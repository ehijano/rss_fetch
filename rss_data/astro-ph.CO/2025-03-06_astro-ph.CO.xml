      <title>Using Gravitational Wave Signals to Disentangle Early Matter Dominated Epochs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curvature perturbations induce gravitational waves (GWs) at second order, contributing to the stochastic gravitational wave background. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum is sensitive to the evolutionary history of the universe and can be substantially enhanced by early matter-dominated (eMD) epochs, particularly if they end rapidly. Such epochs can be caused by primordial black holes (PBHs) and non-topological solitons (Q-balls), for example. Prior analysis approximated the end of the eMD epoch as instantaneous or used a Gaussian smoothing. In this work, we present a complete analysis fully incorporating their time-evolving decay rates. We demonstrate that the resulting signal spectra from PBH, thin wall Q-ball, thick wall Q-ball, and delayed Q-ball eMD epochs are distinguishable for monochromatic distributions. We then consider log-normal mass distributions and discuss the distinguishability of the various GW spectra. Importantly we find that the change in the spectrum from a finite mass width is qualitatively different from the change arising from a slower transition to radiation domination.</description>

      <title>Design of the full-sky scanning strategy and systematic effect control in a cosmic microwave background probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for primordial $B$-mode polarization signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is a major goal of contemporary cosmology. Detecting these signatures would confirm primordial gravitational waves and allow precise determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, which is crucial for distinguishing between inflationary models. This requires high-precision, full-sky observations from space-based platforms to avoid atmospheric fluctuations and windows. Since $B$-mode signatures are much fainter than CMB temperature anisotropies, their detection requires well-designed calibration and mitigation strategies. Next-generation space observatories such as LiteBIRD, which use Half-Wave Plate (HWP) modulation technology, represent a significant advance. This technology allows single-detector observations, eliminating the need for differential detection and its associated systematic complexities. The study begins with the optimization of scan strategy parameters for missions with HWP to improve in-flight calibration, suppress systematic effects, and develop robust null-test methods. In addition, we present a method for calculating the impact of systematic effects on the estimation of $r$ using the SBM software framework, which performs fast mapping in spin space. This method allows the decomposition and elimination of systematic effects in terms of spins, and we demonstrate the elimination of several systematic effects.</description>

      <title>A semi-cosmographic approach to study cosmological evolution in phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signature of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation in the clustering of dark-matter tracers allows us to measure $(D_A(z), H(z))$ independently. Treating these as conjugate variables, we are motivated to study cosmological evolution in the phase space of dimensionless variables $x = H_o D_A/c$ and $p = dx/dz$. The dynamical system $(x(z),p(z))$ can be integrated for a known set of equation of state parameters for different matter/energy components. However, to avoid any preference for specific dark energy models, we adopt a cosmographic approach. We consider two scenarios where the Luminosity distance is expanded as Pad\'e rational approximants using expansion in terms of $z$ and $(1+z)^{1/2}$ respectively. However, instead of directly using the Pad\'e ratios to fit kinematic quantities with data, we adopt an alternative approach where the evolution of the cold dark matter sector is incorporated in our analysis through a semi-cosmographic equation of state, which is then, used to solve the dynamical problem in the phase space. The semi-cosmographic $(D_A(z), H(z))$, thus obtained, is fitted with BAO and SNIa data from DESI DR1, eBOSS and Pantheon+ respectively. We also consider a futuristic 21-cm intensity mapping experiment. We further use the semi-cosmographic fitting to reconstruct some diagnostics of background cosmology and compare our results for the two scenarios of Pad\'e expansions.</description>

      <title>Fast and Precise Spectral Analysis for Dark Matter Searches with LIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel logarithmic spectral estimation method for dark matter searches using gravitational-wave detectors, integrating established dark matter search techniques with insights from computer music analysis. By leveraging symmetries between the time and frequency domains, this method matches the computational efficiency of FFT based algorithms without, unlike such algorithms, compromising precision. We apply this approach to data from LIGO's third observing run, directly comparing its performance with that of a previous search. Our results show a consistent 15 percent improvement across nearly the entire frequency range, without additional computational costs. With potential for further refinements, this method already offers a solution capable of maximizing the scientific potential of current and future gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Constraining self-interacting scalar field dark matter with strong gravitational lensing in cluster scale?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to investigate the properties of solitonic cores in the Thomas-Fermi regime under the self-interacting scalar field dark matter framework. Using semi-analytical techniques, we characterize soliton signatures through their density profiles, gravitational lensing deflection angles, and surface mass density excess in the context of strong lensing by galaxy clusters. Focusing on halos spanning two mass scales -- $M_{200}= 2 \cdot 10^{15}\rm M_\odot$ and $2 \cdot 10^{14} \rm M_\odot$ -- we compute lensing observables to assess the viability of the SFDM model. Our analysis establishes constraints on the soliton core mass, directly probing the self-interaction parameter space of scalar field dark matter. This work bridges semi-analytical predictions with astrophysical observations, offering a lensing-based framework to test ultralight dark matter scenarios in galaxy cluster environments.</description>

      <title>Optimal joint reconstruction from CMB observations: application to cosmic birefringence, patchy reionization and CMB lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line-of-sight distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), including gravitational lensing, cosmic birefringence, and patchy screening, encode crucial cosmological information. While quadratic estimators (QE) have been excellent tools for extracting these signals, they become suboptimal for current- and next-generation CMB surveys, failing to maximize signal-to-noise and suffering from bias contamination that standard bias-hardening techniques cannot mitigate. We present a joint maximum a posteriori framework that simultaneously reconstructs multiple distortion fields while explicitly accounting for their mutual contamination. For cosmic birefringence searches, our method achieves up to 2.5 improvement in reconstruction noise compared to the QE, while significantly reducing CMB lensing-induced biases up to a factor of 5. These gains in lensing biases manifest not only in deep polarization surveys like CMB-S4 and SPT-3G, but also in higher-noise experiments like Simons Observatory, where our method reduces lensing-induced biases by a factor of two thanks to the power of delensing. Our code provides a first step to robust analyses of CMB secondary anisotropies, their cross-correlations with large-scale structure, and ultimately enabling more sensitive searches for primordial $B$-modes.</description>

      <title>Detecting extremely low frequency primordial gravitational wave by gravitational lens system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) are predicted to origin from inflation, according to which a period of accelerated expansion exists in the very early Universe. The detection of PGWs would verify the inflationary theory and determine its energy scale. The traditional method of using B-mode polarization to detect extremely low frequency PGW faces challenges due to the contamination from dust in Milky Way. We investigated the feasibility of using gravitational lens system (GLS) with source of high redshift to detect extremely low frequency PGW. With GLS perturbed by extremely low frequency PGWs, we found that the observed time delay in GLS could strongly deviate from the theoretical one, such strong deviation is the evidence of extremely low frequency PGWs.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: Long-term imprints of external reionization on galaxy evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of ionizing external ultraviolet (UV) radiation on low-mass haloes ($M_{h}&lt;10^{10}M_\odot$) at high redshift using $1140M_\odot$ baryonic resolution zoom-in simulations of seven regions from the THESAN-ZOOM project. We compare three simulation sets that differ in the treatment of external UV radiation: one employing a uniform UV background initiated at z=10.6 in addition to radiation transport for local sources, another with the same background starting at z=5.5, and the default configuration in which the large-scale radiation field from the parent THESAN-1 simulation box acts as a boundary condition. The multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model, combined with its high mass resolution, allows us to resolve all star-forming haloes and capture the back-reaction of ionizing radiation on galaxy properties during the epoch of reionization. When present, external UV radiation efficiently unbinds gas in haloes with masses below $10^9M_\odot$ and suppresses subsequent star formation. As a result, in simulations with early reionization, minihaloes fail to form stars from pristine gas, leading to reduced metal enrichment of gas later accreted by more massive haloes. Consequently, haloes with masses below $10^{10}M_\odot$ at all simulated epochs (z&gt;3) exhibit lower metallicities and altered metallicity distributions. The more accurate and realistic shielding from external UV radiation, achieved through self-consistent radiative transfer, permits the existence of a cold but low-density gas phase down to z=3. These findings highlight the importance of capturing a patchy reionization history in high-resolution simulations targeting high-redshift galaxy formation. We conclude that at minimum, a semi-numerical model that incorporates spatially inhomogeneous reionization and a non-uniform metallicity floor is necessary to accurately emulate metal enrichment in minihaloes.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis with perturbations in type-II and type-III seesaw models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density perturbations have recently been shown to lead to a novel effect in the freeze-out of heavy particles called "acoustically driven freeze-out." This leads to an enhancement in the yield in standard leptogenesis. We extend this calculation to include $2 \to 2$ washout processes in type-I leptogenesis and the Sommerfeld-enhanced $2 \to 2$ gauge annihilations in type-II and type-III leptogenesis. These CP conserving annihilations suppress the yield of heavy particles sourcing the asymmetry. We show the acoustically driven freeze-out leads to novel enhancements in the baryon asymmetry in type-II and type-III leptogenesis, already in the weak washout regime, in contrast with type-I leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Impact of the cosmic neutrino background on black hole superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the effect of the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) on the superradiant phase caused by an ultralight scalar field around a spinning black hole (BH). When the scalar-neutrino Yukawa coupling $y_{\phi \nu}$ reaches values near $10^{-16}$ for astrophysical black holes (ApBHs) or $10^{-20}$ for supermassive black holes (SMBHs), thermal field theory corrections to the scalar field self-interaction drive superradiant instability, regardless of whether the scalar field constitutes dark matter. Additionally, we assess how these thermal corrections influence the scalar field mass $m_\phi$. In scenarios lacking self-interactions, these effects impose stricter constraints on the parameter space of the scalar field. Assuming two degenerate C$\nu$B neutrino masses and an inverted mass ordering, these Yukawa couplings constrain $y_{\phi \nu}$ to values as large as $10^{-6}$ for ApBHs and $10^{-11}$ for SMBHs, with comparable results for massless neutrinos or normal mass ordering. We also examine the robustness of these findings in light of astrophysical uncertainties near the BH and highlight prospects for future observational discoveries.</description>

      <title>Periodic Cosmic String Formation and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study string formation and dynamics in a scalar field theory with a global $U(1)$ symmetry. If a scalar field $\Phi$ is initially displaced from the minimum of a wine-bottle potential, even if uniformly over large spatial patches, small spatial perturbations to $\Phi$ grow via parametric resonance as $\Phi$ oscillates; this occurs for a wide range of initial $U(1)$ charge densities. The growth of perturbations leads to the formation of spatially coherent, temporally stable "counter-rotating regions" (CRR): spatially connected regions exhibiting $\Phi$ evolution with large, opposite-sign rotation speeds in field space which persist over long durations. These CRR are separated by domain boundaries that have a large field gradient and zero rotational speed in field space. String or vortex topological defects form, are confined to, and then annihilate periodically on these boundaries. We demonstrate these periodic dynamics with numerical simulations in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, in both Minkowski spacetime and in a radiation-dominated FLRW universe, and we explain some features of the evolution (semi-)analytically. At late times in an expanding universe, when $\Phi$ approaches the potential minimum, the CRR and vortices dissipate into scalar radiation. Phenomenologically, periodic bursts of string formation and annihilation can lead to periodic bursts of gravitational-wave production. For small initial $U(1)$ charge density, these gravitational-wave bursts can be synchronized across the whole Universe. Owing to their periodic nature, they could give rise to a gravitational-wave frequency spectrum consisting of a forest of peaks. These periodic scalar field dynamics also occur with large, untuned initial $U(1)$ charge density; they may thus have implications for models that depend on a coherent field rotation, such as kination and the axion kinetic-misalignment mechanism.

      <description>arXiv:2503.03119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity is identical to curved spacetime. It is manifested by the curvature of a Riemannian spacetime in general relativity but by torsion or non-metricity in teleparallel gravity models. In this paper, we apply these multiple options to the spacetime perturbation theory and seek the possibilities of representing the gravitation of the background and that of the perturbation in separate ways. We show that the perturbation around a Riemannian background can be described by torsion or non-metricity, so that we have teleparallel like actions for the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Luminosity and stellar mass functions of faint photometric satellites around spectroscopic central galaxies from DESI Year-1 Bright Galaxy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the luminosity functions (LFs) and stellar mass functions (SMFs) of photometric satellite galaxies around spectroscopically identified isolated central galaxies (ICGs). The photometric satellites are from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DR9), while the spectroscopic ICGs are selected from the DESI Year-1 BGS sample. We can measure satellite LFs down to $r$-band absolute magnitudes of $M_{r,\mathrm{sat}}\sim-7$, around ICGs as small as $7.1&lt;\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}&lt;7.8$, with the stellar mass of ICGs measured by the DESI Fastspecfit pipeline. The satellite SMF can be measured down to $\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{sat}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}\sim 5.5$. Interestingly, we discover that the faint/low-mass end slopes of satellite LFs/SMFs become steeper with the decrease in the stellar masses of host ICGs, with smaller and nearby host ICGs capable of being used to probe their fainter satellites.. The steepest slopes are $-2.298\pm0.656$ and $-$2.888$\pm$0.916 for satellite LF and SMF, respectively. Detailed comparisons are performed between the satellite LFs around ICGs selected from DESI BGS or from the SDSS NYU-VAGC spectroscopic Main galaxies over $7.1&lt;\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}&lt;11.7$, showing reasonable agreements, but we show that the differences between DESI and SDSS stellar masses for ICGs play a role to affect the results. We also compare measurements based on DESI Fastspecfit and Cigale stellar masses used to bin ICGs, with the latter including the modeling of AGN based on WISE photometry, and we find good agreements in the measured satellite LFs by using either of the DESI stellar mass catalogs.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass range remain a viable and until now unconstrained dark matter (DM) candidate. If such PBHs exist, they could be captured by stars in DM-dominated environments with low velocity dispersion such as ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs). The capture probability increases with the stellar mass, and captured PBHs would rapidly destroy their host stars. As a result, the presence of PBHs in UFDs would alter their stellar mass functions. Using photometric observations of three ultra-faint dwarf galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope, we show that it is unlikely that their mass functions have been significantly modified by PBHs, and we place constraints on the PBH abundance. In the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Triangulum II, PBHs around $10^{19}$g are excluded at the $2\sigma$ ($3\sigma$) level from constituting more than $\sim55\%$ ($\sim78\%$) of the dark matter, while the possibility that PBHs represent the entirety of the DM is excluded at the $3.7\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Cosmological Constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamical realisation of the equation of state $p +\rho =0$ is studied. A non-pathological dynamics for the perturbations of such a system mimicking a dynamical cosmological constant (DCC) requires to go beyond the perfect fluid paradigm. It is shown that an anisotropic stress must be always present. The Hamiltonian of the system in isolation resembles the one of a Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator and linear stability requires that it cannot be positive definite. The dynamics of linear cosmological perturbations in a DCC dominated Universe is studied in detail showing that when DCC is minimally coupled to gravity no dramatic instability is present. In contrast to what happens in a cosmological constant dominated Universe, the non-relativistic matter contrast is no longer constant and exhibits an oscillator behaviour at small scales while it grows weakly at large scales. In the gravitational waves sector, at small scales, the amplitude is still suppressed as the inverse power of the scale factor while it grows logarithmically at large scales. Also the vector modes propagate, though no growing mode is found.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Dynamics in Galaxy Clusters: The Hidden Role of Low-Luminosity Galaxies in Coma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Coma cluster, one of the richest and most well-known systems at low redshifts, to explore the importance of low-flux objects in the identification of cluster substructures. In addition, we conduct a study of the infall flow around Coma, considering the presence or absence of low-flux objects across the projected phase space of the cluster. Our results indicate that low-luminosity galaxies play a fundamental role in understanding the dynamical state of galaxy clusters. These galaxies, often overlooked because of their faint nature, serve as sensitive tracers of substructure dynamics and provide crucial insights into the cluster's evolutionary history. We show that not considering the low-flux objects present in clusters can lead to significant underestimates of the numbers of substructures, both in most central parts, in the infall regions, and beyond, connecting to the large-scale structure up to a distance of approximately $8 R_{200}$ from the center of Coma.</description>

      <title>Constraining the primordial black hole abundance through Big-Bang nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the scenario in which primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses Mpbh &lt; 10^9 g undergo Hawking evaporation, around the Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) epoch. The evaporation process modifies the Universe's expansion rate and the baryon-to-photon ratio, leading to an alteration of the primordial abundance of light nuclei. We present numerical solutions for the set of equations describing this physics, considering different values of PBH masses and abundances at their formation, showing how their evaporation impacts the abundances of light nuclei, obtained by incorporating the non-standard Hubble rate and baryon-to-photon ratio into the BBN code PArthENoPE. The results are then used to place upper bounds for the PBH relative abundance at formation in the range 10^8 g &lt; Mpbh &lt; 10^9 g, providing the strongest constraints existing to-date in this mass range.</description>

      <title>Narrowing down the Hubble tension to the first two rungs of distance ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decade-persistent Hubble tension has become a $5\sigma$ crisis of modern cosmology between the early-Universe extrapolation from globally fitting the standard $\Lambda$CDM to Planck-CMB measurements and the late-Universe measurement from the three-rung distance ladder with SH0ES calibration. Regarding the current dilemma of theoretical resolutions, recent focus has shifted to systematics inspection. Here we find an associated $5\sigma$ tension in the intercept of the supernova magnitude-redshift relation between the second-rung and third-rung supernovae from the PantheonPlus compilation independent of calibrations in use. As required by the consistency of the distance-ladder method, we propose a method to eliminate the intercept tension, directly constraining $H_0=73.4\pm1.0\;\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ from the first two-rung distance ladder alone without referring to the third-rung supernovae but still consistent with both SH0ES typical three-rung and first two-rung constraints, which not only supports our method to rebuild the intercept consistency but also rules out third-rung supernova systematics including the late-time transition in supernova absolute magnitude. Further crosschecking with the Carnegie Supernova Project revealed that different calibrators alone still consistently prefer our results. Therefore, the original Hubble tension between the Planck-CMB measurements and SH0ES three-rung distance ladder can be narrowed down to a tension between the Planck-CMB and the first two-rung measurements.</description>

      <title>Extracting Axion String Network Parameters from Simulated CMB Birefringence Maps using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles may form a network of cosmic strings in the Universe today that can rotate the plane of polarization of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. Future CMB observations with improved sensitivity might detect this axion-string-induced birefringence effect, thereby revealing an as-yet unseen constituent of the Universe and offering a new probe of particles and forces that are beyond the Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics. In this work, we explore how spherical convolutional neural networks (SCNNs) may be used to extract information about the axion string network from simulated birefringence maps. We construct a pipeline to simulate the anisotropic birefringence that would arise from an axion string network, and we train SCNNs to estimate three parameters related to the cosmic string length, the cosmic string abundance, and the axion-photon coupling. Our results demonstrate that neural networks are able to extract information from a birefringence map that is inaccessible with two-point statistics alone (i.e., the angular power spectrum). We also assess the impact of noise on the accuracy of our SCNN estimators, demonstrating that noise at the level anticipated for Stage IV (CMB-S4) measurements would significantly bias parameter estimation for SCNNs trained on noiseless simulated data, and necessitate modeling the noise in the training data.</description>

      <title>OpenUniverse2024: A shared, simulated view of the sky for the next generation of cosmological surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The OpenUniverse2024 simulation suite is a cross-collaboration effort to produce matched simulated imaging for multiple surveys as they would observe a common simulated sky. Both the simulated data and associated tools used to produce it are intended to uniquely enable a wide range of studies to maximize the science potential of the next generation of cosmological surveys. We have produced simulated imaging for approximately 70 deg$^2$ of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Wide-Fast-Deep survey and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey, as well as overlapping versions of the ELAIS-S1 Deep-Drilling Field for LSST and the High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey for Roman. OpenUniverse2024 includes i) an early version of the updated extragalactic model called Diffsky, which substantially improves the realism of optical and infrared photometry of objects, compared to previous versions of these models; ii) updated transient models that extend through the wavelength range probed by Roman and Rubin; and iii) improved survey, telescope, and instrument realism based on up-to-date survey plans and known properties of the instruments. It is built on a new and updated suite of simulation tools that improves the ease of consistently simulating multiple observatories viewing the same sky. The approximately 400 TB of synthetic survey imaging and simulated universe catalogs are publicly available, and we preview some scientific uses of the simulations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian estimation of cross-coupling and reflection systematics in 21cm array visibility data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations with radio arrays that target the 21-cm signal originating from the early Universe suffer from a variety of systematic effects. An important class of these are reflections and spurious couplings between antennas. We apply a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler to the modelling and mitigation of these systematics in simulated Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA) data. This method allows us to form statistical uncertainty estimates for both our models and the recovered visibilities, which is an important ingredient in establishing robust upper limits on the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) power spectrum. In cases where the noise is large compared to the EoR signal, this approach can constrain the systematics well enough to mitigate them down to the noise level for both systematics studied. Incoherently averaging the recovered power spectra can further reduce the noise and improve recovery. Where the noise level is lower than the EoR, our modelling can mitigate the majority of the reflections and coupling with there being only a minor level of residual systematics. Our approach performs similarly to existing filtering/fitting techniques used in the HERA pipeline, but with the added benefit of rigorously propagating uncertainties. In all cases it does not significantly attenuate the underlying signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energetic cosmic rays scatter off the cosmic neutrino background throughout the history of the Universe, yielding a diffuse flux of cosmic relic neutrinos boosted to high energies. We calculate this flux under different assumptions of the cosmic-ray flux spectral slope and redshift evolution. The non-observation of the diffuse flux of boosted relic neutrinos with current high-energy neutrino experiments already excludes an average cosmic neutrino background overdensity larger than $\sim 10^{4}$ over cosmological distances. We discuss the future detectability of the diffuse flux of boosted relic neutrinos in light of neutrino overdensity estimates and cosmogenic neutrino backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking predict a strong first order cosmological phase transition: we compute the resulting signals, primordial black holes and gravitational waves. These theories employ one SM-neutral scalar, plus some extra model-dependent particle to get the desired quantum potential out of classical scale invariance. We consider models where the extra particle is a scalar singlet, or vectors of an extended U(1) or SU(2) gauge sector. In models where the extra particle is stable, it provides a particle Dark Matter candidate with freeze-out abundance that tends to dominate over primordial black holes. These can instead be DM in models without a particle DM candidate. Gravitational waves arise at a level observable in future searches, even in regions where DM cannot be directly tested.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scenario based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics: Thermodynamic constraints on a generalized cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first and second laws of thermodynamics should lead to a consistent scenario for discussing the cosmological constant problem. In the present study, to establish such a thermodynamic scenario, cosmological equations in a flat Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker universe were derived from the first law, using an arbitrary entropy $S_{H}$ on a cosmological horizon. Then, the cosmological equations were formulated based on a general formulation that includes two extra driving terms, $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$, which are usually used for, e.g., time-varying $\Lambda (t)$ cosmology and bulk viscous cosmology, respectively. In addition, thermodynamic constraints on the two terms are examined using the second law of thermodynamics, extending a previous analysis [Phys. Rev. D 99, 043523 (2019) (arXiv:1810.11138)]. It is found that a deviation $S_{\Delta}$ of $S_{H}$ from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy plays important roles in the two terms. The second law should constrain the upper limits of $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ in our late Universe. The orders of the two terms are likely consistent with the order of the cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$ measured by observations. In particular, when the deviation $S_{\Delta}$ is close to zero, $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ and $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ should reduce to zero and a constant value (consistent with the order of $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$), respectively, as if a consistent and viable scenario could be obtained from thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Exploring sub-GeV dark matter via $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and resonance annihilation with CMB data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit constraints on sub-GeV dark matter (DM) annihilation via $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and resonance processes using current and future CMB data from Planck, FIRAS, and upcoming experiments such as LiteBIRD, CMB-S4, PRISTINE, and PIXIE. For $s$-wave annihilation, we provide updated limits for both $e^{+}e^{-}$ and $\pi\pi$ channels, with the profile likelihood method yielding stronger constraints than the marginal posterior method. In the $p$-wave case, we comprehensively present a model-independent inequality for the 95\% upper limits from FIRAS, PRISTINE, and PIXIE, with future experiments expected to surpass current BBN limits. For resonance annihilation, we report -- for the first time -- the $95\%$ upper limits on the decay branching ratio of the mediator particle, when the resonance peaks during the recombination epoch. Overall, our study highlights the complementary strengths of $\mu$-distortion and CMB anisotropies in probing sub-GeV DM annihilation.</description>
