      <title>Energy Dissipation in Hilbert Envelopes on Motion Waveforms Detected in Vibrating Systems: An Axiomatic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an axiomatic approach in the theory of energy dissipation in Hilbert envelopes on waveforms emanating from various vibrating systems. A Hilbert envelope is a curve tangent to peak points on a motion waveform. The basic approach is to compare non-modulated vs. modulated waveforms in measuring energy loss during the vibratory motion $m(t)$ at time $t$ of moving object such as a walker, runner or biker recorded in a video. Modulation of $m(t)$ is achieved by using Mersenne primes to adjust the frequency $\omega$ of the Euler exponential in $m(t)e^{\pm j2\pi \omega t}{\rm d}t$. Expediture of energy $E_{m(t)}$ by a system is measured in terms of the area bounded by the motion $m(t)$ waveform at time $t$.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzschild black hole in f(R) can exist superradiation phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the mechanism by which Schwarzschild black holes may exhibit superradiance when Bell's theorem is considered a fundamental principle. By integrating quantum field theory with general relativity under the constraints imposed by Bell's inequalities, we develop a comprehensive model that extends the classical understanding of black hole dynamics. The study further draws parallels between the superradiant phenomena in Schwarzschild black holes and those observed in \(f(R)\) gravity theories. Our findings suggest a profound mathematical and conceptual linkage between Bell's theorem and \(f(R)\) gravity, particularly in the manifestation of irreducible singularities and their associated residues. This work provides a novel framework bridging quantum non-locality with modified theories of gravity, offering potential insights into the quantum nature of spacetime and black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Clifford algebra Cl(0,6) approach to beyond the standard model and naturalness problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05678v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is there more to Dirac's gamma matrices than meets the eye? It turns out that gamma zero can be factorized into a product of three operators. This revelation facilitates the expansion of Dirac's space-time algebra to Clifford algebra Cl(0,6). The resultant rich geometric structure can be leveraged to establish a combined framework of the standard model and gravity, wherein a gravi-weak interaction between the extended vierbein field and the extended weak gauge field is allowed. Inspired by the composite Higgs model, we examine the vierbein field as an effective description of the fermion-antifermion condensation. The compositeness of space-time manifests itself at an energy scale which is different from the Planck scale. We propose that all the regular classical Lagrangian terms are of quantum condensation origin, thus possibly addressing the cosmological constant problem provided that we adopt an unconventional multi-scale renormalization procedure for quantum condensations that entail multiplications of divergent integrals. The Clifford algebra approach also permits a weaker form of charge conjugation without particle-antiparticle interchange, which leads to a Majorana-type mass that conserves lepton number. Additionally, in the context of spontaneous breaking of two global U(1) symmetries, we explore a three-Higgs-doublet model with Higgs VEVs 246 GeV, 41 GeV and 2.5 GeV which could explain the fermion mass hierarchies.</description>
