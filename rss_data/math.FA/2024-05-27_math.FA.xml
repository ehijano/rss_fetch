      <title>Signed representing measures (Berger-type charges) in subnormality and related properties of weighted shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of the geometrically regular weighted shifts (GRWS) -- see [5] -- signed power representing measures (which we call Berger-type charges) played an important role. Motivated by their utility in that context, we establish a general theory for Berger-type charges. We give the first result of which we are aware showing that k-hyponormality alone (as opposed to subnormality) yields measure/charge-related information. More precisely, for signed countably atomic measures with a decreasing sequence of atoms we prove that k-hyponormality of the associated shift forces positivity of the densities of the largest k+1 atoms. Further, for certain completely hyperexpansive weighed shifts, we exhibit a Berger-type charge representation, in contrast (but related) to the classical L\'{e}vy-Khinchin representation. We use Berger-type charges to investigate when a non-subnormal GRWS weighted shift may be scaled to become conditionally positive definite, and close with an example indicating a distinction between the study of moment sequences and the study of weighted shifts.</description>

      <title>On similarity to contractions of class $C_{\cdot 0}$ with finite defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A criterion on the similarity of a (bounded, linear) operator $T$ on a (complex, separable) Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ in terms of shift-type invariant subspaces of $T$ to a contraction of class $C_{\cdot 0}$ with finite unequal defects is given. Namely, $T$ is similar to such a contraction if and only if the minimal quantity of (closed) invariant subspaces $\mathcal M$ of $T$ such that the restriction $T|_{\mathcal M}$ of $T$ on $\mathcal M$ is similar to the simple unilateral shift, whose linear span is $\mathcal H$, is finite. A sufficient condition for the similarity of an absolutely continuous polynomially bounded operator $T$ to a contraction of class $C_{\cdot 0}$ with finite equal defects is given. Namely, $T$ is similar to such a contraction if the (spectral) multiplicity of $T$ is finite and $B(T)=\mathbb O$, where $B$ is a finite product of Blaschke products with simple zeros satisfying the Carleson interpolating condition (a Carleson--Newman product).</description>

      <title>Essential positivity for Toeplitz operators on the Fock space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we discuss essential positivity of Toeplitz operators on the Fock space, as motivated by a recent question of Per\"al\"a and Virtanen. We give a proper characterization of essential positivity in terms of limit operators. A conjectured characterization of essential positivity of Per\"al\"a and Virtanen is disproven when the assumption of radiality is dropped. Nevertheless, when the symbol of the Toeplitz operator is of vanishing mean oscillation, we show that the conjecture of Per\"al\"a and Virtanen holds true, even without radiality.</description>

      <title>Layers of planar hexagonal heterostructure modeled by quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work presents a study on the quantum theory of periodic graphs applied to mono- and bilayer hexagonal materials. Different parameters associated with the atoms present at the vertices of these materials were analyzed, verifying the existence of gaps in the spectral bands and expressing the width of these openings according to the parameters. The study was extended to heterostructures with mixed layers and "sandwiches" of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. The dispersion relationships obtained in these models were analyzed and it was concluded that the inclusion of hBN layers on graphene layers can induce a gap in the graphene. Furthermore, it was observed that the inclusion of a single layer of graphene between two layers of hBN reduces the width of the spectral gap. The interaction between carbon atoms and nitrogen and boron atoms was pointed out as responsible for these results. Finally, the inclusion of a magnetic field in the hBN layer was considered, demonstrating that specific values of magnetic flux can eliminate conical touches in the dispersion relation of the operator and ensure the existence of gaps.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Weyl functions in the class of operator-valued generalized Nevanlinna functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06931v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for a generalized Nevanlinna function $Q$ ($Q\in N_{\kappa }\left( \mathcal{H} \right)$) to be a Weyl function (also known as a Weyl-Titchmarch function).
  We also investigate an important subclass of $N_{\kappa }(\mathcal{H})$, the functions that have a boundedly invertible derivative at infinity $Q'\left( \infty \right):=\lim \limits_{z \to \infty}{zQ(z)}$. These functions are regular and have the operator representation $Q\left( z \right)=\tilde{\Gamma}^{+}\left( A-z \right)^{-1}\tilde{\Gamma},z\in \rho \left( A \right)$, where $A$ is a bounded self-adjoint operator in a Pontryagin space $\mathcal{K}$. We prove that every such strict function $Q$ is a Weyl function associated with the symmetric operator $S:=A_{\vert (I-P)\mathcal{K}}$, where $P$ is the orthogonal projection, $P:=\tilde{\Gamma} \left( \tilde{\Gamma}^{+} \tilde{\Gamma} \right)^{-1} \tilde{\Gamma}^{+} $.
  Additionally, we provide the relation matrices of the adjoint relation $S^{+}$ of $S$, and of $\hat{A}$, where $\hat{A}$ is the representing relation of $\hat{Q}:=-Q^{-1}$. We illustrate our results through examples, wherein we begin with a given function $Q\in N_{\kappa }\left( \mathcal{H} \right)$ and proceed to determine the closed symmetric linear relation $S$ and the boundary triple $\Pi$ so that $Q$ becomes the Weyl function associated with $\Pi$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic insights for projection, Gordon-Lewis and Sidon constants in Boolean cube function spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of this work is to study important local Banach space constants for Boolean cube function spaces. Specifically, we focus on $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S}}^N$, the finite-dimensional Banach space of all real-valued functions defined on the $N$-dimensional Boolean cube $\{-1, +1\}^N$ that have Fourier--Walsh expansions supported on a fixed~family $\mathcal{S}$ of subsets of $\{1, \ldots, N\}$. Our investigation centers on the projection, Sidon and Gordon--Lewis constants of this function space. We combine tools from different areas to derive exact formulas and asymptotic estimates of these parameters for special types of families $\mathcal{S}$ depending on the dimension $N$ of the Boolean cube and other complexity characteristics of the support set $\mathcal{S}$. Using local Banach space theory, we establish the intimate relationship among these three important constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate projection constants within classes of multivariate polynomials over finite-dimensional real Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we consider the projection constant for spaces of spherical harmonics and spaces of homogeneous polynomials as well as for spaces of polynomials of finite degree on the unit sphere. We establish a connection between these quantities and certain weighted $L_1$-norms of specific Jacobi polynomials. As a consequence, we present exact formulas, computable expressions and asymptotically accurate estimates for them. The real case we address is considerably more nuanced than its complex counterpart.</description>

      <title>Extended Flow Matching: a Method of Conditional Generation with Generalized Continuity Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of conditional generation is one of the most important applications of generative models, and numerous methods have been developed to date based on the celebrated flow-based models. However, many flow-based models in use today are not built to allow one to introduce an explicit inductive bias to how the conditional distribution to be generated changes with respect to conditions. This can result in unexpected behavior in the task of style transfer, for example. In this research, we introduce extended flow matching (EFM), a direct extension of flow matching that learns a ``matrix field'' corresponding to the continuous map from the space of conditions to the space of distributions. We show that we can introduce inductive bias to the conditional generation through the matrix field and demonstrate this fact with MMOT-EFM, a version of EFM that aims to minimize the Dirichlet energy or the sensitivity of the distribution with respect to conditions. We will present our theory along with experimental results that support the competitiveness of EFM in conditional generation.</description>

      <title>On the boundedness of generalized integration operators on Hardy spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the boundedness and compactness properties of the generalized integration operator $T_{g,a}$ when it acts between distinct Hardy spaces in the unit disc of the complex plane. This operator has been introduced by the first author in connection to a theorem of Cohn about factorization of higher order derivatives of functions in Hardy spaces. We answer in the affirmative a conjecture stated in the same work, therefore giving a complete characterization of the class of symbols $g$ for which the operator is bounded from the Hardy space $H^p$ to $H^q, \, 0&lt;p,q&lt;\infty.$</description>
