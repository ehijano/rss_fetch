      <title>Measuring the State of Open Science in Transportation Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open science initiatives have strengthened scientific integrity and accelerated research progress across many fields, but the state of their practice within transportation research remains under-investigated. Key features of open science, defined here as data and code availability, are difficult to extract due to the inherent complexity of the field. Previous work has either been limited to small-scale studies due to the labor-intensive nature of manual analysis or has relied on large-scale bibliometric approaches that sacrifice contextual richness. This paper introduces an automatic and scalable feature-extraction pipeline to measure data and code availability in transportation research. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task and validate their performance against a manually curated dataset and through an inter-rater agreement analysis. We applied this pipeline to examine 10,724 research articles published in the Transportation Research Part series of journals between 2019 and 2024. Our analysis found that only 5% of quantitative papers shared a code repository, 4% of quantitative papers shared a data repository, and about 3% of papers shared both, with trends differing across journals, topics, and geographic regions. We found no significant difference in citation counts or review duration between papers that provided data and code and those that did not, suggesting a misalignment between open science efforts and traditional academic metrics. Consequently, encouraging these practices will likely require structural interventions from journals and funding agencies to supplement the lack of direct author incentives. The pipeline developed in this study can be readily scaled to other journals, representing a critical step toward the automated measurement and monitoring of open science practices in transportation research.</description>

      <title>Many-to-many. Usability challenges of entity reconciliation in art history and photographic studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates challenges in reconciling heterogeneous records across cultural institutions, focusing on art historical photo archives within the PHAROS consortium. Through case studies, the study analyses reconciliation workflows and cataloguing traditions, with attention to institutional contexts, data granularities, and modelling strategies. Reconciliation is seldom a one-to-one operation. Ambiguities, incomplete data, shifting attributions, and varying practices shape outcomes. Strategies observed include the creation of anonymous or collective entities, the use of umbrella terms, the addition of uncertainty qualifiers, and reticence when ambiguity cannot be resolved. The article highlights the need to model uncertainty explicitly, offering a framework that connects technical reconciliation methods with institutional practices. Insights from PHAROS provide guidance for designing more robust, interoperable, and sustainable cultural heritage infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Archives, archival bond, and digital representation: A case study with the International Image Interoperability Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the archival sector, digitization has long been a strategic initiative to ensure greater availability of historical documents. In recent years, the promotion of guidelines and standards, combined with technological advancements, has established methodologies and best practices and developed tools to facilitate massive digitization projects. However, despite the availability of technological solutions and guidelines, digitization is intended mostly to scan documents and make the outcome images available online. This practice can be problematic in representing the complex fonds structure made of relations, the archival bond that establishes the natural ordering of documents into archival units. This is particularly relevant when the fonds also has a multimedia component, such as an audiovisual component, that is often reproduced on different platforms disconnected from textual documents. This article addresses the challenges linked to digitization in the archival sector and proposes a methodological framework for representing fonds with respect to their native organization. For this purpose, the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) is employed to configure a specific model that respects the archive's hierarchical structure. In particular, this model is configured to maintain the archival bond and enhance the resource's semantic aspect to make the IIIF model semantically interoperable. To demonstrate the adaptability of the framework to the archival domain, in this work, the ''PCI-Unitelefilm'' fonds of the Fondazione Archivio Audiovisivo del Movimento Operaio e Democratico (AAMOD) served as the case study.</description>

      <title>Citation of scientific evidence from video description and its association with attention and impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how YouTube content creators utilize scientific evidence in videos. Log-linear regression examines the influence of alternative communication channels on video creators in Biotechnology, using data from 81,302 papers (2018-2023). This reveals a positive association with news articles and Wikipedia pages, but a negative association with scientific papers, policy documents, and patents. Despite the potential for enriching discussions, science video creators seem to favor materials with wider public attention over influential science, technology, and policy papers. These findings suggest a need for improved dissemination strategies for scientific research. Authors, universities, and journals should consider how their work can be made more accessible and engaging for science communicators on video.</description>
