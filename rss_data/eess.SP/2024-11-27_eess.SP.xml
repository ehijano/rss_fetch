      <title>A multi-dimensional unsupervised machine learning framework for clustering residential heat load profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central to achieving the energy transition, heating systems provide essential space heating and hot water in residential and industrial environments. A major challenge lies in effectively profiling large clusters of buildings to improve demand estimation and enable efficient Demand Response (DR) schemes. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing an unsupervised machine learning framework for clustering residential heating load profiles, focusing on natural gas space heating and hot water preparation boilers. The profiles are analyzed across five dimensions: boiler usage, heating demand, weather conditions, building characteristics, and user behavior. We apply three distance metrics: Euclidean Distance (ED), Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), and Derivative Dynamic Time Warping (DDTW), and evaluate their performance using established clustering indices. The proposed method is assessed considering 29 residential buildings in Greece equipped with smart meters throughout a calendar heating season (i.e., 210 days). Results indicate that DTW is the most suitable metric, uncovering strong correlations between boiler usage, heat demand, and temperature, while ED highlights broader interrelations across dimensions and DDTW proves less effective, resulting in weaker clusters. These findings offer key insights into heating load behavior, establishing a solid foundation for developing more targeted and effective DR programs.</description>

      <title>Channel Modeling for Ultraviolet Non-Line-of-Sight Communications Incorporating an Obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing studies on ultraviolet (UV) non-line-of-sight (NLoS) channel modeling primarily focus on scenarios without any obstacle, which makes them unsuitable for small transceiver elevation angles in most cases. To address this issue, a UV NLoS channel model incorporating an obstacle was investigated in this paper, where the impacts of atmospheric scattering and obstacle reflection on UV signals were both taken into account. To validate the proposed model, we compared it to the related Monte-Carlo photon-tracing (MCPT) model that had been verified by outdoor experiments. Numerical results manifest that the path loss curves obtained by the proposed model agree well with those determined by the MCPT model, while its computation complexity is lower than that of the MCPT model. This work discloses that obstacle reflection can effectively reduce the channel path loss of UV NLoS communication systems.</description>

      <title>E-CONDOR: Efficient Contour-Based Detection Of Random Spatial Signals From UAV Observations Using Dual Stochastic Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel efficient method for spatial monitoring of the distribution of correlated field signals, such as temperature, humidity, etc. using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The spatial signal is compressed to its iso-contour lines at a number of known levels that are introduced by data fusion center (DFC). The UAV traces a contour line of the field signal at a time, and reports the coordinates of its own traces to the DFC for spatial modeling. The DFC iteratively improves the spatial model of the field signal and assigns a new contour level to each UAV to trace and report its coordinates for spatial model improvement. The selected batch of levels and the start point of the search are introduced by the DFC. In order to reduce the required data for spatial modeling, and accordingly improve the algorithm data efficiency, dual stochastic gradient routines are used at the DFC to find a next proper number of contour levels in the batch, and to eliminate the redundant contour levels, in each iteration. The performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm based on computer simulations demonstrates significantly faster convergence, better signal estimation, and a higher data efficiency against when the stochastic gradient is not used.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern AI (i.e., Deep Learning and its variants) is here to stay. However, its enigmatic black box nature presents a fundamental challenge to the traditional methods of test and validation (T&amp;E). Or does it? In this paper we introduce a Digital Engineering (DE) approach to T&amp;E (DE-T&amp;E), combined with generative AI, that can achieve requisite mil spec statistical validation as well as uncover potential deleterious Black Swan events that might otherwise not be uncovered until it is too late. An illustration of these concepts is presented for an advanced modern radar example employing deep learning AI.</description>

      <title>Clustering Time Series Data with Gaussian Mixture Embeddings in a Graph Autoencoder Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series data analysis is prevalent across various domains, including finance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. Traditional time series clustering methods often struggle to capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in such data. In this paper, we propose the Variational Mixture Graph Autoencoder (VMGAE), a graph-based approach for time series clustering that leverages the structural advantages of graphs to capture enriched data relationships and produces Gaussian mixture embeddings for improved separability. Comparisons with baseline methods are included with experimental results, demonstrating that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art time-series clustering techniques. We further validate our method on real-world financial data, highlighting its practical applications in finance. By uncovering community structures in stock markets, our method provides deeper insights into stock relationships, benefiting market prediction, portfolio optimization, and risk management.</description>

      <title>Robust Max-Min Fair Beamforming Design for Rate Splitting Multiple Access-aided Visible Light Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17056v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the robust beamforming design for rate splitting multiple access (RSMA)-aided visible light communication (VLC) networks with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). In particular, we first derive the theoretical lower bound for the channel capacity of RSMA-aided VLC networks. Then we investigate the beamforming design to solve the max-min fairness (MMF) problem of RSMA-aided VLC networks under the practical optical power constraint and electrical power constraint while considering the practical imperfect CSIT scenario. To address the problem, we propose a constrained-concave-convex programming (CCCP)-based beamforming design algorithm which exploits semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and a penalty method to deal with the rank-one constraint caused by SDR. Numerical results show that the proposed robust beamforming design algorithm for RSMA-aided VLC network achieves a superior performance over the existing ones for space-division multiple access (SDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA).</description>

      <title>Invariant neuromorphic representations of tactile stimuli improve robustness of a real-time texture classification system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans have an exquisite sense of touch which robotic and prosthetic systems aim to recreate. We developed algorithms to create neuron-like (neuromorphic) spiking representations of texture that are invariant to the scanning speed and contact force applied in the sensing process. The spiking representations are based on mimicking activity from mechanoreceptors in human skin and further processing up to the brain. The neuromorphic encoding process transforms analog sensor readings into speed and force invariant spiking representations in three sequential stages: the force invariance module (in the analog domain), the spiking activity encoding module (transforms from analog to spiking domain), and the speed invariance module (in the spiking domain). The algorithms were tested on a tactile texture dataset collected in 15 speed-force conditions. An offline texture classification system built on the invariant representations has higher classification accuracy, improved computational efficiency, and increased capability to identify textures explored in novel speed-force conditions. The speed invariance algorithm was adapted to a real-time human-operated texture classification system. Similarly, the invariant representations improved classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and capability to identify textures explored in novel conditions. The invariant representation is even more crucial in this context due to human imprecision which seems to the classification system as a novel condition. These results demonstrate that invariant neuromorphic representations enable better performing neurorobotic tactile sensing systems. Furthermore, because the neuromorphic representations are based on biological processing, this work can be used in the future as the basis for naturalistic sensory feedback for upper limb amputees.</description>

      <title>Robust Bayesian Optimization via Localized Online Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sequential approach for optimizing black-box objective functions using zeroth-order noisy observations. In BO, Gaussian processes (GPs) are employed as probabilistic surrogate models to estimate the objective function based on past observations, guiding the selection of future queries to maximize utility. However, the performance of BO heavily relies on the quality of these probabilistic estimates, which can deteriorate significantly under model misspecification. To address this issue, we introduce localized online conformal prediction-based Bayesian optimization (LOCBO), a BO algorithm that calibrates the GP model through localized online conformal prediction (CP). LOCBO corrects the GP likelihood based on predictive sets produced by LOCBO, and the corrected GP likelihood is then denoised to obtain a calibrated posterior distribution on the objective function. The likelihood calibration step leverages an input-dependent calibration threshold to tailor coverage guarantees to different regions of the input space. Under minimal noise assumptions, we provide theoretical performance guarantees for LOCBO's iterates that hold for the unobserved objective function. These theoretical findings are validated through experiments on synthetic and real-world optimization tasks, demonstrating that LOCBO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art BO algorithms in the presence of model misspecification.</description>

      <title>Snake-Inspired Mobile Robot Positioning with Hybrid Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile robots are used in various fields, from deliveries to search and rescue applications. Different types of sensors are mounted on the robot to provide accurate navigation and, thus, allow successful completion of its task. In real-world scenarios, due to environmental constraints, the robot frequently relies only on its inertial sensors. Therefore, due to noises and other error terms associated with the inertial readings, the navigation solution drifts in time. To mitigate the inertial solution drift, we propose the MoRPINet framework consisting of a neural network to regress the robot's travelled distance. To this end, we require the mobile robot to maneuver in a snake-like slithering motion to encourage nonlinear behavior. MoRPINet was evaluated using a dataset of 290 minutes of inertial recordings during field experiments and showed an improvement of 33\% in the positioning error over other state-of-the-art methods for pure inertial navigation.</description>

      <title>A new architecture for high speed core-selective switch for multicore fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of multicore optical fibers is now recognized as one of the most promising methods to implement the space-division multiplexing techniques required to overcome the impending capacity limit of conventional single-mode optical fibers. Nonetheless, new devices for networking operations compatible with these fibers will be required in order to implement the next-generation high-capacity optical networks. In this work, we develop a new architecture to build a high-speed core-selective switch, critical for efficiently distributing signals over the network. The device relies on multicore interference, and can change among outputs in less than 0.7 us, while achieving less than -18 dB of average inter-core crosstalk, making it compatible with a wide range of network switching tasks. The functionality of the device was demonstrated by routing a 1GBs optical signal and by successfully switching signals over a field-installed multicore fiber network. Our results demonstrate for the first time the operation of a multicore optical fiber switch functioning under real-world conditions, with switching speeds that are three orders of magnitude faster than current commercial devices. This new optical switch design is also fully compatible with standard multiplexing techniques and, thus, represents an important achievement towards the integration of high-capacity multicore telecommunication networks.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of a Low-Cost Single-Lead ECG Module for Vascular Ageing Prediction and Studying Smoking-induced Changes in ECG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vascular age is traditionally measured using invasive methods or through 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). This paper utilizes a low-cost single-lead (lead-I) ECG module to predict the vascular age of an apparently healthy young person. In addition, we also study the impact of smoking on ECG traces of the light-but-habitual smokers. We begin by collecting (lead-I) ECG data from 42 apparently healthy subjects (smokers and non-smokers) aged 18 to 30 years, using our custom-built low-cost single-lead ECG module, and anthropometric data, e.g., body mass index, smoking status, blood pressure, etc. Under our proposed method, we first pre-process our dataset by denoising the ECG traces, followed by baseline drift removal, followed by z-score normalization. Next, we create another dataset by dividing the ECG traces into overlapping segments of five-second duration. We then feed both segmented and unsegmented datasets to a number of machine learning models, a 1D convolutional neural network, and ResNet18 model, for vascular ageing prediction. We also do transfer learning whereby we pre-train our models on a public PPG dataset, and later, fine-tune and evaluate them on our unsegmented ECG dataset. The random forest model outperforms all other models and previous works by achieving a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.07 and coefficient of determination R2 of 0.99, MSE of 3.56 and R2 of 0.26, MSE of 0.99 and R2 of 0.87, for segmented ECG dataset, for unsegmented ECG dataset, and for transfer learning scenario, respectively. Finally, we utilize the explainable AI framework to identify those ECG features that get affected due to smoking. This work is aligned with the sustainable development goals 3 and 10 of the United Nations which aim to provide low-cost but quality healthcare solutions to the unprivileged. This work also finds its applications in the broad domain of forensic science.</description>

      <title>Bayesian KalmanNet: Quantifying Uncertainty in Deep Learning Augmented Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in tracking algorithms that augment Kalman Filters (KFs) with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). By transforming KFs into trainable deep learning models, one can learn from data to reliably track a latent state in complex and partially known dynamics. However, unlike classic KFs, conventional DNN-based systems do not naturally provide an uncertainty measure, such as error covariance, alongside their estimates, which is crucial in various applications that rely on KF-type tracking. This work bridges this gap by studying error covariance extraction in DNN-aided KFs. We begin by characterizing how uncertainty can be extracted from existing DNN-aided algorithms and distinguishing between approaches by their ability to associate internal features with meaningful KF quantities, such as the Kalman Gain (KG) and prior covariance. We then identify that uncertainty extraction from existing architectures necessitates additional domain knowledge not required for state estimation. Based on this insight, we propose Bayesian KalmanNet, a novel DNN-aided KF that integrates Bayesian deep learning techniques with the recently proposed KalmanNet and transforms the KF into a stochastic machine learning architecture. This architecture employs sampling techniques to predict error covariance reliably without requiring additional domain knowledge, while retaining KalmanNet's ability to accurately track in partially known dynamics. Our numerical study demonstrates that Bayesian KalmanNet provides accurate and reliable tracking in various scenarios representing partially known dynamic systems.</description>

      <title>FORS-EMG: A Novel sEMG Dataset for Hand Gesture Recognition Across Multiple Forearm Orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals hold significant potential for gesture recognition and robust prosthetic hand development. However, sEMG signals are affected by various physiological and dynamic factors, including forearm orientation, electrode displacement, and limb position. Most existing sEMG datasets lack these dynamic considerations. This study introduces a novel multichannel sEMG dataset to evaluate commonly used hand gestures across three distinct forearm orientations. The dataset was collected from nineteen able-bodied subjects performing twelve hand gestures in three forearm orientations--supination, rest, and pronation. Eight MFI EMG electrodes were strategically placed at the elbow and mid-forearm to record high-quality EMG signals. Signal quality was validated through Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Signal-to-Motion artifact ratio (SMR) metrics. Hand gesture classification performance across forearm orientations was evaluated using machine learning classifiers, including LDA, SVM, and KNN, alongside five feature extraction methods: TDD, TSD, FTDD, AR-RMS, and SNTDF. Furthermore, deep learning models such as 1D CNN, RNN, LSTM, and hybrid architectures were employed for a comprehensive analysis. Notably, the LDA classifier achieved the highest F1 score of 88.58\% with the SNTDF feature set when trained on hand gesture data of resting and tested across gesture data of all orientations. The promising results from extensive analyses underscore the proposed dataset's potential as a benchmark for advancing gesture recognition technologies, clinical sEMG research, and human-computer interaction applications. The dataset is publicly available in MATLAB format. Dataset: \url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ummerummanchaity/fors-emg-a-novel-semg-dataset}</description>

      <title>Model-Based Machine Learning for Max-Min Fairness Beamforming Design in JCAS Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint communications and sensing (JCAS) is expected to be a crucial technology for future wireless systems. This paper investigates beamforming design for a multi-user multi-target JCAS system to ensure fairness and balance between communications and sensing performance. We jointly optimize the transmit and receive beamformers to maximize the weighted sum of the minimum communications rate and sensing mutual information. The formulated problem is highly challenging due to its non-smooth and non-convex nature. To overcome the challenges, we reformulate the problem into an equivalent but more tractable form. We first solve this problem by alternating optimization (AO) and then propose a machine learning algorithm based on the AO approach. Numerical results show that our algorithm scales effectively with the number of the communications users and provides better performance with shorter run time compared to conventional optimization approaches.</description>

      <title>Physically Parameterized Differentiable MUSIC for DoA Estimation with Uncalibrated Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15144</link>

Abstract: Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation is a common sensing problem in radar, sonar, audio, and wireless communication systems. It has gained renewed importance with the advent of the integrated sensing and communication paradigm. To fully exploit the potential of such sensing systems, it is crucial to take into account potential hardware impairments that can negatively impact the obtained performance. This study introduces a joint DoA estimation and hardware impairment learning scheme following a model-based approach. Specifically, a differentiable version of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is derived, allowing efficient learning of the considered impairments. The proposed approach supports both supervised and unsupervised learning strategies, showcasing its practical potential. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method successfully learns significant inaccuracies in both antenna locations and complex gains. Additionally, the proposed method outperforms the classical MUSIC algorithm in the DoA estimation task.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Based Multi-Objective Optimization for Integrated Sensing and Communications in UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where multiple UAVs simultaneously sense the locations of ground users and provide communication services with radars. To find the trade-off between communication and sensing (C\&amp;S) in the system, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to maximize the total network utility and the localization Cram\'er-Rao bounds (CRB) of ground users, which jointly optimizes the deployment and power control of UAVs. Inspired by the huge potential of large language models (LLM) for prediction and inference, we propose an LLM-enabled decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (LEDMA) for solving the highly non-convex MOP. We first adopt a decomposition-based scheme to decompose the MOP into a series of optimization sub-problems. We second integrate LLMs as black-box search operators with MOP-specifically designed prompt engineering into the framework of MOEA to solve optimization sub-problems simultaneously. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed LEDMA can find the clear trade-off between C\&amp;S and outperforms baseline MOEAs in terms of obtained Pareto fronts and convergence.</description>
