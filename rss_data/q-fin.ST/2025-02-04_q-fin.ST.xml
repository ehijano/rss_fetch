      <title>Supervised Similarity for High-Yield Corporate Bonds with Quantum Cognition Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the application of quantum cognition machine learning (QCML), a novel paradigm for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks rooted in the mathematical formalism of quantum theory, to distance metric learning in corporate bond markets. Compared to equities, corporate bonds are relatively illiquid and both trade and quote data in these securities are relatively sparse. Thus, a measure of distance/similarity among corporate bonds is particularly useful for a variety of practical applications in the trading of illiquid bonds, including the identification of similar tradable alternatives, pricing securities with relatively few recent quotes or trades, and explaining the predictions and performance of ML models based on their training data. Previous research has explored supervised similarity learning based on classical tree-based models in this context; here, we explore the application of the QCML paradigm for supervised distance metric learning in the same context, showing that it outperforms classical tree-based models in high-yield (HY) markets, while giving comparable or better performance (depending on the evaluation metric) in investment grade (IG) markets.</description>

      <title>Year-over-Year Developments in Financial Fraud Detection via Deep Learning: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper systematically reviews advancements in deep learning (DL) techniques for financial fraud detection, a critical issue in the financial sector. Using the Kitchenham systematic literature review approach, 57 studies published between 2019 and 2024 were analyzed. The review highlights the effectiveness of various deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, and transformers across domains such as credit card transactions, insurance claims, and financial statement audits. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC were evaluated. Key themes explored include the impact of data privacy frameworks and advancements in feature engineering and data preprocessing. The study emphasizes challenges such as imbalanced datasets, model interpretability, and ethical considerations, alongside opportunities for automation and privacy-preserving techniques such as blockchain integration and Principal Component Analysis. By examining trends over the past five years, this review identifies critical gaps and promising directions for advancing DL applications in financial fraud detection, offering actionable insights for researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Fundamental properties of linear factor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study conditional linear factor models in the context of asset pricing panels. Our analysis focuses on conditional means and covariances to characterize the cross-sectional and inter-temporal properties of returns and factors as well as their interrelationships. We also review the conditions outlined in Kozak and Nagel (2024) and show how the conditional mean-variance efficient portfolio of an unbalanced panel can be spanned by low-dimensional factor portfolios, even without assuming invertibility of the conditional covariance matrices. Our analysis provides a comprehensive foundation for the specification and estimation of conditional linear factor models.</description>

      <title>Defining and comparing SICR-events for classifying impaired loans under IFRS 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03080v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The IFRS 9 accounting standard requires the prediction of credit deterioration in financial instruments, i.e., significant increases in credit risk (SICR). However, the definition of such a SICR-event is inherently ambiguous, given its current reliance on evaluating the change in the estimated probability of default (PD) against some arbitrary threshold. We examine the shortcomings of this PD-comparison approach and propose an alternative framework for generating SICR-definitions based on three parameters: delinquency, stickiness, and the outcome period. Having varied these framework parameters, we obtain 27 unique SICR-definitions and fit logistic regression models accordingly using rich South African mortgage and macroeconomic data. For each definition and corresponding model, the resulting SICR-rates are analysed at the portfolio-level on their stability over time and their responsiveness to economic downturns. At the account-level, we compare both the accuracy and dynamicity of the SICR-predictions, and discover several interesting trends and trade-offs. These results can help any bank with appropriately setting the three framework parameters in defining SICR-events for prediction purposes. We demonstrate this process by comparing the best-performing SICR-model to the PD-comparison approach, and show the latter's inferiority as an early-warning system. Our work can therefore guide the formulation, modelling, and testing of any SICR-definition, thereby promoting the timeous recognition of credit losses; the main imperative of IFRS 9.</description>

      <title>Developing Cryptocurrency Trading Strategy Based on Autoencoder-CNN-GANs Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18202v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper leverages machine learning algorithms to forecast and analyze financial time series. The process begins with a denoising autoencoder to filter out random noise fluctuations from the main contract price data. Then, one-dimensional convolution reduces the dimensionality of the filtered data and extracts key information. The filtered and dimensionality-reduced price data is fed into a GANs network, and its output serve as input of a fully connected network. Through cross-validation, a model is trained to capture features that precede large price fluctuations. The model predicts the likelihood and direction of significant price changes in real-time price sequences, placing trades at moments of high prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that using autoencoders and convolution to filter and denoise financial data, combined with GANs, achieves a certain level of predictive performance, validating the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to discover underlying patterns in financial sequences. Keywords - CNN;GANs; Cryptocurrency; Prediction.</description>
