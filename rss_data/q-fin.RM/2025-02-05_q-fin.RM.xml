      <title>Exploring Quantum-Enhanced Estimation of Financial Risk Metrics with Quantum RNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach for estimating significant financial metrics within risk management by utilizing quantum phenomena for random number generation. We explore Quantum-Enhanced Monte Carlo, a method that combines traditional and quantum techniques for enhanced precision through Quantum Random Numbers Generation (QRNG). The proposed methods can be based on the use of photonic phenomena or quantum processing units to generate random numbers. The results are promising, hinting at improved accuracy with the proposed methods and slightly lower estimates (both for VaR and CVaR estimation) using the quantum-based methodology.</description>

      <title>The checkerboard copula and dependence concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of choosing the copula when the marginal distributions of a random vector are not all continuous. Inspired by four motivating examples including simulation from copulas, stress scenarios, co-risk measures, and dependence measures, we propose to use the checkerboard copula, that is, intuitively, the unique copula with a distribution that is as uniform as possible within regions of flexibility. We show that the checkerboard copula has the largest Shannon entropy, which means that it carries the least information among all possible copulas for a given random vector. Furthermore, the checkerboard copula preserves the dependence information of the original random vector, leading to two applications in the context of diversification penalty and impact portfolios. The numerical and empirical results illustrate the benefits of using the checkerboard copula in the calculation of co-risk measures.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Time-Varying Portfolio Optimisation using Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Apart from assessing individual asset performance, investors in financial markets also need to consider how a set of firms performs collectively as a portfolio. Whereas traditional Markowitz-based mean-variance portfolios are widespread, network-based optimisation techniques offer a more flexible tool to capture complex interdependencies between asset values. However, most of the existing studies do not contain firms at risk of default and remove any firms that drop off indices over a certain time. This is the first study to also incorporate such firms in portfolio optimisation on a large scale. We propose and empirically test a novel method that leverages Graph Attention networks (GATs), a subclass of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs, as deep learning-based models, can exploit network data to uncover nonlinear relationships. Their ability to handle high-dimensional data and accommodate customised layers for specific purposes makes them appealing for large-scale problems such as mid- and small-cap portfolio optimisation. This study utilises 30 years of data on mid-cap firms, creating graphs of firms using distance correlation and the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph approach. These graphs are the inputs to a GAT model incorporating weight and allocation constraints and a loss function derived from the Sharpe ratio, thus focusing on maximising portfolio risk-adjusted returns. This new model is benchmarked against a network characteristic-based portfolio, a mean variance-based portfolio, and an equal-weighted portfolio. The results show that the portfolio produced by the GAT-based model outperforms all benchmarks and is consistently superior to other strategies over a long period, while also being informative of market dynamics.</description>

      <title>AlphaSharpe: LLM-Driven Discovery of Robust Risk-Adjusted Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial metrics like the Sharpe ratio are pivotal in evaluating investment performance by balancing risk and return. However, traditional metrics often struggle with robustness and generalization, particularly in dynamic and volatile market conditions. This paper introduces AlphaSharpe, a novel framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively evolve and optimize financial metrics to discover enhanced risk-return metrics that outperform traditional approaches in robustness and correlation with future performance metrics by employing iterative crossover, mutation, and evaluation. Key contributions of this work include: (1) a novel use of LLMs to generate and refine financial metrics with implicit domain-specific knowledge, (2) a scoring mechanism to ensure that evolved metrics generalize effectively to unseen data, and (3) an empirical demonstration of 3x predictive power for future risk-returns, and 2x portfolio performance. Experimental results in a real-world dataset highlight the superiority of discovered metrics, making them highly relevant to portfolio managers and financial decision-makers. This framework not only addresses the limitations of existing metrics but also showcases the potential of LLMs in advancing financial analytics, paving the way for informed and robust investment strategies.</description>
