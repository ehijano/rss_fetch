      <title>Explicit Min-wise Hash Families with Optimal Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study explicit constructions of min-wise hash families and their extension to $k$-min-wise hash families. Informally, a min-wise hash family guarantees that for any fixed subset $X\subseteq[N]$, every element in $X$ has an equal chance to have the smallest value among all elements in $X$; a $k$-min-wise hash family guarantees this for every subset of size $k$ in $X$. Min-wise hash is widely used in many areas of computer science such as sketching, web page detection, and $\ell_0$ sampling.
  The classical works by Indyk and P\u{a}tra\c{s}cu and Thorup have shown $\Theta(\log(1/\delta))$-wise independent families give min-wise hash of multiplicative (relative) error $\delta$, resulting in a construction with $\Theta(\log(1/\delta)\log N)$ random bits. Based on a reduction from pseudorandom generators for combinatorial rectangles by Saks, Srinivasan, Zhou and Zuckerman, Gopolan and Yehudayoff improved the number of bits to $O(\log N\log\log N)$ for polynomially small errors $\delta$. However, no construction with $O(\log N)$ bits (polynomial size family) and sub-constant error was known before.
  In this work, we continue and extend the study of constructing ($k$-)min-wise hash families from pseudorandomness for combinatorial rectangles and read-once branching programs. Our main result gives the first explicit min-wise hash families that use an optimal (up to constant) number of random bits and achieve a sub-constant (in fact, almost polynomially small) error, specifically, an explicit family of $k$-min-wise hash with $O(k\log N)$ bits and $2^{-O(\log N/\log\log N)}$ error. This improves all previous results for any $k=\log^{O(1)}N$ under $O(k \log N)$ bits. Our main techniques involve several new ideas to adapt the classical Nisan-Zuckerman pseudorandom generator to fool min-wise hashing with a multiplicative error.</description>

      <title>Designing ReLU Generative Networks to Enumerate Trees with a Given Tree Edit Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 ) and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture, the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35% and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there is no automaton accepting the Tribonacci representations of $n$ and $x$ in parallel, where $\psi = 1.839\cdots$ is the Tribonacci constant, and $x= \lfloor n \psi \rfloor$. Similarly, there is no Tribonacci automaton generating the Sturmian characteristic word with slope $\psi-1$.</description>

      <title>A note on the distinct distances problem over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a finite-field analogue of the Erd\H{o}s distinct distances problem under the Hamming metric. For a set \(S\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^n\) let $\Delta(S)$ denote the set of Hamming distances determined by \(S\). We prove the lower bound \[ |\Delta(S)| \;\ge\; \frac{\log |S|}{2\log(2nq)}, \] and show this bound is tight when \(|S|=O(\text{poly}(n))\), where the constant of proportionality depends only on $q$. We then also study the problem of finding a large \emph{rainbow set}, that is, a subset \(S\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^n\) for which all \(\binom{|S|}{2}\) pairwise Hamming distances spanned by $S$ are distinct. In contrast to the Euclidean setting, we show that a set with many distinct distances does not imply the existence of a large rainbow set, by giving an explicit construction.
  Nevertheless, we establish the existence of large rainbow sets, and prove that every large set in \(\mathbb{F}_q^n\) necessarily contains a non-trivial rainbow subset.</description>

      <title>Geoffrion's theorem beyond finiteness and rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geoffrion's theorem is a fundamental result from mathematical programming assessing the quality of Lagrangian relaxation, a standard technique to get bounds for integer programs. An often implicit condition is that the set of feasible solutions is finite or described by rational linear constraints. However, we show through concrete examples that the conclusion of Geoffrion's theorem does not necessarily hold when this condition is dropped. We then provide sufficient conditions ensuring the validity of the result even when the feasible set is not finite and cannot be described using finitely-many linear constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every completely monotone function defined on a right-unbounded open interval admits a Newton series expansion at every point of that interval. This result can be viewed as an analog of Bernstein's little theorem for absolutely monotone functions. As an application, we use it to study principal indefinite sums, which are constructed via a broad generalization of Bohr-Mollerup's theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the following asymptotically tight lower bound for $k$-color discrepancy: For any $k \geq 2$, there exists a hypergraph with $n$ hyperedges such that its $k$-color discrepancy is at least $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. This improves on the previously known lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n/\log k})$ due to Caragiannis et al. (arXiv:2502.10516). As an application, we show that our result implies improved lower bounds for group fair division.</description>

      <title>On full-separating sets and related codes in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A domination-based identification problem on a graph $G$ is one where the objective is to choose a subset $C$ of the vertex set of $G$ such that $C$ has both, a domination property, that is, $C$ is either a dominating or a total-dominating set of $G$, and a separation property, that is, any two distinct vertices of $G$ must have distinct closed or open neighborhoods in $C$. Such a set $C$ is often referred to as a code in the literature of identification problems. In this article, we introduce a new separation property, called full-separation, as it combines aspects of the two well-studied properties of closed- and open-separation. We study it in combination with both domination and total-domination and call the resulting codes full-separating dominating codes (or FD-codes for short) and full-separating total-dominating codes (or FTD-codes for short), respectively. Incidentally, FTD-codes have also been introduced in the literature of identification problems under the name of strongly identifying codes (or SID-codes for short) and under a differently formulated definition. In this paper, we address the conditions for the existence of FD- and FTD-codes, bounds for their size, their relation to codes of the other types and present some extremal cases for these bounds and relations. We further show that the problems of determining an FD- or an FTD-code of minimum cardinality in a graph are NP-hard. We also show that the cardinalities of minimum FD- and FTD-codes of any graph differ by at most one, but that it is NP-hard to decide whether or not they are equal for a given graph in general.</description>

      <title>Average-case matrix discrepancy: satisfiability bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta &gt; 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_{\rm op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau &gt; 0$. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau &lt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau &gt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions is exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau&gt;\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the semicircle law. Finally, under a technical assumption, we show that there exists values of $(\tau,\kappa)$ for which the number of solutions has large variance, implying the failure of the second moment method. Our proofs rely on establishing concentration and large deviation properties of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints.</description>

      <title>Voting-Based Semi-Parallel Proof-of-Work Protocol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols are suggested to improve the safety guarantees, transaction throughput and confirmation latencies of Nakamoto consensus. In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols and develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and simulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable to incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller profitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we introduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both Nakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical perspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction conflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair distribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use state-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and consider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about the resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.</description>

      <title>Low Recourse Arborescence Forests Under Uniformly Random Arcs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study how to maintain a forest of arborescences of maximum arc cardinality under arc insertions while minimizing recourse -- the total number of arcs changed in the maintained solution. This problem is the "arborescence version'' of max cardinality matching.
  On the impossibility side, we observe that even in this insertion-only model, it is possible for $m$ adversarial arc arrivals to necessarily incur $\Omega(m \cdot n)$ recourse, matching a trivial upper bound of $O(m \cdot n)$. On the possibility side, we give an algorithm with expected recourse $O(m \cdot \log^2 n)$ if all $m$ arcs arrive uniformly at random.</description>

      <title>Exact Causal Attention with 10% Fewer Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Exact Causal Attention (ECA), a Strassen-style algorithm that computes exact Causal Attention using 10\% fewer operations. ECA improves a special class of matrix multiplications where either one operand or the output matrix is upper- or lower-triangular. This includes all matrix multiplication operations in the forward and backward pass of Causal Attention, such as masked product $\mathrm{Mask}(QK^{T})$. ECA is built upon algebraic identities discovered via machine learning and combinatorial search. We note that ECA cannot accelerate fused kernels such as FlashAttention on GPU. This is because ECA requires materialization of large intermediate expressions in the memory, while FlashAttention does not. However, it provides an alternative approach for compute-bound applications and can potentially be useful in scenarios with FLOPs considerations.</description>
