      <title>Reflections on the Future of Statistics Education in a Technological Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keeping pace with rapidly evolving technology is a key challenge in teaching statistics. To equip students with essential skills for the modern workplace, educators must integrate relevant technologies into the statistical curriculum where possible. University-level statistics education has experienced substantial technological change, particularly in the tools and practices that underpin teaching and learning. Statistical programming has become central to many courses, with R widely used and Python increasingly incorporated into statistics and data analytics programmes. Additionally, coding practices, database management, and machine learning now feature within some statistics curricula. Looking ahead, we anticipate a growing emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the pedagogical implications of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT. In this article, we explore these technological developments and discuss strategies for their integration into contemporary statistics education.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for the global clustering coefficient of random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global clustering coefficient serves as a powerful metric for the structural analysis and comparison of complex networks. Random geometric graphs offer a realistic framework for representing the spatial constraints and geometry often found in real-world network datasets. In this paper, we establish a central limit theorem for the global clustering coefficient of random geometric graphs. Our main result identifies the centering and scaling sequences required for convergence in law to the standard normal distribution. Our approach varies by regime: in the dense case, we employ the Lyapunov CLT; in the intermediate case, we utilize the asymptotic theory of $U$-statistics with sample-size-dependent kernels; and in the sparse regime, we use the method of moments to derive the asymptotic distribution. Notably, the convergence rates for non-uniform and uniform random geometric graphs diverge in the dense regime, yet they coincide in the sparse regime. In addition, we find that the global clustering coefficient for both uniform and non-uniform RGGs is asymptotically equal to $3/4$</description>
