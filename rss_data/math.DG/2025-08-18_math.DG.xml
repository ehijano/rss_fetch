      <title>Functoriality of bornological groupoid convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the complete bornological convolution algebras of Lie groupoids and convolution bimodules of groupoid bibundles define a monoidal functor from the 2-category of differentiable stacks to the Morita 2-category of complete bornological algebras. The convolution algebras are generally non-unital, but are shown to possess one-sided approximate units such that the multiplication operators Mackey converge in the functional bornology of endomorphisms. This implies that the convolution algebras are self-induced and the convolution modules are smooth in the sense of R. Meyer. We also show that Lie groupoid actions that are submersive, proper, and transitive have projective convolution modules. This implies that all convolution algebras are quasi-unital. We provide a long list of examples and applications, such as to bornological noncommutative tori, which are Hopf monoids in the Morita category.</description>

      <title>Cohomologically Calibrated Affine Connections and Forced Irreducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a principle of forced geometric irreducibility on product manifolds. We prove that for any product manifold $M=M_1\times M_2$, a cohomologically calibrated affine connection, $\nabla^{\mathcal{C}}$, is necessarily holonomically irreducible, provided its calibration class $[\omega] \in H^3(M;\mathbb{R})$ is mixed. The core of the proof relies on Hodge theory; we show that the algebraic structure of the harmonic part of the torsion generates non-zero off-diagonal components in the full Riemann curvature tensor, which cannot be globally cancelled. This non-cancellation is formally proven via an integral argument. We illustrate the main theorem with explicit constructions on $S^2\times \Sigma_g$, showing that this result holds even in special cases where the Ricci tensor is diagonal, such as the Einstein-calibrated connection. Finally, we briefly discuss speculative analogies between forced irreducibility and quantum entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish Chern number identities on compact complex surfaces. As an application, we prove that if $(M,g)$ is a compact Riemannian four-manifold with constant scalar curvature and admits a compatible complex structure $J$ such that the complexified Ricci curvature is a non-positive $(1,1)$ form, then $M$ is a K\"ahler surface.</description>

      <title>Einstein manifolds under cone conditions for the curvature operator of the second kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is established in [6, 14, 23] that any closed Einstein manifold with two-nonnegative curvature operator of the second kind is either flat or a round sphere. In this paper, we refine this result by relaxing the curvature condition to a cone condition (strictly weaker than two nonnegativity) proposed by Li [18]. Precisely, we prove that any closed Einstein manifold of dimension $n=4$ or $n=5$ or $n\ge 8$, if the curvature operator of the second kind $\mathring{R}$ satisfies \begin{align*}
  (\lambda_1+\lambda_2)/2 \ge -\theta(n) \bar \lambda, \end{align*} then the manifold is either flat or a round sphere. Here, $\lambda_1\le \lambda_2\le \cdots\le \lambda_{(n-1)(n+2)/2}$ are the eigenvalues of $\mathring{R}$, $ \bar \lambda $ is their average, and $\theta(n)$ is a positive constant defined as in (1.2).</description>

      <title>Poincar\'{e} Polynomials and Curvature Operators of Symmetric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute explicit formulas for the curvature operators and Poincar\'e polynomials of all compact irreducible symmetric spaces. We can easily derive the Poincar\'e polynomials using quantum numbers, giving a formula that mirrors the known formula for the Euler characteristic. For the curvature operators, we show that their maximum eigenvalue is always bounded above by the Einstein constant, with equality attained precisely by the Hermitian symmetric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffeology extends differential geometry to spaces beyond smooth manifolds. This paper explores diffeology's key features and illustrates its utility with examples including singular and quotient spaces, and applications in symplectic geometry and prequantization. Diffeology provides a natural and effective framework for handling complexities from singularities and infinite-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Clairaut Riemannian warped product submersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the concept of \textit{Clairaut Riemannian warped product submersions} between Riemannian warped product manifolds. By generalizing the notion of Clairaut Riemannian submersions to the setting of Riemannian warped product submersions, we define such submersions via a warping function satisfying a Clairaut relation along geodesics. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which a Riemannian warped product submersion satisfies the Clairaut condition, showing that it holds if and only if the girth function defining the Clairaut condition has a horizontal gradient, one component of the fibers is totally geodesic, and the other is totally umbilical with mean curvature vector governed by the warping function. We examine the geometric consequences of this structure, study the harmonicity conditions and the behavior of the Weyl tensor. Additionally, we illustrate the theory with several non-trivial examples. In the latter part of the paper, we explore a detailed study of the curvature behavior of such submersions. Explicit formulas for the Riemannian, Ricci, and sectional curvature tensors of the source space are derived in terms of the geometry of the target and fiber manifolds, as well as the warping and girth functions. These computations provide geometric insight into how warping and the Clairaut condition affect curvature properties, such as conformal flatness and the non-positivity of certain mixed curvatures. We also analyze the conditions for a trivial warping of the source manifold and for the fibers to be locally symmetric. Furthermore, the Einstein condition has been explored in various scenarios. Finally, we also extend and answer a question posed by A. L. Besse in the setting of Clairaut warped product submersion.</description>

      <title>Geometry of left-invariant vector fields on Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the geometry of left-invariant vector fields on five-dimensional, simply connected, nilpotent Lie groups equipped with left-invariant Riemannian metrics. Using the canonical identification between the Lie algebra and the space of left-invariant vector fields, we derive algebraic characterizations for Killing, one-harmonic Killing, conformal, and concurrent vector fields. Employing a classification of these nilpotent Lie algebras into ten canonical types, we perform a case-by-case analysis to determine the structure of these vector fields. We prove that the space of Killing fields coincides with the center of the Lie algebra, and that one-harmonic and conformal fields are necessarily Killing. Furthermore, we establish the nonexistence of nontrivial concurrent vector fields in this setting.</description>

      <title>BRIDGES Lectures: Flows of geometric structures, especially $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BRIDGES meeting in gauge theory, extremal structures, and stability was held June 2024 at l'Institut d'\'Etudes Scientifiques de Carg\`ese in Corsica, organized by Daniele Faenzi, Eveline Legendre, Eric Loubeau, and Henrique S\'a Earp. The first week was a summer school consisting of four independent but related lecture series by Oscar Garc\'ia Prada, Spiro Karigiannis, Laurent Manivel, and Ruxandra Moraru. The present document consists of notes for the lecture series by Spiro Karigiannis on "Flows of geometric structures, especially $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures". Some assistance in the preparation of these notes by the author was provided by several participants of the summer school. See the Comments field for more information.
  The main theme is short time existence (STE) and uniqueness for geometric flows. We first introduce geometric structures on manifolds and geometric flows of such structures. We discuss some qualitative features of geometric flows, and consider the notions of strong and weak parabolicity. We focus on the Ricci flow, explaining carefully the DeTurck trick to establish short-time existence and uniqueness, an argument which we then extend to a general class of geometric flows of Riemannian metrics, previewing similar ideas for flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. Finally, we consider geometric flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. We review the basics of $\mathrm{G}_2$-geometry and survey several different geometric flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. In particular, we clarify in what sense STE results for the $\mathrm{G}_2$ Laplacian flow differ from STE results for other geometric flows. We conclude with a summary of some recent results by the author with Dwivedi and Gianniotis, including a classification of all possible heat-type flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures, and a sufficient condition for such a flow to admit STE and uniqueness by a modified DeTurck trick.</description>

      <title>Learning with Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize a notion of confidence that arises in learning or updating beliefs: the amount of trust one has in incoming information and its impact on the belief state. This learner's confidence can be used alongside (and is easily mistaken for) probability or likelihood, but it is fundamentally a different concept -- one that captures many familiar concepts in the literature, including learning rates and number of training epochs, Shafer's weight of evidence, and Kalman gain. We formally axiomatize what it means to learn with confidence, give two canonical ways of measuring confidence on a continuum, and prove that confidence can always be represented in this way. Under additional assumptions, we derive more compact representations of confidence-based learning in terms of vector fields and loss functions. These representations induce an extended language of compound "parallel" observations. We characterize Bayes Rule as the special case of an optimizing learner whose loss representation is a linear expectation.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{L}^p$-based Sobolev theory for PDEs on closed manifolds of class $C^m$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $\mathrm{L}^p$-based ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$) well-posedness and Sobolev regularity for appropriate weak formulations of the (stationary) Laplace--Beltrami, Bochner Laplace, tangent Stokes, and tangent Navier--Stokes problems on compact, connected $d$-dimensional manifolds without boundary of class $C^m$ ($m \geq 2$) embedded in $\mathrm{R}^{d+1}$, in terms of the regularity of the source terms and the manifold. Firstly, we localize and translate the Laplace--Beltrami problem into flat domains to establish $\mathrm{L}^p$-based ($2 \leq p &lt; \infty$) Sobolev regularity results as a consequence of the powerful Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund theory. From then onwards, our strategy is purely ``variational'', building upon the abstract functional analytic idea of ``duality'' and classical results such as the Banach--Ne\v{c}as--Babu\v{s}ka theorem and the generalized Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi theory in reflexive Banach spaces to analyze and relate to each other different strong, weak and ultra-weak formulations for the aforementioned problems. In particular, by exploiting the lack of manifold boundary, we are able to decouple the velocity and the pressure unknowns in the tangent Stokes problem to establish their higher-regularity $\mathbf{W}^{k,p} \times \mathrm{W}^{k-1,p}$ ($k \geq 2$) as a consequence of the $\mathrm{L}^p$-based well-posedness and regularity theory for the Laplace--Beltrami and Bochner--Laplace operators. We finish this work by applying this newly derived regularity theory to: i) define and appropriate Stokes operator and study its spectral and regularity properties, ii) establish $\mathrm{L}^p$-based ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$) existence and well-posedness for the (stationary) tangent Oseen and Navier--Stokes equations via a Galerkin method and bootstrapping, and higher $\mathrm{L}^p$-based Sobolev regularity results. iii) transfer our regularity results to other choices of vector Laplace operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a smooth proper holomorphic fibration of complex manifolds. It is known that the semipositivity of the curvature of the direct image of the relative canonical bundle can be read in terms of the cup product with the Kodaira-Spencer class of the fibers.
  Motivated by this result, in this paper we study the relation between deformations of maps with fixed target and the curvature of certain direct image bundles. As a result, we find some curvature formulas and use them to prove a seminegativity result for a vector bundle of relative forms naturally related to the deformation data.</description>

      <title>Explicit solutions to Christoffel-Minkowski problems and Hessian equations under rotational symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An explicit solution to the Christoffel-Minkowski problem for convex bodies of revolution is presented. The conditions on the prescribed measure involve only first moments over spherical caps, and the support function of the resulting convex body is given by an explicit representation formula in terms of the measure. More generally, existence problems for mixed area measures are addressed. The approach relies on constructing explicit convex solutions to mixed Monge-Amp\`ere equations on $\mathbb{R}^n$ under the assumption of radial symmetry, with the conditions on the measure being expressed through its values on open balls. As a special case, the Dirichlet problem for $k$-Hessian equations on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is treated.</description>

      <title>Weyl Law for Schr\"odinger Operators on Noncompact Manifolds, Heat Kernel, and Karamata-Hardy-Littlewood Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on our earlier work on heat kernel asymptotics for Schr\"odinger-type operators on noncompact manifolds, we establish both the classical and semiclassical Weyl laws for Schr\"odinger operators of the form $\Delta+V$ and $\hbar^2\Delta+V$ on complete noncompact manifolds. While the semiclassical law can be approached via localization, the classical Weyl law has remained widely expected but unproven in this generality. We impose a mild bounded integral oscillation condition on $ V $ in addition to the assumptions that $V$ diverges at infinity and satisfies a doubling condition. In this setting, our oscillation condition is sharp and strictly weaker than all previously known assumptions, even in the Euclidean case.
  A central novelty of our approach is an extended Karamata-Hardy-Littlewood Tauberian theorem, adapted to accommodate non-regularly varying spectral asymptotics in noncompact settings, together with its semiclassical analogue. These Tauberian tools allow us to derive both versions of Weyl's law within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Curvature-dimension condition of sub-Riemannian $\alpha$-Grushin half-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide new examples of sub-Riemannian manifolds with boundary equipped with a smooth measure that satisfy the $\mathsf{RCD}(K , N)$ condition. They are constructed by equipping the half-plane, the hemisphere and the hyperbolic half-plane with a two-dimensional almost-Riemannian structure and a measure that vanishes on their boundary. The construction of these spaces is inspired from the geometry of the $\alpha$-Grushin plane.</description>

      <title>Loops, Holonomy and Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a topology on the group of loops in euclidean space such that this group is embedded in a Lie group which is simple relative to the loops. An extension of this Lie group gives the structural group of a principal bundle with connection whose holonomy coincides with the Chen signature map. We also give an alternative geometric new proof of Chen signature Theorem.</description>

      <title>Prescribing curvatures on surfaces with conical singularities and corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of prescribing Gaussian curvature and geodesic curvature in a compact surface with boundary with conical singularities and corners. Solutions are obtained using a new variational formulation, recently introduced for the regular counterpart of the problem and extended here to the singular case. As far as we know, this is the first result for the problem of prescribed curvatures in surfaces with singularities.</description>
