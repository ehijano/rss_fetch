      <title>A story of cooperation: Centrosome-cytoskeleton interactions and implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A structural link between cell's centrosome and cytoskeleton has been proposed years ago. Centrosomes are usually located in the proximity to the nuclei and maintain nucleus-centrosome axis. This positioning aids in determining the polarity of interphase cells and ensure spindle assembly in mitotic cells. Centrosome also maintains physical interaction with different forms of cytoskeleton to trade-off between internal architecture and cell polarity in tissue specific as well as development specific manner. Several crosslinkers are also available to support this interaction and consequently promote cytoskeleton nucleation as well as centrosome nucleation. We present an overview of coordinated action of cytoskeletal elements on centrosomes and vice versa to modulate complex cellular functions, as diverse as cell migration, cell adhesion and cell division.</description>

      <title>Lichen-Mediated Self-Growing Construction Materials for Habitat Outfitting on Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As its next step in space exploration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) revealed plans to establish a permanent human presence on Mars. To build the centrally located, monolithic habitat, NASA has a history of experimenting with lightweight inflatable habitats to reduce mass and volume. However, the physical structures used to outfit the inflatable must generally be launched by a second spacecraft. This study proposes that, rather than shipping prefabricated outfitting elements to Mars, habitat outfitting can be realized by in-situ construction using cyanobacteria and fungi as building agents. A synthetic lichen system, composed of diazotrophic cyanobacteria and filamentous fungi, can be created to produce abundant biominerals and biopolymers, which will glue Martian regolith into consolidated building blocks. These self-growing building blocks can be assembled into various structures, such as floors, walls, partitions, and furniture.</description>
