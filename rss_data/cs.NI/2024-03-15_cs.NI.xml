      <title>Constrained Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Controller Synchronization in Distributed SDN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In software-defined networking (SDN), the implementation of distributed SDN controllers, with each controller responsible for managing a specific sub-network or domain, plays a critical role in achieving a balance between centralized control, scalability, reliability, and network efficiency. These controllers must be synchronized to maintain a logically centralized view of the entire network. While there are various approaches for synchronizing distributed SDN controllers, most tend to prioritize goals such as optimization of communication latency or load balancing, often neglecting to address both the aspects simultaneously. This limitation becomes particularly significant when considering applications like Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR), which demand constrained network latencies and substantial computational resources. Additionally, many existing studies in this field predominantly rely on value-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods, overlooking the potential advantages offered by state-of-the-art policy-based RL algorithms. To bridge this gap, our work focuses on examining deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques, encompassing both value-based and policy-based methods, to guarantee an upper latency threshold for AR/VR task offloading within SDN environments, while selecting the most cost-effective servers for AR/VR task offloading. Our evaluation results indicate that while value-based methods excel in optimizing individual network metrics such as latency or load balancing, policy-based approaches exhibit greater robustness in adapting to sudden network changes or reconfiguration.</description>

      <title>Comparison of edge computing methods in Internet of Things architectures for efficient estimation of indoor environmental parameters with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large increase in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices have revolutionised the way data is processed, which added to the current trend from cloud to edge computing has resulted in the need for efficient and reliable data processing near the data sources using energy-efficient devices. Two methods based on low-cost edge-IoT architectures are proposed to implement lightweight Machine Learning (ML) models that estimate indoor environmental quality (IEQ) parameters, such as Artificial Neural Networks of Multilayer Perceptron type. Their implementation is based on centralised and distributed parallel IoT architectures, connected via wireless, which share commercial off-the-self modules for data acquisition and sensing, such as sensors for temperature, humidity, illuminance, CO2, and other gases. The centralised method uses a Graphics Processing Unit and the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol, but the distributed method utilises low performance ARM-based devices and the Message Passing Interface protocol. Although multiple IEQ parameters are measured, the training and testing of ML models is accomplished with experiments focused on small temperature and illuminance datasets to reduce data processing load, obtained from sudden spikes, square profiles and sawteeth test cases. The results show a high estimation performance with F-score and Accuracy values close to 0.95, and an almost theorical Speedup with a reduction in power consumption close to 37% in the distributed parallel approach. In addition, similar or slightly better performance is achieved compared to equivalent IoT architectures from related research, but error reduction of 35 to 76% is accomplished with an adequate balance between performance and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Federated Deep Q-Learning and 5G load balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advances in cellular network technology, base station (BS) load balancing remains a persistent problem. Although centralized resource allocation methods can address the load balancing problem, it still remains an NP-hard problem. In this research, we study how federated deep Q learning can be used to inform each user equipment (UE) of the each BS's load conditions. Federated deep Q learning's load balancing enables intelligent UEs to independently select the best BS while also limiting the amount of private information exposed to the network.
  In this study, we propose and analyze a federated deep Q learning load balancing system, which is implemented using the Open-RAN xAPP framework and the near-Real Time Radio Interface Controller (near-RT RIC). Our simulation results indicate that compared to the maximum Signal-To-Noise-Ratio (MAX-SINR) method currently used by UEs, our proposed deep Q learning model can consistently provide better High average UE quality of service</description>

      <title>TransformLoc: Transforming MAVs into Mobile Localization Infrastructures in Heterogeneous Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A heterogeneous micro aerial vehicles (MAV) swarm consists of resource-intensive but expensive advanced MAVs (AMAVs) and resource-limited but cost-effective basic MAVs (BMAVs), offering opportunities in diverse fields. Accurate and real-time localization is crucial for MAV swarms, but current practices lack a low-cost, high-precision, and real-time solution, especially for lightweight BMAVs. We find an opportunity to accomplish the task by transforming AMAVs into mobile localization infrastructures for BMAVs. However, turning this insight into a practical system is non-trivial due to challenges in location estimation with BMAVs' unknown and diverse localization errors and resource allocation of AMAVs given coupled influential factors. This study proposes TransformLoc, a new framework that transforms AMAVs into mobile localization infrastructures, specifically designed for low-cost and resource-constrained BMAVs. We first design an error-aware joint location estimation model to perform intermittent joint location estimation for BMAVs and then design a proximity-driven adaptive grouping-scheduling strategy to allocate resources of AMAVs dynamically. TransformLoc achieves a collaborative, adaptive, and cost-effective localization system suitable for large-scale heterogeneous MAV swarms. We implement TransformLoc on industrial drones and validate its performance. Results show that TransformLoc outperforms baselines including SOTA up to 68\% in localization performance, motivating up to 60\% navigation success rate improvement.</description>

      <title>Whittle Index Based User Association in Dense Millimeter Wave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of user association in a dense millimeter wave (mmWave) network, in which each arriving user brings a file containing a random number of packets and each time slot is divided into multiple mini-slots. This problem is an instance of the restless multi-armed bandit problem, and is provably hard to solve. Using a technique introduced by Whittle, we relax the hard per-stage constraint that each arriving user must be associated with exactly one mmWave base station (mBS) to a long-term constraint and then use the Lagrangian multiplier technique to convert the problem into an unconstrained problem. This decouples the process governing the system into separate Markov Decision Processes at different mBSs. We prove that the problem is Whittle indexable, present a scheme for computing the Whittle indices of different mBSs, and propose an association scheme under which, each arriving user is associated with the mBS with the smallest value of the Whittle index. Using extensive simulations, we show that the proposed Whittle index based scheme outperforms several user association schemes proposed in prior work in terms of various performance metrics such as average cost, delay, throughput, and Jain's fairness index.</description>

      <title>PreConfig: A Pretrained Model for Automating Network Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual network configuration automation (NCA) tools face significant challenges in versatility and flexibility due to their reliance on extensive domain expertise and manual design, limiting their adaptability to diverse scenarios and complex application needs. This paper introduces PreConfig, an innovative NCA tool that leverages a pretrained language model for automating network configuration tasks. PreConfig is designed to address the complexity and variety of NCA tasks by framing them as text-to-text transformation problems, thus unifying the tasks of configuration generation, translation, and analysis under a single, versatile model. Our approach overcomes existing tools' limitations by utilizing advances in natural language processing to automatically comprehend and generate network configurations without extensive manual re-engineering. We confront the challenges of integrating domain-specific knowledge into pretrained models and the scarcity of supervision data in the network configuration field. Our solution involves constructing a specialized corpus and further pretraining on network configuration data, coupled with a novel data mining technique for generating task supervision data. The proposed model demonstrates robustness in configuration generation, translation, and analysis, outperforming conventional tools in handling complex networking environments. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of PreConfig, establishing a new direction for automating network configuration tasks with pretrained language models.</description>

      <title>Charting Censorship Resilience &amp; Global Internet Reachability: A Quantitative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet censorship and global Internet reachability are prevalent topics of today's Internet. Nonetheless, the impact of network topology and Internet architecture to these aspects of the Internet is under-explored. With the goal of informing policy discussions with an objective basis, we present an approach for evaluating both censorship resilience and global Internet reachability using quantitative network metrics, which are applicable to current BGP/IP networks and also to alternative Internet network architectures. We devise and instantiate the metric on the network topology of multiple countries, comparing the BGP/IP network, an overlay network using a waypoint mechanism for circumventing undesired nodes, and the path-aware Internet architecture SCION. The novelty of the approach resides in providing a metric enabling the analysis of these aspects of the Internet at the routing level, taking into account the innate properties of the routing protocol and architecture. We demonstrate that the Internet topology matters, and strongly influences both censorship resilience and reachability to the global Internet. Finally, we argue that access to multiple paths accompanied with path-awareness could enable a higher level of censorship resilience compared to the current Internet, and reduce the centralization of Internet routing.</description>

      <title>Network-Controlled Repeater -- An Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fifth generation (5G) wireless cellular networks, millimeter wave spectrum opens room for several potential improvements in throughput, reliability, latency, among other aspects. However, it also brings challenges, such as a higher influence of blockage which may significantly limit the coverage. In this context, network-controlled repeaters (NCRs) are network nodes with low complexity that represent a technique to overcome coverage problems. In this paper, we introduce the NCR concept and study its performance gains and deployment options. Particularly, presenting the main specifications of NCR as agreed in 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) Rel-18, we analyze different NCR deployments in an urban scenario and compare its performance with alternative deployments. As demonstrated, with a proper network planning and beamforming design, NCR is an attractive solution to cover blind spots the base stations (BSs) may have.</description>

      <title>Handoffs in User-Centric Cell-Free MIMO Networks: A POMDP Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of managing handoffs (HOs) in user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) networks. Motivated by the importance of controlling the number of HOs and by the correlation between efficient HO decisions and the temporal evolution of the channel conditions, we formulate a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with the state space representing the discrete versions of the large-scale fading and the action space representing the association decisions of the user with the access points (APs). We develop a novel algorithm that employs this model to derive a HO policy for a mobile user based on current and future rewards. To alleviate the high complexity of our POMDP, we follow a divide-and-conquer approach by breaking down the POMDP formulation into sub-problems, each solved separately. Then, the policy and the candidate pool of APs for the sub-problem that produced the best total expected reward are used to perform HOs within a specific time horizon. We then introduce modifications to our algorithm to decrease the number of HOs. The results show that half of the number of HOs in the UC-mMIMO networks can be eliminated. Namely, our novel solution can control the number of HOs while maintaining a rate guarantee, where a 47%-70% reduction of the cumulative number of HOs is observed in networks with a density of 125 APs per km2. Most importantly, our results show that a POMDP-based HO scheme is promising to control HOs.</description>

      <title>Cellular-enabled Collaborative Robots Planning and Operations for Search-and-Rescue Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mission-critical operations, particularly in the context of Search-and-Rescue (SAR) and emergency response situations, demand optimal performance and efficiency from every component involved to maximize the success probability of such operations. In these settings, cellular-enabled collaborative robotic systems have emerged as invaluable assets, assisting first responders in several tasks, ranging from victim localization to hazardous area exploration. However, a critical limitation in the deployment of cellular-enabled collaborative robots in SAR missions is their energy budget, primarily supplied by batteries, which directly impacts their task execution and mobility. This paper tackles this problem, and proposes a search-and-rescue framework for cellular-enabled collaborative robots use cases that, taking as input the area size to be explored, the robots fleet size, their energy profile, exploration rate required and target response time, finds the minimum number of robots able to meet the SAR mission goals and the path they should follow to explore the area. Our results, i) show that first responders can rely on a SAR cellular-enabled robotics framework when planning mission-critical operations to take informed decisions with limited resources, and, ii) illustrate the number of robots versus explored area and response time trade-off depending on the type of robot: wheeled vs quadruped.</description>

      <title>CacheGen: Fast Context Loading for Language Model Applications via KV Cache Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on complex tasks, their inputs are supplemented with longer contexts that incorporate domain knowledge or user-specific information. Yet using long contexts poses a challenge for responsive LLM systems, as nothing can be generated until the whole context is processed by the LLM. While the context-processing delay can be reduced by reusing the KV cache of a context across different inputs, fetching the KV cache, which contains large tensors, over the network can cause extra network delays.
  CacheGen is a fast context-loading module for LLM systems. First, CacheGen uses a custom tensor encoder, which embraces KV cache's distributional properties, to encode a KV cache into more compact bitstream representations with negligible encoding/decoding overhead. This reduces the bandwidth demand to fetch the KV cache. Second, to maintain low context-loading delay and high generation quality, CacheGen adapts the streaming strategies to cope with changes in available bandwidth. When available bandwidth drops, CacheGen may raise the compression level for a part of the context or choose to recompute its KV cache on the fly. We test CacheGen on four popular LLMs of various sizes and four datasets (662 contexts in total). Compared to the recent systems that reuse the KV cache, CacheGen reduces the KV cache size by 3.7-4.3x and the total delay in fetching and processing contexts by 2.7-3.2x while having negligible impact on the LLM response quality in accuracy or perplexity.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Federated Learning in Intelligent Transportation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has brought about comprehensive urban traffic information that not only provides convenience to urban residents in their daily lives but also enhances the efficiency of urban road usage, leading to a more harmonious and sustainable urban life. Typical scenarios in ITS mainly include traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, and vehicular edge computing. However, most current ITS applications rely on a centralized training approach where users upload source data to a cloud server with high computing power for management and centralized training. This approach has limitations such as poor real-time performance, data silos, and difficulty in guaranteeing data privacy. To address these limitations, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a promising solution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the application of FL in ITS, with a particular focus on three key scenarios: traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, and vehicular edge computing. For each scenario, we provide an in-depth analysis of its key characteristics, current challenges, and specific manners in which FL is leveraged. Moreover, we discuss the benefits that FL can offer as a potential solution to the limitations of the centralized training approach currently used in ITS applications.</description>
