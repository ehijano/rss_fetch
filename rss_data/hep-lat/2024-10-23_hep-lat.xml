      <title>A high-precision continuum limit study of the HVP short-distance window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The separation of the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment into Euclidean windows allows for a tailored approach to address the different dominant challenges at short, intermediate, and long distances. We present a novel approach to compute the short-distance window without the need for using perturbative QCD. We combine a quenched continuum extrapolation using 18 lattice spacings ($1.6 \,\text{GeV} \lesssim a^{-1} \lesssim 6.1\,\text{GeV}$) with a separate continuum extrapolation of the sea-quark effects. This method allows for the computationally expensive sea-quark effects to be estimated using only a smaller number of ensembles at coarser lattice spacings, while largely confining the logarithmic dependency of the continuum extrapolation to the quenched component.</description>

      <title>The hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g{-}2$ using staggered fermions at the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadronic contributions dominate the uncertainty of the Standard Model prediction for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. In this work, we present results on the hadronic light-by-light contribution obtained from the evaluation of the hadronic four-point function of electromagnetic currents using the position-space formalism developed by the Mainz group. The simulations are performed with staggered fermions directly at the physical point. Several physical volumes are used to estimate finite volume effects. This direct lattice study is supplemented by considering the contribution of the light pseudoscalar pole in both finite and infinite volumes, where we reuse the pseudoscalar transition form factors that have been evaluated in previous simulations on the same ensembles.</description>

      <title>Qudit Gate Decomposition Dependence for Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effect of decomposition basis on primitive qudit gates on superconducting radio-frequency cavity-based quantum computers with applications to lattice gauge theory. Three approaches are tested: SNAP &amp; Displacement gates, ECD &amp; single-qubit rotations $R(\theta,\phi)$, and optimal pulse control. For all three decompositions, implementing the necessary sequence of rotations concurrently rather then sequentially can reduce the primitive gate run time. The number of blocks required for the faster ECD &amp; $R_p(\theta)$ is found to scale $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$, while slower SNAP &amp; Displacement set scales at worst $\mathcal{O}(d)$. For qudits with $d&lt;10$, the resulting gate times for the decompositions is similar, but strongly-dependent on experimental design choices. Optimal control can outperforms both decompositions for small $d$ by a factor of 2-12 at the cost of higher classical resources. Lastly, we find that SNAP &amp; Displacement are slightly more robust to a simplified noise model.</description>

      <title>Observation of string breaking on a (2 + 1)D Rydberg quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe a broad range of phenomena in condensed matter and particle physics. A prominent example is confinement, responsible for bounding quarks inside hadrons such as protons or neutrons. When quark-antiquark pairs are separated, the energy stored in the string of gluon fields connecting them grows linearly with their distance, until there is enough energy to create new pairs from the vacuum and break the string. While such phenomena are ubiquitous in LGTs, simulating the resulting dynamics is a challenging task. Here, we report the observation of string breaking in synthetic quantum matter using a programmable quantum simulator based on neutral atom arrays. We show that a (2+1)D LGT with dynamical matter can be efficiently implemented when the atoms are placed on a Kagome geometry, with a local U(1) symmetry emerging from the Rydberg blockade, while long-range Rydberg interactions naturally give rise to a linear confining potential for a pair of charges, allowing us to tune both their masses as well as the string tension. We experimentally map out the corresponding phase diagram by adiabatically preparing the ground state of the atom array in the presence of defects, and observe substructure of the confined phase, distinguishing regions dominated by fluctuating strings or by broken string configurations. Finally, by harnessing local control over the atomic detuning, we quench string states and observe string breaking dynamics exhibiting a many-body resonance phenomenon. Our work paves a way to explore phenomena in high-energy physics using programmable quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Thermal evolution of dark matter in the early universe from a symplectic glueball model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis that dark matter could be a bound state of a strongly coupled non-Abelian gauge theory is theoretically appealing and has a variety of interesting phenomenological implications. In particular, an interpretation of dark matter as the lightest glueball state in the spectrum of a dark Yang-Mills theory, possibly coupled to the visible sector only through gravitational interactions, has been discussed quite extensively in the literature, but most of previous work has been focused on dark SU(N) gauge theories. In this article, we consider an alternative model, based on a symplectic gauge group, which has a first-order confinement/deconfinement phase transition at a finite critical temperature. We first determine the equation of state of this theory, focusing on temperatures close to the transition, and evaluating the associated latent heat. Then we discuss the evolution of this dark-matter model in the early universe, commenting on the mechanisms by which it could indirectly interact with the visible sector, on the spectrum of gravitational waves it could produce, and on the relic abundances it would lead to. Our discussion includes an extensive review of relevant literature, a number of comments on similarities and differences between our model and dark SU(N) gauge theories, as well as some possible future extensions of the present study.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Polarisability of Octet Baryons via Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing on recent advances in lattice-QCD background-field techniques, the magnetic polarisability of octet baryons is calculated from the first principles of QCD. The results are presented in the context of new constituent quark-model calculations providing a framework for understanding the lattice results and a direct comparison with simulation results at unphysical quark masses. Using smeared quark sources, low-lying Laplacian eigenmode projection and final-state Landau mode projection, considerable attention is devoted to ensuring single-state isolation in the lattice correlation functions. We also introduce new weighting methods to reduce the sensitivity to correlation-function fits, averaging over many fits based on merit drawn from the full correlated $\chi^2$ of the fits. The techniques are implemented on the $32^3 \times 64$, 2+1-flavour dynamical-fermion lattices provided by the PACS-CS collaboration following the introduction of uniform magnetic fields quantised to the lowest nontrivial values available. After some fine tuning of the constituent quark model parameters, we find the model captures the patterns observed in the lattice QCD results very well, providing important insights into the physics underpinning the magnetic polarisabilities. Finally, comparison with the most recent results from experiment proceeds through an effective field theory formalism which incorporates estimates of finite-volume corrections and small electro-quenching corrections as the results are brought to the physical point. We find excellent agreement with experiment where available, including the proton and neutron polarisabilities.</description>

      <title>Is Lattice Quantum Gravity Asymptotically Safe? Making contact between Causal Dynamical Triangulations and the Functional Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the effective action of the scale factor obtained from lattice quantum gravity (in the form of Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT)) to the corresponding effective action obtained from the simplest Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) calculation. In this way, we can identify the generic infinite four-volume limit of the lattice theory in the so-called de Sitter phase with the Gaussian fixed-point limit or the IR fixed-point limit obtained by FRG. We also show how to identify a putative UV lattice gravity fixed point. Our Monte Carlo simulations of CDT allow for the existence of such a UV fixed point, although the data precision does not yet provide a proof of its existence. The concept of a correlation length relevant for the lattice gravity fixed points is argued to be different from the concept of correlation lengths encountered in field theories in a fixed spacetime background.</description>

      <title>Pion-production cross sections in neutrino reactions for studying generalized parton distributions of the nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational form factors of hadrons provide information on mass and pressure distributions in the hadrons, and they have been investigated by generalized parton distributions (GPDs). The GPDs also contain information on internal compositions of hadron spins. Understanding on the origin of hadron masses, pressures, and spins is an important topic not only in hadron physics but also as fundamental physics, and it should be clarified by the GPD studies. The spacelike and timelike GPDs have been measured at charged-lepton accelerator facilities, for example, by the virtual Compton scattering and the two-photon process, respectively. In this work, we show the $\pi^\pm$ and $\pi^0$ production cross sections in neutrino (antineutrino) reactions $\nu \,(\bar\nu) + N \to \ell + \pi + N'$ for measuring the GPDs of the nucleon by using the theoretical formalism of Pire, Szymanowski, and Wagner. The $\pi^\pm$-production cross sections are useful for determining gluon GPDs, whereas the $\pi^0$ production probes quark GPDs. In particular, we show the roles of the pion- and rho-pole terms, the contribution from each GPD term ($H$, $E$, $\tilde H$, $\tilde E$), the effects of the gluon GPDs $H_g$ and $E_g$, and the effects of the reaction energy on the neutrino cross sections. The $\pi^0$-production cross section is sensitive to the quark GPDs including the pion- and rho-pole GPD terms in the Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage region. These cross sections could be measured at Fermilab in future. The neutrino GPD studies will play a complementary role to the projects of charged-lepton and hadron reactions for determining the accurate GPDs.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulation of a (1+1)D SU(2) lattice gauge theory with ion qudits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum simulation strategy for a (1+1)D SU(2) non-abelian lattice gauge theory with dynamical matter, a hardcore-gluon Hamiltonian Yang-Mills, tailored to a six-level trapped-ion qudit quantum processor, as recently experimentally realized. We employ a qudit encoding fulfilling gauge invariance, an SU(2) Gauss law. We discuss the experimental feasibility of generalized M\"olmer-S\"orensen gates used to efficiently simulate the dynamics. We illustrate how a shallow circuit with these resources is sufficient to implement scalable digital quantum simulation of the model. We also numerically show that this model, albeit simple, can dynamically manifest physically-relevant properties specific to non-abelian field theories, such as baryon excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The holographic Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model is often employed to describe strongly-coupled baryonic and isospin-asymmetric matter, for example in the context of neutron stars. Here we consider the case of vanishing baryon chemical potential, where detailed comparisons to data from lattice QCD are possible. To this end, we extend previous works by including a realistic pion mass and pion condensation into the decompactified limit of the model and evaluate the system for arbitrary isospin chemical potentials and temperatures. After suitably fixing the 3 parameters of the model, we find that the overall phase structure is in excellent agreement with lattice results. This also holds for observables at low temperatures in the strongly coupled regime, while we discover and discuss some discrepancies at large temperatures. Our findings give reassurance for the validity of previous and future applications of this model and highlight the aspects where improvements are needed.</description>

      <title>On convergence properties of GPD expansion through Mellin/conformal moments and orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine convergence properties of reconstructing the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) through the universal moment parameterization (GUMP). We provide a heuristic explanation for the connection between the formal summation/expansion and the Mellin-Barnes integral in the literature, and specify the exact convergence condition. We derive an asymptotic condition on the conformal moments of GPDs to satisfy the boundary condition at $x=1$ and subsequently develop an approximate formula for GPDs when $x&gt;\xi$. Since experimental observables constraining GPDs can be expressed in terms of double or even triple summations involving their moments, scale evolution factors, and Wilson coefficients, etc., we propose a method to handle the ordering of the multiple summations and convert them into multiple Mellin-Barnes integrals via analytical continuations of integer summation indices.</description>
