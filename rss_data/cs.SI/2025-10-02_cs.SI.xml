      <title>FTSCommDetector: Discovering Behavioral Communities through Temporal Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00014v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do trillion-dollar tech giants AAPL and MSFT diverge into different response patterns during market disruptions despite identical sector classifications? This paradox reveals a fundamental limitation: traditional community detection methods fail to capture synchronization-desynchronization patterns where entities move independently yet align during critical moments. To this end, we introduce FTSCommDetector, implementing our Temporal Coherence Architecture (TCA) to discover similar and dissimilar communities in continuous multivariate time series. Unlike existing methods that process each timestamp independently, causing unstable community assignments and missing evolving relationships, our approach maintains coherence through dual-scale encoding and static topology with dynamic attention. Furthermore, we establish information-theoretic foundations demonstrating how scale separation maximizes complementary information and introduce Normalized Temporal Profiles (NTP) for scale-invariant evaluation. As a result, FTSCommDetector achieves consistent improvements across four diverse financial markets (SP100, SP500, SP1000, Nikkei 225), with gains ranging from 3.5% to 11.1% over the strongest baselines. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness with only 2% performance variation across window sizes from 60 to 120 days, making dataset-specific tuning unnecessary, providing practical insights for portfolio construction and risk management.</description>

      <title>When Life Paths Cross: Extracting Human Interactions in Time and Space from Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions among notable individuals -- whether examined individually, in groups, or as networks -- often convey significant messages across cultural, economic, political, scientific, and historical perspectives. By analyzing the times and locations of these interactions, we can observe how dynamics unfold across regions over time. However, relevant studies are often constrained by data scarcity, particularly concerning the availability of specific location and time information. To address this issue, we mine millions of biography pages from Wikipedia, extracting 685,966 interaction records in the form of (Person1, Person2, Time, Location) interaction quadruplets. The key elements of these interactions are often scattered throughout the heterogeneous crowd-sourced text and may be loosely or indirectly associated. We overcome this challenge by designing a model that integrates attention mechanisms, multi-task learning, and feature transfer methods, achieving an F1 score of 86.51%, which outperforms baseline models. We further conduct an empirical analysis of intra- and inter-party interactions among political figures to examine political polarization in the US, showcasing the potential of the extracted data from a perspective that may not be possible without this data. We make our code, the extracted interaction data, and the WikiInteraction dataset of 4,507 labeled interaction quadruplets publicly available.</description>

      <title>IA aplicada al an\'alisis del conflicto Ir\'an-Israel: Mapeo de discursos en YouTube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose. This study analyzes the digital representation of the Iran-Israel conflict that occurred in June 2025, based on 120,000 comments posted on YouTube. It sought to identify discursive positions regarding the actors involved and to examine how media and algorithmic biases shape digital conversations. Methodology. A mixed-methods design with triangulation was adopted. In the quantitative phase, natural language processing techniques and machine learning models (BERT and XLM-RoBERTa) were used to classify comments into ten categories. In the qualitative phase, a critical analysis of media context and ideological narratives was conducted, complemented by manual annotation and supervised training. This strategy enabled the integration of statistical robustness with contextual understanding. Results and conclusions. The findings reveal a clear overrepresentation of pro-Palestinian and anti-United States/Israel discourses, while pro-United States and anti-Palestinian positions were marginal. Iran, usually rendered invisible in global media, emerged as a central actor in the digital conversation during the conflict, suggesting a narrative shift away from previous hegemonic frameworks. Likewise, the results confirm the influence of algorithmic biases in amplifying certain discourses while limiting others. Original contributions. This work combines computational analysis and philosophical critique for the study of digital controversies, providing a methodological framework replicable in geopolitical contexts. It is one of the first Spanish-language studies to map, through artificial intelligence and critical analysis, discourses on an international conflict on YouTube, highlighting asymmetries and narrative disputes that are often overlooked.</description>

      <title>EpidemIQs: Prompt-to-Paper LLM Agents for Epidemic Modeling and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to automate complex interdisciplinary research domains. Epidemic modeling, characterized by its complexity and reliance on network science, dynamical systems, epidemiology, and stochastic simulations, represents a prime candidate for leveraging LLM-driven automation. We introduce \textbf{EpidemIQs}, a novel multi-agent LLM framework that integrates user inputs and autonomously conducts literature review, analytical derivation, network modeling, mechanistic modeling, stochastic simulations, data visualization and analysis, and finally documentation of findings in a structured manuscript. We introduced two types of agents: a scientist agent for planning, coordination, reflection, and generation of final results, and a task-expert agent to focus exclusively on one specific duty serving as a tool to the scientist agent. The framework consistently generated complete reports in scientific article format. Specifically, using GPT 4.1 and GPT 4.1 mini as backbone LLMs for scientist and task-expert agents, respectively, the autonomous process completed with average total token usage 870K at a cost of about \$1.57 per study, achieving a 100\% completion success rate through our experiments. We evaluate EpidemIQs across different epidemic scenarios, measuring computational cost, completion success rate, and AI and human expert reviews of generated reports. We compare EpidemIQs to the single-agent LLM, which has the same system prompts and tools, iteratively planning, invoking tools, and revising outputs until task completion. The comparison shows consistently higher performance of the proposed framework across five different scenarios. EpidemIQs represents a step forward in accelerating scientific research by significantly reducing costs and turnaround time of discovery processes, and enhancing accessibility to advanced modeling tools.</description>

      <title>Modeling Product Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a dynamical-systems framework for modeling influence propagation in product adoption networks, formulated as a positive linear system with Metzler interaction matrices and utility-based decay. Exact solutions are derived for constant, piecewise-constant, and fully time-varying interaction structures using matrix exponentials and the Peano--Baker series. It establishes five results: (i) positive interactions guarantee nonnegative amplification, (ii) perceived utility saturates after $\approx\!3$ complementary additions (Weber--Fechner), (iii) frequency of comparable introductions dominates incremental quality improvements, (iv) reinforcing interactions yields monotone gains while decay control gives ambiguous effects, and (v) long-run retention under SIS-type dynamics is bounded by the inverse spectral radius of the adoption graph. These results extend epidemic-threshold theory and positive-systems analysis to networked adoption, yielding explicit, calibratable expressions for influence dynamics on networks.</description>

      <title>SoREX: Towards Self-Explainable Social Recommendation with Relevant Ego-Path Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social recommendation has been proven effective in addressing data sparsity in user-item interaction modeling by leveraging social networks. The recent integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has further enhanced prediction accuracy in contemporary social recommendation algorithms. However, many GNN-based approaches in social recommendation lack the ability to furnish meaningful explanations for their predictions. In this study, we confront this challenge by introducing SoREX, a self-explanatory GNN-based social recommendation framework. SoREX adopts a two-tower framework enhanced by friend recommendation, independently modeling social relations and user-item interactions, while jointly optimizing an auxiliary task to reinforce social signals. To offer explanations, we propose a novel ego-path extraction approach. This method involves transforming the ego-net of a target user into a collection of multi-hop ego-paths, from which we extract factor-specific and candidate-aware ego-path subsets as explanations. This process facilitates the summarization of detailed comparative explanations among different candidate items through intricate substructure analysis. Furthermore, we conduct explanation re-aggregation to explicitly correlate explanations with downstream predictions, imbuing our framework with inherent self-explainability. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four widely adopted benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of SoREX in predictive accuracy. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative analyses confirm the efficacy of the extracted explanations in SoREX. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/antman9914/SoREX.</description>

      <title>Mobility Behavior Evolution During Extended Emergencies: Returners, Explorers, and the 15-Minute City</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding human mobility during emergencies is critical for strengthening urban resilience and guiding emergency management. This study examines transitions between returners, who repeatedly visit a limited set of locations, and explorers, who travel across broader destinations, over a 15-day emergency period in a densely populated metropolitan region using the YJMob100K dataset. High-resolution spatial data reveal intra-urban behavioral dynamics often masked at coarser scales. Beyond static comparisons, we analyze how mobility evolves over time, with varying emergency durations, across weekdays and weekends, and relative to neighborhood boundaries, linking the analysis to the 15-minute city framework.
  Results show that at least two weeks of data are required to detect meaningful behavioral shifts. During prolonged emergencies, individuals resume visits to non-essential locations more slowly than under normal conditions. Explorers markedly reduce long distance travel, while weekends and holidays consistently exhibit returner-like, short distance patterns. Residents of low Points of Interest (POI) density neighborhoods often travel to POI rich areas, highlighting spatial disparities. Strengthening local accessibility may improve urban resilience during crises.

      <title>Threats to the sustainability of Community Notes on X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community Notes are emerging as an important option for content moderation. The Community Notes system pioneered by Twitter, now known as X, uses a bridging algorithm to identify user-generated context with upvotes across political divides, supposedly spinning consensual gold from partisan straw. It is important to understand the nature of the community behind Community Notes, especially as the feature has now been imitated by several billion-user platforms. We look for signs of stability and disruption in the X Community Notes community and interrogate the motivations other than partisan animus (Allen, Martel, and Rand 2022) which may be driving users to contribute. We conduct a novel analysis of the impact of having a note published, which requires being considered "helpful" by the bridging algorithm, utilising a regression discontinuity design. This allows stronger causal inference than conventional methods used with observational data. Our analysis shows the positive effect on future note authoring of having a note published. This highlights the risk of the current system, where the proportion of notes considered "helpful" (and therefore shown to users on X) is low, 10%, and declining. This analysis has implications for the future of Community Notes on X and the extension of this approach to other platforms.</description>

      <title>Discovering Communities in Continuous-Time Temporal Networks by Optimizing L-Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection is a fundamental problem in network analysis, with many applications in various fields. Extending community detection to the temporal setting with exact temporal accuracy, as required by real-world dynamic data, necessitates methods specifically adapted to the temporal nature of interactions. We introduce LAGO, a novel method for uncovering dynamic communities by greedy optimization of Longitudinal Modularity, a specific adaptation of Modularity for continuous-time networks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on time discretization or assume rigid community evolution, LAGO captures the precise moments when nodes enter and exit communities. We evaluate LAGO on synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to efficiently uncover temporally and topologically coherent communities.</description>

      <title>Online Minimization of Polarization and Disagreement via Low-Rank Matrix Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing polarization and disagreement in the Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model under incomplete information. Unlike prior work that assumes a static setting with full knowledge of users' innate opinions, we address the more realistic online setting where innate opinions are unknown and must be learned through sequential observations. This novel setting, which naturally mirrors periodic interventions on social media platforms, is formulated as a regret minimization problem, establishing a key connection between algorithmic interventions on social media platforms and theory of multi-armed bandits. In our formulation, a learner observes only a scalar feedback of the overall polarization and disagreement after an intervention. For this novel bandit problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm based on low-rank matrix bandits. The algorithm first performs subspace estimation to identify an underlying low-dimensional structure, and then employs a linear bandit algorithm within the compact dimensional representation derived from the estimated subspace. We prove that our algorithm achieves an $ \widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative regret over any time horizon $T$. Empirical results validate that our algorithm significantly outperforms a linear bandit baseline in terms of both cumulative regret and running time.</description>

      <title>Social Photo-Elicitation: The Use of Communal Production of Meaning to Hear a Vulnerable Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on an initial ethnographic exploration of the situation of sex-trafficking survivors in Nepal. In the course of studying trafficking survivors in a protected-living situation created by a non-governmental organization in Nepal, we adapted photo-elicitation to hear the voices of the survivors by making the technique more communal. Bringing sociality to the forefront of the method reduced the pressure on survivors to assert voices as individuals, allowing them to speak. We make three contributions to research. First, we propose a communal form of photo-elicitation as a method to elicit values in sensitive settings. Second, we present the complex circumstances of the survivors as they undergo rehabilitation and move towards life with a ``new normal''. Third, our work adds to HCI and CSCW literature on understanding specific concerns of trafficking survivors and aims to inform designs that can support reintegration of survivors in society. The values that the survivors hold and their notion of future opportunities suggest possession of limited but important social capital in some domains that could be leveraged to aid reintegration.</description>

      <title>RouteKG: A knowledge graph-based framework for route prediction on road networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03617v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-term route prediction on road networks allows us to anticipate the future trajectories of road users, enabling various applications ranging from dynamic traffic control to personalized navigation. Despite recent advances in this area, existing methods focus primarily on learning sequential transition patterns, neglecting the inherent spatial relations in road networks that can affect human routing decisions. To fill this gap, this paper introduces RouteKG, a novel Knowledge Graph-based framework for route prediction. Specifically, we construct a Knowledge Graph on the road network to encode spatial relations, especially moving directions that are crucial for human navigation. Moreover, an n-ary tree-based algorithm is introduced to efficiently generate top-K routes in batch mode, enhancing computational efficiency. To further optimize prediction performance, a rank refinement module is incorporated to fine-tune candidate route rankings. The model performance is evaluated using two real-world vehicle trajectory datasets from two Chinese cities under various practical scenarios. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy over the baseline methods. We further validate the proposed method by utilizing the pre-trained model as a simulator for real-time traffic flow estimation at the link level. RouteKG has great potential to transform vehicle navigation, traffic management, and a variety of intelligent transportation tasks, playing a crucial role in advancing the core foundation of intelligent and connected urban systems. The source codes of RouteKG are available at https://github.com/YihongT/RouteKG.</description>

      <title>Arab Spring's Impact on Science through the Lens of Scholarly Attention, Funding, and Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13238v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2010-2011 Arab Spring reverberated far beyond politics, reshaping how the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA) is studied. Analyzing 3.7 million Scopus-indexed articles published between 2002 and 2019, we find that mentions of ten of these countries in titles or abstracts rose significantly after 2011 relative to the global baseline, with Egypt receiving the greatest attention in the region. We link this surge to two intertwined mechanisms: an increase in research funding directed at the MENA region and the emigration of researchers who continued publishing on their countries of origin. Our analysis reveals that Saudi Arabia has emerged as a regional hub for studying the affected countries, attracting funding and scholars, and thereby playing a significant role in shaping the scientific narrative on the region. These findings demonstrate how political upheaval can reshape global knowledge flows by altering who studies whom, with what resources, and in which disciplines.</description>

      <title>Construct to Commitment: The Effect of Narratives on Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how government-led narratives through mass media evolve from construct, a mechanism for framing expectations, into commitment, a sustainable pillar for growth. We propose the "Narratives-Construct-Commitment (NCC)" framework outlining the mechanism and institutionalization of narratives, and formalize it as a dynamic Bayesian game. Using the Innovation-Driven Development Strategy (2016) as a case study, we identify the narrative shock from high-frequency financial data and trace its impact using local projection method. By shaping expectations, credible narratives institutionalize investment incentives, channel resources into R&amp;D, and facilitate sustained improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). Our findings strive to provide insights into the New Quality Productive Forces initiative, highlighting the role of narratives in transforming vision into tangible economic growth.</description>
