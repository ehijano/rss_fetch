      <title>Phase transitions and cluster structures of the new finite range Lennard-Jones like model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current work we revisit the pair-potential recently proposed by Wang et al. (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 10624, 22, 2020) as a well defined finite-range alternative to the widely used Lennard-Jones interaction model. The advantage of their proposed potential is that it not only goes smoothly to zero at the cutoff distance, hence eliminating inconsistencies caused by different treatments of the truncation, but with changing the range of the potential, it is capable of describing soft matter-like behaviour as well as traditional "Lennard-Jones-like" properties. We used the nested sampling method to perform an unbiased sampling of the potential energy surface, and mapped the pressure-temperature phase diagram of a range of truncation distances. We found that the interplay between the location of the energy minimum and interaction range has a complex and strong effect on both the structural and thermodynamic properties of the condensed phases. We discuss the appearance of the liquid-vapour co-existence line and critical point at longer interaction ranges, as well as the relatively small changes in the melting line. We present the ground state diagram, demonstrating that different close-packed polytypic phases appear to be global minima for the model at different pressure and cutoff values, similar to what had been shown in case of the Lennard-Jones model. Finally, we compare the lowest energy structure of some of the N &lt; 60 clusters to that of the known minima of Lennard-Jones and Morse potential, using different cutoff values, revealing a behaviour closely resembling that of the Morse clusters.</description>

      <title>DFT investigation of novel cubic carbon allotrope, yne-C$_{16}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel cubic allotrope yne-C$_{16}$ with sp$^3$/sp$^1$ carbon hybridizations is devised based on crystal chemistry and computations of the ground structure and the energy-dependent quantities within the quantum density functional theory DFT. With respect to srs-C8 characterized by trigonal C(sp$^2$), yne-C$_{16}$ is identified with original C -- C triple bond-like units and distorted tetrahedra. The new allotrope is qualified with unknown topology. At the elementary building unit, C$_{16}$ looks like a pyramidal molecule such as :PCl3, with ":" symbolizing the phosphorous lone pair. With this conceptualization C$_{16}$ has three bond pairs (SIGMA-like) making the pyramid base and the C(triple-bond)C with large PI character resembling phosphorous electron lone pair (:) at the apex of the pyramid. The new allotrope was found cohesive and stable both mechanically (positive elastic constants) as well as dynamically (phonons band structure). C$_{16}$ is characterized with a weakly metallic character.</description>

      <title>Grain boundary segregation spectrum in basal-textured Mg alloys: From solute decoration to structural transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mg alloys are promising lightweight structural materials due to their low density and excellent mechanical properties. However, their limited formability and ductility necessitate improvements in these properties, specifically through texture modification via grain boundary segregation. While significant efforts have been made, the segregation behavior in Mg polycrystals, particularly with basal texture, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we performed atomistic simulations to investigate grain boundary segregation in dilute and concentrated solid solution Mg-Al alloys. We computed the segregation energy spectrum of basal-textured Mg polycrystals, highlighting the contribution from specific grain boundary sites, such as junctions, and identified a newly discovered bimodal distribution which is distinct compared to the conventional skew-normal distribution found in randomly-oriented polycrystals. Using a hybrid molecular dynamics/Monte Carlo approach, we simulated segregation behavior at finite temperatures, identifying grain boundary structural transitions, particularly the varied fraction and morphology of topologically close-packed grain boundary phases when changing thermodynamic variables. The outcomes of this study offer crucial insights into basal-textured grain boundary segregation and phase formation, which can be extended to other relevant Mg alloys containing topologically close-packed intermetallics.</description>

      <title>Small Signal Capacitance in Ferroelectric HZO: Mechanisms and Physical Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a theoretical investigation of the physical mechanisms governing small signal capacitance in ferroelectrics, focusing on Hafnium Zirconium Oxide. Utilizing a time-dependent Ginzburg Landau formalism-based 2D multi-grain phase-field simulation framework, we simulate the capacitance of metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal (MFIM) capacitors. Our simulation methodology closely mirrors the experimental procedures for measuring ferroelectric small signal capacitance, and the outcomes replicate the characteristic butterfly capacitance-voltage behavior. We delve into the components of the ferroelectric capacitance associated with the dielectric response and polarization switching, discussing the primary physical mechanisms - domain bulk response and domain wall response - contributing to the butterfly characteristics. We explore their interplay and relative contributions to the capacitance and correlate them to the polarization domain characteristics. Additionally, we investigate the impact of increasing domain density with ferroelectric thickness scaling, demonstrating an enhancement in the polarization capacitance component (in addition to the dielectric component). We further analyze the relative contributions of the domain bulk and domain wall responses across different ferroelectric thicknesses. Lastly, we establish the relation of polarization capacitance components to the capacitive memory window (for memory applications) and reveal a non-monotonic dependence of the maximum memory window on HZO thickness.</description>

      <title>Polytypic Quantum Wells in Si and Ge: Impact of 2D Hexagonal Inclusions on Electronic Band Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal defects, traditionally viewed as detrimental, are now being explored for quantum technology applications. This study focuses on stacking faults in silicon and germanium, forming hexagonal inclusions within the cubic crystal and creating quantum wells that modify electronic properties. By modeling defective structures with varying hexagonal layer counts, we calculated formation energies and electronic band structures. Our results show that hexagonal inclusions in Si and Ge exhibit a direct band gap, changing with inclusion thickness, effectively functioning as quantum wells. We find that Ge inclusions have a direct band gap and form Type-I quantum wells. This research highlights the potential of manipulating extended defects to engineer the optoelectronic properties of Si and Ge, offering new pathways for advanced electronic and photonic device applications.</description>

      <title>Ferrimagnetic hexagonal Mn$_2$CuGe Heusler alloy with a low-temperature spin-glass state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extensive experimental investigation on the structural, static magnetic, and non-equilibrium dynamical properties of polycrystalline Mn$_2$CuGe Heusler alloy using powder X-ray diffraction, DC magnetization, magnetic relaxation, magnetic memory effect, and specific heat measurements is presented. Structural studies reveal that the alloy crystallizes in a mixed hexagonal crystal structure (space groups P3c1 (no. 158) and P6$_3$/mmc (no. 194)) with lattice parameters a = b = 7.18(4) $\mathring{A}$ and c = 13.12(4) $\mathring{A}$ for the majority phase. The DC magnetization analysis reveals a paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic phase transition around T$_C$ $\approx$ 682 K with a compensation of magnetization at $\approx$ 250 K, and a spin-glass transition around T$_P$ $\approx$ 25.6 K. The N\'eel theory of ferrimagnets supports the ferrimagnetic nature of the studied alloy and the estimated T$_C$ ($\approx$ 687 K) from this theory is consistent with that obtained from the DC magnetization data. A detailed study of non-equilibrium spin dynamics via magnetic relaxation and memory effect experiments shows the evolution of the system through a number of intermediate states and striking magnetic memory effect. Furthermore, heat capacity measurements suggest a large electronic contribution to the specific heat capacity suggesting strong spin fluctuations, due to competing magnetic interactions. All the observations render a spin-glass behavior in Mn$_2$CuGe, attributed to the magnetic frustration possibly arising out of the competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced charge injection from shallow point defects in diamond into water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to its low or negative surface electron affinity and chemical inertness, diamond is attracting broad attention as a source material of solvated electrons produced by optical excitation of the solid-liquid interface. Unfortunately, its wide bandgap typically imposes the use of wavelengths in the ultra-violet range, hence complicating practical applications. Here we probe the photocurrent response of water surrounded by single-crystal diamond surfaces engineered to host shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. We observe clear signatures of diamond-induced photocurrent generation throughout the visible range and for wavelengths reaching up to 594 nm. Experiments as a function of laser power suggest that NV centers and other co-existing defects - likely in the form of surface traps - contribute to carrier injection, though we find that NVs dominate the system response in the limit of high illumination intensities. Given our growing understanding of near-surface NV centers and adjacent point defects, these results open new perspectives in the application of diamond-liquid interfaces to photo-carrier-initiated chemical and spin processes in fluids.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Layer-Controlled Magnetic Orders in MnBi2Te4-Bi2Te3 Topological Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The natural van der Waals superlattice MnBi2Te4-(Bi2Te3)m provides an optimal platform to combine topology and magnetism in one system with minimal structural disorder. Here, we show that this system can harbor both ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders and that these magnetic orders can be controlled in two different ways by either varying the Mn-Mn distance while keeping the Bi2Te3/MnBi2Te4 ratio constant or vice versa. We achieve this by creating atomically engineered sandwich structures composed of Bi2Te3 and MnBi2Te4 layers. We show that the AFM order is exclusively determined by the Mn-Mn distance whereas the FM order depends only on the overall Bi2Te3/MnBi2Te4 ratio regardless of the distance between the MnBi2Te4 layers. Our results shed light on the origins of the AFM and FM orders and provide insights into how to manipulate magnetic orders not only for the MnBi2Te4-Bi2Te3 system but also for other magneto-topological materials.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and Efficient Switching of Sliding Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies highlight the scientific importance and broad application prospects of two-dimensional (2D) sliding ferroelectrics, which prevalently exhibit vertical polarization with suitable stackings. It is crucial to understand the mechanisms of sliding ferroelectricity and to deterministically and efficiently switch the polarization with optimized electric fields. Here, applying our newly developed DREAM-Allegro multi-task equivariant neural network, which simultaneously predicts interatomic potentials and Born effective charges, we construct a comprehensive potential for boron nitride ($\mathrm{BN}$) bilayer. The molecular dynamics simulations reveal a remarkably high Curie temperature of up to 1500K, facilitated by robust intralayer chemical bonds and delicate interlayer van der Waals(vdW) interactions. More importantly, it is found that, compared to the out-of-plane electric field, the inclined field not only leads to deterministic switching of electric polarization, but also largely lower the critical strength of field, due to the presence of the in-plane polarization in the transition state. This strategy of an inclined field is demonstrated to be universal for other sliding ferroelectric systems with monolayer structures belonging to the symmetry group $p \bar{6} m 2$, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).</description>

      <title>Bilayer stacking A-type altermagnet: A general approach to generating two-dimensional altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new concept of bilayer stacking A-type altermagnet (BSAA), in which two identical ferromagnetic monolayers are stacked with antiferromagnetic coupling to form a two-dimensional A-type altermagnet. By solving the stacking model, we derive all BSAAs for all layer groups and draw three key conclusions: (1) Only 17 layer groups can realize intrinsic A-type altermagnetism. All 2D A-type altermagnets must belong to these 17 layer groups, which will be helpful to search for 2D A-type altermagnet. (2) It is impossible to connect the two sublattices of BSAA using $S_{3z}$ or $S_{6z}$, a constraint that is also applicable to all 2D altermagnets. (3) $C_{2\alpha}$ is a general stacking operation to generate BSAA for an arbitrary monolayer. Our theory not only can explain the previously reported twisted-bilayer altermagnets, but also can provide more possibilities to generate A-type altermagnets. Our research has significantly broadened the range of candidate materials for 2D altermagnets. Based on conclusion (1), the bilayer NiZrCl$_6$ is predicted to exhibit intrinsic A-type altermagnetism. Additionally, we use twisted-bilayer NiCl$_2$, previously reported in the literature, as the second example of BSAA. Furthermore, utilizing symmetry analysis and first-principles calculation, we scrutinize their spin-momentum locking characteristic to substantiate their altermagnetic properties.</description>

      <title>A Feasible Way to Find Above-Room-Temperature Ferromagnetic Spintronic Materials: from Flat Band Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding and designing ferromagnets that operate above room temperature is crucial in advancing high-performance spintronic devices. The pioneering van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ has extended the way for spintronic applications by achieving a record-high Curie temperature among its analogues. However, the physical mechanism of increasing Cuire temperature still needs to be explored. Here, we propose a practical approach to discovering high-temperature ferromagnetic materials for spintronic applications through flat band engineering. We simulate the magnetic transition directly from strongly correlated calculations, reconciling the dual nature of $d$-electrons with both localization and itinerant characters. Significantly, our systematic studies unveil the emergence of quasi-particle flat bands arising from collective many-body excitations preceding the ferromagnetic phase transition, reinforcing magnetic stability through a positive feedback mechanism. This research provides a promising pathway for exploring next-generation spintronic devices utilizing low-dimensional vdW flat band systems.</description>

      <title>Janus MoSSe nanotubes on one-dimensional SWCNT-BNNT van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D Janus TMDC layers with broken mirror symmetry exhibit giant Rashba splitting and unique excitonic behavior. For their 1D counterparts, the Janus nanotubes possess curvature, which introduce an additional degree of freedom to break the structural symmetry. This could potentially enhance these effects or even give rise to novel properties. In addition, Janus MSSe nanotubes (M=W, Mo), with diameters surpassing 4 nm and Se positioned externally, consistently demonstrate lower energy states than their Janus monolayer counterparts. However, there have been limited studies on the preparation of Janus nanotubes, due to the synthesis challenge and limited sample quality. Here we first synthesized MoS2 nanotubes based on SWCNT-BNNT heterostructure and then explored the growth of Janus MoSSe nanotubes from MoS2 nanotubes with the assistance of H2 plasma at room temperature. The successful formation of the Janus structure was confirmed via Raman spectroscopy, and microscopic morphology and elemental distribution of the grown samples were further characterized. The synthesis of Janus MoSSe nanotubes based on SWCNT-BNNT enables the further exploration of novel properties in Janus TMDC nanotubes.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of structural and electronic properties of multiferroic oxide Mn3TeO6 under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mn3TeO6 (MTO) has been experimentally found to adopt a P21/n structure under high pressure, which exhibits a significantly smaller band gap compared to the atmospheric R-3 phase. In this study, we systematically investigate the magnetism, structural phase transition and electronic properties of MTO under high pressure through first-principles calculations. Both R-3 and P21/n phases of MTO are antiferromagnetic at zero temperature. The R-3 phase transforms to the P21/n phase at 7.58 GPa, accompanied by a considerable volume collapse of about 6.47%. Employing the accurate method that combines DFT+U and G0W0, the calculated band gap of R-3 phase at zero pressure is very close to the experimental values, while that of the P21/n phase is significantly overestimated. The main reason for this difference is that the experimental study incorrectly used the Kubelka-Munk plot for the indirect band gap to obtain the band gap of the P21/n phase instead of the Kubelka-Munk plot for the direct band gap. Furthermore, our study reveals that the transition from the R-3 phase to the P21/n phase is accompanied by a slight reduction in the band gap.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Study on the Structural and Thermodynamic Properties of U-He compounds under High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranium is considered as a very important nuclear energy material because of the huge amount of energy released. As the main products of spontaneous decay of uranium, helium is difficult to react with uranium for its chemical inertness. Therefore, bubbles will be formed inside uranium, which could greatly reduce the performance of uranium or cause the safety problems. Additionally, nuclear materials are usually operated in an environment of high-temperature and high-pressure, so it is necessary to figure out the exact state of helium inside uranium at extreme conditions. Here, we explored the structural stability of U-He system under high-pressure and high-temperature by using density functional theory calculations. Two metastable phases are found between 50 and 400 GPa: U4He with space group Fmmm and U6He with space group P-1. Both are metallic and adopt layered structures. Electron localization function calculation combined with charge density difference analysis indicate that there are covalent bonds between U and U atoms in both Fmmm-U4He and P-1-U6He. Compared with the elastic modulus of ${\alpha}$-U, the addition of helium has certain influence on the mechanical properties of uranium. Besides, first-principles molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to study the dynamical behavior of Fmmm-U4He and P-1-U6He at high-temperature. It is found that Fmmm-U4He and P-1-U6He undergo one-dimensional superionic phase transitions at 150 GPa. Our study revealed exotic structure of U-He compounds beyond the form of bubble under high-pressure and high-temperature, that might be relevant to the performance and safety issue of nuclear materials at extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Compliant Lattice Modulations Enable Anomalous Elasticity in Ni-Mn-Ga Martensite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High mobility of twin boundaries in modulated martensites of Ni-Mn-Ga-based ferromagnetic shape memory alloys holds a promise for unique magnetomechanical applications. This feature has not been fully understood so far, and in particular it has yet not been unveiled what makes the lattice mechanics of modulated Ni-Mn-Ga specifically different from other martensitic alloys. Here, results of dedicated laser-ultrasonic measurements on hierarchically twinned five-layer modulated (10 M) crystals fill this gap. Using a combination of transient grating spectroscopy and laser-baser resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, it is confirmed that there is a shear elastic instability in the lattice, being significantly stronger than in any other martensitic material and also than what the first-principles calculations for Ni-Mn-Ga predict. The experimental results reveal that the instability is directly related to the lattice modulations. A lattice-scale mechanism of dynamic faulting of the modulation sequence that explains this behavior is proposed; this mechanism can explain the extraordinary mobility of twin boundaries in 10 M.</description>

      <title>Physical Encoding Improves OOD Performance in Deep Learning Materials Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models have been widely used in materials property prediction with great success, especially for properties with large datasets. However, the out-of-distribution (OOD) performances of such models are questionable, especially when the training set is not large enough. Here we showed that using physical encoding rather than the widely used one-hot encoding can significantly improve the OOD performance by increasing the models' generalization performance, which is especially true for models trained with small datasets. Our benchmark results of both composition- and structure-based deep learning models over six datasets including formation energy, band gap, refractive index, and elastic properties predictions demonstrated the importance of physical encoding to OOD generalization for models trained on small datasets.</description>

      <title>Keldysh tuning of photoluminescence in a lead halide perovskite crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1964, Keldysh laid the groundwork for strong-field physics in atomic, molecular, and solid-state systems by delineating a ubiquitous transition from multiphoton absorption to quantum electron tunneling under intense AC driving forces. While both processes in semiconductors can generate carriers and result in photon emission through electron-hole recombination, the low quantum yields in most materials have hindered direct observation of the Keldysh crossover. Leveraging the large quantum yields of photoluminescence in lead halide perovskites, we show that we can not only induce bright light emission from extreme sub-bandgap light excitation but also distinguish between photon-induced and electric-field-induced processes. Our results are rationalized by the Landau-Dykhne formalism, providing insights into the non-equilibrium dynamics of strong-field light-matter interactions. These findings open new avenues for light upconversion and sub-bandgap photon detection, highlighting the potential of lead halide perovskites in advanced optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Optimizing ionic conductivity of lithium in Li$_7$PS$_6$ argyrodite via dopant engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Li-containing argyrodites represent a promising family of Li-ion conductors with several derived compounds exhibiting room-temperature ionic conductivity &gt; 1 mS/cm and making them attractive as potential candidates as electrolytes in solid-state Li-ion batteries. Starting from the parent phase Li7PS6, several cation and anion substitution strategies have been attempted to increase the conductivity of Li ions. Nonetheless, a detailed understanding of the thermodynamics of native defects and doping of Li argyrodite and their effect on the ionic conductivity of Li is missing. Here, we report a comprehensive computational study of defect chemistry of the parent phase Li7PS6 in both intrinsic and extrinsic regimes, using a newly developed workflow to automate the computations of several defect formation energies in a thermodynamically consistent framework. Our findings agree with known experimental findings, rule out several unfavorable aliovalent dopants, narrowing down the potential promising candidates that can be tested experimentally. We also find that cation-anion co-doping can provide a powerful strategy to further optimize the composition of argyrodite. In particular, Si-F co-doping is predicted to be thermodynamically favorable; this could lead to the synthesis of the first F-doped Li-containing argyrodite. Finally, using DeePMD neural networks, we have mapped the ionic conductivity landscape as function of the concentration of the most promising cation and anion dopants identified from the defect calculations, and identified the most promising region in the compositional space with high Li conductivity that can be explored experimentally.</description>

      <title>Energy Window Muffin Tin Orbitals (EWMTO) within the Atomic Sphere Approximation (ASA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose a new efficient basis for the electronic structure problem. The basis is based on the Muffin Tin Orbital (MTO) idea that the eigenstates of the Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian may we be expanded in terms of eigenstates of the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the so called Muffin Tin (MT) spheres and Bessel functions in the interstitial multiplied by appropriate spherical Harmonics. Here we use the fact that the solution to problem of finding the ground state electron density is most often done through an iterative process, where generically on the order of over 20 iterations are taken till the ground state electron density and energy converges to the lowest values allowed by the correlation and exchange functional for the fixed form of the external potential. We use eigenstate information from the previous convergence iteration to choose the energies of the eigenstates of the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian. Furthermore within the Atomic Sphere Approximation (ASA) the energies of the Bessel functions do not matter as they are cancelled out. This is an efficient method aimed at studying the electronic structure of materials with large unit cells especially if they are of close packed form where ASA is particularly accurate.</description>

      <title>Investigating Metal Dopants for Lowering the Contact Resistance of Top Gold Contacted Monolayer MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interface properties between gold (Au) contacts and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) are critical for optimizing the performance of semiconductor devices. This study investigates the impact of metal dopants (D) on the transport properties of MoS2 devices with top Au contacts, aiming to reduce contact resistance and enhance device performance. Using density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF)- based first-principles calculations, we examine the structural, electronic, and quantum transport properties of Au-contacted, metal-doped MoS2. Our results indicate that Cd, Re, and Ru dopants significantly improve the structural stability and electronic properties of MoS2. Specifically, formation energy calculations show that Cd and Re are stable at hollow sites, while Ru prefers bond sites. Remarkably, Au-Ru-MoS2-based device exhibits tunnel resistance (RT ) up to 4.82 ohm-um. Furthermore, a dual-gated Au-Ru-MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) demonstrates an impressive Ion/Ioff ratio of 10^8 at Vgs of 2 V, highlighting its potential for nano-switching applications.</description>

      <title>Revealing the molecular structures of a-Al2O3(0001)-water interface by machine learning based computational vibrational spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-water interfaces are crucial to many physical and chemical processes and are extensively studied using surface-specific sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy. To establish clear correlations between specific spectral signatures and distinct interfacial water structures, theoretical calculations using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are required. These MD simulations typically need relatively long trajectories (a few nanoseconds) to achieve reliable SFG response function calculations via the dipole-polarizability time correlation function. However, the requirement for long trajectories limits the use of computationally expensive techniques such as ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations, particularly for complex solid-water interfaces. In this work, we present a pathway for calculating vibrational spectra (IR, Raman, SFG) of solid-water interfaces using machine learning (ML)-accelerated methods. We employ both the dipole moment-polarizability correlation function and the surface-specific velocity-velocity correlation function approaches to calculate SFG spectra. Our results demonstrate the successful acceleration of AIMD simulations and the calculation of SFG spectra using ML methods. This advancement provides an opportunity to calculate SFG spectra for the complicated solid-water systems more rapidly and at a lower computational cost with the aid of ML.</description>

      <title>Accurate estimation of interfacial thermal conductance between silicon and diamond enabled by a machine learning interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal management at silicon-diamond interface is critical for advancing high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this study, we calculate the interfacial thermal conductance between silicon and diamond using machine learning (ML) interatomic potentials trained on density functional theory (DFT) data. Using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations, we compute the interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) for various system sizes. Our results show a closer agreement with experimental data than those obtained using traditional semi-empirical potentials such as Tersoff and Brenner which overestimate ITC by a factor of about 3. In addition, we analyze the frequency-dependent heat transfer spectrum, providing insights into the contributions of different phonon modes to the interfacial thermal conductance. The ML potential accurately captures the phonon dispersion relations and lifetimes, in good agreement with DFT calculations and experimental observations. It is shown that the Tersoff potential predicts higher phonon group velocities and phonon lifetimes compared to the DFT results. Furthermore, it predicts higher interfacial bonding strength, which is consistent with higher interfacial thermal conductance as compared to the ML potential. This study highlights the use of the ML interatomic potential to improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of thermal transport simulations in complex material systems.</description>

      <title>Rb2Ti2O5 : a layered ionic conductor at the sub-micrometer scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few years, ionic conductors have gained a lot of attention given the possibility to implement them in various applications such as supercapacitors, batteries or fuel cells as well as for resistive memories. Especially, layered two-dimensional (2D) crystals such as h-BN, graphene oxide and MoSe2 have shown to provide unique properties originating from the specific 2D confinement of moving ions. Two important parameters are the ion conductivity and the chemical stability over a wide range of operating conditions. In this vein, Rb2Ti2O5 has been recently found displaying remarkable properties such as superionic conduction and colossal equivalent dielectric constant. Here, a first approach to the study of the electrical properties of layered Rb2Ti2O5 at the 100-nanometer scale is presented. Characterizations by means of micro-Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements of mechanically exfoliated RTO nanocrystals via the so-called adhesive-tape technique are reported. Finally, the results of electrical measurements performed on an exfoliated RTO nanocrystals are presented, and are found to be consistent with the results obtained on macroscopic crystals. 4</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Enhanced Design of Lead-Free Halide Perovskite Materials Using Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of emerging non-toxic perovskite materials has been undertaken to advance the fabrication of environmentally sustainable lead-free perovskite solar cells. This study introduces a machine learning methodology aimed at predicting innovative halide perovskite materials that hold promise for use in photovoltaic applications. The seven newly predicted materials are as follows: CsMnCl$_4$, Rb$_3$Mn$_2$Cl$_9$, Rb$_4$MnCl$_6$, Rb$_3$MnCl$_5$, RbMn$_2$Cl$_7$, RbMn$_4$Cl$_9$, and CsIn$_2$Cl$_7$. The predicted compounds are first screened using a machine learning approach, and their validity is subsequently verified through density functional theory calculations. CsMnCl$_4$ is notable among them, displaying a bandgap of 1.37 eV, falling within the Shockley-Queisser limit, making it suitable for photovoltaic applications. Through the integration of machine learning and density functional theory, this study presents a methodology that is more effective and thorough for the discovery and design of materials.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Reconsidering the nonlinear emergent inductance: time-varying Joule heating and its impact on the AC electrical response"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When non-collinear spin textures are driven by current, an emergent electric field arises due to the emergent electromagnetic induction. So far, this phenomenon has been reported in several materials, manifesting the current-nonlinear imaginary part of the complex impedance. Recently, Furuta et al. proposed a time-varying temperature increase due to Joule heating as an alternative explanation for these current-nonlinear complex impedances [arXiv:2407.00309v1]. In this study, we re-examine the nonlinear complex impedance in GdRuAl12 and YMn6Sn6, specifically addressing the impact of the time-varying temperature increase. Our findings reveal that the magnetic-field angle, frequency, and temperature dependence of nonlinear complex impedances in these two materials cannot be explained by the time-varying temperature increase. Instead, these dependencies of the imaginary part of the nonlinear impedance are consistent with the expected behaviour in the theory of emergent electromagnetic induction. Moreover, we observe a significant real part of the nonlinear complex impedance, likely resulting from the dissipation associated with the current-driven motion of helices and domain walls. Our findings highlight the diverse current-nonlinear transport phenomena of spin dynamical origin in helimagnets.</description>

      <title>Exciton-polariton stimulated scattering in hybrid halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskites, such as methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr$_3$), host tightly bound three-dimensional excitons which are robust at room temperature. Excellent optical properties of MAPbBr$_3$ allow for designing of optical single-mode waveguides and cavities in the frequency range close to the excitonic transitions. Taken together, this turns MAPbBr$_3$ into an excellent platform for probing exciton-polariton nonlinear phenomena at room temperature. Here we investigate ultrafast non-equilibrium dynamics of polaritons under pulsed fs non-resonant excitation. We demonstrate the presence of the stimulated acoustic phonon-assisted scattering regime above threshold pump fluence, characterized by the explosive growth of emission intensity, a redshift of the emission spectral maximum, spectral narrowing, and sub-picosecond emission dynamics. Our theoretical findings are well confirmed by the results of experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Weight update in ferroelectric memristors with identical and non-identical pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) are a class of memristor which promise low-power, scalable, field-driven analog operation. In order to harness their full potential, operation with identical pulses is targeted. In this paper, several weight update schemes for FTJs are investigated, using either non-identical or identical pulses, and with time delays between the pulses ranging from 1 us to 10 s. Experimentally, a method for achieving non-linear weight update with identical pulses at long programming delays is demonstrated by limiting the switching current via a series resistor. Simulations show that this concept can be expanded to achieve weight update in a 1T1C cell by limiting the switching current through a transistor operating in sub-threshold or saturation mode. This leads to a maximum linearity in the weight update of 87%. The scaling behaviour of this scheme as devices are reduced to the sub-micron range is investigated, and the linearity slightly reduces in scaled devices to a maximum of 81%. The origin of the remaining non-linearity is discussed, as well as how this can be overcome.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Magnetoelectric Effect under Magnetic Octupole Order: Its Application to a $d$-Wave Altermagnet and a Pyrochlore Lattice with All-In/All-Out Magnetic Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive investigation has recently been conducted into a new class of antiferromagnetic order known as magnetic octupole order. This order may be concealed due to its higher-rank multipole, making it difficult to detect and manipulate it by using conventional methods such as the anomalous Hall effect. In this paper, we propose the nonlinear magnetoelectric effect (NMEE) as a technique that can detect and manipulate magnetic octupole order because of identical symmetry constraints. To demonstrate this point, we first classify the magnetic point groups in terms of magnetic multipoles to identify magnets, with the lowest-rank multipoles being magnetic octupoles, and reveal many candidate systems. We then derive the NMEE tensor by using quantum kinetic theory and show its relation to quantum geometric properties. Finally, we calculate the NMEE in two antiferromagnets where the lowest-rank nonvanishing multipole is the magnetic octupole. Specifically, we focus on a $d$-wave altermagnet and a pyrochlore lattice with all-in/all-out magnetic order, revealing an enhancement of the NMEE by Weyl points. Finally, we discuss experimental realization and show that the NMEE has a sizeable value that can be detected by the magneto-optical Kerr effect.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Born Oppenheimer Approximation for Molecules and Materials via Electric Field Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an ab initio method for computing vibro-polariton and phonon-polariton spectra of molecules and solids coupled to the photon modes of optical cavities. We demonstrate that if interactions of cavity photon modes with both nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom are treated on the level of the cavity Born-Oppenheimer approximation (CBOA), spectra can be expressed in terms of the matter response to electric fields and nuclear displacements which are readily available in standard density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) implementations. In this framework, results over a range of cavity parameters can be obtained without the need for additional electronic structure calculations, enabling efficient calculations on a wide range of parameters. Furthermore, this approach enables results to be more readily interpreted in terms of the more familiar cavity-independent molecular electric field response properties, such as polarizability and Born effective charges which enter into the vibro-polariton calculation. Using corresponding electric field response properties of bulk insulating systems, we are also able to obtain $\Gamma$ point phonon-polariton spectra of two dimensional (2D) insulators. Results for a selection of cavity-coupled molecular and 2D crystal systems are presented to demonstrate the method.</description>

      <title>A multi-body finite element model for hydrogel packings: Linear response to shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a multi-body finite element model of a packing of hydrogel particles using the Flory-Rehner constitutive law to model the deformation of the swollen polymer network. We show that while the dependence of the pressure, $\Pi$, on the effective volume fraction, $\phi$, is virtually identical to a monolithic Flory material, the shear modulus, $\mu$, behaves in a non-trivial way. $\mu$ increases monotonically with $\Pi$ from zero and remains below about $80\%$ of the monolithic Flory value at the largest $\Pi$ we study here. The local shear strain in the particles has a large spatial variation. Local strains near the centers of the particles are all roughly equal to the applied shear strain, but the local strains near the contact facets are much smaller and depend on the orientation of the facet. We show that the slip between particles at the facets depends strongly on the orientation of the facet and is, on average, proportional to the component of the applied shear strain resolved onto the facet orientation. This slip screens the stress transmission and results in a reduction of the shear modulus relative to what one would obtain if the particles were welded together at the facet. Surprisingly, given the reduction in the shear modulus arising from the facet slip, and the spatial variations in the local shear strain inside the particles themselves, the deformation of the particle centroids is rather homogeneous with the strains of the Delaunay triangles having fluctuations of only order $\pm 5\%$. These results should open the way to construction of quantitative estimates of the shear modulus in highly compressed packings via mean-field, effective-medium type approaches.</description>

      <title>Charge Density Waves in the 2.5-Dimensional Quantum Heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) and their interplay with correlated and topological quantum states are forefront of condensed matter research. The 4$H_{b}$-TaS$_2$ is a CDW ordered quantum heterostructure that is formed by alternative stacking of Mott insulating 1T-TaS$_2$ and Ising superconducting 1H-TaS$_2$. While the $\sqrt{13}\times\sqrt{13}$ and 3$\times$3 CDWs have been respectively observed in the bulk 1T-TaS$_2$ and 2H-TaS$_2$, the CDWs and their pivotal role for unconventional superconductivity in the 4$H_{b}$-TaS$_2$ remain unsolved. In this letter, we reveal the 2-dimensional (2D) $\sqrt{13}\times\sqrt{13}$ chiral CDW in the 1T-layers and intra-unit cell coupled 2D 2$\times$2 CDW in the 1H and 1H' layers of 4$H_{b}$-TaS$_2$. Our results establish 4$H_{b}$-TaS$_2$ a novel 2.5D quantum heterostructure, where 2D quantum states emerge from 3D crystalline structure.</description>

      <title>Optical Absorption and Emission from Wannier-Stark Spectra of Moir\'{e} Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a formalism based on the non-Abelian Berry connection, we explore quantum geometric signatures of Wannier-Stark spectra in two-dimensional superlattices. The Stark energy can be written as \textit{intraband} Berry phases, while Zener tunneling is given by \textit{interband} Berry connections. We suggest that the gaps induced by interband hybridization can be probed by THz optical absorption and emission spectroscopy. This is especially relevant to modern moir\'{e} materials wherein mini-bands are often spectrally entangled, leading to strong interband hybridization in the Wannier-Stark regime. Furthermore, owing to their large superlattice constants, both the low-field and high-field regimes can be accessed in these materials using presently available technology. Importantly, even at moderate electric fields, we find that stimulated emission can dominate absorption, raising the possibility of lasing at practically relevant parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Electronically Amplified Electron-Phonon Interaction and Metal-Insulator Transition in Perovskite Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relative role of electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions in driving the metal-insulator transition in perovskite nickelates opens a rare window into the non-trivial interplay of the two important degrees of freedom in solids. The most promising solution is to extract the electronic and lattice contributions during the phase transition by performing high-resolution spectroscopy measurements. Here, we present a three-dimensional electronic structure study of Nd1-xSrxNiO3 (x = 0 and 0.175) thin films with unprecedented accuracy, in which the low energy fermiology has a quantitative agreement with model simulations and first-principles calculations. Two characteristic phonons, the octahedral rotational and breathing modes, are illustrated to be coupled with the electron dynamics in the metallic phase, showing a kink structure along the band dispersion, as well as a hump feature in the energy spectrum. Entering the insulating state, the electron-phonon interaction is amplified by strong electron correlations, transforming the mobile large polarons at high temperatures to localized small polarons in the ground state. Moreover, the analysis of quasiparticle residue enables us to establish a transport-spectroscopy correspondence in Nd1-xSrxNiO3 thin films. Our findings demonstrate the essential role of electron-lattice interaction enhanced by the electronic correlation to stabilize the insulating phase in the perovskite nickelates.</description>

      <title>Terahertz antiferromagnetic dynamics induced by ultrafast spin currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insulating antiferromagnets are anticipated as the main protagonists of ultrafast spintronics, with their intrinsic terahertz dynamics and their abililty to transport spin information over long distances. However, direct transfer of spin angular momentum to an antiferromagnetic insulator at picosecond time scales remains to be demonstrated. Here, studying the ultrafast behaviour of ferromagnetic metal/antiferromagnetic insulator bilayers, we evidence the generation of coherent excitations in the antiferromagnet combined with a modulation of the demagnetization behavior of the ferromagnet. This confirms that magnetic information can indeed be propagated into antiferromagnetic spin waves at picosecond timescales, thereby opening an avenue towards ultrafast manipulation of magnetic information.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Electronic and Phononic Thermal Transport Across 2D Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical and thermal transport across material interfaces is key for 2D electronics in semiconductor technology, yet their relationship remains largely unknown. We report a theoretical proposal to separate electronic and phononic contributions to thermal conductance at 2D interfaces, which is validated by non-equilibrium Green's function calculations and molecular dynamics simulations for graphene-gold contacts. Our results reveal that while metal-graphene interfaces are transparent for both electrons and phonons, non-covalent graphene interfaces block electronic tunneling beyond two layers but not phonon transport. This suggests that the Wiedemann-Franz law can be experimentally tested by measuring transport across interfaces with varying graphene layers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To explore what features of multi-dimensional training can be remembered in granular materials, the response of a small, two-dimensional packing of hydrogel spheres to two independent types of shear is measured. Packings are trained via the application of several identical shear cycles, either of a single shear type or combinations of the two types. The memory is then read out using a standard protocol capable of revealing memories as a cusp at the point where readout reaches the training strain. The ability to read out a memory is sensitive not only to the type of deformation applied but also to the order in which different types of training are performed. These results underscore the importance of thinking of memories not as single remembered value (amplitude) but as a learned path through phase space.</description>

      <title>Electron energy-loss spectrum and exciton band structure of ${\mathrm{WSe}}_{2}$ monolayer studied by ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bounded excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers lead to numerous opto-electronic applications, which require a detailed understanding of the exciton dynamics. The dynamical properties of excitons with finite momentum transfer $\textbf{Q}$ can be investigated experimentally using electron energy-loss (EEL) spectroscopy. The EEL spectrum depends on the response function of the material which in turn is determined by the exciton energies and eigenvectors in the exciton band structure. In this work, we utilize ab initio density-functional theory plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (DFT+BSE) approach to explore the exciton band structure and also $\textbf{Q}$-resolved EEL spectrum in monolayer ${\mathrm{WSe}}_{2}$. In particular, we carefully examine the discrepancies and connections among the existing EEL spectrum formulas for quasi-two-dimensional (2D) systems, and establish a proper definition of the EEL spectrum, which is then used to calculate the EEL spectra of monolayer ${\mathrm{WSe}}_{2}$. We find that remarkably, the dispersion of the calculated lowest-energy EELS peaks for the in-plane momentum transfer follows almost precisely the non-parabolic upper band of the lowest bright A exciton, and also agrees well with the previous experiment. Furthermore, we show that only the bright exciton with its electric dipole being parallel to the direction of the transfered momentum is excited, i.e., EEL spectroscopy selectively probes bright exciton bands. This explains why only the upper band of the A exciton, which is a longitudinal exciton with an in-plane dipole moment, was observed in the previous experiment. Our findings will stimulate further EEL experiments to measure other branches of the exciton band structure, such as the parabolic lower band of the A exciton, and hence will lead to a better understanding of the exciton dynamics in quasi-2D materials.</description>

      <title>Holographic nature of critical quantum states of proteins</title>

Abstract: The Anderson metal-insulator transition is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics, describing the transition from a conducting (metallic) to a non-conducting (insulating) state driven by disorder in a material. At the critical point of the Anderson transition, wave functions exhibit multifractal behavior, and energy levels display a universal distribution, indicating non-trivial correlations in the eigenstates. Recent studies have shown that proteins, traditionally considered as insulators, exhibit much higher conductivity than previously assumed. In this paper, we investigate several proteins known for their efficient electron transport properties. We compare their energy level statistics, eigenfunction correlation, and electron return probability to those expected in metallic, insulating, or critical states. Remarkably, these proteins exhibit properties of critically disordered metals in their natural state without any parameter adjustment. Their composition and geometry are self-organized into the critical state of the Anderson transition, and their fractal properties are universal and unique among critical systems. Our findings suggest that proteins' wave functions fulfill "holographic" area laws, and the correlation fractal dimension is precisely $d_2=2$.</description>

      <title>Exotic Nd 4f electron magnetism in Nd2RhSi3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compound, Nd2PdSi3, belonging to R2PdSi3 family (R = rare-earths) has been known to exhibit exotic behavior due to unusual Nd 4f hybridization. Here, we study the electronic properties of Nd2RhSi3 employing ac and dc magnetization, heat-capacity, electrical resistivity and magnetoresistance measurements, as Nd 4f hybridization is expected to be slightly different due to the changes in the 4d element. The experimental results establish that, like the Pd analogue, this compound also exhibits ferromagnetic ordering at a rather high temperature of 16.5 K, unlike many other rare-earth members of this family which are antiferromagnetic, with a complex magnetism at further lower temperatures (less than 10 K). There are differences in the measured properties with respect to the Pd analogue, the most important one being the observation of spin-glass features at a temperature significantly higher than the Curie temperature. This is attributed to a gradual evolution of cluster magnetism with decreasing temperature. We infer that the changes in Nd 4f hybridization due to Rh 4d (instead of Pd 4d) plays a role in some fashion for such differences. These properties are attributed to the competing magnetic ground states due to geometrical frustration arising out of triangular arrangement of Nd ions with a bond disorder.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Picophotonics of Crystalline Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanophotonics, which deals with the study of light-matter interaction at scales smaller than the wavelength of radiation, has widespread applications from plasmonic waveguiding, topological photonic crystals, super-lensing, solar absorbers, and infrared imaging. The physical phenomena governing these effects can be captured by using a macroscopic homogenized quantity called the refractive index. However, the lattice-level description of optical waves in a crystalline material using a quantum theory has long been unresolved. Inspired by the dynamics of electron waves and their corresponding band structure, here, we put forth a pico-optical band theory of solids which reveals waves hidden deep within a crystal lattice. We show that these hidden waves arise from optical pico-indices, a family of quantum functions obeying crystal symmetries, and cannot be described by the conventional concept of refractive index. We present for the first time - the hidden waves and pico-optical band structure of 14 distinct materials. We choose Si, Ge, InAs, GaAs, CdTe, and others from Group IV, III-V, and II-VI due to their technological relevance but our framework is readily applicable to a wide range of emerging 2D and 3D materials. In stark contrast to the macroscopic refractive index of these materials used widely today, this picophotonic framework shows that hidden waves exist throughout the crystal lattice and have unique pico-polarization texture and crowding. We also present an open-source software package, Purdue-PicoMax, for the research community to discover hidden waves in new materials like hBN, graphene, and Moire materials. Our work establishes a foundational crystallographic feature to discover novel pico-optical waves in light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Crystalline forsterite to 160 GPa: the striking metastability of one of Universe's most abundant minerals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among Universe's most consequential events are large impacts generating rapidly-evolving extreme pressures and temperatures. Crystalline and amorphous forms of (Mg, Fe)2SiO4 are abundant and widespread, within planets and in space. The behavior of these minerals is expected to deviate form thermodynamic equilibrium in many of the processes that are critical to the formation and evolution of planets, particularly shock events. To further the understanding of the behavior of the silicate under extreme conditions, we statically compressed a crystal of forsterite up to 160.5 GPa, far beyond the compound's stability field, and probed its long-range ordering with synchrotron microdiffraction. We found that forsterite retains long-range ordering up to the highest pressure reached. Forsterite III, emerging at about 58 GPa, persists in compression to 160.5 GPa and in decompression down to about 13 GPa, for a rare combined occurrence of a metastable phase of nearly 150 GPa. These observations dispute earlier reports of pressure-induced amorphization and are a unique testimony of the resilience of the crystalline state in quasi hydrostatic compression. We confirm that highly disordered forsterite can be obtained from the decompression of forsterite III as suggested from the substantial loss of long-range ordering observed at 7 GPa after further decompression. Such kinetic pathway may explain how synthetic olivine glass have been obtained in shock experiments and could be a mechanism of generation of amorphous forsterite in cosmic dust. The 120 GPa Hugoniot discontinuity finds no correspondence in our data, marking a departure from the parallelism between static "cold compression" and dynamic compression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of minimizers of perturbed Dirichlet energies supported on a wire generated by a regular simple curve $\gamma$ and defined in the space of $\mathbb{S}^2$-valued functions. The perturbation $K$ is represented by a matrix-valued function defined on $\mathbb{S}^2$ with values in $\mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$. Under natural regularity conditions on $K$, we show that the family of perturbed Dirichlet energies converges, in the sense of $\Gamma$-convergence, to a simplified energy functional on $\gamma$. The reduced energy unveils how part of the antisymmetric exchange interactions contribute to an anisotropic term whose specific shape depends on the curvature of $\gamma$.
  We also discuss the significant implications of our results for studies of ferromagnetic nanowires when Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is present.</description>

      <title>Text-to-Battery Recipe: A language modeling-based protocol for automatic battery recipe extraction and retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have increasingly applied natural language processing (NLP) to automatically extract experimental research data from the extensive battery materials literature. Despite the complex process involved in battery manufacturing -- from material synthesis to cell assembly -- there has been no comprehensive study systematically organizing this information. In response, we propose a language modeling-based protocol, Text-to-Battery Recipe (T2BR), for the automatic extraction of end-to-end battery recipes, validated using a case study on batteries containing LiFePO4 cathode material. We report machine learning-based paper filtering models, screening 2,174 relevant papers from the keyword-based search results, and unsupervised topic models to identify 2,876 paragraphs related to cathode synthesis and 2,958 paragraphs related to cell assembly. Then, focusing on the two topics, two deep learning-based named entity recognition models are developed to extract a total of 30 entities -- including precursors, active materials, and synthesis methods -- achieving F1 scores of 88.18% and 94.61%. The accurate extraction of entities enables the systematic generation of 165 end-toend recipes of LiFePO4 batteries. Our protocol and results offer valuable insights into specific trends, such as associations between precursor materials and synthesis methods, or combinations between different precursor materials. We anticipate that our findings will serve as a foundational knowledge base for facilitating battery-recipe information retrieval. The proposed protocol will significantly accelerate the review of battery material literature and catalyze innovations in battery design and development.</description>

      <title>Retinomorphic Feature Detection and Machine Vision in a Network Laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological vision systems seamlessly integrate feature-sensitive spatial processing and strong nonlinearity. The retina performs feature detection via ganglion cells, which nonlinearly enhance image features such as edges through lateral inhibition processes between neighbouring cells. As demand for specialised machine learning hardware increases, physical systems are sought which combine feature detection with the nonlinear processing required for tasks such as image classification. Currently, physical machine vision schemes detect features linearly, then employ separate digital systems for subsequent nonlinear activation. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' machine vision platform using a semiconductor network laser. The system hosts many spatially-overlapping lasing modes which detect multiple image features in parallel via their lasing amplitude. Integrated nonlinearity is provided by antagonistic competition for gain between modes - a photonic analogue of the lateral inhibition in retinal cells. Detected feature maps are fed back through the system, providing multi-layer image classification with intrinsic nonlinear processing. Accuracies of 98.05% and 87.85% are achieved for MNIST digits and Fashion-MNIST tasks respectively.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic magnetic interactions in a candidate Kitaev spin liquid close to a metal-insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Kitaev honeycomb model, spins coupled by strongly-frustrated anisotropic interactions do not order at low temperature but instead form a quantum spin liquid with spin fractionalization into Majorana fermions and static fluxes. The realization of such a model in crystalline materials could lead to major breakthroughs in understanding entangled quantum states, however achieving this in practice is a very challenging task. The recently synthesized honeycomb material RuI$_3$ shows no long-range magnetic order down to the lowest probed temperatures and has been theoretically proposed as a quantum spin liquid candidate material on the verge of an insulator to metal transition. Here we report a comprehensive study of the magnetic anisotropy in un-twinned single crystals via torque magnetometry and detect clear signatures of strongly anisotropic and frustrated magnetic interactions. We attribute the development of sawtooth and six-fold torque signal to strongly anisotropic, bond-dependent magnetic interactions by comparing to theoretical calculations. As a function of magnetic field strength at low temperatures, torque shows an unusual non-parabolic dependence suggestive of a proximity to a field-induced transition. Thus, RuI$_3$, without signatures of long-range magnetic order, displays key hallmarks of an exciting new candidate for extended Kitaev magnetism with enhanced quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of the zigzag order in the Kitaev honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kitaev materials often order magnetically at low temperatures due to the presence of non-Kitaev interactions. Torque magnetometry is a very sensitive technique for probing the magnetic anisotropy, which is critical in understanding the magnetic ground state. In this work, we report detailed single-crystal torque measurements in the proposed Kitaev candidate honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$, which displays zigzag order below 34 K. Based on angular-dependent torque studies in magnetic fields up to 16 T rotated in the plane normal to the honeycomb layers, we find an easy-plane anisotropy with a temperature dependence of the torque amplitude following closely the behaviour of the powder magnetic susceptibility. The torque for field rotated in the honeycomb plane has a clear six-fold periodicity with a saw-tooth shape, reflecting the three-fold symmetry of the crystal structure and stabilization of different zigzag domains depending on the field orientation, with a torque amplitude that follows an order parameter form inside the zigzag phase. By comparing experimental data with theoretical calculations we identify the relevant anisotropic interactions and the role of the competition between different zigzag domains in this candidate Kitaev material.</description>

      <title>A backgate for enhanced tunability of holes in planar germanium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planar semiconductor heterostructures offer versatile device designs and are promising candidates for scalable quantum computing. Notably, heterostructures based on strained germanium have been extensively studied in recent years, with emphasis on their strong and tunable spin-orbit interaction, low effective mass, and high hole mobility. However, planar systems are still limited by the fact that the shape of the confinement potential is directly related to the density. In this work, we present the successful implementation of a backgate for a planar germanium heterostructure. The backgate, in combination with a topgate, enables independent control over the density and the electric field, which determines important state properties such as the effective mass, the $g$-factor and the quantum lifetime. This unparalleled degree of control paves the way towards engineering qubit properties and facilitates the targetted tuning of bilayer quantum wells, which promise denser qubit packing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for Phonon Scattering Effects on Thermal Conductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations have demonstrated that multi-phonon scattering processes substantially influence the thermal conductivity of materials, posing significant computational challenges for classical simulations as the complexity of phonon modes escalates. This study examines the potential of quantum simulations to address these challenges, utilizing Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum era (NISQ) quantum computational capabilities and quantum error mitigation techniques to optimize thermal conductivity calculations. Employing the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, we simulate phonon-phonon contributions based on the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). Our methodology involves mapping multi-phonon scattering systems to fermionic spin operators, necessitating the creation of a customized ansatz to balance circuit accuracy and depth. We construct the system within Fock space using bosonic operators and transform the Hamiltonian into the sum of Pauli operators suitable for quantum computation. By addressing the impact of non-unitary noise effects, we benchmark the noise influence and implement error mitigation strategies to develop a more efficient model for quantum simulations in the NISQ era.</description>

Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials have revolutionized materials modeling at the atomic scale. Thanks to these, it is now indeed possible to perform simulations of \abinitio quality over very large time and length scales. More recently, various universal machine-learning models have been proposed as an out-of-box approach avoiding the need to train and validate specific potentials for each particular material of interest. In this paper, we review and evaluate five different universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs), all based on graph neural network architectures which have demonstrated transferability from one chemical system to another. The evaluation procedure relies on data both from a recent verification study of density-functional-theory implementations and from the Materials Project. Through this comprehensive evaluation, we aim to provide guidance to materials scientists in selecting suitable models for their specific research problems, offer recommendations for model selection and optimization, and stimulate discussion on potential areas for improvement in current machine-learning methodologies in materials science.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Peridynamic Neural Operators: Discover Biotissue Constitutive Law and Microstructure From Digital Image Correlation Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human tissues are highly organized structures with collagen fiber arrangements varying from point to point. Anisotropy of the tissue arises from the natural orientation of the fibers, resulting in location-dependent anisotropy. Heterogeneity also plays an important role in tissue function. It is therefore critical to discover and understand the distribution of fiber orientations from experimental mechanical measurements such as digital image correlation (DIC) data. To this end, we introduce the Heterogeneous Peridynamic Neural Operator (HeteroPNO) approach for data-driven constitutive modeling of heterogeneous anisotropic materials. Our goal is to learn a nonlocal constitutive law together with the material microstructure, in the form of a heterogeneous fiber orientation field, from load-displacement field measurements. We propose a two-phase learning approach. Firstly, we learn a homogeneous constitutive law in the form of a neural network-based kernel function and a nonlocal bond force, to capture complex homogeneous material responses from data. Then, in the second phase we reinitialize the learnt bond force and the kernel function, and training them together with a fiber orientation field for each material point. Owing to the state-based peridynamic skeleton, our HeteroPNO-learned material models are objective and have the balance of linear and angular momentum guaranteed. Moreover, the effects from heterogeneity and nonlinear constitutive relationship are captured by the kernel function and the bond force respectively, enabling physical interpretability. As a result, our HeteroPNO architecture can learn a constitutive model for a biological tissue with anisotropic heterogeneous response undergoing large deformation regime. Moreover, the framework is capable to provide displacement and stress field predictions for new and unseen loading instances.</description>

Abstract: Efros-Shklovskii (ES) Coulomb gap in density of localized states and ES law of the variable range hopping conductivity were coined 50 years ago. The theory and its first confirmations were reviewed in our monograph 40-years ago. This paper reviews the subsequent experimental evidence, theoretical advancements, and novel applications. Out of hundreds of experimental validations of the ES law in a diverse range of materials, I focus on those where the dynamic range of conductivity exceeds four orders of magnitude. These include three- and two-dimensional semiconductors under both zero and high magnetic fields, localized phases in the quantum Hall effect, granular metals, nanocrystal arrays, and conducting polymers. Additionally, this review discusses the Coulomb gap near insulator-metal transition and in non-ohmic ES law. Recent developments of other concepts of the ES book are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to compute the radial distribution function of liquid CO2 at 250 K and 50 bar and its expansion coefficients by spherical harmonics as a function of intermolecular distance up to 20 angstroms for all possible combinations of angular indices l, l prime, and m less than or equal to 8, in contrast to past works of limited combinations. The positions and orientations of CO2 molecules were determined by pressure-constant Monte Carlo simulation using a Kihara potential model. It was found that the radial distribution function had an intense peak at 4.05 angstroms and a broad band at around 7.85 angstroms. The expansion coefficients had prominent structures below approximately 7.5 angstroms, showing positive and/or negative peaks, which indicated that the orientational correlations of the central molecule were intense with the molecules present in that region. It was also found that the peaks of some expansion coefficients were not small even when l = 8. Furthermore, molecular orientations had a tendency to orient along one direction presumably because of the linear form of CO2 molecule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding of bonding is key to modelling materials and predicting properties thereof. A widely adopted indicator of bonds and atomic shells is the electron localization function (ELF). The building blocks of the ELF are also used in the construction of modern density functional approximations. Here we demonstrate that the ELF breaks down when applied beyond regular non-relativistic quantum states. We show that for tackling general non-collinear open-shell solutions, it is essential to address both the U(1) gauge invariance -- i.e., invariance under a multiplication by a position dependent phase factor -- and SU(2) gauge invariance -- i.e. invariance under local spin rotations -- {\em conjointly}. Remarkably, we find that the extended ELF also improves the description of paradigmatic collinear states.</description>

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of ice, a molecular-resolution image of ice crystallized from liquid water or the resulting defect structure has never been obtained. Here, we report the stabilization and angstrom-resolution electron imaging of ice Ih crystallized from liquid water. We combine lattice mapping with molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that ice formation is highly tolerant to nanoscale defects such as misoriented subdomains and trapped gas bubbles, which are stabilized by molecular-scale structural motifs. Importantly, bubble surfaces adopt low-energy nanofacets and create negligible strain fields in the surrounding crystal. These bubbles can dynamically nucleate, grow, migrate, dissolve, and coalesce under electron irradiation and be monitored in situ near a steady state. This work opens the door to understanding water crystallization behaviors at an unprecedented spatial resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10818v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion in a two-phase system is a classical problem discussed in the literature. The general solution of the one-dimensional case to this problem is revisited and a detailed derivation is proposed. The solution is discussed in relationship with ion exchange in silicate glasses. The general solution is compared with the complementary error function (erfc) solution and the assumptions under which the general solution reduces to the erfc are identified. Interface or glass surface issues related to ion exchange are discussed in terms of the ratio between the diffusion coefficients of the diffusing alkali ions in the glass and in the ion reservoir phases respectively. Another relevant issue can be identified in the assumption of instantaneous equilibrium at the two-phase interface once the contact is established. Even though this last assumption is somehow unphysical it is the common approach used in the technological application of ion exchange in silicate glass which is justified when the contact time (immersion time) of glass with an ion reservoir is much larger than the time to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium at the surface.</description>

      <title>In-situ Analysis of the Effect of Residual fcc Phase and Special Grain Boundaries on the Deformation Dynamics in Pure Cobalt</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polycrystalline hcp metals - an important class of engineering materials - typically exhibit complex plasticity because of a limited number of slip systems. Among these metals, deformation is even more complicated in cobalt as it commonly contains residual fcc phase due to the incomplete martensitic fcc$\rightarrow$hcp transformation upon cooling. In this work, we employ a combination of in-situ (acoustic emission, AE) and ex-situ (scanning electron microscopy, SEM) techniques in order to examine deformation dynamics in pure polycrystalline cobalt varying in grain size and the content of residual fcc phase prepared using systematic thermal treatment and cycling. We reveal that the presence of the fcc phase and special ~71{\deg} grain boundaries between different hcp martensite variants brings about higher deformability and strength. The fcc phase provides additional slip systems and also accommodates deformation via the stress-induced fcc$\rightarrow$hcp transformation during loading. On the other hand, special boundaries enhance structural integrity and suppress the formation of critical defects. Both these non-trivial effects can dominate over the influence of grain size, being a traditional microstructural variable. The ex-situ SEM experiments further reveal that the stress-induced fcc$\rightarrow$hcp transformation is sluggish and only partial even at high strains, and it does not give rise to detectable AE signals, unlike in other materials exhibiting martensitic transformation. In turn, these insights into cobalt plasticity provide new avenues for the microstructure and performance optimization towards the desired applications through the modern concept of grain boundary engineering.</description>

      <title>Proton Tunneling: A New Insight into Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer in Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is the key step for energy conversion in electrocatalysis. Atomic-scale simulation acts as an indispensable tool to provide a microscopic understanding of PCET. However, consideration of the quantum nature of transferring protons under an exact grand canonical (GC) constant potential condition is a great challenge for theoretical electrocatalysis. Here, we develop a unified computational framework to explicitly treat nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) by a sufficient GC sampling, further assisted by a machine learning force field adapted for electrochemical conditions. Our work demonstrates a non-negligible impact of NQEs on PCET simulations for hydrogen evolution reaction at room temperature, and provides a physical picture that wave-like quantum characteristic of the transferring protons facilitates the particles to tunnel through classical barriers in PCET paths, leading to a remarkable activation energy reduction compared to classical simulations. Moreover, the physical insight of proton tunneling may reshape our fundamental understanding of other types of PCET reactions in broader scenarios of energy conversion processes.</description>

      <title>First-principles exploration of superconductivity in intercalated bilayer borophene phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the emergence of phonon-mediated superconductivity in bilayer borophenes by controlled intercalation with elements from the groups of alkali, alkaline-earth, and transition metals, using systematic first-principles and Eliashberg calculations. We show that the superconducting properties are primarily governed by the interplay between the out-of-plane ($p_{z}$) boron states and the partially occupied in-plane ($s+p_{x,y}$) bonding states at the Fermi level. Our Eliashberg calculations indicate that intercalation with alkaline-earth elements leads to the highest superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{c}$). Specifically, Be in $\delta_{4}$, Mg in $\chi_{3}$, and Ca in the kagome bilayer borophene demonstrate superior performance with $T_{c}$ reaching up to 58~K. Our study therefore reveals that intercalated bilayer borophene phases are not only more resilient to chemical deterioration, but also harbor enhanced $T_{c}$ values compared to their monolayer counterparts, underscoring their substantial potential for the development of boron-based two-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Alternating Bias Assisted Annealing of Amorphous Oxide Tunnel Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a transformational technique for controllably tuning the electrical properties of fabricated thermally oxidized amorphous aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions. Using conventional test equipment to apply an alternating bias to a heated tunnel barrier, giant increases in the room temperature resistance, greater than 70%, can be achieved. The rate of resistance change is shown to be strongly temperature-dependent, and is independent of junction size in the sub-micron regime. In order to measure their tunneling properties at mK temperatures, we characterized transmon qubit junctions treated with this alternating-bias assisted annealing (ABAA) technique. The measured frequencies follow the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation between the shifted resistance and critical current. Further, these studies show a reduction of junction-contributed loss on the order of $\approx 2 \times10^{-6}$, along with a significant reduction in resonant- and off-resonant-two level system defects when compared to untreated samples. Imaging with high-resolution TEM shows that the barrier is still predominantly amorphous with a more uniform distribution of aluminum coordination across the barrier relative to untreated junctions. This new approach is expected to be widely applicable to a broad range of devices that rely on amorphous aluminum oxide, as well as the many other metal-insulator-metal structures used in modern electronics.</description>

      <title>Tunable transport in bi-disperse porous materials with vascular structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study transport in synthetic, bi-disperse porous structures, with arrays of microchannels interconnected by a nanoporous layer. These structures are inspired by the xylem tissue in vascular plants, in which sap water travels from the roots to the leaves to maintain hydration and carry micronutrients. We experimentally evaluate transport in three conditions: high pressure-driven flow, spontaneous imbibition, and transpiration-driven flow. The latter case resembles the situation in a living plant, where bulk liquid water is transported upwards in a metastable state (negative pressure), driven by evaporation in the leaves; here we report stable, transpiration-driven flows down to $\sim -15$ MPa of driving force. By varying the shape of the microchannels, we show that we can tune the rate of these transport processes in a predictable manner, using a simple analytical (effective medium) approach and numerical simulations of the flow field in the bi-disperse media. We also show that the spontaneous imbibition behavior of a single structure - with fixed geometry - can behave very differently depending on its preparation (filled with air, vs. evacuated), because of a dramatic change in the conductance of vapor in the microchannels; this change offers a second way to tune the rate of transport in bi-disperse, xylem-like structures, by switching between air-filled and evacuated states.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced non-reciprocal magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05957</link>

Abstract: Out of equilibrium, the action-reaction symmetry of the interactions is often broken, leading to the emergence of various collective phenomena with no equilibrium counterparts. Although ubiquitous in classical active systems, implementing such non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems has remained challenging, as the known quantum schemes require precise control over the system on a single-site level. Here, we propose a novel dissipation-engineering protocol to induce non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state platforms with light, which we expect to be achievable with state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Focusing on magnetic metals for concreteness, we show microscopically that a light injection that introduces the decay channel to a virtually excited state gives rise to non-reciprocal interactions between localized spins. One can even realize a situation where spin A tries to align with spin B but the B tries the opposite, resulting in a chase-and-runaway dynamics. Applying our scheme to layered ferromagnets, we show that a non-reciprocal phase transition from a static to a many-body time-dependent chiral phase emerges. Our work paves the way to bring solid-state systems to the realm of non-reciprocal science, providing yet another possibility to control quantum matter with light.</description>

      <title>Role of symmetry in the correlated orientational disordered phase of entropic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The crystalline solids with lack of orientational ordering serve the purpose of studying the disordered systems with many fundamental applications in contemporary research. Despite the orientational disorder, the constituent particles sometime follow some conserved laws or correlation while maintaining the translational order depicted by the crystal structure. Such phase is called ``correlated orientational disordered'' phase in the crystal. Polyhedral particles in the presence of hard-core interaction provide a great opportunity to study the orientational order and disorder in entropy driven self-assembly. We report the computational evidence of the role of symmetry of the polyhedral particles and cubic crystalline structures exhibiting the correlated disordered phases, which are obtained from the simulations of single-component systems. The point groups of the particle and crystal structure appear to be directly connected with the existence of multiple unique orientations satisfying a few other orientational features. In this phase, the systems exhibit orientationally frozen states at sufficiently higher packing fractions and discrete orientational hopping at comparatively lower ones while all the signatures of the correlation are preserved. This symmetry relationship appears to control all the aspects of orientational correlation in the crystalline solids which might be useful to draw fundamental insights about the disordered phases with orientational correlation as well as designing the disorder in the crystals.</description>

      <title>Atomic Decompositions of Periodic Electronic-Structure Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new theory for partitioning simulations of periodic and solid-state systems into physically sound atomic contributions at the level of Kohn-Sham density functional theory. Our theory is based on spatially localized linear combinations of crystalline Gaussian-type orbitals and, as such, capable of exposing local features within periodic electronic structures in a more intuitive and robust manner than alternatives based on the spatial distribution of atomic basis functions alone. Early decomposed cohesive energies of both molecular polymers and different crystalline polymorphs demonstrate how the atomic properties yielded by our theory convincingly align with the expected charge polarization in these systems, also whenever partial charges and Madelung energies may lend themselves somewhat ambiguous to interpretation.</description>

      <title>Complementary two dimensional carrier profiles of 4H-SiC MOSFETs by Scanning Spreading Resistance Microscopy and Scanning Capacitance Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reports the results presented in an invited poster during the International Conference on Silicon Carbide and Related Materials (ICSCRM) 2023 held in Sorrento, Italy. The suitability of scanning probe methods based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements is explored to investigate with high spatial resolution the elementary cell of 4H-SiC power MOSFETs. The two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional maps demonstrated a high spatial resolution of about 5 nm using the SSRM capabilities. Furthermore, the SCM capabilities enabled visualizing the fluctuations of charge carrier concentration across the different parts of the MOSFETs elementary cell.</description>
