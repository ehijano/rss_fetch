      <title>Earth, a planetary PCR machine to create life, or the brief history of a tRNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About 4 billion years ago, the Earth probably fulfilled the environmental conditions necessary to favour the transition from primitive chemistry to life. Based on a theoretical hairpin duplication origin of tRNAs and their putative peptide-coding capability before ribosomes existed, here I postulate that, at this hypothetical environment, Earth's daily temperature cycles could have provided a unique planetary thermocycler to create self-replicating RNA hairpins that simultaneously templated amino acids polymerization in a primordial PCR well of prebiotic molecules. This early RNA hairpin-peptide interaction could have established a reciprocal nucleopeptide replicator that paved the way for catalytic translation and replication machineries towards the origin of LUCA.</description>

      <title>Optimal disk packing of chloroplasts in plant cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photosynthesis is vital for the survival of entire ecosystems on Earth. While light is fundamental to this process, excessive exposure can be detrimental to plant cells. Chloroplasts, the photosynthetic organelles, actively move in response to light and self-organize within the cell to tune light absorption. These disk-shaped motile organelles must balance dense packing for enhanced light absorption under dim conditions with spatial rearrangements to avoid damage from excessive light exposure. Here, we reveal that the packing characteristics of chloroplasts within plant cells show signatures of optimality. Combining measurements of chloroplast densities and three-dimensional cell shape in the water plant Elodea densa, we construct an argument for optimal cell shape versus chloroplast size to achieve two targets: dense packing into a two-dimensional monolayer for optimal absorption under dim light conditions and packing at the sidewalls for optimal light avoidance. We formalize these constraints using a model for random close packing matched with packing simulations of polydisperse hard disks confined within rectangular boxes. The optimal cell shape resulting from these models corresponds closely to that measured in the box-like plant cells, highlighting the importance of particle packing in the light adaptation of plants. Understanding the interplay between structure and function sheds light on how plants achieve efficient photo adaptation. It also highlights a broader principle: how cell shape relates to the optimization of packing finite and relatively small numbers of organelles under confinement. This universal challenge in biological systems shares fundamental features with the mechanics of confined granular media and the jamming transitions in dense active and passive systems across various scales and contexts.</description>

      <title>Generalized, sublethal damage-based mathematical approach for improved modeling of clonogenic survival curve flattening upon hyperthermia, radiotherapy, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling can offer valuable insights into the behavior of biological systems upon treatment. Different mathematical models have been designed to predict the efficacy of hyperthermia (HT), radiotherapy (RT), or their combination. However, approaches capable of modeling cell survival from shared general principles for both mono-treatments and their co-application are rare. Moreover, some cell cultures show dose-dependent saturation in response to HT or RT, manifesting in survival curve flattening. An advanced survival model must, therefore, appropriately reflect such behavior. We propose a mathematical approach to model the effect of both treatments based on the general principle of sublethal damage (SLD) accumulation for the induction of cell death and irreversible proliferation arrest. Our approach extends Jung's model on heat-induced cellular inactivation by incorporating dose-dependent recovery rates that delineate changes in SLD restoration. The resulting unified model (Umodel) accurately describes HT and RT survival outcomes, applies to simultaneous thermoradiotherapy modeling, and is particularly suited to reproduce survival curve flattening phenomena. We demonstrate the Umodel's robust performance (R2&gt;0.95) based on numerous clonogenic survival datasets from the literature and experiments. The proposed Umodel allows the use of a single mathematical function based on generalized SLD accumulation principles with implemented radiosensitization, regardless of energy type or mechanism of action. It reproduces various clonogenic survival curve patterns, including flattening, thus encompassing treatment variability and potentially better reflecting tumor responses. Our approach opens options for further model development and therapy outcome predictions of sequential treatments in different orders and recovery intervals.</description>

      <title>Latency correction in sparse neuronal spike trains with overlapping global events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: In Kreuz et al., J Neurosci Methods 381, 109703 (2022) two methods were proposed that perform latency correction, i.e., optimize the spike time alignment of sparse neuronal spike trains with well defined global spiking events. The first one based on direct shifts is fast but uses only partial latency information, while the other one makes use of the full information but relies on the computationally costly simulated annealing. Both methods reach their limits and can become unreliable when successive global events are not sufficiently separated or even overlap.
  New Method: Here we propose an iterative scheme that combines the advantages of the two original methods by using in each step as much of the latency information as possible and by employing a very fast extrapolation direct shift method instead of the much slower simulated annealing.
  Results: We illustrate the effectiveness and the improved performance, measured in terms of the relative shift error, of the new iterative scheme not only on simulated data with known ground truths but also on single-unit recordings from two medial superior olive neurons of a gerbil.
  Comparison with Existing Method(s): The iterative scheme outperforms the existing approaches on both the simulated and the experimental data. Due to its low computational demands, and in contrast to simulated annealing, it can also be applied to very large datasets.
  Conclusions: The new method generalizes and improves on the original method both in terms of accuracy and speed. Importantly, it is the only method that allows to disentangle global events with overlap.</description>
