      <title>A Geometric Graph-Based Deep Learning Model for Drug-Target Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In structure-based drug design, accurately estimating the binding affinity between a candidate ligand and its protein receptor is a central challenge. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, have demonstrated superior performance over traditional empirical and physics-based methods for this task, enabled by the growing availability of structural and experimental affinity data. In this work, we introduce DeepGGL, a deep convolutional neural network that integrates residual connections and an attention mechanism within a geometric graph learning framework. By leveraging multiscale weighted colored bipartite subgraphs, DeepGGL effectively captures fine-grained atom-level interactions in protein-ligand complexes across multiple scales. We benchmarked DeepGGL against established models on CASF-2013 and CASF-2016, where it achieved state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across diverse evaluation metrics. To further assess robustness and generalization, we tested the model on the CSAR-NRC-HiQ dataset and the PDBbind v2019 holdout set. DeepGGL consistently maintained high predictive accuracy, highlighting its adaptability and reliability for binding affinity prediction in structure-based drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Driven Peptide Classification in Biological Nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A device capable of performing real time classification of proteins in a clinical setting would allow for inexpensive and rapid disease diagnosis. One such candidate for this technology are nanopore devices. These devices work by measuring a current signal that arises when a protein or peptide enters a nanometer-length-scale pore. Should this current be uniquely related to the structure of the peptide and its interactions with the pore, the signals can be used to perform identification. While such a method would allow for real time identification of peptides and proteins in a clinical setting, to date, the complexities of these signals limit their accuracy. In this work, we tackle the issue of classification by converting the current signals into scaleogram images via wavelet transforms, capturing amplitude, frequency, and time information in a modality well-suited to machine learning algorithms. When tested on 42 peptides, our method achieved a classification accuracy of ~$81\,\%$, setting a new state-of-the-art in the field and taking a step toward practical peptide/protein diagnostics at the point of care. In addition, we demonstrate model transfer techniques that will be critical when deploying these models into real hardware, paving the way to a new method for real-time disease diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. More broadly, fluorescent proteins emerge as tractable model systems for probing evolutionary pressures on chromoprotein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling may extend coherence time into the regime required for ultrafast gate operations, suggesting fluorescent protein dimers as a viable platform for bio-inspired qubits.</description>
