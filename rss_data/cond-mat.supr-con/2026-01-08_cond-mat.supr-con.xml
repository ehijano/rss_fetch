      <title>Interlayer Charge-Transfer Ferroelectric Fluctuations as a Pairing Mechanism in van der Waals Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signatures of unconventional superconductivity have been reported in a wide range of van der Waals (vdW) materials. However, their microscopic origin remains unclear due to competing electronic orders, strong spin-orbit coupling, and structural instabilities in the normal state. Here we investigate the role of interlayer breathing and shear modes in superconducting vdW heterostructures. Contrary to conventional wisdom -- which assumes that weak interlayer bonding and large layer separation suppress electronic coupling to these modes -- we show that the associated charge transfer can generate a substantial pairing interaction. We develop a theory of superconductivity mediated by such interlayer modes and demonstrate that proximity to a ferroelectric or antiferroelectric quantum critical point provides a strong-coupling pairing channel. Within a two-dimensional model with SU(2) symmetry and in-plane isotropy, we find an accidental degeneracy between interlayer triplet states, which can occur even for an $s$-wave in-plane gap. We further show that Josephson coupling between layers, arising from either static magnetism or induced by paramagnetic correlations, can stabilize a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting state of the $s+i\,s$ type, which couples to magnetization when at least two mirror symmetries are absent. Our results are directly applicable to candidate chiral vdW superconductors such as 4Hb-TaS$_2$ and to sliding ferroelectric metals, exemplified by bilayer MoTe$_2$. More broadly, our work identifies ferroelectric fluctuations as a promising route to unconventional pairing in vdW systems and motivates experimental searches for chiral multicomponent superconductivity.</description>

      <title>In-plane ferromagnetism-driven topological nodal-point superconductivity with tilted Weyl cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential application of topological superconductivity in quantum transport and quantum information has fueled an intense investigation of hybrid materials with emergent electronic properties, including magnet-superconductor heterostructures. Here, we report evidence of a topological nodal-point superconducting phase in a one-atom-thick in-plane ferromagnet in direct proximity to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor. Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy data reveal the presence of a double-peak low-energy feature in the local density of states of the hybrid system, which is rationalized via model calculations to be an emergent topological nodal-point superconducting phase with tilted Weyl cones. Our results further establish the combination of in-plane ferromagnetism and conventional superconductivity as a route to design two-dimensional topological quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic second-harmonic generation in superconducting nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circuits based on superconducting nanostructures are among the most promising platforms for quantum computing. Understanding how device geometry governs nonlinear electrodynamics is crucial for implementing superconducting quantum technologies. However, to date, research has largely been limited to superconducting nanostructures with collinearly aligned static and dynamic applied magnetic fields. Here, we analyze the dynamics of Meissner currents and Abrikosov vortices in a superconducting nanocube exposed to combined static and microwave magnetic fields, extending the analysis to a more general excitation geometry. We demonstrate that, in a noncollinear configuration,the magnetization component parallel to the static field develops a dominant second-harmonic response under the microwave driving. This effect is strongly enhanced when Meissner currents saturate at static fields just below the thresholds for successive vortex nucleation. By numerically solving the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations, we show that the response originates from Meissner-current saturation combined with the nonlinear oscillations of normal-phase indentations, yielding an anisotropic second-harmonic signal that is directionally separated from, and not overshadowed by, the first-harmonic component of the dynamic magnetization. These findings are relevant for superconducting devices that require controllable high-frequency nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic superconducting diode effect from non-collinear compensated magnetism in Mn$_3$Pt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently emerged as a distinct class of magnetic systems that exhibit spin splitting of electronic bands while retaining zero net magnetization. This unique combination makes them a promising platform for time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting phenomena, although identifying concrete material platforms remains an important open challenge. Here, we develop a theory for the superconducting diode effect observed experimentally in a Mn$_3$Pt-superconductor heterostructure. Using both a symmetry analysis and model calculations on the breathing kagome lattice, we show how the altermagnetic spin textures in Mn$_3$Pt generate a spin splitting of the electronic bands that remains magnetization-free even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and, upon taking into account the proximity coupling across the interface, produces a superconducting diode effect. We also demonstrate that the angular dependence of the critical current provides a probe of the magnetic order. We hope that our work will contribute to the understanding and further discovery of candidate materials for novel altermagnet-superconductor hybrid devices.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Superconducting Diode Effect in Mn$_{3}$Pt/Nb Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compensated magnetic orders that can split the spin-degeneracy of electronic bands have become a very active field of research. As opposed to spin-orbit coupling, the splitting resulting from these "altermagnets" is not a small relativistic correction and, in contrast to ferromagnets, not accompanied by a net magnetization and large stray fields. In particular, the theoretical analysis of the interplay of altermagnetism and superconductivity has taken center stage, while experimental investigations of their coexistence remain in their infancy. We here study heterostructures consisting of Nb thins films interfaced with the $T_1$ and $T_2$ phases of Mn$_3$Pt. These non-collinear magnetic states can be thought of as descendants from the same altermagnetic order in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate the non-trivial impact on the superconducting state of Nb, which exhibits a zero-field superconducting diode effect, despite the compensated ($T_2$) and nearly-compensated ($T_1$) magnetic order; the diode efficiencies can reach large values (up to 50$\%$). The diode effect is found to be highly sensitive to the form of the magnetic order, illustrating its potential as a symmetry probe. The complex magnetic field and temperature dependence hint at a rich interplay of multiple contributing mechanisms. Our results define a new materials paradigm for dissipationless spintronics and magnetization-free diode functionality, while motivating further exploration of non-collinear altermagnetic superconductors.</description>

      <title>Integration and Resource Estimation of Cryoelectronics for Superconducting Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling superconducting quantum computers to the fault-tolerant regime calls for a commensurate scaling of the classical control and readout stack. Today's systems largely rely on room-temperature, rack-based instrumentation connected to dilution-refrigerator cryostats through many coaxial cables. Looking ahead, superconducting fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs) will likely adopt a heterogeneous quantum-classical architecture that places selected electronics at cryogenic stages -- for example, cryo-CMOS at 4~K and superconducting digital logic at 4~K and/or mK stages -- to curb wiring and thermal-load overheads. This review distills key requirements, surveys representative room-temperature and cryogenic approaches, and provides a transparent first-order accounting framework for cryoelectronics. Using an RSA-2048-scale benchmark as a concrete reference point, we illustrate how scaling targets motivate constraints on multiplexing and stage-wise cryogenic power, and discuss implications for functional partitioning across room-temperature electronics, cryo-CMOS, and superconducting logic.</description>

      <title>Ramp Josephson junctions of Al/Ti/Sr2RuO4: Observation of single-domain quantum oscillations and the detection of chiral edge current</title>

Abstract: The determination of how the phase of the superconducting order parameter in a superconductor varies with the spatial direction, which can be done only through the Josephson-effect-based phase-sensitive measurements, is crucial for the establishment of the precise pairing symmetry of the superconductor. So far, such measurements have been done on high-Tc cuprate superconductors but only at a couple of directions for Sr2RuO4 because of the difficulty in preparing Josephson junctions between Sr2RuO4 and an s-wave superconductor with a chosen mutual orientation. Another long-standing issue in Sr2RuO4, which was shown previously to feature a spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry by muon spin rotation and other measurements, is that the expected presence of chiral surface currents, domains, and domain walls is yet to be explicitly shown experimentally. To address these issues, we have long sought the preparation of high-quality Josephson junctions between Sr2RuO4 and a conventional s-wave with a controllable orientation relative to symmetry axes in Sr2RuO4. We report in this article the successful fabrication of ramp Josephson junctions of Al/Ti/Sr2RuO4 on thin single crystals of Sr2RuO4 obtained by mechanical exfoliation. These junctions were found to show high-quality quantum oscillations consistent with a single-domain Josephson coupling. The normal junction resistance was found to depend extremely sensitively on the supercurrent flowing in the Sr2RuO4 crystal on which the Josephson junction was made. This finding was used in the present work to provide an estimate of the size of the chiral surface current, which is shown to agree with its upper bound established previously.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-Enhanced Graphene Superconductivity with Record Pauli-Limit Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-polarized superconductors offer a rare platform for studying electronic correlations, but few candidate systems have been experimentally confirmed to date. Here, we report the observation of a spin-polarized superconducting state, denoted SC5, in WSe2-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene. At in-plane magnetic field B|| = 0 T, SC5 has a critical temperature of 68 mK and an out-of-plane critical magnetic field of only 12 mT. Surprisingly, these values are significantly enhanced as B|| increases, and the superconductivity persists to B|| = 8.8 T. This value corresponds to a record-high Pauli-limit violation ratio of at least 80 among all superconductors, while the true critical field is beyond the limit of our instrument. We conclude that SC5 experiences a canting crossover from Ising-type to spin-polarized superconductor with increased B||.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Electron Liquids: Precision Many-Body Treatment of Coulomb Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: More than a century after discovery, the theory of conventional superconductivity remains incomplete. While the importance of electron-phonon coupling is understood, a controlled first-principles treatment of Coulomb interaction is lacking. Current ab initio calculations of superconductivity rely on a phenomenological downfolding approximation, replacing Coulomb interaction with a repulsive pseudopotential \mu*, and leaving ambiguities in electron-phonon coupling with dynamical Coulomb interactions unresolved. We address this via an effective field theory approach, integrating out high-energy electronic degrees of freedom using variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo. Applied to the uniform electron gas, this establishes a microscopic procedure to implement downfolding, define the pseudopotential, and express dynamical Coulomb effects on electron-phonon coupling via the electron vertex function. We find the bare pseudopotential significantly larger than conventional values. This yields improved pseudopotential estimates in simple metals and tests density functional perturbation theory accuracy for effective electron-phonon coupling. We present an ab initio workflow computing superconducting Tc from the anomalous vertex's precursory Cooper flow. This infers Tc from normal state calculations, enabling reliable estimates of very low Tc (including near quantum phase transitions) beyond conventional reach. Validating our approach on simple metals without empirical tuning, we resolve long-standing discrepancies and predict a pressure-induced transition in Al from superconducting to non-superconducting above ~60GPa. We propose ambient-pressure Mg and Na are proximal to a similar critical point. Our work establishes a controlled ab initio framework for electron-phonon superconductivity beyond the weak-correlation limit, paving the way for reliable Tc calculations and novel material design.</description>
