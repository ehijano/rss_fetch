      <title>Crystalline superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions for compact superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The narrow bandgap of semiconductors allows for thick, uniform Josephson junction barriers, potentially enabling reproducible, stable, and compact superconducting qubits. We study vertically stacked van der Waals Josephson junctions with semiconducting weak links, whose crystalline structures and clean interfaces offer a promising platform for quantum devices. We observe robust Josephson coupling across 2--12 nm (3--18 atomic layers) of semiconducting WSe$_2$ and, notably, a crossover from proximity- to tunneling-type behavior with increasing weak link thickness. Building on these results, we fabricate a prototype all-crystalline merged-element transmon qubit with transmon frequency and anharmonicity closely matching design parameters. We demonstrate dispersive coupling between this transmon and a microwave resonator, highlighting the potential of crystalline superconductor-semiconductor structures for compact, tailored superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Atomic collapse in gapped graphene: lattice and valley effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the atomic collapse phenomenon in $K$ and $K'$ valley of gapped graphene. Bound states induced by Coulomb impurity in the gap turn into atomic collapse resonances as the charge increases beyond the supercritical charge $Z_c$. $Z_c$ increases sublinear with the band gap $\Delta$. The atomic collapse resonances result in peaks in the LDOS at the same energies in $K$ and $K'$ valley, but the strong (weak) LDOS peaks in $K$ valley are weak (strong) LDOS peaks in $K'$ valley reminiscent of pseudospin polarization phenomenon. From a spatial LDOS analysis of the atomic collapse resonance states, we assign specific atomic orbitals to the atomic collapse resonances. Remarkably, the two $p$ atomic orbital atomic collapse states are no longer degenerate and splits into two having lobes in different directions in the graphene plane.</description>

      <title>Selective Hydrogen Molecule Dissociation on Ca2N Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing efficient hydrogen storage and conversion technologies is essential for sustainable energy. This study investigates the catalytic potential of a dicalcium nitride (Ca2N) monolayer for hydrogen dissociation using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We find that atomic hydrogen preferentially adsorbs at Ca-centered hollow sites (labeled A sites), while molecular hydrogen adsorption is limited to bridge sites (labeled B sites). AIMD simulations reveal that H2 dissociation at B sites inhibits further adsorption, suggesting a mechanism of controlled H2 dissociation. The current findings emphasize the potential of pristine Ca2N as a catalyst for H2 dissociation-related processes and motivate future investigations of its activity in hydrogen evolution reactions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modulation of Electronic and Optical Properties in GaN Bilayers by Interlayer Sliding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a first-principles investigation of the electronic and optical properties of gallium nitride (GaN) bilayers, focusing on the influence of interlayer sliding and spacing. In contrast to the earlier studies on discrete stacking configurations, we explore the dynamic evolution of the properties during transitions between stable stacking arrangements. Using density functional theory calculations, we systematically analyze the impact of these structural variations on the electronic band structure and optical absorption spectra of GaN bilayers. The analysis includes both high-symmetry stacking configurations (AA', AB', and AC') and intermediate states generated by controlled in-plane atomic displacements, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the property changes associated with interlayer sliding. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the potential for tuning the electronic and optical response of two-dimensional GaN for applications in nanoscale photonic and electronic devices, where precise control over interlayer interactions and stacking is crucial.</description>

      <title>Charge density wave modulated third-order nonlinear Hall effect in 1$T$-VSe$_2$ nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of a pronounced third-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) in 1$T$-phase VSe$_2$ nanosheets, synthesized using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The nanosheets exhibit a charge density wave (CDW) transition at $\sim$77 K. Detailed angle-resolved and temperature-dependent measurements reveal a strong cubic relationship between the third-harmonic Hall voltage $V_{3\omega}^\perp$ and the bias current $I_\omega$, persisting up to room temperature. Notably, the third-order NLHE demonstrates a twofold angular dependence and significant enhancement below the CDW transition temperature, indicative of threefold symmetry breaking in the CDW phase. Scaling analysis suggests that the intrinsic contribution from the Berry connection polarizability tensor is substantially increased in the CDW phase, while extrinsic effects dominate at higher temperatures. Our findings highlight the critical role of CDW-induced symmetry breaking in modulating quantum geometric properties and nonlinear transport phenomena in VSe$_2$, paving the way for future explorations in low-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale resolved mapping of the dipole emission of hBN color centers with a scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising candidates as quantum light sources for future technologies. In this work, we utilize a scattering-type near-field optical microscope (s-SNOM) to study the photoluminescence (PL) emission characteristics of such quantum emitters in metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy grown hBN. On the one hand, we demonstrate direct near-field optical excitation and emission through interaction with the nanofocus of the tip resulting in a sub-diffraction limited tip-enhanced PL hotspot. On the other hand, we show that indirect excitation and emission via scattering from the tip significantly increases the recorded PL intensity. This demonstrates that the tip-assisted PL (TAPL) process efficiently guides the generated light to the detector. We apply the TAPL method to map the in-plane dipole orientations of the hBN color centers on the nanoscale. This work promotes the widely available s-SNOM approach to applications in the quantum domain including characterization and optical control.</description>

      <title>Giant Anomalous Hall Effect in Kagome Nodal Surface Semimetal Fe$_3$Ge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) arises from the integration of the non-zero Berry curvature (BC), conventionally observed in the Dirac/Weyl and nodal-line semimetals. Moreover, nodal surface semimetals are expected to exhibit more significant BC under the prevalence of degenerate points near the Fermi level. In this work, we report the detection of a giant AHE in the Kagome magnet Fe$_3$Ge with a two-dimensional (2D) nodal surface (NS) at $k_{z}=\pi$ plane, exhibiting an anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 1500 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ at 160 K, the highest among all reported Kagome topological materials. This finding suggests a new platform for searching large AHC materials and facilitates potential room-temperature applications in spintronic devices and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>The Connection between Spin Wave Polarization and Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study establishes a fundamental connection between the dissipation and polarization of spin waves, which are often treated as independent phenomena. Through theoretical analysis and numerical validation, we demonstrate that within the linearized spin wave regime, a spin wave mode's dissipation rate, defined as the ratio of linewidth to the resonance frequency, exceeds Gilbert damping by a factor given by its spatially averaged polarization. This average is governed by a non-positive definite weight, whose magnitude depends on the magnon density of the local excitation, while its sign is dictated by the local polarization handedness. Remarkably, this universal connection applies across diverse magnetic interactions and textures, offering crucial insights into spin wave dynamics and dissipation.</description>

      <title>Spin-imbalance induced buried topological edge currents in Mott \&amp; topological insulator heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the heterostructure between a ferrimagnetic Mott insulator and a time-reversal invariant topological band insulator on the two-dimensional Lieb lattice with periodic boundary conditions. Our Hartree-Fock and slave-rotor mean-field results incorporate long-range Coulomb interactions. We present charge and magnetic reconstructions at the two edges of the heterostructure and reveal how \textit{buried} topological edge modes adapt to these heterostructure edge reconstructions. In particular, we demonstrate that the interface magnetic field induces a spin imbalance in the edge modes while preserving their topological character and metallic nature. We show that this imbalance leads to topologically protected buried spin and charge currents. The inherent spin-momentum locking ensures that left and right movers contribute to the current at the two buried interfaces in opposite directions. We show that the magnitude of the spin-imbalance induced charge and spin current can be tuned by adjusting the spin-orbit coupling of the bulk topological insulator relative to the correlation strength of the bulk Mott insulator. Thus, our results demonstrate a controlled conversion of a spin Hall effect into an analog of a charge Hall effect driven by band topology and interaction effects. These topologically protected charge and spin currents pave the way for advances in low-energy electronics and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Gate Tunable Josephson Diode Effect in Josephson Junctions made from InAs Nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of Josephson diode effect (JDE) in hybrid devices made from semiconductor InAs nanosheets and superconductor Al contacts. By applying an in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\mathrm{xy}}$), we detect non-reciprocal superconducting switching current as well as non-reciprocal superconducting retrapping current. The strength of the JDE depends on the angle between the in-plane magnetic field and the bias current ($I_{\mathrm{b}}$), reaching its maximum when $B_{\mathrm{xy}} \perp I_{\mathrm{b}}$ and dropping to nearly zero when $B_{\mathrm{xy}}\parallel I_{\mathrm{b}}$. Additionally, the diode efficiency is tunable via an electrostatic gate with a complete suppression at certain gate voltages. Our findings indicate that the observed JDE in InAs nanosheet-based Josephson junctions most likely arises from the Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in the nanosheets. Such gate-tunable JDE in Josephson junctions made from semiconductor material with SOI is useful not only for constructing advanced superconducting electronics but also for detecting novel superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Electrically driven resonant magnetization, spin-pumping and charge-to-spin conversion from chiral-spin modes at THz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral-spin modes are collective excitations of a spin-orbit (SO) coupled system that lead to resonances in many observables. Here we identify resonances in "cross-response", i.e., electric-field induced magnetization and magnetic-field induced electric currents, known also as the Edelstein effect and its inverse, respectively. We show that the chiral-spin modes resonantly enhance the electrically induced magnetization. As specific examples, we consider a single-valley two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba or Dresselhaus SO coupling and a two-valley Dirac system with proximity-induced Rashba and valley-Zeeman SO couplings. We suggest an architecture for a spin-pumping experiment based on THz excitation of chiral-spin modes, which would demonstrate a resonant enhancement of charge-to-spin conversion.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Sub-configurations Reveals Stable Spin-Orbit Torque Switching Polarity in Polycrystalline Mn3Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated the switching of octupole moment in Mn3Sn driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT). However, they have not accounted for the polycrystalline nature of the sample when explaining the switching mechanism. In this work, we use samples with various atomic orientations to capture this polycrystalline nature. We thoroughly investigate their SOT-induced spin dynamics and demonstrate that the polycrystalline structure leads to distinct outcomes. Our findings reveal that configuration II, where the Kagome plane is perpendicular to the spin polarization, exhibits robust switching with stable polarity, whereas the signals from various sub-configurations in configuration I cancel each other out. By comparing our findings with experimental results, we pinpoint the primary sources contributing to the measured AHE signals. Additionally, we establish a dynamic balance model that incorporates the unique properties of Mn3Sn to elucidate these observations. Our study highlights the essential role of the polycrystalline nature in understanding SOT switching. By clarifying the underlying physical mechanisms, our work resolves the longstanding puzzle regarding the robust SOT switching observed in Mn3Sn.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the intrinsic nonlinear valley thermal effects, driven by the Quantum Metric of the system. Our findings elucidate that valley indices in the nonlinear effect are distinguishable by the thermoelectric correction to the orbital magnetization, which adopts opposite signs across valleys mirroring the role of orbital angular momentum in the linear valley Hall effect. Through a prototypical two-band model on an anisotropic tilted Dirac semimetal, we investigate how intrinsic material parameters modulate this nonlinear valley thermal response. Extending to realistic PT symmetric anisotropic semiconductors, our findings enrich the understanding of valley-based phenomena, with implications for advanced theoretical and experimental pursuits in valleytronics and valley caloritonics.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric properties of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene-superconductor hetero-junction: effect of valley polarization and trigonal warping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric properties (electronic contribution) of a normal-superconductor (NS) hybrid junction, where the normal region consists of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). The superconducting region is characterized by a common $s$-wave superconductor closely proximitized to the MATBG. We compute various thermoelectric coefficients, including thermal conductance, thermopower, and the figure of merit ($zT$), using the scattering matrix formalism. These results are further supported by calculations based on a lattice-regularized version of the effective Hamiltonian. Additionally, we explore the impact of trigonal warping and valley polarization on the thermoelectric coefficients. Notably, we find a significant variation in $zT$ as a function of these parameters, reaching values as high as 2.5. Interestingly, we observe a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law near the charge neutrality point with the superconducting correlation, indicating that MATBG electrons behave as slow Dirac fermions in this regime. This observation is further confirmed by the damped oscillatory behavior of the thermal conductance as a function of the barrier strength when an insulating barrier is modelled at the interface of the NS junction. Beyond theoretical insights, our findings suggest new possibilities for thermoelectric applications using MATBG based NS junctions.</description>

      <title>A flux-controlled two-site Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In semiconducting-superconducting hybrid devices, Andreev bound states (ABSs) can mediate the coupling between quantum dots (QDs), allowing for the realisation of artificial Kitaev chains. In order to engineer Majorana bound states (MBSs) in these systems, one must control the energy of the ABSs. In this work, we show how extended ABSs in a flux tunable Josephson junction can be used to control the coupling between distant quantum dots separated by $\approx$ 1 $\mathrm{\mu}$m. In particular, we demonstrate that the combination of electrostatic control and phase control over the ABSs significantly increases the parameter space in which MBSs are observed. Finally, by employing an additional spectroscopic probe in the hybrid region between the QDs, we gain information about the spatial distribution of the Majorana wave function in a two-site Kitaev chain.</description>

      <title>Strain-time engineering via exciton interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technology to produce attosecond pulses opens the door to manipulate electrons in matter before their loss of quantum coherence. In two-dimensional materials, where excitonic interactions dominate the optical response, a laser-induced quantum superposition of excitons may induce a migration of charge across the system. Here, instead of tailoring the laser pulse in order to control the exciton superposition, we propose strain as a more feasible and robust scheme to control exciton migration. Uniaxial strain may break the crystal symmetry and lift the degeneracy of 1s exciton states. We show in monolayer hBN a precise control of the exciton oscillation between different valleys via strain. We perform numerical simulations of the laser-driven electron dynamics that demonstrate this effect. This work paves the way of using strain for tailoring exciton oscillations at the attosecond time scale.</description>

      <title>Braiding Majoranas in a linear quantum dot-superconductor array: Mitigating the errors from Coulomb repulsion and residual tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchanging the positions of two non-Abelian anyons transforms between many-body wavefunctions within a degenerate ground-state manifold. This behavior is fundamentally distinct from fermions, bosons and Abelian anyons. Recently, quantum dot-superconductor arrays have emerged as a promising platform for creating topological Kitaev chains that can host non-Abelian Majorana zero modes. In this work, we propose a minimal braiding setup in a linear array of quantum dots consisting of two minimal Kitaev chains coupled through an ancillary, normal quantum dot. We focus on the physical effects that are peculiar to quantum dot devices, such as interdot Coulomb repulsion and residual single electron tunneling. We find that the errors caused by either of these effects can be efficiently mitigated by optimal control of the ancillary quantum dot that mediates the exchange of the non-Abelian anyons. Moreover, we propose experimentally accessible methods to find this optimal operating regime and predict signatures of a successful Majorana braiding experiment.</description>

      <title>Overlay-aware Variation Study of Flip FET and Benchmark with CFET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we carried out an overlay-aware variation study on Flip FET (FFET) considering the impact on RC parasitics induced by the lithography misalignment in backside processes, and benchmarked it with CFET in terms of the power-performance (PP) and variation sources. The iso-leakage frequency degrades up to 2.20% with layout misalignment of 4 nm. It's found that the Drain Merge resistance degrades significantly with misalignment increasing and is identified as the major variation source. Through careful DTCO with design rule optimization, the variation can be greatly suppressed, while the resistance fluctuation of the DM also drops substantially. Monte Carlo random experiments were also conducted, validating the variation reduction. Comparing with the CFET featuring self-aligned gate and much less overlay induced misalignment, fortunately, FFET's PP is still better except when misalignment reaches 8 nm, which is out of spec and nearly impossible. Considering the variabilities induced by the high aspect ratio processes, CFET still faces big challenges compared with FFET.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport with Spin Orbit Coupling: New Developments in TranSIESTA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the implementation of spinor quantum transport within the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) code TranSIESTA based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). First-principles methods play an essential role in molecular and material modelling, and the DFT+NEGF approach has become a widely-used tool for quantum transport simulation. Exisiting (open source) DFT-based quantum transport codes either model non-equilibrium/finite-bias cases in an approximate way or rely on the collinear spin approximation. Our new implementation closes this gap and enables the TranSIESTA code to use full spinor-wave functions. Thereby it provides a method for transport simulation of topological materials and devices based on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or non-collinear spins. These materials hold enormous potential for the development of ultra-low energy electronics urgently needed for the design of sustainable technology. The new feature is tested for relevant systems determining magnetoresistance in iron nanostructures and transport properties of a lateral transition metal dichalcogenide heterojunction.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations of holes in GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GaN has emerged to be a major semiconductor akin to silicon due to its revolutionary impacts in solid state lighting, critically enabled by p-type doping, and high-performance radio-frequency and power electronics. Suffering from inefficient hole doping and low hole mobility, quantum oscillations in p-type GaN have not been observed, hindering fundamental studies of valence bands and hole transport in GaN. Here, we present the first observation of quantum oscillations of holes in GaN. Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in hole resistivity are observed in a quantum-confined two-dimensional hole gas at a GaN/AlN interface, where polarization-induced doping overcomes thermal freeze-out, and a sharp and clean interface boosts the hole mobility enough to unmask the quantum oscillations. These holes degenerately occupy the light and heavy hole bands of GaN and have record-high mobilities of ~1900 cm2/Vs and ~400 cm2/Vs at 3K, respectively. We use magnetic fields up to 72 T to resolve SdH oscillations of holes from both valence bands to extract their respective sheet densities, quantum scattering times, and the effective masses of light holes (0.5-0.7 m0) and heavy holes (1.9 m0). SdH oscillations of heavy and light holes in GaN constitute a direct metrology of valence bands and open new venues for quantum engineering in this technologically important semiconductor. Like strained silicon transistors, strain-engineering of the valence bands of GaN is predicted to dramatically improve hole mobilities by reducing the hole effective mass, a proposal that can now be explored experimentally, particularly in a fully fabricated transistor, using quantum oscillations. Furthermore, the findings of this work suggest a blueprint to create 2D hole gases and observe quantum oscillations of holes in related wide bandgap semiconductors such as SiC and ZnO in which such techniques are not yet possible.</description>

      <title>Protecting Intercavity Polaritons in Strongly Coupled Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically designed and experimentally demonstrated a mechanism to protect a spatially segregated mixed light-matter state, known as intercavity exciton-polariton in strongly coupled optical cavities. This excitation, shared across the coupled cavity array, exhibits remarkable robustness over a wide momentum range, without compromising photon-exciton mixing or the spatial separation of its photonic and excitonic components, which also enables a tunable heavy mass. Additionally, we unveil a direct connection between the transparency window, characteristic of slow-light experiments, and the protection of the intercavity polariton nature. Both phenomena originate from the strategic design of an energy-level landscape featuring a $\Lambda$-scheme, opening new avenues for exploring and utilizing these unique optical excitations in advanced photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Origin of performance enhancement of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors by He-ion irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are indispensable in fields such as quantum science and technology, astronomy, and biomedical imaging, where high detection efficiency, low dark count rates and high timing accuracy are required. Recently, helium (He) ion irradiation was shown to be a promising method to enhance SNSPD performance. Here, we study how changes in the underlying superconducting NbTiN film and the SiO2/Si substrate affect device performance. While irradiated and unirradiated NbTiN films show similar crystallinity, we observe He bubble formation below the SiO2/Si interface and an amorphization of the Si substrate. Both reduce the thermal conductance between the superconducting thin film and the substrate from 210 W/m^2/K^4 to 70 W/m^2/K^4 after irradiation with 2000 ions/nm^2. This effect, combined with the lateral straggle of He ions in the substrate, allows the modification of the superconductor-to-substrate thermal conductance of an SNSPD by selectively irradiating the regions around the nanowire. With this approach, we achieved an increased plateau width of saturating intrinsic detection efficiency of 9.8 uA compared to 3.7 uA after full irradiation. Moreover, the critical current remained similar to that of the unirradiated reference device (59 uA versus 60.1 uA), while full irradiation reduced it to 22.4 uA. Our results suggest that the irradiation-induced reduction of the thermal conductance significantly enhances SNSPD sensitivity, offering a novel approach to locally engineer substrate properties for improved detector performance.</description>

      <title>Thermal Stability and Depinning Currents of Domain Wall-Based Artificial Synapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micromagnetic modeling is employed to optimize the design of artificial synapse devices based on the spin-orbit-torque (SOT) driven domain wall (DW) motion along a nanotrack with triangular notches. Key attributes, such as the thermal stability of the pinned DW and depinning currents, are obtained for varied nanotrack geometry and pinning strength. Depinning probability as a function of SOT current density and pulse width is studied using finite temperature micromagnetic simulations for varying pinning potential. Results show that wider notches provide better thermal stability - depinning current trade-off. On the other hand, narrow notches exhibit less variation in the depinning times at finite temperatures. It is observed that the DW position can be set precisely to any desired location by the SOT current pulse if the thermal stability is sufficiently high. It is also observed that the meta-plastic functionality can be obtained by adding notches of progressively higher depinning currents along the rectangular nanotrack.</description>

      <title>Optimal spectral transport of non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal transport problem seeks to minimize the total transportation cost between two distributions, thus providing a measure of distance between them. In this work, we study the optimal transport of the eigenspectrum of one-dimensional non-Hermitian models as the spectrum deforms on the complex plane under a varying imaginary gauge field. Notably, according to the non-Bloch band theory, the deforming spectrum continuously connects the eigenspectra of the original non-Hermitian model (with vanishing gauge field) under different boundary conditions. It follows that the optimal spectral transport should contain key information of the model. Characterizing the optimal spectral transport through the Wasserstein metric, we show that, indeed, important features of the non-Hermitian model, such as the (auxiliary) generalized Brillouin zone, the non-Bloch exceptional point, and topological phase transition, can be determined from the Wasserstein-metric calculation. We confirm our conclusions using concrete examples. Our work highlights the key role of spectral geometry in non-Hermitian physics, and offers a practical and convenient access to the properties of non-Hermitian models.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Sides of Wafer: Physical Implementation and Block-Level PPA on Flip FET with Dual-sided Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the conventional scaling of logic devices comes to an end, functional wafer backside and 3D transistor stacking are consensus for next-generation logic technology, offering considerable design space extension for powers, signals or even devices on the wafer backside. The Flip FET (FFET), a novel transistor architecture combining 3D transistor stacking and fully functional wafer backside, was recently proposed. With symmetric dual-sided standard cell design, the FFET can deliver around 12.5% cell area scaling and faster but more energy-efficient libraries beyond other stacked transistor technologies such as CFET. Besides, thanks to the novel cell design with dual-sided pins, the FFET supports dual-sided signal routing, delivering better routability and larger backside design space. In this work, we demonstrated a comprehensive FFET evaluation framework considering physical implementation and block-level power-performance-area (PPA) assessment for the first time, in which key functions are dual-sided routing and dual-sided RC extraction. A 32-bit RISC-V core was used for the evaluation here. Compared to the CFET with single-sided signals, the FFET with single-sided signals achieved 23.3% post-P&amp;R core area reduction, 25.0% higher frequency and 11.9% lower power at the same utilization, and 16.0 % higher frequency at the same core area. Meanwhile, the FFET supports dual-sided signals, which can further benefit more from flexible allocation of cell input pins on both sides. By optimizing the input pin density and BEOL routing layer number on each side, 10.6% frequency gain was realized without power degradation compared to the one with single-sided signal routing. Moreover, the routability and power efficiency of FFET barely degrades even with the routing layer number reduced from 12 to 5 on each side, validating the great space for cost-friendly design enabled by FFET.</description>

      <title>A Panoramic View of MXenes via a New Design Strategy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, possess unique physical and chemical properties, enabling diverse applications in fields ranging from energy storage to communication, catalysis, sensing, healthcare, and beyond. The transition metal and nonmetallic atoms in MXenes can exhibit distinct coordination environments, potentially leading to a wide variety of 2D phases. Despite extensive research and significant advancements, a fundamental understanding of MXenes' phase diversity and its relationship with their hierarchical precursors, including intermediate MAX phases and parent bulk phases, remains limited. Using high-throughput modeling based on first-principles density functional theory, we unveil a wide range of MXenes and comprehensively evaluate their relative stabilities across a large chemical space. The key lies in considering both octahedral and trigonal prismatic coordination environments characteristic of various bulk phases. Through this comprehensive structural library of MXenes, we uncover a close alignment between the phase stability of MXenes and that of their hierarchical 3D counterparts. Building on this, we demonstrate a new design strategy where the atomic coordination environments in parent bulk phases can serve as reliable predictors for the design of MXenes, reducing reliance on intermediate MAX phases. Our study significantly expands the landscape of MXenes, at least doubling the number of possible structures.</description>

Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional chains of atoms can be effectively described by one-dimensional Dirac-type equation. Crystal structure of the chain is reflected by pseudo-spin of the quasi-particles. In the article, we present a simple framework where supersymmetric transformation is utilized to generate an interaction between two, initially non-interacting systems described by pseudo-spin-one Dirac-type equation. In the presented example, the transformation converts two asymptotically non-interacting atomic chains into a saw chain locally. The model possesses a flat band whose energy can be fine-tuned deliberately.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Mechanical Strain on Magnetic and Structural Properties of 2D Materials: A Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent flexibility of two dimensional materials allows for efficient manipulation of their physical properties through strain application, which is essential for the development of advanced nanoscale devices. This study aimed to understand the impact of mechanical strain on the magnetic properties of two dimensional materials using Monte Carlo simulations. The effects of several strain states on the magnetic properties were investigated using the Lennard Jones potential and bond length-dependent exchange interactions. The key parameters analyzed include the Lindemann coefficient, radial distribution function, and magnetization in relation to temperature and magnetic field. The results indicate that applying biaxial tensile strain generally reduces the critical temperature. In contrast, the biaxial compressive strain increased Tc within the elastic range, but decreased at higher strain levels. Both compressive and tensile strains significantly influence the ferromagnetic properties and structural ordering, as evidenced by magnetization hysteresis. Notably, pure shear strain did not induce disorder, leaving the magnetization unaffected. In addition, our findings suggest the potential of domain-formation mechanisms. This study provides comprehensive insights into the influence of mechanical strain on the magnetic behavior and structural integrity of 2D materials, offering valuable guidance for future research and advanced material design applications.</description>

Abstract: Interfacing light from solid-state single-photon sources with scalable and robust room-temperature quantum memories has been a long-standing challenge in photonic quantum information technologies due to inherent noise processes and time-scale mismatches between the operating conditions of solid-state and atomic systems. Here, we demonstrate on-demand storage and retrieval of single photons from a semiconductor quantum dot device in a room-temperature atomic vapor memory. A deterministically fabricated InGaAs quantum dot light source emits single photons at the wavelength of the cesium D1 line at 895\,nm which exhibit an inhomogeneously broadened linewidth of 5.1(7)\,GHz and are subsequently stored in a low-noise ladder-type cesium vapor memory. We show control over the interaction between the single photons and the atomic vapor, allowing for variable retrieval times of up to 19.8(3)\,ns at an internal efficiency of $\eta_\mathrm{int}=0.6(1)\%$. Our results significantly expand the application space of both room-temperature vapor memories and semiconductor quantum dots in future quantum network architectures.</description>

      <title>The geometric impact of the quantum Hall interface on a cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, quantum Hall interface has become a popular subject of research; distinct from that of the quantum Hall edge, which is constrained by external background confinement, the interface has the freedom to move, likely towards a string-like state. In disk geometry, it was known that the interface energy has an extra correction due to its curvature which depends on the size of the disk. In this work, we analytically calculate the energy of the integer quantum Hall interface on a cone surface which has the advantage that its curvature is more easily adjustable. By tuning the length and curvature of the interface by the cone angle parameter $\beta$, we analyze the dependence of the quantum Hall interface energy on the curvature and verify this geometric correction. Moreover, we find that the tip of the cone geometry has an extra contribution to the energy that reflects on the $u_2,u_4$ term.</description>

      <title>An ab initio dataset of size-dependent effective thermal conductivity for advanced technology transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the size of transistors shrinks and power density increases, thermal simulation has become an indispensable part of the device design procedure. However, existing works for advanced technology transistors use simplified empirical models to calculate effective thermal conductivity in the simulations. In this work, we present a dataset of size-dependent effective thermal conductivity with electron and phonon properties extracted from ab initio computations. Absolute in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivity data of eight semiconducting materials (Si, Ge, GaN, AlN, 4H-SiC, GaAs, InAs, BAs) and four metallic materials (Al, W, TiN, Ti) with the characteristic length ranging from 5 to 50 nanometers have been provided. Besides the absolute value, normalized effective thermal conductivity is also given, in case it needs to be used with updated bulk thermal conductivity in the future. The dataset presented in this paper are openly available at https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.j00113.00154.</description>

      <title>Two-Photon Interference from an InAs Quantum Dot emitting in the Telecom C-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-photon interference from an InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dot (QD) emitting in the telecom C-band with a raw two-photon interference visibility of $V_{HOM}=(71.9\pm0.2)$ % is demonstrated. This is achieved by a two-fold approach: an improvement of the molecular beam epitaxial growth for better QDs, and integration of the QDs into an optical circular Bragg grating resonator for a Purcell enhancement of the radiative decay rate. The quantum optical properties of the fabricated device are studied by means of time-correlated single-photon counting under quasi-resonant excitation of the charged exciton line. A reduced lifetime of $T_1=(257.5\pm0.2)$ ps is found corresponding to a Purcell factor of $F_P\geqq(4.7\pm0.5)$. Pronounced anti-bunching of the second-order autocorrelation function at zero time delay $g^{(2)} (0)=(0.0307\pm0.0004)$ confirms the single-photon emission character. The two-photon interference is demonstrated with an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer in Hong-Ou-Mandel configuration. We discuss strategies how to further improve the indistinguishability, and provide a survey of the state-of-the art.</description>

      <title>Environment-limited transfer of angular momentum in Bose liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Impurity motion in a many-body environment has been a central issue in the field of low-temperature physics for decades. In bosonic quantum fluids, the onset of a drag force experienced by point-like objects is due to collective environment excitations, driven by the exchange of linear momentum between the impurity and the many-body bath. In this work we consider a rotating impurity, with the aim of exploring how angular momentum is exchanged with the surrounding bosonic environment. In order to elucidate this issues, we employ a quasiparticle approach based on the angulon theory, which allows us to effectively deal with the non-trivial algebra of quantized angular momentum in presence of a many-body environment. We uncover how impurity dressing by environmental excitations can establish an exchange channel, whose effectiveness crucially depends on the initial state of the impurity. Remarkably, we find that there is a critical value of initial angular momentum, above which this channel effectively freezes.</description>

      <title>Superlubric sliding ferroelectricity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity may emerge in many van der Waals bilayers/multilayers and the low switching barriers render ultrafast data writing with low energy cost. We note that such barriers are still much higher compared with structural superlubricity, and in this paper we propose a type of superlubric sliding ferroelectricity in homobilayers separated by a different layer that leads to unprecedented low switching barriers due to incommensurate interfaces. For example, the switching barrier of 3R bilayer MoS2 will be respectively reduced by around 2 or 1 order of magnitudes if they are separated by a graphene or BN monolayer, and the required voltage for switching can be about 1 order of magnitude lower. Such superlubric sliding ferroelectricity widely exists in various similar sandwich trilayer systems where the polarizations stem from symmetry breaking in across-layer stacking configurations, and with ultralow barriers of superlubric sliding, their performances for various applications are greatly enhanced compared with homobilayer sliding ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal-Driven Variations in Structure, Magnetism, and Photocatalysis of Monoclinic M3Se4 (M = Fe, Co, Ni) Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition metal selenides (MxSey) have gained attention for their unique physical and chemical properties, especially those associated with the transition metal (M). Despite advancements in synthesis, fabricating these selenides is challenging due to their complex stoichiometry and high asymmetry. One such system is monoclinic iron selenide (Fe3Se4), which can be used in permanent-magnet technologies and serve as a model system for understanding magnetism. This study focuses on fabricating monoclinic M3Se4 (M = Fe, Co, or Ni) compounds via thermal decomposition, examining how solution chemistry influences their morphology and properties. With a Curie temperature of about 322 K, Fe3Se4 is ferrimagnetic, whereas Co3Se4 and Ni3Se4 are paramagnetic between 5 and 300 K. The latter two compounds also show higher catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution in water splitting, with maximum H2-evolution rates of 1.01, 5.16, and 6.83 mmol h-1g-1 for Fe3Se4, Co3Se4, and Ni3Se4, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of adiabatic orbital pumping, highlighting qualitative differences from spin pumping. An oscillating magnetic field pumps not only orbital angular momentum current but also orbital angular position current. The latter, which has no spin counterpart, underscores the incompleteness of existing orbital torque theories. Importantly, both types of orbital currents can be detected as transverse electric voltages, which contain considerable second harmonic components unlike in spin pumping. Moreover, orbital currents can be pumped by lattice dynamics that carry phonon angular momentum, implying that orbital currents can, in turn, induce phonon angular momentum. Our work open up new possibilities for generating orbital currents and provides a broader understanding of the interplay between spin, orbital, and phonon dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically propose chiral magnon in ferromagnetic chiral crystals. We show that the crystal chirality is imprinted in orbital angular momentum of magnons which exhibits the opposite signs for opposite chiralities of the crystal. We also show that a finite magnon orbital angular momentum can be induced by a temperature gradient which is a magnonic analogue of the Edelstein effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical development in the Quantum Hall effect in monolayer graphene showed that the previous model of the valley-anisotropy interaction is incomplete, as it was assumed to be ultra-short range (USR). In this work, we use exact diagonalization to go beyond the ultra-short range to find the different phases for $\nu=2/3$. We model the interaction as Yukawa so that we can control the range as a proof of concept. Even in this simple setting, we discovered how dropping the USR condition shifts the transition borders in favour of certain phases, leads to a new bond-ordered phase appearing, and breaks the ferromagnetic phase in two competing states as a result of lifting the USR-driven degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Winding Tuple for Non-Hermitian Topological Edge Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between topological localization and non-Hermiticity localization in non-Hermitian crystal systems results in a diversity of shapes of topological edge modes (EMs), offering opportunities to manipulate these modes for potential topological applications. The characterization of the domain of EMs and the engineering of these EMs require detailed information about their wave functions, which conventional calculation of topological invariants cannot provide. In this Letter, by recognizing EMs as specified solutions of eigenequation, we derive their wave functions in an extended non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We then inversely construct a winding tuple $\left \{ w_{\scriptscriptstyle GBZ},w_{\scriptscriptstyle BZ}\right \} $ that characterizes the existence of EMs and their spatial distribution. Moreover, we define a novel spectral winding number equivalent to $w_{\scriptscriptstyle BZ}$, which is determined by the product of energies of different bands. The inverse design of topological invariants allows us to categorize the localized nature of EMs even in systems lacking sublattice symmetry, which can facilitate the manipulation and utilization of EMs in the development of novel quantum materials and devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Bloch states of weak spacetime-periodic perturbations of homogeneous materials in one spatial dimension. The interplay of space- and time-periodicity leads to an infinitely degenerate dispersion relation in the free case. We consider a general perturbation term, and, as consequence of the infinite degeneracy, we show that the effective equations are given by the eigenvalue problem of an infinite matrix. Our method can be viewed as a time-modulated generalisation of the nearly-free electron model. Based on this result, we find that the infinite degeneracy may split into a family of non-degenerate bands. Our results are illustrated with numerical calculations, and we observe close agreement between the perturbation theory and the numerically computed full solution.</description>

      <title>Linear response of a Chern insulator to finite-frequency electric fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the macroscopic charge and current densities of a Chern insulator initially occupying its electronic ground state as it responds to a finite-frequency electric field; we use a previously developed formalism based on microscopic polarization and magnetization fields in extended media. In a topologically trivial insulator, our result reduces to the familiar expression for the induced current density in linear response obtained from a Kubo analysis. But for a Chern insulator we find an extra "topological" term involving the (first) Chern number associated with the occupied bands, encoding the quantum anomalous Hall effect in the presence of a frequency-dependent electric field. While an analogous term has been introduced in the "modern theories of polarization and magnetization" for the linear response of finite-sized systems to static electric fields, our expression is valid for bulk Chern insulators in the presence of both static and finite-frequency electric fields, being derived analytically from a microscopic treatment of the electronic degrees of freedom, and can be generalized in a straightforward way to describe the response of a Chern insulator to electromagnetic fields that are not only frequency-dependent but also spatially inhomogeneous.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Discovery of Kagome Materials in Transition Metal Oxide Monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome materials are known for hosting exotic quantum states, including quantum spin liquids, charge density waves, and unconventional superconductivity. The search for kagome monolayers is driven by their ability to exhibit neat and well-defined kagome bands near the Fermi level, which are more easily realized in the absence of interlayer interactions. However, this absence also destabilizes the monolayer forms of many bulk kagome materials, posing significant challenges to their discovery. In this work, we propose a strategy to address this challenge by utilizing oxygen vacancies in transition metal oxides within a "1+3" design framework. Through high-throughput computational screening of 349 candidate materials, we identified 12 thermodynamically stable kagome monolayers with diverse electronic and magnetic properties. These materials were classified into three categories based on their lattice geometry, symmetry, band gaps, and magnetic configurations. Detailed analysis of three representative monolayers revealed kagome band features near their Fermi levels, with orbital contributions varying between oxygen 2p and transition metal d states. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the "1+3" strategy, offering a promising approach to uncovering low-dimensional kagome materials and advancing the exploration of their quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Stable Tunneling Current in Serial Double Quantum Dots: Insights from Nonequilibrium Green Functions and Pauli Spin Blockade</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate charge transport through serial double quantum dots (SDQDs) with strong electron correlations using nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. In the linear response regime, we compute the charge stability diagram and analyze the Coulomb oscillatory tunneling current, revealing both thermal and nonthermal broadening effects on the current spectra in relation to two gate voltages. In the nonlinear response regime, we focus on tunneling currents in SDQDs under the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) scenario. We find that current rectification with negative differential conductance is significantly degraded as temperature increases, making it challenging to distinguish between the inter-site spin triplet and singlet states. Notably, we observe a robust reversed tunneling current that remains stable against temperature variations, provided the resonant channel in the PSB scenario is coupled to the states of the right (left) electrode, which is fully occupied (unoccupied) by particles. This characteristic provides valuable insights for designing transistors capable of operating over a wide temperature range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW (known as wiggle well) and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by empirical nonlocal pseudopotential theory to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interaction between valley states across different Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature with a focus on wiggle well type structures and compare our results with previous work. Our framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</description>

      <title>Broadband High-Performance Terahertz Polarizers by Nanoimprint Lithography for Advanced Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10029</link>

Abstract: Terahertz polarizers are essential for advanced spectroscopic systems but face challenges like low transmission, short bandwidths and low extinction ratios. This study demonstrates the development of ultrabroadband THz polarizers using nanoimprint lithography, achieving high performance through double-wire-grid polarizer (DWGP) structures on cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) substrates. Compared to silicon-based alternatives, the polymer DWGPs demonstrated over twice the TM-polarized transmittance across the 0.1 - 25 THz range. The degree of polarization exceeded 98% in a 0.1-16 THz range, with a maximum extinction ratio above 65.4 dB at 4.2 THz.
  Simultaneous characterization of materials using THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) covered extended frequency ranges of 0.1 - 40 THz and 0.9 - 20 THz, respectively. Nanofabricated polymer DWGP revealed the superior optical properties, including enhanced TM transmittance and reduced TE leakage when compared to Si DWGP. Additionally, the fabricated polymer polarizers showcased cost-effectiveness, scalability, and durability, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional Si-based polarizers.
  The significant developments demonstrated in this study position polymer-based DWGPs as significant components for THz imaging, sensing, and wireless communication systems, paving the way for next-generation technologies.</description>

      <title>Colossal orbital-Edelstein effect in non-centrosymmetric superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In superconductors that lack inversion symmetry, the flow of supercurrent can induce a non-vanishing magnetization, a phenomenon which is at the heart of non-dissipative magneto-electric effects, also known as Edelstein effects. For electrons carrying spin and orbital moments a question of fundamental relevance deals with the orbital nature of magneto-electric effects in conventional spin-singlet superconductors with Rashba coupling. Remarkably, we find that the supercurrent-induced orbital magnetization is more than one order of magnitude greater than that due to the spin, giving rise to a colossal magneto-electric effect. The induced orbital magnetization is shown to be sign tunable, with the sign change occurring for the Fermi level lying in proximity of avoiding crossing points in the Brillouin zone. In the presence of superconducting phase inhomogeneities, a modulation of the Edelstein signal on the scale of the superconducting coherence length appears, leading to domains with opposite orbital moment orientations. These hallmarks are robust to real-space self-consistent treatment of the superconducting order parameter. The orbital-dominated magneto-electric phenomena, hence, have clear-cut marks for detection both in the bulk and at the edge of the system and are expected to be a general feature of multi-orbital superconductors with inversion symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>SU($N$) altermagnetism: Lattice models, magnon modes, and flavor-split bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a type of magnetic order that combines properties of ferro- and antiferromagnets, has stirred great interest lately not only as a promising source of spintronics applications, but also as a potential gateway to exotic phases of matter. Here, we demonstrate how to generalize collinear altermagnetism to SU($N$) magnets with $N&gt;2$. Guided by symmetry principles, we present a recipe to construct Heisenberg models for such generalized altermagnets and apply it explicitly for $N=3,4$. Using flavor-wave theory, we compute the excitation spectrum of a two-dimensional SU(3) model and show that it exhibits magnon bands with altermagnetic splitting according to magnetic quantum numbers; we connect this quantum-number splitting to the frequently used concept of magnon chirality. We also compute the electronic band structure for a metallic system of the same symmetry and map out the polarization of the resulting flavor-split bands.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional microwave-optical conversion with an integrated soft-ferroelectric barium titanate transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient, low-noise, and high-bandwidth transduction between optical and microwave photons is key to long-range quantum communication between distant superconducting quantum processors. Recent demonstrations of microwave-optical transduction using the broadband direct electro-optic (Pockels) effect in optical thin films made of AlN or LiNbO$_3$ have shown promise. To improve efficiency and added noise, materials with larger Pockels coefficients, such as the soft ferroelectrics BaTiO$_3$ or SrTiO$_3$, are required. However, these materials require adapted designs and fabrication approaches due to their nonlinear and, in some cases, hysteretic electro-optic response. Here, we engineer an on-chip, triply resonant transducer comprising low-loss BaTiO$_3$-on-SiO$_2$ waveguides monolithically integrated with a superconducting microwave resonator made of Nb. We demonstrate bidirectional microwave-optical transduction and reach total off-chip efficiencies of $1\times10^{-6}$ using pulsed pumping. Our novel device concept permits in-situ poling of the ferroelectric material without introducing excess microwave loss, using a fully subtractive fabrication process with superconducting air bridges. In addition, we investigate optically induced heating, revealing fast thermalization and quasiparticle resilience of the microwave resonator. Our transducer concept and fabrication process are applicable to other materials with a large bias-induced Pockels effect and pave the way for efficient, low-power quantum interconnects.</description>

      <title>Optimal control for preparing fractional quantum Hall states in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optomechanical systems with quasi-periodic and chaotic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model optomechanical systems with photon-vibration interactions linear, quadratic, and cubic in mechanical displacements are studied under conditions for adiabatic elimination of the photon field. The opportunity of transformation of effective potential describing the dynamics of the mechanical resonator from single-well to double-well is demonstrated. The dynamics of the mechanical resonator is considered in the presence of (i) only linear interaction, (ii) only quadratic interaction, (iii) both linear and quadratic interactions, and (iv) all three interactions, while other parameters of the optomechanical system, the modulation optical field, and the initial conditions remain fixed. Quasiperiodic oscillations of the mechanical resonator in the case (i) are replaced by chaotic ones when the cases (ii) or (iii) are realized. It is interesting that in the presence of all three interactions, the chaotic behavior of the mechanical oscillator becomes quasi-periodic. However, increasing the power of the modulation field again leads to chaos.</description>
