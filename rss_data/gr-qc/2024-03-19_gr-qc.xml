      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Universality of the Penrose Limit of Black Hole Photon Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the physics of photon rings in a wide range of axisymmetric black holes admitting a separable Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the geodesics. Utilizing the Killing-Yano tensor, we derive the Penrose limit of the black holes, which describes the physics near the photon ring. The obtained plane wave geometry is directly linked to the frequency matrix of the massless wave equation, as well as the instabilities and Lyapunov exponents of the null geodesics. Consequently, the Lyapunov exponents and frequencies of the photon geodesics, along with the quasinormal modes, can be all extracted from a Hamiltonian in the Penrose limit plane wave metric. Additionally, we explore potential bounds on the Lyapunov exponent, the orbital and precession frequencies, in connection with the corresponding inverted harmonic oscillators and we discuss the possibility of photon rings serving as holographic horizons in a holographic duality framework for astrophysical black holes. Our formalism is applicable to spacetimes encompassing various types of black holes, including stationary ones like Kerr, Kerr-Newman, as well as static black holes such as Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, among others.</description>

      <title>The end of spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will highlight that despite there being various approaches to quantum gravity, there are universal approach-independent features of quantum gravity. The geometry of spacetime becomes an emergent structure, which emerges from some purely quantum gravitational degrees of freedom. We argue that these quantum gravitational degrees of freedom can be best understood using quantum information theory. Various approaches to quantum gravity seem to suggest that quantum gravity could be a third quantized theory, and such a theory would not be defined in spacetime, but rather in an abstract configuration space of fields. This supports the view that spacetime geometry is not fundamental, thus effectively ending the spacetime description of nature.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics on (mini)superspace, or a non-linear extension of quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline the content and theoretical support for the proposal of "hydrodynamics on (mini)superspace" (or a non-linear extension of quantum cosmology) as an effective framework for quantum gravity in a cosmological context. The basis for the proposal is a general correspondence between hydrodynamics and cosmology, and a picture of the universe as a quantum gravity condensate. The support comes from several directions. One is from mathematical physics: the hydrodynamics of quantum fluids can be mapped to relativistic cosmological dynamics, and both share the same conformal symmetries, which can be unraveled via geometric methods in superspace. The second is that the proposed framework is realized in quantum gravity formalisms like group field theory, in which an emergent cosmological dynamics can be extracted from the hydrodynamics of fundamental quantum simplices in a condensate phase. The same proposal can be motivated from the idea of 3rd quantization of gravity and from recent work on quantum cosmology, as an effective way of incorporating topology changing processes or cosmological inhomogeneities, respectively. A key conceptual ingredient is the relational understanding of space and time, which makes superspace the natural arena for gravitational dynamics, as opposed to the "spacetime" manifold, together with the general idea of emergent spacetime. The proposal and the results supporting it suggest an exciting dialogue between quantum gravity, the theory of quantum fluids and cosmology, as well as a new direction for analogue gravity simulations in the lab.</description>

      <title>Inspiral Time Probability Distribution for Two Black Holes Captured by Emitting Gravitational Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If two initially unbound black holes of masses M_1 and M_2, total mass M = M_1 + M_2, reduced mass mu = M_1 M_2/(M_1+M_2), and initial relative velocity v &lt;&lt; c(4 mu/M) in otherwise empty space are captured into a bound orbit by emitting gravitational radiation, the inspiral time to coalescence increases monotonically to infinity as the impact parameter b approaches from below the critical impact parameter b_c = [340 pi G^7 M^6 mu/(3 c^5 v^9)]^{1/7} = [(85 pi/384)(4 mu/M)]^{1/7}(2GM/c^2)(v/c)^{-9/7} for capture. Assuming a uniform flux of impinging black holes with b &lt; b_c, the cumulative probability for impact parameters smaller than some value $b$, conditional upon the impact parameter being smaller than $b_c$, is $P = (b/b_c)^2$. Then it is shown that the inspiral time for [Mv^2/(4 mu c^2)]^{2/7} &lt;&lt; P &lt; 1 is T = (2 pi GM/v^3) P^{21/4} zeta(3/2,1-P^{7/2}), and closed-form approximate expressions for the inverse function P(T/T_0) with T_0 = 2 pi GM/v^3 are also given.</description>

      <title>Stability and Dynamics of f(Q,B) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the cosmological implications of a modified $f(Q, B)$ gravity model, incorporating both the nonmetricity scalar ($Q$) and the boundary term ($B$). A generic connection ($\Gamma_{\mu \nu}^{\alpha}$) has been used to define the four-dimensional metric tensor and the covariant derivative ($\nabla_{\mu}$). Statistical analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques constrains the $H(z)$ model free parameters based on observational data from the Cosmic Chronometers (CC) sample, the extended Pantheon$^+$ dataset, and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. This analysis clarifies the deceleration and Equation of State (EoS) parameters and reveals a smooth transition from a deceleration to an accelerating expansion phase on the evolution history of the Universe. The most intriguing finding is identifying a stable critical point within the dynamical system of the model. This critical point corresponds to the de Sitter phase, a well-known era of accelerated expansion. The stability of the critical point suggests that, under specific initial conditions, the trajectory of the Universe will inherently be drawn towards and remain within the de Sitter phase. This aligns with the current observations, indicating Universe dominated by dark energy (DE) and undergoing late-time accelerated expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing recent mathematical advances in proving stability of Minkowski spacetime with minimal decay rates and nonlinear stability of Kerr black holes with small angular momentum, we investigate the detailed asymptotic behaviors of gravitational waves generated in these spacetimes. Here we report and propose a new angular momentum memory effect along future null infinity. This accompanies Christodoulou's nonlinear displacement memory effect and the spin memory effect. The connections and differences to these effects are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from a nonspherical density profile with a misaligned deformation tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the numerical simulation of primordial black hole formation from a nonspherical profile of the initial curvature perturbation $\zeta$. We consider the background expanding universe filled with the perfect fluid with the linear equation of state $p=w\rho$ ($w=1/3$ or $1/5$), where $p$ and $\rho$ are the pressure and the energy density, respectively. The initial condition is set in a way such that the principal directions of the second derivatives of $\zeta$ and $\triangle \zeta$ at the central peak are misaligned, where $\triangle$ is the Laplacian. In this setting, since the linearized density is proportional to $\triangle \zeta$, the inertia tensor and deformation tensor $\partial_i\partial_j \zeta$ are misaligned. Thus tidal torque may act and the spin of a resultant primordial black hole would be non-zero in general, although it is estimated to be very small from previous perturbative analyses.As a result, we do not find a finite value of the spin within our numerical precision, giving support for the negligibly small value of the black hole spin for $1/5\lesssim w \lesssim 1/3$. More specifically, our results suggest that the dimensionless PBH spin $s$ is typically so small that $s\ll0.1$ for $w\gtrsim0.2$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling gravity's quantum fingerprint through gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proposal for an improved theoretical model to illuminate the quantum nature of gravity is given. This model investigates the gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) phenomena, circumventing classical communication constraints of LOCC principle. Here a non-relativistic two dimensional quantum oscillator detector is coupled to linearly polarized gravitational waves (GWs). Exploiting the quantum nature of GWs, we observe the GIE within the oscillator quantum states. Since the model satisfies ``event'' as well as ``system'' localities, the observed GIE is much robust signature for quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Can nonlocal gravity explain dark energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view to scrutinise the idea that nonlocal modifications of \GR~could dynamically address the dark energy problem, we investigate the evolution of the Universe at infrared scales as an \IDG~model of the Ricci scalar, without introducing the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ or any scalar field. The accelerated expansion of the late Universe is shown to be compatible with the emergence of nonlocal gravitational effects at sufficiently low energies. A technique for circumventing the mathematical complexity of the nonlocal cosmological equations is explained and, after drawing a connection with the Starobinsky gravity, verifiable predictions are considered, like a possible decreasing in the strength of the effective gravitational constant.</description>

      <title>Massive Scalar Field Perturbations of Black Holes Immersed in Chaplygin-Like Dark Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider massive scalar field perturbations in the background of black holes immersed in Chaplygin-like dark fluid (CDF), and we analyze the photon sphere modes as well as the de Sitter modes and discuss their dominance, by using the pseudospectral Chebyshev method and the third order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. We also discuss the impact of the parameter representing the intensity of the CDF on both families of quasinormal modes. Mainly, we find that the propagation of a massive scalar field is stable in this background, and it is characterized by quasinormal frequencies with a smaller oscillation frequency and a longer decay time compared to the propagation of the same massive scalar field within the Schwarzschild-de Sitter background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ eth-operators and spin-weighted spherical harmonics to express the ADM mass of a static space-time based on the mean values of its components over a a radius-$r$ sphere. While initially derived for standard spherical coordinates, we showcase its adaptability by demonstrating its usefulness in expressing a quasilocal mass; specifically, the Bartnik mass, of an almost round 2D-hypersurface in terms of some specific boundary conditions. Additionally, we utilize this formulation to propose a deep learning methodology for numerically constructing static metrics that incorporate 2D-hypersurfaces with specified Bartnik mass.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Searches for Post-Merger Remnants of GW170817 and GW190425</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of two searches for gravitational waves from the post-merger remnants of the binary neutron star coalescence events GW170817 and GW190425. The searches are fully coherent over 1800~s of data from the 2nd (for GW170817) and 3rd (for GW190425) observing runs of the LIGO and Virgo observatories. The searches compute the matched filter $\mathcal{F}$-statistic, and use a piecewise model of the rapidly changing frequency evolution appropriate for young neutron stars. No detection is claimed. The peak root-sum-squared strain upper limit at 50\% detection probability ($h_{\text{rss}}^{50\%})$ of both searches occurs at 1700~Hz and is estimated at $1.64 \times 10^{-22}~\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ for GW170817, and $1.0 \times 10^{-22}~\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ for GW190425. This is the first gravitational wave search for a neutron star remnant of GW190425.</description>

      <title>Genuine N-partite entanglement in Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex quantum information tasks in a gravitational background require multipartite entanglement for effective processing. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the properties of multipartite entanglement in a relativistic setting. In this paper, we study genuine N-partite entanglement of massless Dirac fields in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, characterized by the presence of a black hole event horizon (BEH) and a cosmological event horizon (CEH). We obtain the general analytical expression of genuine N-partite entanglement shared by n observers near BEH and m (n+m = N) observers near CEH. It is shown that genuine N-partite entanglement monotonically decreases with the decrease of the mass of the black hole, suggesting that the Hawking effect of the black hole destroys quantum entanglement. It is interesting to note that genuine N-partite entanglement is a non-monotonic function of the cosmological constant, meaning that the Hawking effect of the expanding universe can enhance quantum entanglement. This result contrasts with multipartite entanglement in single-event horizon spacetime, offering a new perspective on the Hawking effect in multi-event horizon spacetime.</description>

      <title>Connecting 2-Forms, Conformal Transformations, Curvature Invariants and Topological Classes in Einstein Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique Nature of the Lorentz group in four dimensions is the root cause of the many remarkable properties of the Einstein spacetimes, in particular their operational structure on the 2-forms. We show how this operational structure can be used for two ends. First, it allows for a simple generalization of the Birkhoff theorem to Schwarzschild (A)de-Sitter spacetime. Second, it provides the means to construct an Abelian endomorphism group on the space of 2-forms. It is observed that taking the trace over this group element-wise induces a further Abelian group which may be identified with a tensor representation of conformal transformations, giving Einstein spacetimes access to their own conformal equivalence class. A further trace over the group yields the curvature invariants of the spacetime. The Kretschmann scalar becomes the topological Euler density, which may be linked in a simple way to the Hawking temperature of horizons.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Model for the Gravitational Wave Signal from Merging Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterised models that predict the gravitational-wave (GW) signal from merging black holes are used to extract source properties from GW observations. The majority of research in this area has focused on developing methods capable of producing highly accurate, point-estimate, predictions for the GW signal. A key element missing from every model used in the analysis of GW data is an estimate for how confident the model is in its prediction. This omission increases the risk of biased parameter estimation of source properties. Current strategies include running analyses with multiple models to measure systematic bias however, this fails to accurately reflect the true uncertainty in the models. In this work we develop a probabilistic extension to the phenomenological modelling workflow for non-spinning black holes and demonstrate that the model not only produces accurate point-estimates for the GW signal but can be used to provide well-calibrated local estimates for its uncertainty. Our analysis highlights that there is a lack of Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations available at multiple resolutions which can be used to estimate their numerical error and implore the NR community to continue to improve their estimates for the error in NR solutions published. Waveform models that are not only accurate in their point-estimate predictions but also in their error estimates are a potential way to mitigate bias in GW parameter estimation of compact binaries due to unconfident waveform model extrapolations.</description>

      <title>Accretion disks and relativistic line broadening in boson star spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the observational properties of static, spherically symmetric boson stars with fourth and sixth-order self-interactions, using the Julia-based general-relativistic radiative transfer code Skylight. We assume the boson stars are surrounded by an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk. We use the Novikov-Thorne model to compute the energy flux, introducing a physically based accretion model around these boson star configurations. Additionally, we calculate the relativistic broadening of emission lines, incorporating a lamppost corona model with full relativistic effects for the first time around a boson star. Our results show distinct observational features between quartic-potential boson stars and Schwarzschild black holes, owing to the presence of stable circular orbits at all radii around the former. On the other hand, compact solitonic boson stars, which possess an innermost stable circular orbit, have observational features closely similar to black holes. This similarity emphasizes their potential as black-hole mimickers. However, the compact boson stars, lacking an event horizon, have complex light-ring structures that produce potentially observable differences from black holes with future generations of experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we investigate some exact cosmological models in the Myrzakulov $F(R,Q)$ gravity or the Myrzakulov gravity-II (MG-II) which was proposed in [arXiv:1205.5266]. Here $R$ and $Q$ are the curvature and nonmetricity scalars using non-special connection, respectively. We have solved field equations in two different contexts using a flat FLRW metric. We have obtained two exact solutions in the form of scale factor $a(t)$, and using this scale factor, we have derived other cosmological parameters. After that using recent observational datasets $H(z)$ and Pantheon SNe Ia, we have obtained best fit constrained values of model parameters by applying the MCMC analysis. Using these best fit values of model parameters, we have discussed the results behaviour of the derived models. We have found that both models are transit phase model and approaches to $\Lambda$CDM model at late-time universe. We have found that the geometrical sector dark equation of state $\omega_{(geom)}$ behaves just like dark energy candidate. Also, we have estimated the transition redshift $z_{t}$ and present age of the universe $t_{0}$ which are consistent with recent observations.</description>

      <title>On the weak and strong field effects in antiscalar background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The triumph of general relativity under the banner "gravity is geometry" began with confirming the crucial effects within the Solar system and proceeded recently to the strong-field shadow effect for the compact object in the center of the Milky Way. Here, we examine some of those phenomena for the Einstein-scalar equations in the antiscalar regime to reveal the difference from vacuum both in weak and strong fields. As a result, we find that for week-field perihelion shift the difference between vacuum and antiscalar cases proves to be observationally imperceptible in practice, even for S-cluster stars with high eccentricities, and even if accumulated over a century. In strong-field case, we reconsider the shadow effect (this time without involving complex-valued scalar field) as the most perspective from an observational viewpoint. Even though the resulting difference is quite appreciable (about 5%), no conclusion can be made until the mass of the central object is known with the accuracy an order of magnitude higher than the currently available.</description>

      <title>Hubble tension in a nonminimally coupled curvature-matter gravity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presently open problem of the Hubble tension is shown to be removed in the context of a modified theory of gravity with a non-minimal coupling between curvature and matter. By evolving the cosmological parameters that match the cosmic microwave background data until their values from direct late-time measurements, we obtain an agreement between different experimental methods without disrupting their individual validity. These modified gravity models are shown to provide adequate fits for other observational data from recent astrophysical surveys and to reproduce the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe without the inclusion of a cosmological constant. This compatibility with observations presents further evidence of the versatility of these models in mimicking diverse cosmological phenomena in a unified manner.</description>

      <title>Hairy Black Holes with Arbitrary Small Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtained new hairy black hole solutions in Einstein-scalar theory, including asymptotic flat, de Sitter and anti-de Sitter black holes. The theory is inspired by Ref. [1], where traversable wormhole solutions from an Einstein-phantom scalar theory are constructed. In this work, we found new black hole solutions in an Einstein-normal scalar theory. Comparing with Schwarzschild metric, the hairy black holes have two interesting properties: i) the areas of the black holes are always smaller than the same mass Schwarzschild black holes; ii) A naked singularity with positive mass arises when the black hole mass decreases. The energy conditions for the black holes and naked singularities are checked. We found that, as hairy black holes, the null energy condition(NEC) and the strong energy condition(SEC) are hold, while the weak energy condition(WEC) is violated in the vicinity of black hole horizon. The naked singularity respects to all three energy conditions. We also investigate the quasinormal modes(QNMs) of the hairy black holes by a test scalar field. The results indicate that one can distinguish hairy black holes with the same mass Schwarzschilid black hole by their QNM spectra.</description>

      <title>Loop Special Relativity: Kaluza-Klein area metric as a line element for stringy events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let a physical event constitute a simple loop in spacetime. This in turn calls for a generalized loop line element (= distance$^2$ between two neighboring loops) capable of restoring, at the shrinking loop limit, the special relativistic line element (= distance$^2$ between the two neighboring center-of-masses, respectively). Sticking at first stage to a flat Euclidean/Minkowski background, one is led to such a preliminary loop line element, where the role of coordinates is played by the oriented cross-sections projected by the loop event. Such cross-sections are generically center-of-mass independent, unless (owing to a topological term) the loop events are intrinsically wrapped around a Kaluza-Klein like compact fifth dimension. Serendipitously, it is the Kaluza-Klein ingredient which, on top of its traditional assignments, is shown to govern the extension of Pythagoras theorem to loop space. Associated with $M_4 \otimes S_1$ is then a 10-dim loop spacetime metric, whose 4-dim center-of-mass core term is supplemented by a 6-dim Maxwell-style fine structure. The imperative inclusion of a positive (say Nambu-Goto) string tension within the framework of Loop Special Relativity is fingerprinted by a low periodicity breathing mode. Nash global isometric embedding is conjectured to play a major role in the construction of Loop General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-reduced Loop Quantum Gravity: Plane Waves, Flat Space and the Hamiltonian Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop quantum gravity methods are applied to a symmetry-reduced model with homogeneity in two dimensions, derived from a Gowdy model [5,6]. The conditions for propagation of unidirectional plane gravitational waves at exactly the speed of light are set up in form of null Killing equations in terms of Ashtekar variables and imposed as operators on quantum states of the system. Due to the effective one-dimensionality, holonomies and holonomy operators appear as simple phase factors. In correspondence, state functions might be considered as U(1) elements with the usual inner product. Under the assumption of equal spacing of the eigenvalues of geometrical quantities the solutions are not normalizable in this sense. With decreasing spacing for growing eigenvalues, as introduced for example in [11], the situation becomes worse. Taking over the inner product from the genuine gauge group SU(2) of LQG renders the obtained states normalizable, nevertheless fluctuations of geometrical quantities remain divergent. In consequence, the solutions of the Killing conditions are modified, which means allowing for small fluctuations of the propagation speed, i. e. dispersion of gravitational waves. Vacuum fluctuations of Minkowski space are sketched. Finally the same methods are applied to the Hamiltonian constraint with the same result concerning normalizability. With such a modification also the constraint is not exactly satisfied any more, which indicates the necessary presence of some kind of interacting matter.</description>

      <title>Dark matter effect on black hole accretion disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparing different dark matter (DM) models, we explore the DM influence on black hole (BH) accretion disk physics, considering corotating and counterrotating thick accretion tori orbiting a central spinning BH. Our results identify accretion onto a central BH as a good indicator of DM presence, signaling possible DM tracers in accretion physics. We analyze accretion around a spinning BH immersed in perfect-fluid dark matter, cold dark matter and scalar field dark matter. Our investigation addresses observational evidence of distinctive DM effects on toroidal accretion disks and protojet configurations, proving that BH accretion tori immersed in DM can present characteristics, such as interdisk cusp or double tori, which have usually been considered as tracers for superspinars and naked singularity attractors. Therefore, in this context DM influence on the BH geometry could manifest as superspinar mimickers. DM also affects the central spinning attractor energetics associated with accretion physics, and its influence on accretion disks can be searched for in a variation of the central BH energetics as an increase of the mass accretion rates.</description>

Abstract: $\Lambda$CDM is challenged by observational tensions between late- and early-time cosmology, most dramatically in the Hubble constant $H_0$. $\Lambda$CDM hereby falls short as an effective infra-red (IR) limit of quantum cosmology. Consistency with general relativity in an effective dark energy $\Lambda=\alpha_p\Lambda_0\sim H^2/c^2$ obtains from an IR-coupling $\alpha_p\sim \hbar$ to the bare cosmological constant $\Lambda_0\sim 1/\hbar$, where $\hbar$ is the Planck constant. A path integral formulation with gauged total phase identifies $\Lambda$ with the trace of the Schouten tensor $J$. It predicts the scaling $H_0\simeq \sqrt{6/5}H_0^{\Lambda{\rm CDM}}$ inferred from the BAO, while preserving the age of the Universe. With no free parameters, this first principle model predicts a 9\% departure in $H_0$ between the Local Distance Ladder and the $\Lambda$CDM {\em Planck} measurements with no tension between late and early times. In galaxies, the same IR coupling predicts a sharp transition to anomalous rotation curves below the de Sitter acceleration $a_{dS}=cH$, where $c$ is the velocity of light. Excluded by galaxy models in $\Lambda$CDM, it points to ultra-light dark matter of mass $m_D\lesssim 3\times 10^{-21}$eV consistent with $m_D\gtrsim 10^{-22}$eV of wave-like $\psi$CDM.</description>

      <title>A Search for Classical Subsystems in Quantum Worlds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoherence and einselection have been effective in explaining several features of an emergent classical world from an underlying quantum theory. However, the theory assumes a particular factorization of the global Hilbert space into constituent system and environment subsystems, as well as specially constructed Hamiltonians. In this work, we take a systematic approach to discover, given a fixed Hamiltonian, (potentially) several factorizations (or tensor product structures) of a global Hilbert space that admit a quasi-classical description of subsystems in the sense that certain states (the "pointer states") are robust to entanglement. We show that every Hamiltonian admits a pointer basis in the factorization where the energy eigenvectors are separable. Furthermore, we implement an algorithm that allows us to discover a multitude of factorizations that admit pointer states and use it to explore these quasi-classical "realms" for both random and structured Hamiltonians. We also derive several analytical forms that the Hamiltonian may take in such factorizations, each with its unique set of features. Our approach has several implications: it enables us to derive the division into quasi-classical subsystems, demonstrates that decohering subsystems do not necessarily align with our classical notion of locality, and challenges ideas expressed by some authors that the propensity of a system to exhibit classical dynamics relies on minimizing the interaction between subsystems. From a quantum foundations perspective, these results lead to interesting ramifications for relative-state interpretations. From a quantum engineering perspective, these results may be useful in characterizing decoherence free subspaces and other passive error avoidance protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hole argument of general relativity threatens a radical and pernicious form of indeterminism. One natural response to the argument is that points belonging to different but isometric models should always be identified, or 'dragged-along', by the diffeomorphism that relates them. In this paper, I first criticise this response and its construal of isometry: it stumbles on certain cases, like Noether's second theorem. Then I go on to describe how the essential features of Einstein\rq{}s `point-coincidence' response to the hole argument avoid the criticisms of the `drag-along response' and are compatible with Noether's second theorem.</description>

      <title>Gedanken Experiments to Destroy a Black Hole by a Test Particle: Multiply Charged Black Hole with Higher Derivative Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a gedanken experiment to destroy an extremally charged black hole by dropping a test particle, provided that there are multiple $U(1)$ gauge fields coupled with each other through higher derivative interactions. In the absence of higher derivative corrections, it is known that the Coulomb repulsion prevents a test particle that would break the extremal condition from falling into an extremal black hole and therefore the black hole cannot be destroyed. We extend this observation to include higher derivative corrections. Although the extremal condition is modified by the higher derivative interactions, we find that the repulsive force induced by the higher derivative couplings is responsible for preventing a test particle that would break the modified extremal condition to reach the event horizon. Thus, we confirm that the weak cosmic censorship conjecture holds for extremally charged black holes even in the presence of higher derivative corrections, as long as the test particle approximation is justified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge-gravity duality provides a robust mathematical framework for studying the behavior of strongly coupled non-abelian plasmas both near and far away from thermodynamic equilibrium. In particular, their near-equilibrium transport coefficients such as viscosity, conductivity, diffusion constants, etc. can be determined from poles of the retarded Green's function which are the dissipative eigenmodes i.e., the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the dual gravitational field equations. The AdS5/CFT4 correspondence admits the description of a strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}$= 4 Supersymmetric Yang Mills (SYM) plasma at non-zero temperature as a dual AdS5 black brane geometry. We demonstrate the application of pseudospectral methods to solving the dual Einstein field equations using the example of homogenous isotropization in $\mathcal{N}$= 4 SYM plasma far from equilibrium. Using this framework, we also compute the quasinormal modes of electrically (Reissner-Nordstrom) and magnetically charged AdS5 black branes for the case of vanishing spatial momenta. The near-extremal behavior of these QNMs is analyzed for both types of black branes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an operational framework, combining relativistic quantum measurement theory with quantum reference frames (QRFs), in which local measurements of a quantum field on a background with symmetries are performed relative to a QRF. This yields a joint algebra of quantum-field and reference-frame observables that is invariant under the natural action of the group of spacetime isometries. For the appropriate class of quantum reference frames, this algebra is parameterised in terms of crossed products. Provided that the quantum field has good thermal properties (expressed by the existence of a KMS state at some nonzero temperature), one can use modular theory to show that the invariant algebra admits a semifinite trace. If furthermore the quantum reference frame has good thermal behaviour (expressed by the existence of a KMS weight) at the same temperature, this trace is finite. We give precise conditions for the invariant algebra of physical observables to be a type $\textnormal{II}_1$ factor. Our results build upon recent work of Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington and Witten [JHEP 2023, 82 (2023)], providing both a significant mathematical generalisation of these findings and a refined operational understanding of their model.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the effect of lens mass models in cosmological applications of strong gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lens system catalogues are typically used to constrain a combination of cosmological and empirical lens mass model parameters, even though the simplest singular isothermal sphere (SIS) models yield a $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom $\simeq 2$. To date, this problem has been alleviated by introducing additional empirical parameters in the extended power law (EPL) models and constraints from high resolution imagery. The EPL parameters are taken to vary from lens to lens, rather than defining universal lens profiles. We investigate these lens models using Bayesian methods through a novel alternative that treats spatial curvature via the non-FLRW Timescape cosmology. We apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods using the catalogue of 161 lens systems of Chen et al (arXiv:1809.09845) to simulate large mock catalogues for: (i) the standard $\Lambda$CDM model with zero spatial curvature; and (ii) the Timescape model. Furthermore, this methodology can be applied to any cosmological model. In agreement with previous results we find that in combination with SIS parameters, models with zero FLRW spatial curvature fit better as the free parameter approaches an unphysical empty universe, $\Omega_{\rm M0}\to0$. By contrast, the Timescape cosmology is found to prefer parameter values in which its cosmological parameter, the present void fraction, is driven to $f_{\rm v0}\to0.73$ matches, close to values found to best fit independent cosmological data sets: supernovae Ia distances and cosmic microwave background. This conclusion holds for a large range of seed values $f_{\rm v0}\to0.73\in\{0.1,0.9\}$, and for Timescape fits to both Timescape and FLRW mocks. Regardless of cosmology, unphysical estimates of the distance ratios given from power-law lens models result in poor goodness of fit. Nonetheless, the results are consistent with non-FLRW spatial curvature evolution.</description>

Abstract: We construct a complete conformal scattering theory for finite energy Maxwell potentials on a class of curved, asymptotically flat spacetimes with prescribed smoothness of null infinity and a non-zero ADM mass. In order to define the full set of scattering data, we construct a Lorenz-like gauge which makes the field equations hyperbolic and non-singular up to null infinity, and reduces to an intrinsically solvable ODE on null infinity. We develop a method to solve the characteristic Cauchy problem from this scattering data based on a theorem of H\"ormander. In the case of Minkowski space, we further investigate an alternative formulation of the scattering theory by using the Morawetz vector field instead of the usual timelike Killing vector field.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures of rotating black holes in the semiclassical gravity with trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work by Fernandes [arXiv:2305.10382], an exact stationary and axisymmetric solution was discovered in semiclassical gravity with type-A trace anomaly, identified as a quantum-corrected version of the Kerr black hole. In this study, we explore the observational signatures of this black hole solution. Our investigation reveals that there exist prograde and retrograde light rings, whose radii increase monotonically with the coupling parameter $\alpha$. We also observe that when $\alpha$ is negative, the shadow area for the quantum-corrected black hole is smaller than that of the Kerr black hole, whereas when $\alpha$ is positive, the area is larger. Furthermore, for a near-extremal black hole, its high-spin feature (the NHEKline) is found to be highly susceptible to disruption by $\alpha$. Moreover, we discuss the images of the quantum-corrected black hole in the presence of a thin accretion disk and compare them to those of the Kerr black hole. Our study highlights the importance of near-horizon emission sources in detecting the effects of quantum corrections by black hole images.</description>

      <title>Spectral-infinite element method approach for computing asymptotically flat initial data sets in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a spectral-infinite element method for solving Einstein's constraint equations in hyperbolic form. As an application of this, we use this method for computing asymptotically flat perturbations of a Kerr black hole with small angular momentum. Our numerical infrastructure is based on the use of a spin-weighted spherical harmonic transform combined with an infinite element method for solving partial differential equations in unbounded domains.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Induced Entanglement of Masses With Extra Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is believed that gravity can be considered as a quantum coherent mediator. In this study, we propose a plan to test the existence of extra dimensions using the Quantum Gravity Induced Entanglement of Masses (QGEM) experiment. This experiment involves two freely falling test masses passing through a Stern-Gerlach-like device. We investigate the entanglement witness between these masses within the framework of the Randall-Sundrum II model (RS-II). Our findings indicate that the system reaches entanglement more rapidly in the presence of extra dimensions, particularly when the radius of the extra dimension is large.</description>

      <title>Shadows of a generic class of spherically symmetric, static spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the characteristics of shadows for a general class of spherically symmetric, static spacetimes, which may arise in general relativity or in modified theories of gravity. The chosen line element involves a sum (with constant but different coefficients) of integer powers of $\frac{1}{\text{r}}$ in $\text{g}_\text{tt}$ and $\text{g}_\text{rr}$, in the Schwarzschild gauge. We begin our discussion by motivating the line element through a study of the energy conditions (null and weak) and the extent to which they are satisfied/violated for diverse choices of the parameters appearing in the metric functions. Subsequently, we construct the circular shadows and analyse the dependence of the shadow radius on the metric parameters. We find that with specific choices of the metric parameters (within the ranges allowed by the energy conditions) one can, in principle, obtain values that conform with recent observations on shadows, as available in the literature. We also mention where such metrics may arise (i.e., in which theory of gravity and the physical scenario therein), thereby proposing that the observed shadows may be representative signatures of different theoretical contexts.</description>

      <title>Horizons that Gyre and Gimble: A Differential Characterization of Null Hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the thermodynamics of black hole solutions conformal to stationary solutions, we study the geometric invariant theory of null hypersurfaces. It is well-known that a null hypersurface in a Lorentzian manifold can be treated as a Carrollian geometry. Additional structure can be added to this geometry by choosing a connection which yields a Carrollian manifold. In the literature various authors have introduced Koszul connections to study the study the physics on these hypersurfaces. In this paper we examine the various Carrollian geometries and their relationship to null hypersurface embeddings. We specify the geometric data required to construct a rigid Carrollian geometry, and we argue that a connection with torsion is the most natural object to study Carrollian manifolds. We then use this connection to develop a hypersurface calculus suitable for a study of intrinsic and extrinsic differential invariants on embedded null hypersurfaces; motivating examples are given, including geometric invariants preserved under conformal transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At present, there is practically no doubt that general relativity is closely related to gravity. Moreover, after the work of Jacobson, Padmanabhan and others, it became clear that a thermodynamic interpretation of Einstein's relativistic equations is possible. On the other hand, we are witnessing the conceptual problems of the SCM (the problem of the cosmological constant, the problem of coincidences) and many years of futile attempts to directly fix the main components of the model (dark energy and dark matter). The combination of these two factors gave rise to a natural desire, at least at the phenomenological level, to build a cosmological model that represents the synthesis of gravity and thermodynamics and does not include components of an unknown nature. It is this model\`uentropic cosmology\`uthat is considered in this review. We have set as our goal, omitting the details that can be found in the references given, to present the conceptual foundations of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an initial data set having a continuous symmetry and a marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS) that is not preserved by this symmetry. We show that such a MOTS is unstable except in an exceptional case. In non-rotating cases we provide a Courant-type lower bound on the number of unstable eigenvalues. These results are then used to prove the instability of a large class of exotic MOTSs that were recently observed in the Schwarzschild spacetime. We also discuss the implications for the apparent horizon in data sets with translational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Relativistic periastron advance beyond Einstein theory: analytical solution with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a new solution to calculate the orbital periastron advance of a test body subject to a central gravitational force field, for relativistic theories and models beyond Einstein. This analitycal formula has general validity that includes all the post-Newtonian (PN) contributions to the dynamics and is useful for high-precision gravitational tests. The solution is directly applicable to corrective potentials of various forms, without the need for numerical integration. Later, we apply it to the Scalar Tensor Fourth Order Gravity (STFOG) and NonCommutative Geometry, providing corrections to the Newtonian potential of Yukawa-like form $V(r)=\alpha \frac{e^{-\beta r}}{r}$, and we conduct the first analysis involving all the PN terms for these theories. The same work is performed with a Schwarzschild geometry perturbed by a Quintessence Field, leading to a power-law potential $V(r)=\alpha_q {r}^q$. Finally, by using astrometric data of the Solar System planetary precessions and those of S2 star around Sgr A*, we infer new theoretical constraints and improvements in the bounds for $\beta$. The resulting simulated orbits turn out to be compatible with General Relativity.</description>

      <title>A Gravitational Waveform Model for Detecting Accelerating Inspiraling Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytic frequency-domain gravitational waveform model for an inspiraling binary whose center-of-mass undergoes a small acceleration, assumed to be constant during the detection, such as when it orbits a distant tertiary mass. The center-of-mass acceleration along the line of sight is incorporated as a new parameter that perturbs the standard TaylorF2 model. We calculate the wave phase to 3rd post-Newtonian order and first order in the acceleration. It is shown that acceleration most significantly modifies the wave phase in the low frequency portion of the signal, so ground-based detectors with a good sensitivity at low frequencies are the most effective at detecting this effect. We present a Fisher information calculation to quantify the detectability of this effect at advanced LIGO A Plus, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope over the mass range of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, and discuss degeneracy between acceleration and other parameters. We also determine the parameter space where the acceleration is large enough that the wave phase model would have to be extended to nonlinear orders in the acceleration.</description>

      <title>Black holes and regular black holes in coincident $f(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{B}_Q)$ gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider an extension of the symmetric teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR), namely, $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, by including a boundary term $\mathbb{B}_Q$, where $\mathbb{Q}$ is the non-metricity scalar. More specifically, we explore static and spherically symmetric black hole and regular black hole solutions in $f(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{B}_Q)$ gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED). In particular, to obtain black hole solutions, and in order to ensure that our solutions preserve Lorentz symmetry, we assume the following relation $f_Q = -f_B$, where $f_{Q}=\partial f/\partial\mathbb{Q}$ and $f_{B}= \partial f/\partial\mathbb{B}_Q$. We develop three models of black holes, and as the starting point for each case we consider the non-metricity scalar or the boundary term in such a way to obtain the metric functions $A(r)$. Additionally, we are able to express matter through analytical solutions for specific NLED Lagrangians ${\cal L}_{\rm NLED}(F)$. Furthermore, we also obtain generalized solutions of the Bardeen and Culetu types of regular black holes, by imposing specific metric functions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical system analysis of DBI scalar field cosmology in coincident $f(Q)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we offer the dynamical system analysis of the DBI (Dirac-Born-Infeld) scalar field in a modified $f(Q)$ gravity context. We have taken a polynomial form of modified gravity and used two different kinds of scalar potential, i.e., polynomial and exponential, and found a closed autonomous dynamical system of equations. We have analyzed the fixed points of such a system and commented on the conditions under which deceleration to late-time acceleration happens in this model. We have noted the similarity of the two models and have also shown that our result is indeed consistent with the previous work done on Einstein's gravity. We have also investigated the phenomenological implications of our models by plotting the EoS ($\omega$), Energy density ($\Omega$), and deceleration parameter ($q$) w.r.t. to e-fold time and comparing with the present value. Finally, we conclude the paper by observing how the dynamical system analysis differs in modified $f(Q)$ gravity, and we also provide some of the future scope of our work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1906.06790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of local type non-Gaussianity on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBH) based on the peak theory. We provide the PBH formation criterion based on the so-called compaction function and use the peak theory statistics associated with the curvature perturbation with the local type non-Gaussianity. Providing a method to estimate the PBH abundance, we demonstrate the effects of non-Gaussianity. It is explicitly shown that the value of non-linear parameter $|f_{\rm NL}| \sim 1$ induces a similar effect to a few factors of difference in the amplitude of the power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Abundance of Primordial Black Holes in Peak Theory for an Arbitrary Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.02425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We modify the procedure to estimate PBH abundance proposed in arXiv:1805.03946 so that it can be applied to a broad power spectrum such as the scale-invariant flat power spectrum. In the new procedure, we focus on peaks of the Laplacian of the curvature perturbation $\triangle \zeta$ and use the values of $\triangle \zeta$ and $\triangle \triangle \zeta $ at each peak to specify the profile of $\zeta$ as a function of the radial coordinate while the values of $\zeta$ and $\triangle \zeta$ are used in arXiv:1805.03946. The new procedure decouples the larger-scale environmental effect from the estimate of PBH abundance. Because the redundant variance due to the environmental effect is eliminated, we obtain a narrower shape of the mass spectrum compared to the previous procedure in arXiv:1805.03946. Furthermore, the new procedure allows us to estimate PBH abundance for the scale-invariant flat power spectrum by introducing a window function. Although the final result depends on the choice of the window function, we show that the $k$-space tophat window minimizes the extra reduction of the mass spectrum due to the window function. That is, the $k$-space tophat window has the minimum required property in the theoretical PBH estimation. Our procedure makes it possible to calculate the PBH mass spectrum for an arbitrary power spectrum by using a plausible PBH formation criterion with the nonlinear relation taken into account.</description>

      <title>Putting Flat $\Lambda$CDM In The (Redshift) Bin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology is specified by two constant fitting parameters at the background level in the late Universe, the Hubble constant $H_0$ and matter density (today) $\Omega_m$. Mathematically, $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ are either integration constants arising from solving ordinary differential equations or are directly related to integration constants. Seen in this context, if fits of the $\Lambda$CDM model to cosmological probes at different redshifts lead to different $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ parameters, this is a mismatch between mathematics and observation. Here, in mock observational Hubble data (OHD) (geometric probes of expansion history) we demonstrate evolution in distributions of best fit parameters with effective redshift. As a result, considerably different $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ best fits from Planck-$\Lambda$CDM cannot be precluded in high redshift bins. We explore if OHD, Type Ia supernovae and standardisable quasar samples exhibit redshift evolution of best fit $\Lambda$CDM parameters. In all samples, we confirm a decreasing $H_0$ and increasing $\Omega_m$ trend with increasing bin redshift. Through comparison with mocks, we confirm that similar behaviour can arise randomly within the flat $\Lambda$CDM model with probabilities as low as $p = 0.0021$ ($3.1 \, \sigma$). We present complementary profile distribution analysis confirming the shifts in cosmological parameters in high redshift bins. In particular, we identify a redshift range where Planck $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ values are disfavoured at $99.6 \%$ ($2.9 \sigma$) confidence level in a combination of OHD and supernovae data.</description>

      <title>Communication protocols and QECCs from the perspective of TQFT, Part I: Constructing LOCC protocols and QECCs from TQFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) provide a general, minimal-assumption language for describing quantum-state preparation and measurement. They therefore provide a general language in which to express multi-agent communication protocols, e.g. local operations, classical communication (LOCC) protocols. Here we construct LOCC protocols using TQFT, and show that LOCC protocols generically induce quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs). Using multi-observer scenarios described by quantum Darwinism and Bell/EPR experiments as examples, we show how these LOCC-induced QECCs effectively convert entanglement into classical redundancy. In the accompanying Part II, we show that such QECCs can be regarded as implementing, or inducing the emergence of, spacetimes on the boundaries between interacting systems. We investigate this connection between inter-agent communication and spacetime using BF and Chern-Simons theories, and then using topological M-theory.</description>

      <title>Implications of GWTC-3 on primordial black holes from vacuum bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16810v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The population of black holes inferred from the detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration has revealed interesting features in the properties of black holes in the Universe. We analyze the GWTC-3 dataset assuming the detected black holes in each event had an either astrophysical or primordial origin. In particular, we consider astrophysical black holes described by the fiducial \textsc{Power Law + Peak} distribution and primordial black holes whose mass function obeys a broken power law. These primordial black holes can be generated by vacuum bubbles that nucleate during inflation. We find that astrophysical black holes dominate the events with mass less than $\sim 30M_\odot$, whereas primordial black holes are responsible for the massive end, and also for the peak at $\sim 30M_\odot$ in the mass distribution. More than half of the observed events could come from primordial black hole mergers. We also discuss the implications on the primordial black hole formation mechanism and the underlying inflationary model.</description>

Abstract: The investigation of the phase state of dense matter is hindered by complications of first-principle nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics. By performing the first consistent general-relativistic calculations of tidal-excited g-mode of neutron stars with a first-order strong interaction phase transition in the high-density core, we demonstrate that gravitational wave signal during binary neutron star inspiral probes their innermost hadron-quark transition and provides potent constraints from present and future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Radial and Non-Radial Oscillations of Inverted Hybrid Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the radial and non-radial oscillations of Cross stars (CrSs), i.e., stars with a quark matter crust and a hadronic matter core in an inverted order compared to conventional hybrid stars. We draw comparisons of their oscillation modes with those of neutron stars, quark stars, and conventional hybrid stars. We find that the stellar stability analysis from the fundamental mode of radial oscillations, and the $g$, $f$ modes of non-radial oscillations are quite similar to those of conventional hybrid stars. However, due to the inverted stellar structure, the first non-radial $p$ mode of CrSs behaves in an inverted way and sits in a higher frequency domain compared to that of conventional hybrid stars. These results provide a direct way to discriminate CrSs from other types of compact stars via gravitational-wave probes. Specifically, compact stars emitting $g$-mode gravitational waves within the $0.5$-$1$ kHz range should be CrSs or conventional hybrid stars rather than neutron stars or pure quark stars, and a further GW detection of the first $p$ mode above 8 kHz or an identification of a decreasing trend of frequencies versus star masses associated with it will help identify the compact object to be a CrS rather than a conventional hybrid star.</description>

      <title>Yang-Baxter deformed wedge holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the wedge holography in the presence of homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformation. We observe that the DGP term is the reason for the existence of non-zero tension of the Karch-Randall branes in Yang-Baxter deformed wedge holography. The homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformation introduce non-trivial island surfaces inside the black hole horizon whose entanglement entropy is lower than the twice of thermal entropy of the black hole. Therefore, we obtain the Page curve even without the DGP term on the Karch-Randall branes due to the homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformation in the context of wedge holography. Finally, we compute the the holographic complexity in homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformed $AdS_2$ background.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Particle Decays during Reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves have become an irreplaceable tool for exploring the post-inflationary universe. Their cosmological and astrophysical origins have been attracting numerous attention. In this Letter, we point out a novel source of ultra-high frequency gravitational waves: the decay of particles produced during the reheating era. We highlight the decay of the Higgs boson as a representative case, showing how it yields a testable gravitational wave spectrum by future observations.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Non-Relativistic Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-relativistic quantum field theory is a framework that describes systems where the velocities are much smaller than the speed of light. A large class of those obey Schr\"{o}dinger invariance, which is the equivalent of the conformal symmetry in the relativistic world. In this review, we pedagogically introduce the main theoretical tools used to study non-relativistic physics: null reduction and $c \rightarrow \infty$ limits, where $c$ is the speed of light. We present a historical overview of non-relativistic wave equations, Jackiw-Pi vortices, the Aharonov-Bohm scattering, and the trace anomaly for a Schr\"{o}dinger scalar. We then review modern developments, including fermions at unitarity, the quantum Hall effect, off-shell actions, and a systematic classification of the trace anomaly. The last part of this review is dedicated to current research topics. We define non-relativistic supersymmetry and a corresponding superspace to covariantly deal with quantum corrections. Finally, we define the Spin Matrix Theory limit of the AdS/CFT correspondence, which is a non-relativistic sector of the duality obtained via a decoupling limit, where a precise matching of the two sides can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Probing supermassive black hole seed scenarios with gravitational wave measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process whereby the supermassive black holes populating the centers of galaxies have been assembled remains to be established, with the relative importance of seeds provided by collapsed Population-III stars, black holes formed in nuclear star clusters via repeated mergers, or direct collapses of protogalactic disks yet to be determined. In this paper we study the prospects for casting light on this issue by future measurements of gravitational waves emitted during the inspirals and mergers of pairs of intermediate-mass black holes, discussing in particular the roles of prospective measurements by LISA and the proposed atom interferometers AION and AEDGE. We find that, the expected number of detectable IMBH binaries is $O(100)$ for LISA and AEDGE and $O(10)$ for AION in low-mass seeds scenarios and goes down to $O(10)$ for LISA and below one for AEDGE and AION in high-mass seed scenarios. This allows all of these observatories to probe the parameters of the seed model, in particular if at least a fraction of the SMBHs arise from a low-mass seed population. We also show that the measurement accuracy of the binary parameters is, in general, best for AEDGE that sees very precisely the merger of the binary.</description>

      <title>BGK subgrid model for neutrino quantum kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new subgrid model for neutrino quantum kinetics, which is primarily designed to incorporate effects of collective neutrino oscillations into neutrino-radiation-hydrodynamic simulations for core-collapse supernovae and mergers of compact objects. We approximate the neutrino oscillation term in quantum kinetic equation by Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) relaxation-time prescription, and the transport equation is directly applicable for classical neutrino transport schemes. The BGK model is motivated by recent theoretical indications that non-linear phases of collective neutrino oscillations settle into quasi-steady structures. We explicitly provide basic equations of the BGK subgrid model for both multi-angle and moment-based neutrino transport to facilitate the implementation of the subgrid model in the existing neutrino transport schemes. We also show the capability of our BGK subgrid model by comparing to fully quantum kinetic simulations for fast neutrino-flavor conversion. We find that the overall properties can be well reproduced in the subgrid model; the error of angular-averaged survival probability of neutrinos is within $\sim 20 \%$. By identifying the source of error, we also discuss perspectives to improve the accuracy of the subgrid model.</description>

      <title>On-shell Bootstrap for n-gluons and gravitons scattering in (A)dS, Unitarity and Soft limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm to recursively bootstrap $n$-point gluon and graviton Mellin-Momentum amplitudes in (A)dS spacetime using only three-point amplitude. We discover that gluon amplitudes are simply determined by factorization for $n\geq 5$. The same principle applies to $n$-point graviton amplitudes, but additional constraints such as flat space and soft limits are needed to fix contact terms. Furthermore, we establish a mapping from $n$-point Mellin-Momentum amplitudes to $n$-point cosmological correlators. We efficiently compute explicit examples up to five points. This leads to the first five-graviton amplitude in $AdS_{d+1}$.</description>

      <title>New quasi-Einstein metrics on a two-sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct all axi-symmetric non-gradient $m$-quasi-Einstein structures on a two-sphere. This includes the spatial cross-section of the extreme Kerr black hole horizon corresponding to $m=2$, as well as a family of new regular metrics with $m\neq 2$ given in terms of hypergeometric functions. We also show that in the case $m=-1$ with vanishing cosmological constant the only orientable compact solution in dimension two is the flat torus, which proves that there are no compact surfaces with a metrisable affine connection with skew Ricci tensor.</description>
