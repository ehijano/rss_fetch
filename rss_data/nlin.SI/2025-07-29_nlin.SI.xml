      <title>Inverse scattering method for an integrable system of derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a solution method for the integrable system (derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger II system) or the Chen--Lee--Liu system. This is done by presenting a solution technique for the inverse scattering problem for the corresponding linear system of ordinary differential equations with energy-dependent potentials. The relevant inverse scattering problem is solved by establishing a system of linear integral equations, which we refer to as the Marchenko system of linear integral equations. In solving the inverse scattering problem we use the input data set consisting of a transmission coefficient, a reflection coefficient, and the bound-state information presented in the form of a pair of matrix triplets. Using our data set as input to the Marchenko system, we recover the potentials from the solution to the Marchenko system. By using the time-evolved input data set, we recover the time-evolved potentials, where those potentials form a solution to the integrable DNLS II system.</description>

      <title>Darboux transformations and related non-Abelian integrable differential-difference systems of the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct linear and quadratic Darboux matrices compatible with the reduction group of the Lax operator for each of the seven known non-Abelian derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations that admit Lax representations. The differential-difference systems derived from these Darboux transformations generalise established non-Abelian integrable models by incorporating non-commutative constants. Specifically, we demonstrate that linear Darboux transformations generate non-Abelian Volterra-type equations, while quadratic transformations yield two-component systems, including non-Abelian versions of the Ablowitz-Ladik, Merola-Ragnisco-Tu, and relativistic Toda equations. Using quasideterminants, we establish necessary conditions for factorising a higher-degree polynomial Darboux matrix with a specific linear Darboux matrix as a factor. This result enables the factorisation of quadratic Darboux matrices into pairs of linear Darboux matrices.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Hermite Polynomials and Calogero-Moser Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are two equivalent descriptions of George Wilson's adelic Grassmannian $Gr^{ad}$, one in terms of differential ``conditions'' and another in terms of Calogero-Moser Pairs. The former approach was used in the 2020 paper by Kasman-Milson which found that each family of Exceptional Hermite Polynomials has a generating function which lives in $Gr^{ad}$. This suggests that Calogero-Moser Pairs should also be useful in the study of Exceptional Hermite Polynomials, but no researchers have pursued that line of inquiry prior to the first author's thesis. The purpose of this note is to summarize highlights from that thesis, including a novel formula for Exceptional Hermite Polynomials in terms of Calogero-Moser Pairs and a theorem utilizing this correspondence to produce explicit finitely-supported distributions which annihilate them.</description>

      <title>The open XYZ spin 1/2 chain: Separation of Variables and scalar products for boundary fields related by a constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the open XYZ spin chain with boundary fields. We solve the model by the new Separation of Variables approach introduced in arXiv:1904.00852. In this framework, the transfer matrix eigenstates are obtained as a particular sub-class of the class of so-called separate states. We consider the problem of computing scalar products of such separate states. As usual, they can be represented as determinants with rows labelled by the inhomogeneity parameters of the model. We notably focus on the special case in which the boundary parameters parametrising the two boundary fields satisfy one constraint, hence enabling for the description of part of the transfer matrix spectrum and eigenstates in terms of some elliptic polynomial Q-solution of a usual TQ-equation. In this case, we show how to transform the aforementioned determinant for the scalar product into some more convenient form for the consideration of the homogeneous and thermodynamic limits: as in the open XXX or XXZ cases, our result can be expressed as some generalisation of the so-called Slavnov determinant.</description>
