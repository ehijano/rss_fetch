      <title>Edge-prompted spin waves probed via magneto-optical effect in the infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in magnonics highlight the need for employing spin wave characteristics as new state variables, which is to be detected and mapped out with high precision in all-onchip, small scale devices. Spin wave modes that are prompted by the sample edges in planar structures are of particular fundamental importance to the future design and characterization of magnonic device functionalities. In this work, we demonstrate an infrared light-based, magneto-optical technique that concurrently functions both as a spectroscopic and an imaging tool. The detected precessional phase contrast can be directly used to construct the map of the spin wave wavefront in the continuous wave regime of spin-wave propagation and in the stationary state, without needing any optical reference path. We experimentally detect the edge spin wave modes of a Y3Fe5O12 film sample, and study the evolution and interference from edge dominated modes to their bulk counterparts. Distinct wavevector groups and propagation characteristics are observed for the edge and bulk spin wave modes. Further, the magnon dispersion relation in the infrared is obtained by Fourier transforming the wavefronts measured in real space, which is a huge advantage to the wavevector-resolved Brillouin light scattering (BLS) technique, where the angle of incidence has to be varied, and is also much less cumbersome than the phase-resolved BLS. Our results demonstrate that the infrared optical strobe light can serve as a versatile platform for magneto-optical probing of magnetization dynamics, with potential implications in investigating hybrid magnonic systems.</description>

      <title>Retrieval of fundamental material parameters of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides from experimental exciton energies: An analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a straightforward and highly accurate method for determining material parameters such as screening length, bandgap energy, exciton reduced mass, and dielectric constant of the surrounding medium using experimental magnetoexciton energies available for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Our approach is based on analytical formulations that allow us to calculate the screening length $r_0$ and bandgap energy $E_g$ directly from the experimental $s$-state exciton energies $E_{1s}$, $E_{2s}$, and $E_{3s}$. We also establish a relationship between the surrounding dielectric constant $\kappa$ and the exciton reduced mass $\mu$. This relationship simplifies the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for a magnetoexciton in a TMDC monolayer, transforming it into a one-parameter equation that depends only on a single material parameter, $\mu$. Therefore, the fitting method is easy to implement, as it compares calculated magnetoexciton energies with experimental data to determine the true exciton reduced mass, the best-fit value of $\mu$. By applying this method, we extract material parameters $E_g$, $r_0$, $\mu$, and $\kappa$ from the magnetoexciton energies of monolayer TMDCs (WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoS$_2$) encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slabs in various current experiments. Additionally, we provide key material properties such as diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii, which are calculated using the extracted parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography of the superfluid-insulator transition for a mesoscopic atomtronic ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a phase-space perspective for the analysis of the superfluid-insulator transition for finite-size Bose-Hubbard circuits. We explore how the eigenstates parametrically evolve as the inter-particle interaction is varied, paying attention to the fingerprints of chaos at the quantum phase-transition. Consequently, we demonstrate that the tomographic spectrum reflects the existence of mixed-regions of chaos and quasi-regular motion in phase-space. This tomographic semiclassical approach is much more efficient and informative compared to the traditional ``level statistics" inspection. Of particular interest is the characterization of the fluctuations that are exhibited by the many-body eigenstates. In this context, we associate with each eigenstate a Higgs measure for the identification of amplitude modes of the order-parameter. Finally we focus on the formation of the lowest Goldstone and Higgs bands.</description>

      <title>Long-lived Zone-boundary Magnons in an Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulators exhibit many desirable features for spintronic applications such as fast dynamics in the THz range and robustness to fluctuating external fields. However, large damping typically associated with THz magnons presents a serious challenge for THz magnonic applications. Here, we report long-lived short-wavelength zone boundary magnons in the honeycomb AFM insulator CoTiO3, recently found to host topological magnons. We find that its zone-boundary THz magnons exhibit longer lifetimes than its zone-center magnons. This unusual momentum-dependent long magnon lifetime originates from several factors including the antiferromagnetic order, exchange anisotropy, a finite magnon gap, and magnon band dispersion. Our work suggests that magnon-magnon interaction may not be detrimental to magnon lifetimes and should be included in future searches for topological magnons.</description>

      <title>Converting $PT$-Symmetric Topological Classes by Floquet Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Going beyond the conventional classification rule of Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, $PT$ symmetric topological phases are classified by $(PT)^2=1$ or $-1$. The interconversion between the two $PT$-symmetric topological classes is generally difficult due to the constraint of $(PT)^2$. Here, we propose a scheme to control and interconvert the $PT$-symmetric topological classes by Floquet engineering. We find that it is the breakdown of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge, induced by the $\pi$ phase difference between different hopping rates, by the periodic driving that leads to such an interconversion. Relaxing the system from the constraint of $(PT)^2$, rich exotic topological phases, e.g., the coexisting $PT$-symmetric first-order real Chern insulator and second-order topological insulators not only in different quasienergy gaps, but also in one single gap, are generated. In contrast to conventional Floquet topological phases, our result provides a way to realize exotic topological phases without changing symmetries. It enriches the family of topological phases and gives an insightful guidance for the development of multifunctional quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Metamorphic quantum dot arrays in twisted trilayer hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large set of controlled quantum states with tunable spacing and interactions is crucial in understanding and engineering novel quantum materials for quantum information processing. Such achievements have been mostly confined to atomic physics, exemplified by ordered arrays of neutral atoms or trapped ions. In solid-state systems, well-ordered quantum dots (QDs), in particular, also have significant potential for these applications. However, their precise large-scale fabrication and on-demand reconfigurations remain important challenges. Here, we predict that twisted trilayer hexagonal boron nitride hosts well-defined QD arrays with spatial precision and symmetry control as well as exceptional dynamic repositioning. These arrays emerge naturally at ultrasmall twist angles, forming diverse domain configurations including triangular, kagome and hexagram arrangements. The quantum states within each dot exhibit high fidelity to quantum harmonic oscillator wavefunctions, realizing uniform dot states as long as the moire-of-moire lattice is well ordered. Uniquely, we demonstrate that these arrays can be dynamically reconfigured via external electric fields coupled to local electric polarizations, allowing continuous tuning between regimes of strong coupling and complete isolation, and offering a pathway to long-ranged quantum information shuttling. This tunability and uniformity distinguish our platform from conventional implementations and suggest substantial potential for quantum applications, from array-based single-photon sources to scalable quantum processors, establishing twisted van der Waals systems as a promising platform for programmable quantum architectures with spatial and energetic control.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced DC Hall current in few-layer black phosphorus with a gate-tunable Floquet gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically explore Floquet engineering in few-layer black phosphorus (fBP) under time-periodic driving. Motivated by the ability of circularly polarized light to induce nontrivial topological states at Dirac nodes, we investigate the emergence of a photoinduced DC Hall effect in the Dirac semimetal phase of fBP. Starting from a low-energy continuum model, we derive the effective Floquet Hamiltonian and analytically calculate the Berry curvature, demonstrating the opening of a topological gap. We also perform lattice-model calculations incorporating a self-consistent Hartree method to compute Floquet band structures and DC Hall conductivity under a perpendicular electric field. Our results reveal that the DC Hall current in fBP can be effectively tuned via a periodic driving field and electrostatic gating.</description>

      <title>Layered semiconductors integrated with polyimide thin films for high-quality valleytronic and quantum-photonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric integration of layered semiconductors is a prerequisite for fabricating high-quality optoelectronic, valleytronic, and quantum-photonic devices. While hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is the current benchmark dielectric, exploration of the most suitable dielectric materials covering the complete substrates continues to expand. This work demonstrates the formation of high optical-quality excitons in two widely explored layered semiconductors, WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$, integrated into polyimide (PI) thin films of thicknesses $\approx$500 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) studies at $T$ = 296 K show the formation of neutral excitons $\left(X^0\right)$ and trions in fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ with 2-sigma ($2\sigma$) spatial-inhomogeneity of 4.5 (3.4) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth), which is $\approx$1/3rd (1/5th), respectively, that of inhomogeneity measured in fully-hBN-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$. A smaller $2\sigma$ of 2.1 (2.3) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth) has been shown for fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WS$_2$. Polarization-resolved and excitation power-dependent PL measurements of PI-isolated 1L-TMDs at $T$ = 4 K further reveal formations of high-quality neutral-biexcitons and negatively-charged biexcitons, with degrees of valley-polarization up to 21$\%$ under non-resonant excitation. Furthermore, the fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ also hosts single quantum emitters with narrow linewidths and high-spectral stability. This work indicates that PI thin films may serve the purpose of high-quality dielectric material for integrating the layered materials on a wafer scale.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Hopf insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopf insulators represent a unique class of topological insulators that exist exclusively in two-band systems and are inherently unstable upon the inclusion of additional bands. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that non-Hermiticity gives rise to distinctive complex-energy gap structures, known as point gaps, and associated topological phases with no analogs in Hermitian systems. However, non-Hermitian counterparts of Hopf insulators have remained largely elusive. Here, we generally classify topological phases of two-band non-Hermitian systems based on the homotopy theory and uncover Hopf-type point-gap topology present only for two bands. Specifically, we reveal such Hopf-type point-gap topology for three-dimensional systems with chiral symmetry (class AIII) and four-dimensional systems with no symmetry (class A). Explicitly constructing prototypical models from the Hermitian Hopf insulator, we further demonstrate that these non-Hermitian topological phases lead to anomalous point-gapless boundary states spectrally detachable from the bulk bands.</description>

      <title>Probing Loop Currents and Collective Modes of Charge Density Waves in Kagome Materials with NV Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the unconventional charge density wave (CDW) order with loop currents has attracted considerable attention in the Kagome material family AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs). However, experimental signatures of loop current order remain elusive. In this work, based on the mean-field free energy, we analyze the collective modes of unconventional CDW order in a Kagome lattice model. Furthermore, we point out that phase modes in the imaginary CDW (iCDW) order with loop current orders result in time-dependent stray fields. We thus propose using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to detect these time-dependent stray fields, providing a potential experimental approach to identifying loop current order.</description>

      <title>The Role of Flexoelectric Coupling and Chemical Strains in the Emergence of Polar Chiral Nano-Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review examines the conditions that lead to the formation of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in thin films and core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. It also analyzes possible mechanisms by which the flexoelectric effect impacts the polarization structure in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. Special attention is given to the role of the anisotropic flexoelectric effect in forming a unique type of polarization states with distinct chiral properties, referred to as "flexons". In the first part of the review, we study the influence of the flexoelectric coupling on the polarity, chirality and branching of metastable labyrinthine domain structures in uniaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. We reveal that the transition from sinuous branched domain stripes to spiral-like domains occurs gradually as the flexoelectric coupling strength is increased. Our findings indicate that the joint action of flexoelectric effect and chemical strains, termed as "flexo-chemical" coupling, can significantly influence the effective Curie temperature, polarization distribution, domain morphology, and chirality in multiaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of flexo-chemical coupling and screening effects leads to the appearance and stabilization of a chiral polarization morphology in nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectrics. In the second part of the review, we discuss several advanced applications of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles for nanoelectronics elements and cryptography. We underline the possibilities of the flexoelectric control of multiple-degenerated labyrinthine states, which may correspond to a differential negative capacitance (NC) state stabilized in the uniaxial ferroelectric core by the presence of a screening shell.</description>

      <title>Bolometric Superconducting Optical Nanoscopy (BOSON)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting transition-edge sensors are renowned for their extraordinary photon sensitivity and energy resolution, finding applications spanning quantum information, astronomy, and nanophotonics. Here, we report the development of BOlometric Superconducting Optical Nanoscopy (BOSON), a novel platform that integrates bolometric detection at the superconducting transition edges with near-field optical techniques. BOSON enables the mapping of photoinduced changes in superconductivity with unprecedented spatial resolution and photon sensitivity. By incorporating BOSON with low-dimensional materials, we achieved polariton imaging at nanowatt excitation levels--at least four orders of magnitude lower than the power typically required in prior near-field nanoscopy experiments. Our findings highlight the potential for BOSON to advance scanning probe based optical platforms to enable the detection of photons, polaritons, and Cooper pair dynamics at the nanoscale. This paves the way for quantum sensing applications using single-polariton detection and can offer deeper insights into quasiparticle dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Review on the Applications of Density Functional Theory to the FQH System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect remains a captivating area in condensed matter physics, characterized by strongly correlated topological order, fractionalized excitations, and anyonic statistics. Numerical simulations, such as exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, matrix product states, and Monte Carlo methods, are essential to examine the properties of strongly correlated systems. Recently, density functional theory (DFT) has been employed in this field within the framework of composite fermion (CF) theory. In this paper, we assess how DFT addresses major challenges in FQH system, such as computing ground state and low-energy excitations. We emphasize the critical insights provided by DFT-based methods into the CF model, edge effects, and the nature of fractional charge and magnetoroton excitations. Furthermore, we examine the advantages and limitations of DFT approaches, highlight the interplay between numerical simulations and theoretical models. We finally discuss the future potential of time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) for modeling non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically explore the low-energy behavior of a Josephson tunnel junction coupled to a finite-length, charge-biased transmission line and compare it to its flux-biased counterpart. For transmission lines of increasing length, we show that the low-energy charge-dependent energy bands of the charge-biased configuration can be exactly mapped onto those of the flux-biased system via a well-defined duality transformation of circuit parameters. In the limit of an infinitely long transmission line, the influence of boundary conditions vanishes, and both circuits reduce to a resistively shunted Josephson junction. This convergence reveals the system's intrinsic self-duality and critical behavior. Our exact formulation of charge-flux duality provides a foundation for generalizations to more complex superconductor-insulator phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Page curve like dynamics in Interacting Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement in a one-dimensional $XXZ$ spin-$1/2$ chain, with and without integrability-breaking interactions, that is connected to a bath. We start from a state where the system and bath are completely unentangled, and the bath is polarized spin-down. We consider two different initial states for the system - (i) a polarized spin-up state, and (ii) an infinite temperature state. In the particle representation of the spin chain, the polarized spin-up state corresponds to a filled state, while the polarized spin-down state corresponds to an empty state. Starting from these inhomogeneous quenches, in all the above-mentioned cases we obtain the Page curve like behavior in the entanglement. We report different power-law behavior in the growth of entanglement for different initial states and different kinds of baths (interacting and non-interacting). In an attempt to explore plausible deep connections between entanglement and Boltzmann entropy, we investigate the latter in both the filled and the infinite temperature case, for the system and the bath. For the filled case, the Boltzmann entropy of the system has the form of a Page curve but quantitatively deviates from the entanglement. On the other hand, the entropy of the bath keeps increasing. Remarkably, for the infinite temperature case, we find that the system and bath Boltzmann entropies agree with the entanglement entropy, after and before the Page time, respectively. Our findings are expected to hold for generic interacting quantum systems and could be of relevance to black hole physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral characterization of quantum emitter luminescence over broad wavelength ranges and fast timescales is important for applications ranging from biophysics to quantum technologies. Here we present the application of time-domain Fourier transform spectroscopy, based on a compact and stable birefringent interferometer coupled to low-dark-count superconducting single-photon detectors, to the study of quantum emitters. We experimentally demonstrate that the system enables spectroscopy of quantum emitters over a broad wavelength interval from the near-infrared to the telecom range, where grating-based spectrometers coupled to InGaAs cameras are typically noisy and inefficient. We further show that the high temporal resolution of single-photon detectors, which can be on the order of tens of picoseconds, enables the monitoring of spin-dependent spectral changes on sub-nanosecond timescales.</description>

      <title>Origin of magic angles in twisted bilayer graphene: The magic ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unexpected discovery of superconductivity and strong electron correlation in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), a system containing only sp electrons, is considered as one of the most intriguing developments in two-dimensional materials in recent years. The key feature is the emergent flat energy bands near the Fermi level, a favorable condition for novel many-body phases, at the so-called "magic angles". The physical origin of these interesting flat bands has been elusive to date, hindering the construction of an effective theory for the unconventional electron correlation. In this work, we have identified the importance of charge accumulation in the AA region of the moire supercell and the most critical role of the Fermi ring in AA-stacked bilayer graphene. We show that the magic angles can be predicted by the moire periodicity determined by the size of this Fermi ring. The resonant criterion in momentum space makes it possible to coherently combine states on the Fermi ring through scattering by the moire potential, leading to flat bands near the Fermi level. We thus establish the physical origin of the magic angles in TBG and identify the characteristics of one-particle states associated with the flat bands for further many-body investigations.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by recent advances in observational astrophysics and continued explorations in the field of analog gravity, we discuss the prospect of simulating models of cosmology within the context of synthetic mechanical lattice experiments. We focus on the physics of expanding Universe scenarios described by the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Specifically, quantizing scalar fluctuations in a background FLRW spacetime leads to a quadratic bosonic Hamiltonian with temporally varying pair production terms. Here we present a mapping that provides a one-to-one correspondence between these classes of cosmology models and feedback-coupled mechanical oscillators. As proof-of-principle, we then perform experiments on a synthetic mechanical lattice composed of such oscillators. We simulate two different FLRW expansion scenarios with Universes dominated by vacuum energy and matter and discuss our experimental results.</description>

      <title>Magnetic nutation: transient separation of magnetization from its angular momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For nearly 90 years, precession and relaxation processes have been thought to dominate magnetization dynamics. Only recently has it been considered that, on short time scales, an inertia-driven magnetization dynamics should become relevant, leading to additional nutation of the magnetization vector. Here, we trigger magnetic nutation via a sudden excitation of a thin Ni80Fe20 (Permalloy) film with an ultrashort optical pulse, that leads to an abrupt tilting of the effective field acting on the magnetic moments, separating the dynamics of the magnetization from that of its angular momentum. We investigate the resulting magnetization dynamics in the inertial regime experimentally by the time-resolved magneto optical Kerr effect. We find a characteristic oscillation in the Kerr signal in the range of about 0.1 THz superimposed on the precessional oscillations with GHz frequencies. By comparison with atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that this observation cannot be explained by the well-known Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of motion but can be attributed to inertial contributions leading to nutation of the magnetization vector around its angular momentum. Hence, an optical and non-resonant excitation of inertial magnetization dynamics can trigger and control different magnetic processes, ranging from demagnetization via nutation to precession in a single device. These findings will have profound implications for the understanding of ultrafast spin dynamics and magnetization switching.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically study spin pumping into a spin-nematic state in a junction system composed of a ferromagnetic insulator and a spin-nematic insulator, described by using the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model. We analyze an increase of the Gilbert damping in ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) due to an interfacial exchange coupling within a mean-field theory based on the Schwinger boson method. We find that the two Schwinger bosons contribute in distinct ways to spin pumping. We report a detailed dependence of the spin pumping on a resonant frequency, a magnetic field, and an interface type.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Hubbard U parameters for Enhanced Description of Electronic and Magnetic Properties in CrI$_3$ Monolayers and Bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of CrI$_3$ monolayers, which were recently measured, have been investigated considering electronic repulsion and localization effects in Cr 3d orbitals. In this study, we propose a DFT approach using Hubbard U corrections to improve accuracy. We compare the valence density-of-states using the HSE06 hybrid functional and the DFT+U approach, which includes U parameters for both Cr 3d and I 5p orbitals. The results of our study indicate that the optimal values for U(Cr$_{3d}$) and U(I$_{5p}$) are 3.5 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. This approach is further applied to improve calculations of electronic and magnetic properties in CrI$_3$ monolayers and, more importantly, in bilayers combined with van der Waals functionals. These refinements hold promise for further studies of complex CrI$_3$ nanostructures, and may also be of interest for other trihalide few-layer systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent quantum phase transition of a Josephson junction coupled to a high-impedance multimode resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics of a single Josephson junction coupled to a resistive environment is a long-standing fundamental problem at the center of an intense debate, strongly revived by the advent of superconducting platforms with high-impedance multimode resonators. Here we investigate the emergent criticality of a junction coupled to a multimode resonator when the number of modes is increased. We demonstrate how the multimode environment renormalizes the Josephson and capacitive energies of the junction so that in the thermodynamic limit the charging energy dominates when the impedance is larger than the resistance quantum and is negligible otherwise, independently from the bare ratio between the two energy scales and the compact or extended nature of the phase of the junction. Via exact diagonalization, we find that the transition surprisingly stems from a level anticrossing involving not the ground state, but the first excited state, whose energy gap vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. We clarify the nature of the two phases by pointing at a different behaviour of the ground and excited states and we show that at the transition point the spectrum displays universality not only at low frequencies. In agreement with recent experiments, we reveal striking spectral signatures of the phase transition.</description>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic spintronics offers the potential for higher-frequency operations and improved insensitivity to magnetic fields compared to ferromagnetic spintronics. However, previous electrical techniques to detect antiferromagnetic dynamics have utilized large, millimeter-scale bulk crystals. Here we demonstrate direct electrical detection of antiferromagnetic resonance in structures on the few-micrometer scale using spin-filter tunneling in PtTe$_2$/bilayer CrSBr/graphite junctions in which the tunnel barrier is the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr. This sample geometry allows not only efficient detection, but also electrical control of the antiferromagnetic resonance through spin-orbit torque from the PtTe$_2$ electrode. The ability to efficiently detect and control antiferromagnetic resonance enables detailed studies of the physics governing these high frequency dynamics.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature fermionic charge and current densities in conical space with a circular edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the finite temperature and edge induced effects on the charge and current densities for a massive spinor field localized on a 2D conical space threaded by a magnetic flux. The field operator is constrained on a circular boundary, concentric with the cone apex, by the bag boundary condition and by the condition with the opposite sign in front of the term containing the normal to the edge. In two-dimensional spaces there exist two inequivalent representations of the Clifford algebra and the analysis is presented for both the fields realizing those representations. The circular boundary divides the conical space into two parts, referred as interior (I-) and exterior (E-) regions. The radial current density vanishes. The edge induced contributions in the expectation values of the charge and azimuthal current densities are explicitly separated in the both regions for the general case of the chemical potential. They are periodic functions of the magnetic flux and odd functions under the simultaneous change of the signs of magnetic flux and chemical potential. In the E-region all the spinorial modes are regular and the total charge and current densities are continuous functions of the magnetic flux. In the I-region the corresponding expectation values are discontinuous at half-integer values of the ratio of the magnetic flux to the flux quantum. 2D fermionic models, symmetric under the parity and time-reversal transformations (in the absence of magnetic fields) combine two spinor fields realizing the inequivalent representations of the Clifford algebra. The total charge and current densities in those models are discussed for different combinations of the boundary conditions for separate fields. Applications are discussed for electronic subsystem in graphitic cones described by the 2D Dirac model.</description>

Abstract: Molecular nanomagnets are systems with a vast phenomenology and are very promising for a variety of technological applications, most notably spintronics and quantum information. Their low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties can be modeled using effective spin Hamiltonians, once the exchange coupling parameters between the localized magnetic moments are determined. In this work we employ density functional theory (DFT) to compute the exchange parameters between the atomic spins for two representative ring-shaped molecules containing eight transition-metal magnetic ions: Cr$_8$ and V$_8$. Considering a set of properly chosen spin configurations and mapping their DFT energies on the corresponding expressions from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we compute the exchange couplings between magnetic ions which are first, second and further neighbors on the rings. In spite of their chemical and structural similarities the two systems exhibit very different ground states: antiferromagnetic for Cr$_8$, ferromagnetic for V$_8$, which also features non-negligible couplings between second nearest neighbors. A rationalization of these results is proposed that is based on a multi-band Hubbard model with less-than-half filled shells on magnetic ions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider unconventional magnets with proximity-induced superconductivity and investigate the emergence of superconducting correlations by carrying out a full classification of allowed Cooper pair symmetries. In particular, we focus on $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets under the influence of spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductivity induced by proximity effect. Under generic conditions, we find that unconventional magnets not only drive a spin-singlet to spin-triplet conversion but also they transfer their parity symmetry that induces superconducting correlations with higher angular momentum. For instance, a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor with $d$-wave altermagnetism is able to host odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $d$-wave superconducting pair amplitudes, while when combining with $p$-wave magnetism the emerging superconducting pairing acquires an even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $p$-wave symmetry. We further demonstrate that unconventional magnetism produces even more exotic superconducting correlations in spin-singlet $d$-wave superconductors, where odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $g$-wave and even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $f$-wave pair symmetries are possible in altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets, respectively. We also discuss how these ideas generalize to spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductors and also show how our results can be applied to unconventional magnets with higher angular momentum, such as with $f$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave symmetries. Our results can help understand the emergent superconducting correlations due to the interplay of unconventional magnetism and superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong electron-electron interaction can induce Mott insulating state, which is believed to host unusual correlated phenomena such as quantum spin liquid when quantum fluctuation dominates and unconventional superconductivity through doping. Transition metal compounds as correlated materials provide a versatile platform to engineer the Mott insulating state. Previous studies mostly focused on the controlling of the repulsive interaction and bandwidth of the electrons by gating or doping. Here, we performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on monolayer 1T phase NbSe2, TaSe2, and TaS2 and directly observed their band structures with characteristic lower Hubbard bands. By systematically investigating the orbital textures and temperature dependence of the energy gap of the materials in this family, we discovered that hybridization of the chalcogen p states with lower Hubbard band stabilizes the Mott phase via tuning of the bandwidth, as shown by a significant increase of the transition temperature (TC) at a stronger hybridization strength. Our findings reveal a mechanism for realizing a robust Mott insulating phase and establish monolayer 1T phase transition metal dichalcogenide family as a promising platform for exploring correlated electron problems.</description>

Abstract: Periodic driving is a powerful tool to generate exotic topological phases without static counterparts, such as the anomalous chiral edge modes from bulk bands with zero Chern number and topological $\pi$ modes exhibiting period-doubled dynamics. Recently, a new class of Floquet topological mode, namely the $\pi/2$ mode, which carries four-period periodicity and has potential applications in quantum computing, was proposed based on a square-root method and realized in an acoustic system. Here we propose a laser-written waveguide array lattice to realize topological $\pi/2$ modes in photonics. Our photonic model simulates a square-root periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and has a rich phase diagram allowing for the co-existence of conventional zero, $\pi$ modes, and the new $\pi/2$ modes. Through numerical simulations of the wave equation, we uncover the unique four-period evolution feature of the $\pi/2$ modes. Our model, which only contains four waveguides per unit cell and two driving steps, is easy to implement with current fabrication techniques and may find applications in quantum optics.</description>
