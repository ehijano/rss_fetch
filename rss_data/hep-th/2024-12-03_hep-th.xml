      <title>A non-perturbative construction of the de Sitter late-time boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach for constructing the late-time conformal boundary of quantum field theory in de Sitter spacetime. A boundary theory which consists of a continuous family of primary operators residing on unitary irreducible representations, the principal series. These boundary operators exhibit two-point functions that include contact terms alongside standard CFT two-point functions. We introduce a bulk-to-boundary expansion in which a bulk operator, when pushed to the boundary, is represented as an integral over boundary operators. The kernel of this integral is related to the K\"all\'en-Lehmann spectral density, and we examine the convergence of the expansion by deriving the spectral density's large dimension limit. Additionally, we derive an inversion formula for the bulk-to-boundary expansion, where, given a bulk theory, the boundary operator content is constructed as an integral of the bulk operator times the bulk-to-boundary propagator. We verify the inversion formula by recovering the boundary two-point function and reproducing perturbation theory. Along the way, we define an operator that generates both the bulk-to-boundary and free bulk-to-bulk propagators from the boundary two-point function, proving to be a powerful tool for simplifying de Sitter diagrams.</description>

      <title>String theory and the SymTFT of 3d orthosymplectic Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the 3d ${\cal N}=5$ Chern-Simons-Matter theory with orthosymplectic gauge group and its gravity dual from the perspective of generalized symmetries. We derive the corresponding 4d symmetry topological field theory from the gravity dual and relate the allowed boundary conditions to the different variants of the 3d theory. Concentrating on a specific variant that has a discrete non-abelian global symmetry, we explain how the structure of this symmetry arises from brane dynamics.</description>

      <title>Compactification on Calabi-Yau threefolds: Consistent truncation to pure supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study compactifications of eleven- and ten-dimensional maximal supergravity on Calabi-Yau threefolds. We explicitly construct truncations to pure supergravity with eight supercharges in five and four dimensions and show that they are consistent, i.e. that every solution of the lower-dimensional equations of motion fully solves the higher-dimensional ones. We furthermore match the supersymmetry transformations and demonstrate the consistency to full non-linear order in fermions. Our construction is independent of the choice of Calabi-Yau threefold and only involves the universal structures such as the K\"ahler form and the holomorphic three-form, in agreement with implicit constructions in the generalised geometry literature. As an immediate application, we embed four-dimensional extremal black holes in the higher-dimensional supergravities. We furthermore propose Ans\"atze for consistent truncations on all universal structures, leading to supergravities with additional matter multiples. An extensive list of equations of motion and supersymmetry transformations for various supergravity theories is provided in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping leading hadronic muon anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We bootstrap the leading order hadronic contribution to muon anomalous magnetic moment. The leading hadronic contribution comes from the hadronic vacuum polarization function (HVP). We explore the bootstrap constraints, namely unitarity, analyticity, crossing symmetry and finite energy sum rules (FESR) from quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The unitarity appears as a positive semi-definite condition among the pion partial waves, form factor and spectral density function of HVP, which establishes a lower bound on leading order hadronic contribution to muon anomalous magnetic moment. We also impose chiral symmetry breaking to improve the bound slightly. By combining the lower bound with the remaining extensively calculated contributions, we achieve a bound on anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu^\text{bootstrap-min}=11659176.3^{+3}_{-3}\times 10^{-10}$ and standard model prediction saturates this bound within the error bars. We also present a possible improvement that is saturated by both lattice computation and measured value within the error bars.</description>

      <title>Quantum corrections to DGKT and the Weak Gravity Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study D4 brane domain walls in the scale-separated 4d $\mathcal{N}$=1 AdS$_4$ DGKT scenario. Classically, these are BPS and satisfy a no-force condition since their tension equals their charge. We show that this property is not stable against quantum corrections and that these increase the brane tension-to-charge ratio, rendering the branes self-attractive. As a result, DGKT seems to be in tension with the Weak Gravity Conjecture for membranes. The quantum effects we consider include non-perturbative gaugino condensation on the D4-brane worldvolume and Euclidean D2 brane instantons, which correct the tension-to-charge ratio because the DGKT construction breaks all parity symmetries. Similar results hold in other 4d $\mathcal{N}$=1 setups not protected by parity symmetries.</description>

      <title>Renyi entropy of single-character CFTs on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a non-perturbative approach to calculate the R\'enyi entropy of a single interval on the torus for single-character (meromorphic) conformal field theories. Our prescription uses the Wro\'nskian method of Mathur, Mukhi and Sen, in which we construct differential equations for torus conformal blocks of the twist two-point function. As an illustrative example, we provide a detailed calculation of the second R\'enyi entropy for the $\rm E_{8,1}$ WZW model. We find that the $\mathbb Z_2$ cyclic orbifold of a meromorphic CFT results in a four-character CFT which realizes the toric code modular tensor category. We show that the $\mathbb Z_2$ cyclic orbifold of the $\rm E_{8,1}$ WZW model yields a three-character CFT since two of the characters coincide. We find that the second R\'enyi entropy for the $\rm E_{8,1}$ WZW model has the universal logarithmic divergent behaviour in the decompactification limit of the torus as expected. Furthermore, we see that the $q$-expansion is UV finite, apart from the leading universal logarithmic divergence.</description>

      <title>Mass Hierarchy of Z(2) Monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we establish every spherically symmetric non-Abelian Z(2) monopole generated by su(2) embeddings in the SU(4) Yang-Mills-Higgs model minimally broken to SO(4) by a symmetric second-rank tensor Higgs field. We find new monopole solutions associated with index 4 and index 10 embeddings. These solutions belong to su(2) multiplets that are higher dimensional than triplets. Properties of these monopoles such as their mass and radius are calculated in the vanishing potential limit. A parallel between this result and the Standard Model hierarchy of fermion masses is considered.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping $\mathcal{N} = 4$ sYM correlators using Integrability and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study four-point correlation functions of the stress-tensor multiplet in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ super Yang-Mills (sYM) theory by leveraging integrability and localization techniques. We combine dispersive sum rules and spectral information from integrability, used previously, with integrated constraints from supersymmetric localization. We obtain two-sided bounds on the OPE coefficient of the so-called Konishi operator in the planar limit at any value of the 't Hooft coupling ranging from weak to strong coupling. In addition to individual OPE coefficients, we discuss how to bound the correlation function itself and obtain two-sided bounds at various values of the cross-ratios and coupling. Lastly, considering the limit of large 't Hooft coupling, we connect the analysis with that of an analogous flat space problem involving the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude.</description>

      <title>More on scattering processes of dressed particles with a time-dependent mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the scattering process of a scalar field having a time-dependent mass with another scalar field having a constant mass as a toy model of the scattering problems during preheating after inflation. Despite a general difficulty of analytically solving such models, in our previous work [1], we considered an exactly calculable model of such scattering processes with a time-dependent mass of the form $m^2(t)\supset \mu^4t^2$ and the time-dependence never disappears formally. In this work, we discuss another exactly calculable model with a time-dependent mass that has a spike/peak but asymptotes to a constant, which effectively appears in the preheating model of Higgs inflation with a non-minimal coupling. Thanks to the localized time-dependence of the mass, the daughter particle number density behaves in a physically reasonable way contrary to the one in our previous model due to the infinite time-dependent mass in the asymptotic future. On the other hand, we find that the daughter particle experiences the kinematically forbidden process, which is a non-perturbative phenomenon found in our previous work. As in the previous model, the kinematically forbidden process produces daughter particles exponentially more than the parent particle having the time-dependent mass, which never happens for particle decay processes without time-dependent backgrounds. This result supports the existence of such a non-perturbative particle production process in general time-dependent backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous transformations in a gauged twistor formulation of a massive particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the mass-shell constraints in the gauged twistor formulation of a massive particle given in [Phys. Rev. D 93, 045016 (2016)] are incorporated in an action automatically by extending the local $U(2)$ transformation to its inhomogeneous extension denoted by $IU(2)$. Therefore it turns out that all the necessary constraints are incorporated into an action by virtue of the local $IU(2)$ symmetry of the system.</description>

      <title>NUTs, Bolts, and Spindles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new infinite classes of Euclidean supersymmetric solutions of four dimensional minimal gauged supergravity comprising a $U (1) \times U (1)$-invariant, asymptotically locally hyperbolic, metric on the total space of orbifold line bundles over a spindle (bolt). The conformal boundary is generically a squashed, branched, lens space and the graviphoton gauge field can have either twist or anti-twist through the spindle bolt. Correspondingly, the boundary geometry inherits two types of rigid Killing spinors, that we refer to as twist and anti-twist for the three-dimensional Seifert orbifolds, as well as some specific flat connections for the background gauge field, determined by the data of the spindle bolt. For all our solutions we compute the holographically renormalized on-shell action and compare it to the expression obtained via equivariant localization, uncovering a markedly distinct behaviour in the cases of twist and anti-twist. Our results provide precise predictions for the large $N$ limit of the corresponding localized partition functions of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories placed on Seifert orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Dynamical black hole entropy beyond general relativity from the Einstein frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Hollands, Wald and Zhang proposed a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole for an arbitrary theory of gravity obtained from a diffeomorphism covariant Lagrangian via the Noether charge method. We present an alternative, pedagogical derivation of the dynamical black hole entropy for $f(R)$ gravity as well as canonical scalar-tensor theory by means of conformal transformations. First, in general relativity we generalize Visser and Yan's pedagogical proof of the non-stationary physical process first law to black holes that may not be in vacuum, and give a pedagogical derivation of the second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum perturbations by considering the second-order variation of the Raychaudhuri equation. Second, we apply the derivation for general relativity to theories in the Einstein frames, and then recast the conclusions in their original frames. We show that the dynamical black hole entropy formulae of these theories satisfy both the non-stationary physical process first law and the non-stationary comparison first law via the Einstein frame. We further study the second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum perturbations, and observe that the second law is obeyed at second order in those theories. Using the Einstein frame, we also determine the relationship between the dynamical black hole entropy and the Wald entropy of the generalized apparent horizon in the original frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find the novel class of the supersymmetric deformation of the $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ $\sigma$-model and its equivalence with the generalised chiral Gross-Neveu. This construction allows the use of field-theoretic techniques and particularly the study of renormalisability and $\beta$-function. Provided approach is useful in finding conformal limits and establishes relation between chiral (GN) and sigma model description (geometric), which is explicitly demonstrated for the case of $ \mathbb{R} \times S^{1} $/Super-Thirring models. We also provide discussion on its emergence in $\mathcal{N}=2$ Liouville and 4-dim Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>Wedge Holographic Complexity in Karch-Randall Braneworld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate holographic complexities in the context of wedge holography, focusing specifically on black string geometry in AdS$_3$. The wedge spacetime is bounded by two end-of-the-world (EOW) branes with intrinsic Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) gravity. In line with this codimension-two holography, there are three equivalent perspectives: bulk perspective, brane perspective, and boundary perspective. Using both the ''Complexity=Volume'' (CV) and ''Complexity=Action'' (CA) proposals, we analyze the complexity in wedge black string geometry in the tensionless limit. By treating the branes as rigid, we find the late-time growth rates of CV and CA match exactly across bulk and brane perspectives. These results are consistent with those from JT gravity, with additional contributions from the intrinsic gravity of the branes. For fluctuating branes, we find that the late-time growth rates of CV and CA match between bulk and brane perspectives at the linear order of fluctuation. The CV results exhibit $\frac{\phi_h^2}{\phi_0}$ corrections from fluctuations, consistent with the findings in previous work. Moreover, the CA results reveal an additional constant term in the fluctuating branes case. We provide an interpretation of this in terms of gravitational edge mode effects. The distinct corrections arising from fluctuations in the CA and CV proposals suggest that the CV proposal is more sensitive to geometric details. Furthermore, we discuss these results in relation to Lloyd's bound on complexity, their general time dependence, and the effects of fluctuations.</description>

We first present the black brane solution for this model and subsequently calculate the color non-abelian DC conductivity for this solution using AdS/CFT duality. Our results retrieve the Yang-Mills model in the limit as $q_1$ approaches zero.</description>

      <title>Topology of Holographic Thermodynamics within Non-extensive Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into the thermodynamic topology of AdS Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m (R-N) black holes by employing nonextensive entropy frameworks, specifically R$\acute{e}$nyi (with nonextensive parameter $\lambda$) and Sharma-Mittal entropy (with nonextensive parameter $\alpha, \beta$). Our investigation spans two frameworks: bulk boundary and restricted phase space (RPS) thermodynamics. In the bulk boundary framework, we face singular zero points revealing topological charges influenced by the free parameter $(\lambda)$ with a positive topological charge $(\omega = +1)$ and the total topological charge $(W = +1)$, indicating the presence of a single stable on-shell black hole. Further analysis shows that when $(\lambda)$ is set to zero, the equations align with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy structure, demonstrating different behaviors with multiple topological charges $(\omega = +1, -1, +1)$. Notably, increasing the parameter $\alpha$ in Sharma-Mittal entropy results in multiple topological charges $(\omega = +1, -1, +1)$ with the total topological charge $(W = +1)$. Conversely, increasing $(\beta)$ reduces the number of topological charges, maintaining the total topological charge $(W = +1)$. Extending our study to the restricted phase space, we observe consistent topological charges $(\omega = +1)$ across all conditions and parameters. This consistency persists even when reducing to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, suggesting similar behaviors in both non-extended and Hawking entropy states within RPS.</description>

      <title>2d theory for asymptotic dynamics of 4d (self-dual) Einstein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple chiral 2d theory living on a momentum space celestial sphere whose behaviour exactly produces various IR dynamics of recent resurged interests for 4d (selfdual) Einstein gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We demonstrate how to use simple 2d CFT computations to reproduce 4d BMS algebra and $w_{1+\infty}$ algebra, deduce the form of both chiral and anti-chiral stress tensors and recover the necessity for dressing hard particles asymptotically with soft modes. We further discuss how possible extensions of this 2d theory incorporates further dynamical information of 4d Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Do anomalies break the momentum routing invariance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diagrammatic computation of anomalies is usually associated with the breaking of the momentum routing invariance. This is because the momentum routing is usually chosen to fulfill the desired Ward identity. In the case of the chiral anomaly, the momentum routing is chosen in order to fulfill the gauge Ward identity and break the chiral Ward identity. Although the chiral anomaly is physical because it is associated with the pion decay into two photons, this does not necessarily mean that the momentum routing invariance is broken because the momentum routing was chosen in the computation of the anomaly. In this work, we show that if gauge invariance is assumed, the chiral and the scale anomalies are independent of the momentum routing chosen and as a result they are momentum routing invariant. Thus, it turns out that momentum routing invariance might be violated when there is a gauge anomaly.</description>

Abstract: We analyze solutions of Chamseddine's topological gravity in four space-time dimensions and discover various black hole solutions with(out) torsion as well as those that describe naked singularities. Because all of the solutions belong to the sector with vanishing scalar fields, they share peculiar trait that all conserved charges are vanishing.</description>

      <title>Forced non-conformal fluid dynamics from the Chamblin-Reall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chamblin-Reall gravity is usually obtained by dimensional reduction. It has been shown that the completely solvable Chamblin-Reall models can only have one background scalar field, which are the dimensionally reduced compactified AdS black hole, the reduced Dp-brane/compactified Dp-brane, and the reduced smeared Dp-brane. When a scalar probe is manually introduced into the action of Chamblin-Reall gravity, whose boundary limit is a coordinate-dependent coupling constant, the gradients of this varying coupling will act as an effective force exerting on the relativistic fluid at the boundary. Thus the dynamics of the fluid will be affected by the force. We will use the fluid/gravity correspondence to derive the transport coefficients related to the boundary coupling and give the explicit expression for the forcing term in the form of the gradients of that coupling.</description>

      <title>New Examples of Abelian D4D2D0 Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the methods of \cite{Alexandrov:2023zjb} to compute generating series of D4D2D0 indices with a single unit of D4 charge for several compact Calabi-Yau threefolds, assuming modularity of these indices. Our examples include a $\mathbb{Z}_{7}$ quotient of R{\o}dland's pfaffian threefold, a $\mathbb{Z}_{5}$ quotient of Hosono-Takagi's double quintic symmetroid threefold, the $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ quotient of the bicubic intersection in $\mathbb{P}^{5}$, and the $\mathbb{Z}_{5}$ quotient of the quintic hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^{4}$. For these examples we compute GV invariants to the highest genus that available boundary conditions make possible, and for the case of the quintic quotient alone this is sufficiently many GV invariants for us to make one nontrivial test of the modularity of these indices. As discovered in \cite {Alexandrov:2023zjb}, the assumption of modularity allows us to compute terms in the topological string genus expansion beyond those obtainable with previously understood boundary data. We also consider five multiparameter examples with $h^{1,1}&gt;1$, for which only a single index needs to be computed for modularity to fix the rest. We propose a modification of the formula in \cite{Alexandrov:2022pgd} that incorporates torsion to solve these models. Our new examples are only tractable because they have sufficiently small triple intersection and second Chern numbers, which happens because all of our examples are suitable quotient manifolds. In an appendix we discuss some aspects of quotient threefolds and their Wall data.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Weyl Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Abelian gauge symmetry proposed by Hermann Weyl is generalized to its non-Abelian extension. Afterwards the standard model is generalized to incorporate the Abelian and non-Abelian Weyl symmetry. This symmetry extension brings new gauge particles that can be potential candidates for the dark matter. It also naturally introduces a second scalar field into the theory. The breaking of the Weyl symmetry turns this scalar field into a dimensional constant, making the Higgs as the only scalar component in the standard model. In addition to the expected benefits, there are three unexpected bonuses: (1) it brings some new understanding of the parity violation; (2) it provides an answer to the sign problem in the Higgs mechanism; (3) it gives some new perspectives on the nature of the neutrino: non-Abelian Weyl symmetry demands that there \textit{must be} right-handed netrino; furthermore, the smallness of the neutrino mass is protected by the non-Abelian Weyl symmetry.</description>

      <title>Effective Strings in QED$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective string theory describes the physics of long confining strings in theories, like Yang-Mills theory, where the mass gap $M_{gap}^2$ is of the same order as the string tension $T$. In $2+1$ dimensions, there is a class of confining theories, including massive QED$_3$ as first analyzed by Polyakov, for which $M_{gap}^2\ll T$. These theories are weakly coupled at low energies of order $M_{gap}$, and may be analyzed perturbatively. In this paper, we analyze the physics of strings in such theories, focusing on QED$_3$, at energies of order $M_{gap}$ (but still well below $\sqrt{T}$). We argue that the width of the string in these theories should be of order $1/M_{gap}$ independently of its length, as long as the string is not exponentially long. We also compute at leading order in perturbation theory the ground state energy of a confining string on a circle, and the scattering of Nambu-Goldstone bosons on the string worldsheet.</description>

      <title>On the classification of duality defects in $c=2$ compact boson CFTs with a discrete group orbifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to exploring duality defects in the $c=2$ compact boson conformal field theory (CFT). This study is motivated by the desire to classify categorical symmetries, particularly duality defects, in CFTs. While the $c=1$ case has been extensively studied, and the types of realizable duality defects are largely understood, the situation becomes significantly more complex for $c=2$. The simplicity of the $c=1$ case arises from the fact that its theory is essentially determined by the radius of compactification. In contrast, the $c=2$ case involves more parameters, leading to a more intricate action of T-duality. As a result, directly solving the condition for a theory to be self-dual under orbifolding becomes highly challenging. To address this, we categorize duality defects into four types and demonstrate that the condition for a toroidal branch theory to be self-dual under an orbifold induced by an automorphism generated by shift symmetry can be reformulated as quadratic equations. We also found that for ``almost all" theories we can enumerate all solutions for such equations. Moreover, this reformulation enables the simultaneous exploration of multiple duality defects and provides evidence for the existence of duality defects under specific parameter families for the theory, such as $(\tau, \rho) = (it, \frac{1}{2}+it)$ where $t \in \mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>Towards confinement using black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The confinement of quarks is analyzed by establishing a correspondence between the effective actions inside a black hole and the QCD action, formulated as a scalar field theory in the Carrollian regime. We first demonstrate that both QCD (in the instanton-dominance limit) and the interior of a black hole can be described at one-loop as the effective action of a soliton in the Carrollian limit. At one-loop, QCD confinement is shown to be entirely analogous to confinement within a black hole, with the event horizon acting as the hadron radius. Higher-order corrections to the effective action do not destabilize the solitons but may produce subtle observable effects, such as deconfinement or a partial resolution to the information loss problem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a collection of numerical bootstrap computations for 3d CFTs with a U(1) global symmetry. We test the accuracy of our method and fix conventions through a computation of bounds on the OPE coefficients for low-lying operators in the free fermion, free scalar, and generalised free vector field theories. We then compute new OPE bounds for scalar operators in the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, $O(2)$ model, and large $N$ limit of the $O(N)$ model. Additionally, we present a number of exclusion plots for such 3d CFTs. In particular, we look at the space of even and odd parity scalar operators in the low-lying spectrum that are compatible with crossing symmetry. As well as recovering the known theories, there are some kinks that indicate new unknown theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a recently proposed interpretation of the signal detected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) as due to a relic stochastic background of primordial gravitons, produced in the context of the string cosmology pre-big bang scenario. We show that such interpretation cannot be reconciled with a phenomenologically viable minimal version of such scenario, while it can be allowed if one considers an equally viable but generalised, non-minimal version of pre-big bang evolution. Maintaining the $S$-duality symmetry throughout the high-curvature string phase is possible although somewhat disfavoured. The implications of this non-minimal scenario for the power spectrum of curvature perturbations are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>The Dark Side of Double-Tensor Multiplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the properties of a set of free double-tensor multiplets in $N=2$ supersymmetry, focusing on their behavior within rigid superspace. These multiplets can be obtained from hypermultiplets by Hodge-dualizing half of their scalars, and feature an off-shell matching of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. Despite this fact, the supersymmetry algebra results to close only on-shell. Our analysis is conducted both in superspace, using the geometric (rheonomic) approach, and in spacetime, comparing how our results are obtained in the two approaches. Notably, the cohomology of superspace requires that the scalars Hodge-dual to the antisymmetric tensors crucially contribute to the superspace description of the tensors super-field strengths. This shows an inherent non-locality of the theory, already in the free case, which however does not forbid a Lagrangian description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the Baikov representation of Feynman integrals in its standard and loop-by-loop variants. The Baikov representation is a parametric representation, which has as its defining feature the fact that the integration variables are the propagators of the Feynman integral. For the loop-by-loop Baikov representation, we discuss in detail a strategy for how to make an optimal parametrization which is one that minimizes the number of extra integration variables that have to be introduced for a given Feynman integral. Furthermore, we present a Mathematica implementation, named BaikovPackage, that is able to generate the Baikov representation in its standard and loop-by-loop varieties. We also discuss some subtleties and open problems regarding Baikov representations.</description>

Using these advances we calculate the entanglement entropy as a function of time for 1+1-dimensional CFTs that are split into $N$ subsystems. We give explicit results for $N = 4$ and $N = 17$. We find that all qualitative differences that arise for larger $N$ are present for $N = 4$.</description>

Abstract: We study the response of a rotating BTZ black hole to the scalar tidal perturbation. We show that the real component of the tidal response function isn't zero, indicating that a rotating BTZ black hole possesses non-zero tidal Love numbers. Additionally, we observe scale-dependent behaviour, known as log-running, in the tidal response function. We also conduct a separate analysis on an extremal rotating BTZ black hole, finding qualitative similarities with its non-extremal counterpart. In addition, we present a procedure to calculate the tidal response function of a charged rotating BTZ black hole as well.</description>

Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian thermal states form a fundamental class of states in quantum information science. This paper explores the information geometry of these states, focusing on characterizing the distance between two nearby states and the geometry induced by a parameterization in terms of their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. In particular, for the family of bosonic Gaussian thermal states, we derive expressions for their Fisher-Bures and Kubo-Mori information matrices with respect to their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. An important application of our formulas consists of fundamental limits on how well one can estimate these parameters. We additionally establish formulas for the derivatives and the symmetric logarithmic derivatives of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. The former could have applications in gradient descent algorithms for quantum machine learning when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz, and the latter in formulating optimal strategies for single parameter estimation of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. Finally, the expressions for the aforementioned information matrices could have additional applications in natural gradient descent algorithms when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz.</description>

      <title>Generators of Local Lorentz Transformation in ADM-Vielbein Formalism of Gravitational Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity contains 16 variables in the framework of ADM-Vielbein formalism which are 6 more than metric formalism. These variables emerge due to additional symmetry of Local Lorentz Transformations. In the framework of the Hamiltonian approach, it is expected to find first class constraints which generate this gauge symmetry. We introduce the complete form of such constraints and show that they exactly obey the algebra of the Lorentz group.</description>

      <title>Extra dimensional axion patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study for the first time the $\textit{complete}$ parameter space of a bulk extra-dimensional axion. We find novel regimes where no single KK mode is produced along the canonical QCD axion line, and instead, it is maximally deviated along with several other axions that constitute a multiple solution to the strong CP problem. In the most common extra-dimensional models, namely for flat and curved Randall-Sundrum scenarios, and assuming that all Peccei-Quinn breaking comes from QCD, we find that these solutions are however subject to tight phenomenological constraints. In light of these results, only one -- canonical -- pattern can be expected from a bulk axion in one or more extra spacetime dimensions. As a byproduct, we generalize the axions eigenvalue and eigenvector equations for an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions and compactifications.</description>

      <title>Edge modes and boundary impurities in the anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of boundary phenomena in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain (XXZ-$\frac{1}{2}$) in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase, with a particular focus on the interplay between fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{4} $ edge modes and a coupled spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity at the edge. Employing a combination of Bethe Ansatz, exact diagonalization, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, we explore the intricate phase diagram that emerges when the impurity is coupled either integrably or non-integrably to the chain. For integrable antiferromagnetic impurity couplings, we identify two distinct phases: the Kondo phase, where the impurity is screened by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and the antiferromagnetic bound mode phase, where an exponentially localized bound state screens the impurity in the ground state. When coupled ferromagnetically while maintaining integrability, the impurity behaves as a free spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, leading to either a ferromagnetic bound mode phase, where the impurity remains free in the ground state but may be screened at higher energy excitations or an unscreened (or local moment) phase where impurity remains unscreened in every eigenstate whereas for non-integrable ferromagnetic coupling, the impurity is not free. In the case of non-integrable antiferromagnetic coupling, a third phase emerges, characterized by mid-gap excitations with two degenerate states below the mass gap on top of the Kondo and antiferromagnetic bound mode phases, further enriching the phase diagram. Our findings highlight the nuanced behavior of boundary impurities in gapped antiferromagnetic systems, offering new insights into Kondo effects and impurity screening in the presence of fractionalized edge modes and bulk antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Algebraic approach to spacetime bulk reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the theory of holographic quantum error correction in the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, together with the kink transform conjecture on the bulk AdS description of boundary cocycle flow, we characterize (approximate) complementary recovery in terms of (approximate) intertwining of bulk and boundary cocycle derivatives. Using the geometric modular structure in vacuum AdS, we establish an operator algebraic subregion-subregion duality of boundary causal diamonds and bulk causal wedges for Klein-Gordon fields in the universal cover of AdS. Our results suggest that, from an algebraic perspective, the kink transform is bulk cocycle flow, which (in the above case) induces the bulk geometry via geometric modular action and the corresponding notion of time. As a by-product, we find that if the von Neumann algebra of a boundary CFT subregion is a type $\mathrm{III}_1$ factor with an ergodic vacuum, then the von Neumann algebra of the corresponding dual bulk subregion, is either $\mathbb{C}1$ (with a one-dimensional Hilbert space) or a type $\mathrm{III}_1$ factor.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Models in Lovelock Gravity: An Overview of Recent Progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current review, we provide a summary of the recent progress made in the cosmological aspect of extra-dimensional Lovelock gravity. Our review covers a wide variety of particular model/matter source combinations: Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet as well as cubic Lovelock gravities with vacuum, cosmological constant, perfect fluid, spatial curvature, and some of their combinations. Our analysis suggests that it is possible to set constraints on the parameters of the above-mentioned models from the simple requirement of the existence of a smooth transition from the initial singularity to a realistic low-energy regime. Initially, anisotropic space naturally evolves into a configuration with two isotropic subspaces, and if one of these subspaces is three-dimensional and is expanding while another is contracting, we call it realistic compactification. Of course, the process is not devoid of obstacles, and in our paper, we review the results of the compactification occurrence investigation for the above-mentioned models. In particular, for vacuum and $\Lambda$-term EGB models, compactification is not suppressed (but is not the only possible outcome either) if the number of extra dimensions is $D \geqslant 2$; for vacuum cubic Lovelock gravities it is always present (however, cubic Lovelock gravity is defined only for $D \geqslant 3$ number of extra dimensions); for the EGB model with perfect fluid it is present for $D=2$ (we have not considered this model in higher dimensions yet), and in the presence of spatial curvature, the realistic stabilization of extra dimensions is always present (however, such a model is well-defined only in $D \geqslant 4$ number of extra dimensions).</description>

      <title>Charged black hole solutions in $f(R,T)$ gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions in $f(R,T)$ gravity, where $R$ is the curvature scalar and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED). To construct our solutions, we adopt a linear functional form, $f(R,T) = R + \beta T$. In the limit $\beta = 0$, the theory reduces to General Relativity (GR), recovering $f(R,T) \approx R$. We propose a power-law Lagrangian of the form $\mathcal{L} = f_0 + F + \alpha F^p$, where $\alpha =f_0= 0$ corresponds to the linear electrodynamics case. Using this setup, we derive the metric functions and determine an effective cosmological constant. Our analysis focuses on specific cases with $p = 2$, $p = 4$, and $p = 6$, where we formulate analytic expressions for the matter fields supporting these solutions in terms of the Lagrangian as a function of $F$. Additionally, we verify the regularity of the solutions and study the structure of the event horizons. Furthermore, we examine a more specific scenario by determining the free forms of the first and second derivatives $\mathcal{L}_F(r)$ and $\mathcal{L}_{FF}(r)$ of the Lagrangean of the nonlinear electromagnetic field. From these relations, we derive the general form of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{NLED}}(r)$ using consistency relations. This Lagrangian exhibits an intrinsic nonlinearity due to the influence of two constants, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Specifically, $\alpha$ originates from the power-law term in the proposed Lagrangian, while $\beta$ arises from the assumed linear function $f(R,T)$. The interplay of these constants ensures that the nonlinearity of the Lagrangian is governed by both $\alpha$ and $\beta$, rather than $\alpha$ alone.</description>

      <title>Periodical orbits and waveforms with spontaneous Lorentz symmetry-breaking in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study time-like geodesics around a spherically symmetric black hole in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity, characterized by the parameter $l$, which induces spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. The geodesic equations and effective potential are derived to investigate the influence of $l$. We calculate the marginally bound orbits and innermost stable circular orbits, analyzing the parameter's impact. Periodic orbits are computed numerically and classified within the standard taxonomy, revealing significant effects of $l$ on their momentum and energy. Additionally, we explore an extreme mass ratio inspiral system under the adiabatic approximation to derive gravitational waveforms emitted by an object orbiting a supermassive black hole in KR gravity. These waveforms reflect the distinctive characteristics of periodic orbits and highlight the influence of $l$. With advancements in gravitational wave detection, these results offer insights into black holes influenced by Lorentz symmetry-breaking fields.</description>

Abstract: I review the formalism of patch bosonization of Fermi surfaces, with a focus on the problem of a two-dimensional metal at a quantum critical point. I argue that this formalism is fundamentally inapplicable to the problem, except in synthetic limits. One such limit is the small-$N$ limit, which was already discussed in early studies of the problem; a similar but slightly less unphysical large-$N$ limit is proposed. I show that it is at least formally possible to construct perturbative expansions around these synthetic limits. However, I argue that nonperturbative effects become important when $N\sim1$.</description>

      <title>Exploring cosmological imprints of phantom crossing with dynamical dark energy in Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current era of precision cosmology, the persistence of cosmological tensions, most notably the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ tension, challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. To reconcile these tensions via late-time modifications to expansion history, various features such as phantom crossing in the dark energy equation of state, a negative energy density at high redshifts, etc., are favoured. However, these scenarios cannot be realized within the framework of GR without introducing ghost or gradient instabilities. In this work, we investigate a dynamical dark energy scenario within the framework of Horndeski gravity, incorporating nonminimal coupling to gravity and self-interactions. We highlight that the model can exhibit novel features like phantom crossing and negative dark energy densities at high redshifts without introducing any instabilities. For this specific Horndeski model, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the background evolution along with the effects on perturbations, examining observables like growth rate, matter and CMB power spectrum. To check the consistency of the model with the observational data, we employ MCMC analysis using BAO/$f\sigma_8$, Supernovae, and CMB data. While the model does not outperform the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework in a combined likelihood analysis, there remains a preference for non-zero values of the model parameters within the data. This suggests that dynamical dark energy scenarios, particularly those with non-minimal couplings, merit further exploration as promising alternatives to GR, offering rich phenomenology that can be tested against a broader range of current and upcoming observational datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on three distinct lines of recent developments: edge modes and boundary charges in gravitational physics, relational dynamics in classical and quantum gravity, and quantum reference frames. We argue that these research directions are in fact linked in multiple ways, and can be seen as different aspects of the same research programme. This research programme has two main physical goals and one general conceptual aim. The physical goals are to move beyond the two idealizations/approximations of asymptotic or closed boundary conditions in gravitational physics and of ideal reference frames (coded in coordinate frames or gauge fixings), thus achieving a more realistic modeling of (quantum) gravitational physical phenomena. The conceptual aim is to gain a better understanding of the influence of observers in physics and the ensuing limits of objectivity.</description>

      <title>Background-dependent and classical correspondences between $f(Q)$ and $f(T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $f(Q)$ and $f(T)$ gravity are based on fundamentally different geometric frameworks, yet they exhibit many similar properties. In this article, we identify two types of background-dependent and classical correspondences between these two theories of gravity. The first correspondence is rooted in their equivalence within the background of Minkowski spacetime, while the second is based on the equivalence of their equations of motion. To establish the first correspondence, we develop the tetrad-spin formulation of $f(Q)$ gravity and we derive the corresponding expression for the spin connection. Additionally, we extract the equations of motion of $f(Q)$ gravity within this tetrad-spin framework and we elucidate the relationship through an example in spherical coordinates. For the second correspondence, we derive the general affine connection for the static and spherically symmetric spacetime in $f(Q)$ gravity, and we compare its equations of motion with the ones of $f(T)$ gravity. Amongst others, our results reveal that, within our affine connection branch, $f(T)$ solutions are not simply a subset of $f(Q)$ solutions; rather, they encompass a complex solution beyond $f(Q)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Meson spectroscopy in the $Sp(4)$ gauge theory with three antisymmetric fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of an extensive numerical study of the $Sp(4)$ lattice gauge theory with three (Dirac) flavors of fermion in the two-index antisymmetric representation. In the presence of (degenerate) fermion masses, the theory has an enhanced global $SU(6)$ symmetry, broken explicitly and spontaneously to its $SO(6)$ subgroup. This symmetry breaking pattern makes the theory interesting for applications in the context of composite Higgs models, as well as for the implementation of top partial compositeness. It can also provide a dynamical realisation of the strongly interacting massive particle paradigm for the origin of dark matter. We adopt the standard plaquette gauge action with the Wilson-Dirac formulation for the fermions and apply the (rational) hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm in our ensemble generation process. We monitor the autocorrelation and topology of the ensembles. We explore the bare parameter space, and identify the weak and strong coupling regimes separated by a line of first-order bulk phase transitions.
  We measure two-point correlation functions between meson operators that transform as non-trivial representations of $SO(6)$, and extract the ground-state masses and the decay constants, in all accessible spin and parity channels. In addition, we measure the mass of the first excited state for the vector meson by solving a generalised eigenvalue problem. Spectral quantities show a mass dependence that is compatible with the expectation that, at long distances, the theory undergoes confinement, accompanied by the spontaneous breaking of the approximate global symmetries acting on the matter fields. Finally, we discuss the continuum and massless extrapolations, after setting the physical scale using the gradient flow method, and compare the results to those of existing studies in the quenched approximation, as well as to the literature on closely related theories.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum loop model (QLM), along with the quantum dimer model (QDM), are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, these models are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg quantum simulators. However, the effect of finite temperature fluctuations on these quantum constrained models has been barely explored. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite temperature phase diagram of the QLM on the triangular lattice. We discover that the vison plaquette (VP) crystal experiences a finite temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of {\it thermal fractionalization}, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Picture for Entanglement Hamiltonians in Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the quasiparticle picture of entanglement evolution to obtain an effective description for the out-of-equilibrium Entanglement Hamiltonian at the hydrodynamical scale following quantum quenches in free fermionic systems in two or more spatial dimensions. Specifically, we begin by applying dimensional reduction techniques in cases where the geometry permits, building directly on established results from one-dimensional systems. Subsequently, we generalize the analysis to encompass a wider range of geometries. We obtain analytical expressions for the entanglement Hamiltonian valid at the ballistic scale, which reproduce the known quasiparticle picture predictions for the Renyi entropies and full counting statistics. We also numerically validate the results with excellent precision by considering quantum quenches from several initial configurations.</description>

      <title>Superposing and gauging fermionic Gaussian projected entangled pair states to get lattice gauge theory groundstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauged Gaussian fermionic projected entangled pair states (GGFPEPS) form a novel type of Ansatz state for the groundstate of lattice gauge theories. The advantage of these states is that they allow efficient calculation of observables by combining Monte-Carlo integration over gauge fields configurations with Gaussian tensor network machinery for the fermionic part. Remarkably, for GGFPEPS the probability distribution for the gauge field configurations is positive definite and real so that there is no sign problem.
  In this work we will demonstrate that gauged (non-Gaussian) fermionic projected pair states (GFPEPS) exactly capture the groundstate of generic lattice gauge theories. Additionally, we will present a framework for the efficient computation of observables in the case where the non-Gaussianity of the PEPS follows from the superposition of (few) Gaussian PEPS.
  Finally, we present a new graphical notation for Gaussian tensor and their contractions into Gaussian tensor network states.</description>

      <title>Does matter Kerr?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working in momentum space and at linear order in the gravitational coupling, we derive the most general class of energy-momentum tensors associated with a given multipolar structure of the spacetime in arbitrary dimensions, and built out of a mass and an angular momentum, at any order in the spin expansion. In this formalism, we are able to derive directly the full multipolar structure of any solution from the multipole expansion of the energy-momentum tensor, in complete analogy to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we identify the recurrence relations that allow obtaining the multipolar structure of the Kerr and the Myers-Perry black hole solutions, defining source multipoles in a General Relativity context for the first time. For these solutions, we are able to resum the energy-momentum tensor in momentum space at all orders in the angular momentum, and compute its real-space version. In the Kerr case we exactly obtain the matter source found by Israel, namely an equatorial, pressureless thin disk rotating at superluminal speed. For Myers-Perry in five dimensions, the matter distribution is a three-ellipsoid in four spatial dimensions with nontrivial stresses. Remarkably, for any dimensions, the matter configuration is a lower-dimensional distribution which has the same singularity structure as the fully non-linear black-hole solution. Our formalism underscores the advantage of working in momentum space to generate nontrivial matter sources for non-linear spacetimes, and could be used to construct regular non-exotic matter configurations that source spinning black hole solutions or horizonless compact objects with the same multipolar structure as black holes.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this review is to provide a pedagogical development of the Unruh effect and the thermofield double state. In Section 2, we construct Rindler spacetime and analyze the perspective of an observer undergoing constant acceleration in Minkowski spacetime, which motivates the establishment of the relationship between the Fourier modes in both geometries using the Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation. In Section 3, we explore the underlying physics leading to the Unruh effect and draw an analogy to the thermal radiation observed around a Schwarzschild black hole. Finally, in Section 4, we derive the thermofield double state by conducting a Euclidean analysis of the field and geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.07661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In odd dimensions the integrated conformal anomaly is entirely due to the boundary terms \cite{Solodukhin:2015eca}. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of the anomaly in five dimensions. We give the complete list of the boundary conformal invariants that exist in five dimensions. Additionally to 8 invariants known before we find a new conformal invariant that contains the derivatives of the extrinsic curvature along the boundary. Then, for a conformal scalar field satisfying either the Dirichlet or the conformal invariant Robin boundary conditions we use the available general results for the heat kernel coefficient $a_5$, compute the conformal anomaly and identify the corresponding values of all boundary conformal charges.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the full-color four-loop three-point form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in N=4 SYM, based on the color-kinematics (CK) duality and generalized unitarity method. The CK-dual solution, while manifesting all dual Jacobi relations and satisfying the minimal power-counting of loop momenta, lies in a 133-dimensional solution space. We also show that the planar form factor integrand satisfies precisely a directional dual conformal symmetry in the lightlike limit of the operator momentum, which is supported by explicit four-loop calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We bootstrap the symbol of the maximal-helicity-violating four-particle form factor for the chiral part of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory at two loops. When minimally normalized, this symbol involves only 34 letters and obeys the extended Steinmann relations in all partially-overlapping three-particle momentum channels. In addition, the remainder function for this form factor exhibits an antipodal self-duality: it is invariant under the combined operation of the antipodal map defined on multiple polylogarithms -- which reverses the order of the symbol letters -- and a simple kinematic map. This self-duality holds on a four-dimensional parity-preserving kinematic hypersurface. It implies the antipodal duality recently noticed between the three-particle form factor and the six-particle amplitude in this theory.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Rational Conformal Field Theories in Small Genera, Chiral Fermionization, and Symmetry/Subalgebra Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16921v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A (1+1)D unitary bosonic rational conformal field theory (RCFT) may be organized according to its genus, a tuple $(c,\mathscr{C})$ consisting of its central charge $c$ and a unitary modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$ which describes the (2+1)D topological quantum field theory (TQFT) for which its maximally extended chiral algebra forms a holomorphic boundary condition. We establish a number of results pertaining to RCFTs in "small" genera, by which we informally mean genera with the central charge $c$ and the number of primary operators rank$(\mathscr{C})$ both not too large. We start by completely solving the modular bootstrap problem for theories with at most four primary operators. In particular, we characterize, and provide an algorithm which efficiently computes, the function spaces to which the partition function of any bosonic RCFT with rank$(\mathscr{C})\leq 4$ must belong. Using this result, and leveraging relationships between RCFTs and holomorphic vertex operator algebras which come from "gluing" and cosets, we rigorously enumerate all bosonic theories in $95$ of the $105$ genera $(c,\mathscr{C})$ with $c\leq 24$ and rank$(\mathscr{C})\leq 4$. This includes as (new) special cases the classification of chiral algebras with three primaries and $c&lt;120/7\sim 17.14$, and the classification of chiral algebras with four primaries and $c&lt;62/3\sim 20.67$. We then study two applications of our classification. First, by making use of chiral versions of bosonization and fermionization, we obtain the complete list of purely left-moving fermionic RCFTs with $c&lt;23$ as a corollary of the results of the previous paragraph. Second, using a (conjectural) concept which we call "symmetry/subalgebra duality," we precisely relate our bosonic classification to the problem of determining certain generalized global symmetries of holomorphic vertex operator algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11212v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Poincar\'e symmetry can be contracted in two ways to yield the Galilei symmetry and the Carroll symmetry. The well-known Schr\"odinger equation exhibits the Galilei symmetry and is a fundamental equation in Galilean quantum mechanics. However, the question remains: what is the quantum equation that corresponds to the Carroll symmetry? In this paper, we derive a novel equation in two dimensions, called the ``Carroll-Schr\"odinger equation'', which describes the quantum dynamics in the Carrollian framework. We also construct the so-called ``Carroll-Schr\"odinger algebra'' in two dimensions, which is a conformal extension of the centrally extended Carroll algebra with a dynamical exponent of $z=1/2$. We demonstrate that this algebra is the symmetry algebra of the Carroll-Schr\"odinger field theory. Moreover, we apply the method of canonical quantization to the theory and utilize it to compute the transition amplitude. Finally, we discuss higher dimensions and identify the so-called ``generalized Carroll-Schr\"odinger equation''.</description>

Abstract: Gaussian process regression, kernel support vector regression, the random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and the generalized linear model algorithms are applied to data of complete intersection Calabi?Yau threefolds. It is shown that Gaussian process regression is the most suitable for learning the Hodge number h^(2,1)in terms of h^(1,1). The performance of this regression algorithm is such that the Pearson correlation coefficient for the validation set is R^2 = 0.9999999995 with a Root Mean Square Error RMSE = 0.0002895011. As for the calibration set, these two parameters are as follows: R^2 = 0.9999999994 and RMSE = 0.0002854348. The training error and the cross-validation error of this regression are 10^(-9) and 1.28 * 10^(-7), respectively. Learning the Hodge number h^(1,1)in terms of h^(2,1) yields R^2 = 1.000000 and RMSE = 7.395731 * 10^(-5) for the validation set of the Gaussian Process regression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an explicit formula for the thermodynamic potential of the AdS dyonic black brane solution with an axio-dilaton hair, which was discovered in an extension of the $(3+1)$d Gubser-Rocha model enjoying S-duality. From the thermodynamic potential, we can compute the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibilities of the dyonic solution. The result of the magnetization is negative implying that the system is diamagnetic. Subsequently, we consider a specific neutral limit of the dyonic solution. In this setup, we find that the system exhibits spontaneous breaking of a global $U(1)$ symmetry. The order parameter is given by a complex operator which is dual to the axio-dilaton field in the bulk. Interestingly, the system has a finite Hall conductivity even in the absence of the external magnetic field, and it is related to the phase of the complex operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric solutions of matter-coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity in the forms of $AdS_2\times S^3$- and $AdS_3\times S^2$-sliced domain walls with a non-vanishing two-form field from the supergravity multiplet. These two types of solutions holographically describe conformal line and surface defects within five-dimensional $N=2$ SCFTs, respectively. In the case of $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ gauge group obtained by coupling $F(4)$ supergravity to three vector multiplets, we find charged domain wall solutions describing holographic RG flows between two supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacua with a running two-form field supporting the line and surface defects. For a particular case of one vector multiplet with $SO(3)\times U(1)$ gauge group, we find solutions describing RG flows from an $AdS_6$ vacuum to physically acceptable singular geometries in the presence of defects. This class of solutions can be uplifted to type IIB theory using a consistent truncation obtained from $SO(5,5)$ exceptional field theory with half-maximal structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Chern-Simons-like formulation of exotic general massive gravity models within the framework of third-way to three-dimensional gravity. We classify our construction into two main approaches: one using torsional cosmological Einstein and exotic massive gravity equations, and the other a torsion-free approach. The former approach, while mathematically appealing, precludes the construction of critical exotic models where the central charges vanish. In contrast, the latter approach has a wider parameter space and allows for the construction of critical models. An explicit example of an exotic general model is provided to illustrate both methods. Our methodology represents the first step towards establishing the most general Chern-Simons-like formulation of third-way to three-dimensional gravity, which would enable the study of identifying its bulk/boundary unitary sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase structure of a higher derivative sine-Gordon model in four dimensions is analysed. It is shown that the inclusion of a relevant two-derivative term in the action significantly modifies some of the results obtained by neglecting this operator, and the final picture is substantially different from the one describing the phase diagram associated with the two-dimensional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. The study is carried out with the help of the Renormalization Group (RG) flow equations, determined for a set of three parameters, and numerically solved both for a truncated series expansion approximation, and for the complete set of equations. In both cases, a continuous line of fixed points, terminating at a particular point presenting universal properties, is found, together with a manifold that separates two phases, roughly characterized by the sign of the coupling $\widetilde z_k$ associated with this newly included operator. While the phase corresponding to $\widetilde z_k&gt;0$ shows some pathologies, the one with $\widetilde z_k&lt;0$ has a well-behaved infrared limit, where the system reduces to a Gaussian-like model. We also briefly comment about the possibility that our model could capture some of the qualitative features of the ultraviolet (UV) critical manifold of conformally reduced gravity.</description>

      <title>Hairy dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in an Einstein-Maxwell-Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin type model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct spherically symmetric dyonic black holes in a generalized Maxwell-Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin type model with a complex scalar doublet and a symmetry breaking potential {for the real scalar field}, minimally coupled to Einstein gravity in asymptotically flat space.
  We analyze the properties of the hairy black holes and determine their domain of existence. Our discussion focuses mostly on the case of a long-ranged massless real scalar field.
  Our results indicate that in this case, depending on the coupling constants, the resonant hairy dyonic black holes may bifurcate from Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes at maximal chemical potential, while the limiting solutions at minimal chemical potential may be related to the Penney solution.</description>

      <title>CFT Constraints on Parity-odd Interactions with Axions and Dilatons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We illustrate how the conformal Ward identities (CWIs) in momentum space completely determine the structure of a parity-odd 3-point correlator involving currents, energy momentum tensors and at least one scalar operator in $d=4$. Conformal invariance fixes almost all such possible correlators to vanish. The only exceptions are given by the $\langle JJO\rangle_{odd}$ and the $\langle TTO \rangle_{odd}$ which in momentum-space are protected by chiral and conformal anomalies. Specifically, one can obtain a non-vanishing solution by considering scalar operators such as $O=\nabla \cdot J_A$, $O=g_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}$ or their shadow transforms. We comment on the implications of these results that constrain the coupling of axions and dilatons in a conformal phase of the early universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Examining the $\phi^{4}$ and $\phi^{8}$ models within a two-dimensional framework in the flat spacetime and embracing a theory with unconventional kinetic terms, one investigates the emergence of kinks/antikinks and double-kinks/antikinks. We devote our study to obtaining the field configurations with minimal energy, i.e., solutions possessing a Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield's bound. Next, to accomplish our goal, we adopt non-polynomial generalizing functions, namely, hyperbolic sine and cosine functions: the first produce BPS potentials exhibiting a minimum at $\phi=0$, facilitating the emergence of genuine double-kink-type configurations. Conversely, the second promotes the rise of kink-type solutions.</description>

      <title>Dissipation in the $1/D$ expansion for planar matrix models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the thermal behavior of a large number of matrix degrees of freedom in the planar limit. We work in $0+1$ dimensions, with $D$ matrices, and use $1/D$ as an expansion parameter. This can be thought of as a non-commutative large-$D$ vector model, with two independent quartic couplings for the two different orderings of the matrices. We compute a thermal two-point correlator to ${\cal O}(1/D)$ and find that the degeneracy present at large $D$ is lifted, with energy levels split by an amount $\sim 1/\sqrt{D}$. This implies a timescale for thermal dissipation $\sim \sqrt{D}$. At high temperatures dissipation is predominantly due to one of the two quartic couplings.</description>

      <title>Linear Perturbations and Stability Analysis in $f(T)$ Braneworld Scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a detailed analysis of the full linear perturbations in the braneworld scenario within $f(T)$ gravity. By decomposing the perturbations of the theory into the scalar, transverse vector, antisymmetric pseudotensor, and symmetric transverse-traceless tensor modes, we derive the quadratic action for each mode. The results indicate that there is a total of one scalar, one massless vector, and one tensor propagating degrees of freedom. Consequently, in comparison to general relativity, no additional degrees of freedom appear under the flat braneworld background in the linearized theory. For a thick brane model with $f(T)=T+ \alpha T^2$, we find that it exhibits stability against linear perturbations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Supergravity Equations for the WZW Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized supergravity equations (GSEs) were originally proposed as a modification of the standard IIB supergravity equations to satisfy the background of $\eta$-deformed $AdS_5 \times S^5$ introduced by Arutyunov {\it et al}. In this study, we proceed to write down the GSEs for the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models based on Lie groups. First, we simplify the GSEs for the WZW model by imposing the conditions for vanishing of the one-loop beta function equations. Then, by introducing an {\it Ansatz} for the Killing vector field $I$, it is shown that the Killing equation ${\cal L}_{_{I}} G_{_{\mu \nu}}=0$ is held. In addition, we introduce a generalized Killing vector such that the existence of a solution to the GSEs requires that this vector be light-like. In this way, we solve the simplified GSEs for the WZW models constructed on Lie groups up to dimension five. Unfortunately, two of the groups do not have light-like vectors and therefore do not admit the GSEs.</description>

      <title>Chiral gauge theories, generalized anomalies and breaking of the color-flavor-locked center symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the strong-interaction dynamics of a class of $4D$ chiral $SU(N)$ gauge theories with a fermion in a symmetric second-rank tensor representation and a number of fermions in an anti-antisymmetric tensor representation, extending the previous work on chiral gauge theories such as the Bars-Yankielowicz and the generalized Georgi-Glashow models. The main tool of our analysis is the anomalies obstructing the gauging of certain 1-form color-flavor-locked center symmetry, together with some flavor symmetries. The matching requirement for these mixed-anomalies strongly favors dynamical Higgs phases caused by bifermion condensate formation, against a confinement phase with no condensates and no symmetry breaking, or a confinement phase with multifermion color-singlet condensates only. Dynamical gauge symmetry breaking and the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry caused by such condensates mean that the color-flavor-locked 1-form center symmetry itself is lost in the infrared. One is led to a solution, if not unique, which satisfies fully the conventional as well as the new, generalized 't Hooft anomaly matching requirements.</description>

      <title>Gauging in Parameter Space: A Top-Down Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss a novel top-down perspective on gauging parameters in quantum field theories (QFTs) by promoting them to partially dynamical fields. Through a generalized notion of symmetry theories, we explore the consequences of this promotion, revealing new topological defects, decompositions as well as generalized symmetry structures across various dimensions. We provide a systematic top-down derivation of symmetry theories for parameters and discuss how special types of branes, such as Euclidean branes and fluxbranes are related to gauging in the parameter space in QFTs. We illustrate our theoretical framework with two key examples: the modified instanton sum in 4D $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory and the gauging of gauge ranks in 3D ABJ(M) theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note introduces a novel paradigm for conformal defects with continuously adjustable dimensions. Just as the standard $\varepsilon$ expansion interpolates between integer spacetime dimensions, a new parameter, $\delta$, is used to interpolate between different integer-dimensional defects. The ensuing framework is explored in detail for defects of dimension $p=2+\delta$ in both free and interacting $O(N)$ bulk conformal field theories (CFTs) in $d=4-\varepsilon$. Comprehensive calculations are performed to first and second order in $\varepsilon$ and to high or all orders in $\delta$. Additionally, in the large-$N$ limit, the interpolation between defects of dimensions $p=1$ and $p=2$ is analysed for spacetime dimensions $4\leq d\leq 6$. The new parameter $\delta$ provides a natural enrichment of the space of defect CFTs and allows to find new integer dimension or co-dimension defects.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in early universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm offers a method for constructing wave functions for both closed and open systems based on their Hamiltonians. Given that the entire early universe is fundamentally an open system, we apply the Lanczos algorithm to investigate Krylov complexity across different phases of the early universe, including inflation, the radiation-dominated period (RD), and the matter-dominated period (MD). Notably, we find that Krylov complexity differs between the closed and open system approaches. To effectively capture the impact of potentials during the RD and MD phases, we analyze various inflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, the \(R^2\) inflationary potential, and chaotic inflationary potential, which is taking into account the violations of slow-roll conditions. This analysis is conducted in terms of conformal time through the preheating process. Our numerical results indicate that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy is remarkably similar within distinctive potentials in RD and MD. Additionally, we rigorously construct what is referred to as an open two-mode squeezed state, utilizing the second kind of Meixner polynomials. Based on this construction, we are the first to calculate the evolution equations for \(r_k\) and \(\phi_k\) as they relate to the scale factor. Our findings suggest that dissipative effects lead to a rapid decoherence-like behavior. Moreover, our results indicate that inflation behaves as a strongly dissipative system, while both the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated phases exhibit characteristics of weak dissipation. This research provides new insights into exploring the universe from the perspective of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Bosonic and fermionic Gaussian states from K\"ahler structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.15518v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that bosonic and fermionic Gaussian states (also known as "squeezed coherent states") can be uniquely characterized by their linear complex structure $J$ which is a linear map on the classical phase space. This extends conventional Gaussian methods based on covariance matrices and provides a unified framework to treat bosons and fermions simultaneously. Pure Gaussian states can be identified with the triple $(G,\Omega,J)$ of compatible K\"ahler structures, consisting of a positive definite metric $G$, a symplectic form $\Omega$ and a linear complex structure $J$ with $J^2=-1\!\!1$. Mixed Gaussian states can also be identified with such a triple, but with $J^2\neq -1\!\!1$. We apply these methods to show how computations involving Gaussian states can be reduced to algebraic operations of these objects, leading to many known and some unknown identities. We apply these methods to the study of (A) entanglement and complexity, (B) dynamics of stable systems, (C) dynamics of driven systems. From this, we compile a comprehensive list of mathematical structures and formulas to compare bosonic and fermionic Gaussian states side-by-side.</description>

Abstract: We conjecture that the generating series of Gromov-Witten invariants of the Hilbert schemes of $n$ points on a K3 surface are quasi-Jacobi forms and satisfy a holomorphic anomaly equation. We prove the conjecture in genus $0$ and for at most $3$ markings - for all Hilbert schemes and for arbitrary curve classes. In particular, for fixed $n$, the reduced quantum cohomologies of all hyperk\"ahler varieties of $K3^{[n]}$-type are determined up to finitely many coefficients.
  As an application we show that the generating series of $2$-point Gromov-Witten classes are vector-valued Jacobi forms of weight $-10$, and that the fiberwise Donaldson-Thomas partition functions of an order two CHL Calabi-Yau threefold are Jacobi forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.00021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Without a complete theory of quantum gravity, the question of how quantum fields and quantum particles behave in a superposition of spacetimes seems beyond the reach of theoretical and experimental investigations. Here we use an extension of the quantum reference frame formalism to address this question for the Klein-Gordon field residing on a superposition of conformally equivalent metrics. Based on the group structure of ``quantum conformal transformations'', we construct an explicit quantum operator that can map states describing a quantum field on a superposition of spacetimes to states representing a quantum field with a superposition of masses on a Minkowski background. This constitutes an extended symmetry principle, namely invariance under quantum conformal transformations. The latter allows to build an understanding of superpositions of diffeomorphically non-equivalent spacetimes by relating them to a more intuitive superposition of quantum fields on curved spacetime. Furthermore, it can be used to import the phenomenon of particle production in curved spacetime to its conformally equivalent counterpart, thus revealing new features in modified Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we build the Hamiltonian system and the corresponding Lax pairs associated to a twisted connection in $\mathfrak{gl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ admitting an irregular and ramified pole at infinity of arbitrary degree, hence corresponding to the Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy. We provide explicit formulas for these Lax pairs and Hamiltonians in terms of the irregular times and standard $2g$ Darboux coordinates associated to the twisted connection. Furthermore, we obtain a map that reduces the space of irregular times to only $g$ non-trivial isomonodromic deformations. In addition, we perform a symplectic change of Darboux coordinates to obtain a set of symmetric Darboux coordinates in which Hamiltonians and Lax pairs are polynomial. Finally, we apply our general theory to the first cases of the hierarchy: the Airy case $(g=0)$, the Painlev\'{e} $1$ case $(g=1)$ and the next two elements of the Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy.</description>

Abstract: The Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory is an extension of General Relativity (GR), proposed for addressing galactic and cosmological observations without dark matter. By casting the AeST theory into a $3+1$ form, we determine its full non-perturbative Hamiltonian formulation and analyse the resulting constraints. We find the presence of four first class and four second class constraints and show that the theory has six physical degrees of freedom at the fully nonlinear level. Our results set the basis for determining the propagation of perturbations on general backgrounds and we present the case of small perturbations around Minkowski spacetime as an example stemming from our analysis.</description>

      <title>Is it possible to separate baryonic from dark matter within the $\Lambda$-CDM formalism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10364v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We found general solutions of matter stress-energy (non-)conservation in scalar-tensor FLRW-type cosmological models by extending the logotropic formalism to the case of non-minimal coupling between the scalar field and new dark fluid candidates. The energy conditions expressed by the generating function are introduced. Next, we investigate the possibility of separating baryonic from dark matter and explain their ratio as a chameleon effect in the presence of non-minimal coupling. To answer the question affirmatively we analyze simple extensions of the $\Lambda$-CDM model by adding a non-minimally coupled scalar field in the Einstein frame. Two scenarios involving either a scalaron (quintessence) or a phantom (ghost) are numerically solved and compared. As a result, it is shown that in both cases LCDM model can be reproduced with a high accuracy in the region covered by observations. We have also demonstrated the compatibility of the two models under consideration with available PPN parameters estimations. As expected, in the case of the phantom (ghost) field the Big-Bang scenario is replaced by the (matter) Bounce.</description>

      <title>Symmetries as Ground States of Local Superoperators: Hydrodynamic Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry algebras of quantum many-body systems with locality can be understood using commutant algebras, which are defined as algebras of operators that commute with a given set of local operators. In this work, we show that these symmetry algebras can be expressed as frustration-free ground states of a local superoperator, which we refer to as a ``super-Hamiltonian". We demonstrate this for conventional symmetries such as $Z_2$, $U(1)$, and $SU(2)$, where the symmetry algebras map to various kinds of ferromagnetic ground states, as well as for unconventional ones that lead to weak ergodicity breaking phenomena of Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scars. In addition, we show that the low-energy excitations of this super-Hamiltonian can be understood as approximate symmetries, which in turn are related to slowly relaxing hydrodynamic modes in symmetric systems. This connection is made precise by relating the super-Hamiltonian to the superoperator that governs the operator relaxation in noisy symmetric Brownian circuits, and this physical interpretation also provides a novel interpretation for Mazur bounds for autocorrelation functions. We find examples of gapped/gapless super-Hamiltonians indicating the absence/presence of slow-modes, which happens in the presence of discrete/continuous symmetries. In the gapless cases, we recover hydrodynamic modes such as diffusion, tracer diffusion, and asymptotic scars in the presence of $U(1)$ symmetry, Hilbert space fragmentation, and a tower of quantum scars respectively. In all, this demonstrates the power of the commutant algebra framework in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of exact symmetries, and associated approximate symmetries and hydrodynamic modes, and their dynamical consequences in systems with locality.</description>

      <title>A Bound on Thermalization from Diffusive Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local equilibration time of quantum many-body systems has been conjectured to satisfy a `Planckian bound', $\tau_{\rm eq}\gtrsim \frac{\hbar}{T}$. We provide a sharp and universal definition of this time scale, and show that it is bounded below by the strong coupling scale of diffusive fluctuations, which can be expressed in terms of familiar transport parameters. When applied to quantum field theories at finite temperature, this fluctuation bound implies the Planckian bound. The fluctuation bound moreover applies to any local thermalizing system, and we study its implication for correlated insulators, metals, as well as disordered fixed points, where it can be used to establish a lower bound on the diffusivity in terms of the specific heat $D\gtrsim 1/(c_V^{2/d}\tau_{\rm eq})$. Finally, we discuss how the local equilibration time can be directly measured in experiments.</description>

      <title>On some simple orbifold affine VOAs at non-admissible level arising from rank one 4D SCFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the representations of some simple affine vertex algebras at non-admissible level arising from rank one 4D SCFTs. In particular, we classify the irreducible highest weight modules of $L_{-2}(G_2)$ and $L_{-2}(B_3)$. It is known by the works of Adamovi\'{c} and Per\v{s}e that these vertex algebras can be conformally embedded into $L_{-2}(D_4)$. We also compute the associated variety of $L_{-2}(G_2)$, and show that it is the orbifold of the associated variety of $L_{-2}(D_4)$ by the symmetric group of degree 3 which is the Dynkin diagram automorphism group of $D_4$. This provides a new interesting example of associated variety satisfying a number of conjectures in the context of orbifold vertex algebras.</description>

      <title>Classical double copy in the black hole mini-superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09374v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a novel formulation of classical double copy in the mini-superspace of static, spherically symmetric black holes where the map between the solutions of general relativity and Maxwell's theory can be realized in Boyer-Lindsquit coordinates. By employing the reduced action principle, we show that the double copy structure can be generalized to Lovelock gravities and quasi-topological gravities. However, the gravitational solutions are mapped to the purely electric solutions of Maxwell's theory with a difference: instead of a direct match between the Kerr-Schild scalar in the gravity side and the scalar potential in the gauge theory side, the scalar potential becomes a polynomial in the Kerr-Schild scalar, giving rise to a generalization of the Kerr-Schild double copy. We calculate the Regge-Teitelboim surface charges and prove that the mass of the black hole solution is identified with the electric charge corresponding to the Coulomb part of the gauge theory solution in the same way it does in the case of general relativity.</description>

      <title>The Sine-Gordon QFT in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the massless Sine-Gordon model in de Sitter spacetime, in the regime $\beta^2 &lt; 4 \pi$ and using the framework of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory. We show that a Fock space representation exists for the free massless field, but that the natural one-parameter family of vacuum-like states breaks the de Sitter boost symmetries. We prove convergence of the perturbative series for the S matrix in this representation, and construct the interacting Haag-Kastler net of local algebras from the relative S matrices. We show that the net fulfills isotony, locality and de Sitter covariance (in the algebraic adiabatic limit), even though the states that we consider are not invariant. We furthermore prove convergence of the perturbative series for the interacting field and the vertex operators, and verify that the interacting equation of motion holds.</description>

      <title>Variable Brane Tension and Dark Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we show that in a particular braneworld scenario with variable brane tension, we obtain matter acting as dark energy while the gravitational constant $G$ promoted to a scalar field on the brane plays the role of matter (both in the sense they have an 'effective' Equation of State equivalent to that of dark energy and matter respectively). This result is interpreted from the Friedmann equation obtained from our model that exactly matches the standard Friedmann equation of General Relativity with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in terms of the aforementioned quantities. The universe is assumed to consist of only matter and dark energy in this model which is a good approximation for our universe. We also propose a way to unify early and late-time cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation for parallel motion in three-dimensional topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our study delves into the modifications observed in Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation when its generating charged particle moves parallel to an interface formed by two generic magnetoelectric media, focusing on topological insulators. We compute the electromagnetic field through the Green's function. Applying the far-field approximation and the steepest descent method, we derive analytical expressions for the electric field, revealing contributions from spherical and lateral waves with topological origins. Subsequently, we analyze the angular distribution of the radiation, particularly focusing on parallel motions in close proximity to the interface. Our findings indicate that the radiation along the Vavilov-Cherenkov cone is inhomogeneous and asymmetric. We analyze the radiated energy at both sides of the interface. Finally, we discuss the particle's retarding force, which is notably enhanced in the ultrarelativistic regime. We illustrate these results for the topological insulator TlBiSe$_2$ and the magnetoelectric TbPO$_4$.</description>

      <title>Radiative symmetry breaking from the on-shell perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models with classical scale symmetry, which feature radiative symmetry breaking, generically lead to a supercooled first-order phase transition in the early Universe resulting in a strong gravitational-wave signal, potentially observable by LISA. This is thanks to the absence of mass terms in the potential and the resulting logarithmic structure of the zero-temperature effective potential. It is known that imposing a symmetry at classical level does not prohibit breaking it by quantum corrections. In the case of scale symmetry, a mass term can in principle appear through renormalisation. This is not the case in the commonly used $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ or Coleman-Weinberg schemes. In this work, we renormalise a scale-invariant model in the on-shell scheme to check whether parameterising it with the physical masses will introduce mass terms to the potential. We find that indeed mass terms appear for an arbitrary choice of the physical masses. However, we formulate an on-shell condition for radiative symmetry breaking, sufficient and necessary for the cancellation of mass terms in the renormalised potential, yielding a logarithmic potential needed for supercooled phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Gravity-induced birefringence in spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometric optics effectively describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves when the wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic length scale of the medium, making wave phenomena like diffraction negligible. As a result, light propagation in a vacuum is typically modeled by rays that follow null geodesics. However, general relativity predicts that polarization-dependent deviations from these geodesics occur in an inhomogeneous gravitational field. In this article, we evaluate the corrections for the deflection and emission of light by a massive gravitating body. Additionally, we derive the scaling behavior of the physical parameters characterizing the trajectories. The calculations are performed at leading order in frequency. We use these results to assess the significance of the birefringence effect in various astrophysical observations. We find that the effect cannot be measured with current instruments but may be detectable in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we study and investigate the effects of the Generalised Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and electric charge on Casimir wormhole geometry in the Curvature-Lagrangian coupled $f(R,L_m)$ gravity. The functional form of the considered model is $f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2\kappa}+L_m^{\,\,\alpha}$, corresponding to it the analytic shape function is found. For our analysis, we study the wormhole spacetimes for three particular models for the redshift function. We observe that the null energy condition is violated despite a positive contribution from the electromagnetic energy density. We also note that electric charges, GUP effects, and higher model parameter values increase the throat length. Further, we have studied the deflection of light using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, emphasizing the contribution from GUP by including higher-order terms.</description>

      <title>Why do newer degrees of freedom appear in higher-order truncated hydrodynamic theory?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact derivation of relativistic hydrodynamics from an underlying microscopic theory has been shown to be an all-order theory. From the relativistic transport equation of kinetic theory, the full expressions of hydrodynamic viscous fluxes have been derived which turn out to include all orders of out-of-equilibrium derivative corrections. It has been shown, that for maintaining causality, it is imperative that the temporal derivatives must include all orders, which can be resummed in non-local, relaxation operator-like forms and finally `integrated in' introducing newer degrees of freedom. The theory can of course be truncated at any higher spatial orders, but the power over the the infinite temporal sum increases correspondingly such that the causality is respected. As a result, the theory truncated at any higher order of spatial gradient, requires newer degrees of freedom for each increasing order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the absence of a definitive top-down indication for understanding the peculiar structure of the lepton sector, discrete flavor symmetries offer a profound perspective for examining the intricate patterns of lepton masses and mixings. In this work, drawing upon previous studies on the interplay of flavor symmetries with the potential UV completions from a purely bottom-up perspective, three well-motivated discrete flavor groups, suitable for portraying the leptonic sector as well as the neutrino masses, specifically $A_4$, $A_5$ and $S_4$, are explored within this framework, leading to the comprehensive classification of the NP mediators, along with the tree-level matching relations onto dimension-6 SMEFT operators. Particular emphasis is placed on the discrete leptonic directions, for which a phenomenological analysis is carried out in order to constrain various NP mediators, where significant focus is directed towards the examination of the cLFV operators, which, for the wide range of applicable cases, offer the leading constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <title>Universal topological classifications of black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we investigate the universal classifications of black hole states by considering them as topological defects within the thermodynamic parameter space. Through the asymptotic behaviors of the constructed vector, our results indicate the existence of four distinct topological classifications, denoted as $W^{1-}$, $W^{0+}$, $W^{0-}$, and $W^{1+}$. Within these classifications, the innermost small black hole states are characterized as unstable, stable, unstable, and stable, respectively, while the outermost large ones exhibit an unstable, unstable, stable, and stable behavior. These classifications also display contrasting thermodynamic properties in both low and high Hawking temperature limits. Furthermore, we establish a systematic ordering of the local thermodynamically stable and unstable black hole states as the horizon radius increases for a specific topological classification. These results reveal the universal topological classifications governing black hole thermodynamics, providing valuable insights into the fundamental nature of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Existence of Vacuum Wormholes in Einsteinian Cubic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wormhole solutions in gravitational theories typically require exotic matter. Here we present a wormhole solution to the field equations of Einsteinian Cubic Gravity -- a phenomenological competitor to general relativity that includes terms cubic in the curvature -- that has no matter, exotic or otherwise. These purely gravitational wormhole geometries are asymptotically AdS but contain a geometric deficit at infinity. The deficit, interpreted as a global monopole, plays an essential role in our construction. We find that our wormhole solution satisfies traversablility criteria. We also find, for different parameters, a range of possible wormhole solutions.</description>

      <title>Further support for $S_8$ increasing with effective redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Adil et al. 2023, we reported an increasing trend in $S_8$ with effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ based on $f \sigma_8(z)$ constraints over the redshift range $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 2$, and predicted that this trend would be observable in independent datasets. Recently, the studies by Artis et al. and the ACT+DESI collaboration appeared, presenting data that aligns with the expected trends. In this letter, we quantify the statistical significance of the increasing $S_8$ trends in recent studies by fitting a linear model to estimate the slope $\Delta\,S_8/\Delta\, z_{\textrm{eff}}$, and comparing the results to mock simulations. We find probabilities of $p = 0.0163$ and $p = 0.01893$, corresponding to approximately $2.1\sigma$ for each dataset. Using Fisher's method to combine the independent probabilities, we obtained $p=0.0027$ ($2.8 \sigma$). When we incorporate our earlier findings, the combined statistical significance reaches between $3\sigma$ and $3.7\sigma$. Finally, we discuss how ``scatter" in $\sigma_8$/$S_8$ constraints from recent DESI full-shape galaxy clustering fits this picture at low statistical significance. This letter continues a series of studies initiated in 2020 that explore redshift-dependent $\Lambda$CDM parameters as an indication of a breakdown in the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Linearized gravitational waves in de Sitter space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a brief note on a recently flagged issue \cite{CHK} regarding the precise characterization of quadrupolar truncation of the linearized gravitational waves in de Sitter space-time. An apparent inconsistency was noted while transforming the linearized solution truncated to quadrupolar contribution to the Bondi-Sachs form. A consistent truncation was identified as one where the transformation of the truncated solution does not generate logarithmic terms inadmissible in the Bondi-Sachs asymptotic form.
  I point out the role of the gauge conditions and the solution of the homogeneous equation in obviating the apparent inconsistency issue.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic radiation from scalar and axion fields: distinguishability and detectability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the characteristics of electromagnetic (EM) radiation associated with scalar and axion field oscillations in different background field setups. Because the scalar field and axion field have different parity and couple with the EM field in different forms, the EM signals generated by the scalar and axion can be used to distinguish them. More interestingly, resonance effects amplify the difference between the two fields and consequent EM signal strength, which helps us distinguish and detect them in future observations.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing of chirality imbalance in SU(2) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement a variational quantum algorithm to investigate the chiral condensate in a 1+1 dimensional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge theory. The algorithm is evaluated using a proposed Monte Carlo sampling method, which allows the extension to large qubit systems. The obtained results through quantum simulations on classical and actual quantum hardware are in good agreement with exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian, revealing the phenomena of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration as functions of both temperature and chemical potential. Our findings underscore the potential of near-term quantum computing for exploring QCD systems at finite temperature and density in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>
