      <description>arXiv:2406.05457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an iterated Sacks forcing and topological games, we prove that the existence of a totally imperfect Menger set in the Cantor cube with cardinality continuum, is independent from ZFC. We also analyze structures of Hurewicz or consonant subsets of the Cantor cube in the Sacks model.</description>

      <title>Free algebras and coproducts in varieties of G\"odel algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G\"odel algebras are the Heyting algebras satisfying the axiom $(x \to y) \vee (y \to x)=1$. We utilize Priestley and Esakia dualities to dually describe free G\"odel algebras and coproducts of G\"odel algebras. In particular, we realize the Esakia space dual to a G\"odel algebra free over a distributive lattice as the, suitably topologized and ordered, collection of all nonempty closed chains of the Priestley dual of the lattice. This provides a dual description of free G\"odel algebras without any restriction on the number of free generators, which generalizes known results for the finitely generated case. A similar approach allows us to characterize the Esakia spaces dual to coproducts of arbitrary families of G\"odel algebras. We also establish analogous dual descriptions of free algebras and coproducts in every variety of G\"odel algebras. As consequences of these results, we obtain a formula to compute the depth of coproducts of G\"odel algebras and show that all free G\"odel algebras are bi-Heyting algebras.</description>

      <title>Oracle modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new formulation of Turing reducibility in terms of higher modalities, inspired by an embedding of the Turing degrees in the lattice of subtoposes of the effective topos discovered by Hyland. In this definition, higher modalities play a similar role to I/O monads or dialogue trees in allowing a function to receive input from an external oracle. However, in homotopy type theory they have better logical properties than monads: they are compatible with higher types, and each modality corresponds to a reflective subuniverse that under suitable conditions is itself a model of homotopy type theory.
  We give synthetic proofs of some basic results about Turing reducibility in cubical type theory making use of two axioms of Markov induction and computable choice. Both axioms are variants of axioms already studied in the effective topos. We show they hold in certain reflective subuniverses of cubical assemblies, demonstrate their use in some simple proofs in synthetic computability theory using modalities, and show they are downwards absolute for oracle modalities. These results have been formalised using cubical mode of the Agda proof assistant.
  We explore some first connections between Turing reducibility and homotopy theory. This includes a synthetic proof that two Turing degrees are equal as soon as they induce isomorphic permutation groups on the natural numbers, making essential use of both Markov induction and the formulation of groups in HoTT as pointed, connected, 1-truncated types. We also give some simple non-topological examples of modalities in cubical assemblies based on these ideas, to illustrate what we expect higher dimensional analogues of the Turing degrees to look like.</description>

      <title>The class and dynamics of $\alpha$-balanced Polish groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each ordinal $\alpha&lt;\omega_1$, we introduce the class of $\alpha$-balanced Polish groups. These classes form a hierarchy that completely stratifies the space between the class of Polish groups admitting a two-side-invariant metric (TSI) and the class of Polish groups admitting a complete left-invariant metric (CLI). We establish various closure properties, provide connections to model theory, and we develop a boundedness principle for CLI groups by showing that $\alpha$-balancedness is an initial segment of a regular coanalytic rank.
  In the spirit of Hjorth's turbulence theory we also introduce "generic $\alpha$-unbalancedness": a new dynamical condition for Polish $G$-spaces which serves as an obstruction to classification by actions of $\alpha$-balanced Polish groups. We use this to provide, for each $\alpha&lt;\omega_1$, an action of an $\alpha$-balanced Polish group whose orbit equivalence relation is strongly generically ergodic against actions of any $\beta$-balanced Polish group with $\beta&lt;\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Ladder mice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume ZF + AD + $V=L(\mathbb{R})$. We prove some "mouse set" theorems, for definability over $J_\alpha(\mathbb{R})$ where $[\alpha,\alpha]$ is a projective-like gap (of $L(\mathbb{R})$) and $\alpha$ is either a successor ordinal or has countable cofinality, but $\alpha\neq\beta+1$ where $\beta$ ends a strong gap. For such ordinals $\alpha$ and integers $n\geq 1$, we show that there is a mouse $M$ with $\mathbb{R}\cap M=\mathrm{OD}_{\alpha n}$.
  The proof involves an analysis of ladder mice and their generalizations to $J_\alpha(\mathbb{R})$. This analysis is related to earlier work of Rudominer, Woodin and Steel on ladder mice. However, it also yields a new proof of the mouse set theorem even at the least point where ladder mice arise -- one which avoids the stationary tower. The analysis also yields a corresponding "anti-correctness" result on a cone, generalizing facts familiar in the projective hierarchy; for example, that $(\Pi^1_3)^V\upharpoonright M_1$ truth is $(\Sigma^1_3)^{M_1}$-definable and $(\Sigma^1_3)^{M_1}$ truth is $(\Pi^1_3)^V\upharpoonright M_1$-definable.
  We also define and study versions of ladder mice on a cone at the end of weak gap, and at the successor of the end of a strong gap, and an anti-correctness result on a cone there.</description>

      <title>The Lattice Problem for Models of $\mathsf{PA}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lattice problem for models of Peano Arithmetic ($\mathsf{PA}$) is to determine which lattices can be represented as lattices of elementary submodels of a model of $\mathsf{PA}$, or, in greater generality, for a given model $\mathcal{M}$, which lattices can be represented as interstructure lattices of elementary submodels $\mathcal{K}$ of an elementary extension $\mathcal{N}$ such that $\mathcal{M} \preccurlyeq \mathcal{K} \preccurlyeq \mathcal{N}$. The problem has been studied for the last 60 years and the results and their proofs show an interesting interplay between the model theory of PA, Ramsey style combinatorics, lattice representation theory, and some results in elementary number theory. We present a survey of the most important results together with a detailed analysis of some special cases to explain and motivate a technique of CPP-representations developed by James Schmerl for constructing elementary extensions with prescribed interstructure lattices. The last section is devoted to a discussion of lesser-known results about lattices of elementary submodels of countable recursively saturated models of PA.</description>

      <title>A propositional cirquent calculus for computability logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cirquent calculus is a proof system with inherent ability to account for sharing subcomponents in
  logical expressions. Within its framework, this article constructs an axiomatization CL18 of the basic
  propositional fragment of computability logic the game-semantically conceived logic of computational
  resources and tasks. The nonlogical atoms of this fragment represent arbitrary so called static games, and
  the connectives of its logical vocabulary are negation and the parallel and choice versions of conjunction
  and disjunction. The main technical result of the article is a proof of the soundness and completeness of
  CL18 with respect to the semantics of computability logic.</description>

      <title>On the limit of the first incompleteness theorem: revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.12233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is motivated from finding the limit of the applicability of the first incompleteness theorem ($\sf G1$). A natural question is: can we find a minimal theory for which $\sf G1$ holds? The answer of this question depends on our definition of minimality. We examine the Turing degree structure of recursively enumerable (RE) theories for which $\sf G1$ holds and the interpretation degree structure of RE theories weaker than the theory $\mathbf{R}$ with respect to interpretation for which $\sf G1$ holds. We answer all questions about these two structures in our past work and prove more results about them. It is known that there are no minimal essentially undecidable theories with respect to interpretation. We generalize this result and give two general characterizations which tell us under what conditions there are no minimal RE theories having some property with respect to interpretation. Finally, as an application, we propose the theory version of recursively inseparable theories, ${\sf tRI}$ theories, and show that there are no minimal ${\sf tRI}$ theories with respect to interpretation: for any ${\sf tRI}$ theory, we can effectively find a ${\sf tRI}$ theory which is strictly weaker with respect to interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07321v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate some Weihrauch problems between $\mathsf{ATR}_2$ and $\mathsf{C}_{\omega^\omega}$ . We show that the fixed point theorem for monotone operators on the Cantor space (a weaker version of the Knaster-Tarski theorem) is not Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{ATR}_2$. Furthermore, we introduce the $\omega$-model reflection $\mathsf{ATR}_2^{\mathrm{rfn}}$ of $\mathsf{ATR} $ and show that it is an upper bound for problems provable from the axiomatic system $\mathrm{ATR}_0$ which are of the form $\forall X(\theta(X) \to \exists Y \eta(X, Y ))$ with arithmetical formulas $\theta, \eta$. We also show that Weihrauch degrees of relativized least fixed point theorem for monotone operators on the Cantor space forms a linear hierarchy between $\mathsf{ATR}^{\mathrm{rfn}}$ and $\mathsf{C}_{\omega^\omega} $.</description>

      <title>New definitions in the theory of Type 1 computable topological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type 1 computability -- computability based on the use of numberings -- is one of several ways of developing systematically computable mathematics. This approach can be considered particularly important since it is the one that focuses on finite descriptions. The study of Type 1 computability of topological spaces can be understood as the study of topological spaces some of whose open sets admit finite descriptions. We define Type 1 computable topological spaces without making reference to a basis. Following work of Spreen, we show that the use of a formal inclusion relation should be systematized. We give the first general definition of the computable topology associated to a computable metric that does not rely on effective separability. This definition can be translated to other constructive settings, and its relevance goes beyond that of Type 1 computability. We also compare different notions of effective basis. The first one, introduced by Nogina, is based on an effective version of the statement ``a set $O$ is open if for any point in $O$, there is a basic set containing that point and contained in $O$''. The second one, associated to Lacombe, is based on an effective version of ``a set $O$ is open if it can be written as a union of basic open sets''. We show that neither of the notions of basis we thus obtain is completely satisfactory. We define a new notion of basis, based on an effective version of the Nogina statement, but using a formal inclusion relation. Finally, we obtain a new version of the theorem of Moschovakis which states that the Lacombe and Nogina approaches coincide on countable recursive Polish spaces, but which applies to sets equipped with non-onto numberings, and with effective separability as a sole hypothesis.</description>

      <title>On Quantifiers for Quantitative Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a kind of first-order predicate logic with intended semantics in the reals. Compared to other approaches in the literature, we work predominantly in the multiplicative reals [0,\infty], showing they support three generations of connectives, that we call non-linear, linear additive, and linear multiplicative. Means and harmonic means emerge as natural candidates for bounded existential and universal quantifiers, and in fact we see they behave as expected in relation to the other logical connectives. We explain this fact through the well-known fact that min/max and arithmetic mean/harmonic mean sit at opposite ends of a spectrum, that of p-means. We give syntax and semantics for this quantitative predicate logic, and as example applications, we show how softmax is the quantitative semantics of argmax, and R\'enyi entropy/Hill numbers are additive/multiplicative semantics of the same formula. Indeed, the additive reals also fit into the story by exploiting the Napierian duality -log \dashv 1/exp, which highlights a formal distinction between 'additive' and 'multiplicative' quantities. Finally, we describe two attempts at a categorical semantics via enriched hyperdoctrines. We discuss why hyperdoctrines are in fact probably inadequate for this kind of logic.</description>

      <title>Gabriel-Ulmer Duality for Topoi, An Introduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to relate the classical result of Gabriel-Ulmer to the geometry of topoi. The usage of the attribute 'left exact' when dealing with functors involved in this duality is indeed not casual and it is related to the geometrical side of the story, i.e. sheaf theory, as in \cite{SGA}. Thought to be a very basic introduction to the subject, it is mostly self-contained. The reader is assumed to be familiar with the fundamentals of category theory, no further prerequisite knowledge is required. The proof of Gabriel-Ulmer duality follows \cite{MP}.</description>

Abstract: We investigate completions of partial combinatory algebras (pcas), in particular of Kleene's second model $\mathcal{K}_2$ and generalizations thereof. We consider weak and strong notions of embeddability and completion that have been studied before. By a result of Klop it is known that not every pca has a strong completion. The study of completions of $\mathcal{K}_2$ has as corollaries that weak and strong embeddings are different, and that every countable pca has a weak completion. We then consider generalizations of $\mathcal{K}_2$ for larger cardinals, and use these to show that it is consistent that every pca has a weak completion.</description>

      <title>Constructive Interpolation and Concept-Based Beth Definability for Description Logics via Sequents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a constructive method applicable to a large number of description logics (DLs) for establishing the concept-based Beth definability property (CBP) based on sequent systems. Using the highly expressive DL RIQ as a case study, we introduce novel sequent calculi for RIQ-ontologies and show how certain interpolants can be computed from sequent calculus proofs, which permit the extraction of explicit definitions of implicitly definable concepts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sequent-based approach to computing interpolants and definitions within the context of DLs, as well as the first proof that RIQ enjoys the CBP. Moreover, due to the modularity of our sequent systems, our results hold for any restriction of RIQ, and are applicable to other DLs by suitable modifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study limit models in the abstract elementary class of modules with embeddings as algebraic objects. We characterize parametrized noetherian rings using the degree of injectivity of certain limit models.
  We show that the number of limit models and how close a ring is from being noetherian are inversely proportional.
  $\textbf{Theorem.}$ Let $n \geq 0$ The following are equivalent.
  1. $R$ is left $(&lt;\aleph_{n } )$-noetherian but not left $(&lt; \aleph_{n -1 })$-noetherian.
  2.The abstract elementary class of modules with embeddings has exactly $n +1$ non-isomorphic $\lambda$-limit models for every $\lambda \geq (\operatorname{card}(R) + \aleph_0)^+$ such that the class is stable in $\lambda$.
  We further show that there are rings such that the abstract elementary class of modules with embeddings has exactly $\kappa$ non-isomorphic $\lambda$-limit models for every infinite cardinal $\kappa$.</description>
