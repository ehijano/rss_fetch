      <title>Content-Agnostic Moderation for Stance-Neutral Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized recommendation systems often drive users towards more extreme content, exacerbating opinion polarization. While (content-aware) moderation has been proposed to mitigate these effects, such approaches risk curtailing the freedom of speech and of information. To address this concern, we propose and explore the feasibility of \emph{content-agnostic} moderation as an alternative approach for reducing polarization. Content-agnostic moderation does not rely on the actual content being moderated, arguably making it less prone to forms of censorship. We establish theoretically that content-agnostic moderation cannot be guaranteed to work in a fully generic setting. However, we show that it can often be effectively achieved in practice with plausible assumptions. We introduce two novel content-agnostic moderation methods that modify the recommendations from the content recommender to disperse user-item co-clusters without relying on content features.
  To evaluate the potential of content-agnostic moderation in controlled experiments, we built a simulation environment to analyze the closed-loop behavior of a system with a given set of users, recommendation system, and moderation approach. Through comprehensive experiments in this environment, we show that our proposed moderation methods significantly enhance stance neutrality and maintain high recommendation quality across various data scenarios. Our results indicate that achieving stance neutrality without direct content information is not only feasible but can also help in developing more balanced and informative recommendation systems without substantially degrading user engagement.</description>

      <title>Mitigate Position Bias with Coupled Ranking Bias on CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Position bias, i.e., users' preference of an item is affected by its placing position, is well studied in the recommender system literature. However, most existing methods ignore the widely coupled ranking bias, which is also related to the placing position of the item. Using both synthetic and industrial datasets, we first show how this widely coexisted ranking bias deteriorates the performance of the existing position bias estimation methods. To mitigate the position bias with the presence of the ranking bias, we propose a novel position bias estimation method, namely gradient interpolation, which fuses two estimation methods using a fusing weight. We further propose an adaptive method to automatically determine the optimal fusing weight. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and industrial datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>SynerGraph: An Integrated Graph Convolution Network for Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a novel approach to multimodal recommendation systems, focusing on integrating and purifying multimodal data. Our methodology starts by developing a filter to remove noise from various types of data, making the recommendations more reliable. We studied the impact of top-K sparsification on different datasets, finding optimal values that strike a balance between underfitting and overfitting concerns. The study emphasizes the significant role of textual information compared to visual data in providing a deep understanding of items. We conducted sensitivity analyses to understand how different modalities and the use of purifier circle loss affect the efficiency of the model. The findings indicate that systems that incorporate multiple modalities perform better than those relying on just one modality. Our approach highlights the importance of modality purifiers in filtering out irrelevant data, ensuring that user preferences remain relevant. Models without modality purifiers showed reduced performance, emphasizing the need for effective integration of pre-extracted features. The proposed model, which includes an novel self supervised auxiliary task, shows promise in accurately capturing user preferences. The main goal of the fusion technique is to enhance the modeling of user preferences by combining knowledge with item information, utilizing sophisticated language models. Extensive experiments show that our model produces better results than the existing state-of-the-art multimodal recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Continual Collaborative Distillation for Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a promising technique for addressing the computational challenges associated with deploying large-scale recommender systems. KD transfers the knowledge of a massive teacher system to a compact student model, to reduce the huge computational burdens for inference while retaining high accuracy. The existing KD studies primarily focus on one-time distillation in static environments, leaving a substantial gap in their applicability to real-world scenarios dealing with continuously incoming users, items, and their interactions. In this work, we delve into a systematic approach to operating the teacher-student KD in a non-stationary data stream. Our goal is to enable efficient deployment through a compact student, which preserves the high performance of the massive teacher, while effectively adapting to continuously incoming data. We propose Continual Collaborative Distillation (CCD) framework, where both the teacher and the student continually and collaboratively evolve along the data stream. CCD facilitates the student in effectively adapting to new data, while also enabling the teacher to fully leverage accumulated knowledge. We validate the effectiveness of CCD through extensive quantitative, ablative, and exploratory experiments on two real-world datasets. We expect this research direction to contribute to narrowing the gap between existing KD studies and practical applications, thereby enhancing the applicability of KD in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Source Retrieval Question Answering Framework Based on RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large-scale language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been widely adopted. However, existing RAG paradigms are inevitably influenced by erroneous retrieval information, thereby reducing the reliability and correctness of generated results. Therefore, to improve the relevance of retrieval information, this study proposes a method that replaces traditional retrievers with GPT-3.5, leveraging its vast corpus knowledge to generate retrieval information. We also propose a web retrieval based method to implement fine-grained knowledge retrieval, Utilizing the powerful reasoning capability of GPT-3.5 to realize semantic partitioning of problem.In order to mitigate the illusion of GPT retrieval and reduce noise in Web retrieval,we proposes a multi-source retrieval framework, named MSRAG, which combines GPT retrieval with web retrieval. Experiments on multiple knowledge-intensive QA datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework in this study performs better than existing RAG framework in enhancing the overall efficiency and accuracy of QA systems.</description>

      <title>Potential Field Based Deep Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) involves training a network to learn a semantically meaningful representation space. Many current approaches mine n-tuples of examples and model interactions within each tuplets. We present a novel, compositional DML model, inspired by electrostatic fields in physics that, instead of in tuples, represents the influence of each example (embedding) by a continuous potential field, and superposes the fields to obtain their combined global potential field. We use attractive/repulsive potential fields to represent interactions among embeddings from images of the same/different classes. Contrary to typical learning methods, where mutual influence of samples is proportional to their distance, we enforce reduction in such influence with distance, leading to a decaying field. We show that such decay helps improve performance on real world datasets with large intra-class variations and label noise. Like other proxy-based methods, we also use proxies to succinctly represent sub-populations of examples. We evaluate our method on three standard DML benchmarks- Cars-196, CUB-200-2011, and SOP datasets where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Its Not a Modality Gap: Characterizing and Addressing the Contrastive Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal contrastive models such as CLIP achieve state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot classification by embedding input images and texts on a joint representational space. Recently, a modality gap has been reported in two-encoder contrastive models like CLIP, meaning that the image and text embeddings reside in disjoint areas of the latent space. Previous studies suggest that this gap exists due to 1) the cone effect, 2) mismatched pairs in the dataset, and 3) insufficient training. We show that, even when accounting for all these factors, and even when using the same modality, the contrastive loss actually creates a gap during training. As a result, We propose that the modality gap is inherent to the two-encoder contrastive loss and rename it the contrastive gap. We present evidence that attributes this contrastive gap to low uniformity in CLIP space, resulting in embeddings that occupy only a small portion of the latent space. To close the gap, we adapt the uniformity and alignment properties of unimodal contrastive loss to the multi-modal setting and show that simply adding these terms to the CLIP loss distributes the embeddings more uniformly in the representational space, closing the gap. In our experiments, we show that the modified representational space achieves better performance than default CLIP loss in downstream tasks such as zero-shot image classification and multi-modal arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Evolutionary Learning to Select Feature Interactions for Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature interaction selection is a fundamental problem in commercial recommender systems. Most approaches equally enumerate all features and interactions by the same pre-defined operation under expert guidance. Their recommendation is unsatisfactory sometimes due to the following issues: (1)~They cannot ensure the learning abilities of models because their architectures are poorly adaptable to tasks and data; (2)~Useless features and interactions can bring unnecessary noise and complicate the training process. In this paper, we aim to adaptively evolve the model to select appropriate operations, features, and interactions under task guidance. Inspired by the evolution and functioning of natural organisms, we propose a novel \textsl{Cognitive EvoLutionary Learning (CELL)} framework, where cognitive ability refers to a property of organisms that allows them to react and survive in diverse environments. It consists of three stages, i.e., DNA search, genome search, and model functioning. Specifically, if we regard the relationship between models and tasks as the relationship between organisms and natural environments, interactions of feature pairs can be analogous to double-stranded DNA, of which relevant features and interactions can be analogous to genomes. Along this line, we diagnose the fitness of the model on operations, features, and interactions to simulate the survival rates of organisms for natural selection. We show that CELL can adaptively evolve into different models for different tasks and data, which enables practitioners to access off-the-shelf models. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that CELL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Also, we conduct synthetic experiments to ascertain that CELL can consistently discover the pre-defined interaction patterns for feature pairs.</description>

      <title>CtrlA: Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Probe-Guided Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution for mitigating hallucinations of large language models (LLMs) with retrieved external knowledge. Adaptive RAG enhances this approach by dynamically assessing the retrieval necessity, aiming to balance external and internal knowledge usage. However, existing adaptive RAG methods primarily realize retrieval on demand by relying on superficially verbalize-based or probability-based feedback of LLMs, or directly fine-tuning LLMs via carefully crafted datasets, resulting in unreliable retrieval necessity decisions, heavy extra costs, and sub-optimal response generation. We present the first attempts to delve into the internal states of LLMs to mitigate such issues by introducing an effective probe-guided adaptive RAG framework, termed CtrlA. Specifically, CtrlA employs an honesty probe to regulate the LLM's behavior by manipulating its representations for increased honesty, and a confidence probe to monitor the internal states of LLM and assess confidence levels, determining the retrieval necessity during generation. Experiments show that CtrlA is superior to existing adaptive RAG methods on a diverse set of tasks, the honesty control can effectively make LLMs more honest and confidence monitoring is proven to be a promising indicator of retrieval trigger. Our codes are available at https://github.com/HSLiu-Initial/CtrlA.git.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Many-To-Many Relationships for Defending Against Visual-Language Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that vision-language (VL) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks for image-text retrieval (ITR). However, existing defense strategies for VL models primarily focus on zero-shot image classification, which do not consider the simultaneous manipulation of image and text, as well as the inherent many-to-many (N:N) nature of ITR, where a single image can be described in numerous ways, and vice versa. To this end, this paper studies defense strategies against adversarial attacks on VL models for ITR for the first time. Particularly, we focus on how to leverage the N:N relationship in ITR to enhance adversarial robustness. We found that, although adversarial training easily overfits to specific one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in the train data, diverse augmentation techniques to create one-to-many (1:N) / many-to-one (N:1) image-text pairs can significantly improve adversarial robustness in VL models. Additionally, we show that the alignment of the augmented image-text pairs is crucial for the effectiveness of the defense strategy, and that inappropriate augmentations can even degrade the model's performance. Based on these findings, we propose a novel defense strategy that leverages the N:N relationship in ITR, which effectively generates diverse yet highly-aligned N:N pairs using basic augmentations and generative model-based augmentations. This work provides a novel perspective on defending against adversarial attacks in VL tasks and opens up new research directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the External and Parametric Knowledge Fusion of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs) presents a promising solution to overcome the limitations imposed by their antiquated and static parametric memory. Prior studies, however, have tended to over-reliance on external knowledge, underestimating the valuable contributions of an LLMs' intrinsic parametric knowledge. The efficacy of LLMs in blending external and parametric knowledge remains largely unexplored, especially in cases where external knowledge is incomplete and necessitates supplementation by their parametric knowledge. We propose to deconstruct knowledge fusion into four distinct scenarios, offering the first thorough investigation of LLM behavior across each. We develop a systematic pipeline for data construction and knowledge infusion to simulate these fusion scenarios, facilitating a series of controlled experiments. Our investigation reveals that enhancing parametric knowledge within LLMs can significantly bolster their capability for knowledge integration. Nonetheless, we identify persistent challenges in memorizing and eliciting parametric knowledge, and determining parametric knowledge boundaries. Our findings aim to steer future explorations on harmonizing external and parametric knowledge within LLMs.</description>

      <title>An engine not a camera: Measuring performative power of online search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The power of digital platforms is at the center of major ongoing policy and regulatory efforts. To advance existing debates, we designed and executed an experiment to measure the power of online search providers, building on the recent definition of performative power. Instantiated in our setting, performative power quantifies the ability of a search engine to steer web traffic by rearranging results. To operationalize this definition we developed a browser extension that performs unassuming randomized experiments in the background. These randomized experiments emulate updates to the search algorithm and identify the causal effect of different content arrangements on clicks. We formally relate these causal effects to performative power. Analyzing tens of thousands of clicks, we discuss what our robust quantitative findings say about the power of online search engines. More broadly, we envision our work to serve as a blueprint for how performative power and online experiments can be integrated with future investigations into the economic power of digital platforms.</description>

      <title>Multi-stage Retrieve and Re-rank Model for Automatic Medical Coding Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) serves as a definitive medical classification system encompassing a wide range of diseases and conditions. The primary objective of ICD indexing is to allocate a subset of ICD codes to a medical record, which facilitates standardized documentation and management of various health conditions. Most existing approaches have suffered from selecting the proper label subsets from an extremely large ICD collection with a heavy long-tailed label distribution. In this paper, we leverage a multi-stage ``retrieve and re-rank'' framework as a novel solution to ICD indexing, via a hybrid discrete retrieval method, and re-rank retrieved candidates with contrastive learning that allows the model to make more accurate predictions from a simplified label space. The retrieval model is a hybrid of auxiliary knowledge of the electronic health records (EHR) and a discrete retrieval method (BM25), which efficiently collects high-quality candidates. In the last stage, we propose a label co-occurrence guided contrastive re-ranking model, which re-ranks the candidate labels by pulling together the clinical notes with positive ICD codes. Experimental results show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of measures on the MIMIC-III benchmark.</description>

      <title>CaLa: Complementary Association Learning for Augmenting Composed Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) involves searching for target images based on an image-text pair query. While current methods treat this as a query-target matching problem, we argue that CIR triplets contain additional associations beyond this primary relation. In our paper, we identify two new relations within triplets, treating each triplet as a graph node. Firstly, we introduce the concept of text-bridged image alignment, where the query text serves as a bridge between the query image and the target image. We propose a hinge-based cross-attention mechanism to incorporate this relation into network learning. Secondly, we explore complementary text reasoning, considering CIR as a form of cross-modal retrieval where two images compose to reason about complementary text. To integrate these perspectives effectively, we design a twin attention-based compositor. By combining these complementary associations with the explicit query pair-target image relation, we establish a comprehensive set of constraints for CIR. Our framework, CaLa (Complementary Association Learning for Augmenting Composed Image Retrieval), leverages these insights. We evaluate CaLa on CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks with multiple backbones, demonstrating its superiority in composed image retrieval.</description>

      <title>Learning from Litigation: Graphs and LLMs for Retrieval and Reasoning in eDiscovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19164</link>

Abstract: Electronic Discovery (eDiscovery) involves identifying relevant documents from a vast collection based on legal production requests. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) has transformed this process, helping document review and enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Although traditional approaches like BM25 or fine-tuned pre-trained models are common in eDiscovery, they face performance, computational, and interpretability challenges. In contrast, Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods prioritize interpretability but sacrifice performance and throughput. This paper introduces DISCOvery Graph (DISCOG), a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of two worlds: a heterogeneous graph-based method for accurate document relevance prediction and subsequent LLM-driven approach for reasoning. Graph representational learning generates embeddings and predicts links, ranking the corpus for a given request, and the LLMs provide reasoning for document relevance. Our approach handles datasets with balanced and imbalanced distributions, outperforming baselines in F1-score, precision, and recall by an average of 12%, 3%, and 16%, respectively. In an enterprise context, our approach drastically reduces document review costs by 99.9% compared to manual processes and by 95% compared to LLM-based classification methods</description>

      <title>UP5: Unbiased Foundation Model for Fairness-aware Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Foundation Models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled them to the forefront of Recommender Systems (RS). Despite their utility, there is a growing concern that LLMs might inadvertently perpetuate societal stereotypes, resulting in unfair recommendations. Since fairness is critical for RS as many users take it for decision-making and demand fulfillment, this paper focuses on user-side fairness for LLM-based recommendation where the users may require a recommender system to be fair on specific sensitive features such as gender or age. In this paper, we dive into the extent of unfairness exhibited by LLM-based recommender models based on both T5 and LLaMA backbones, and discuss appropriate methods for promoting equitable treatment of users in LLM-based recommendation models. We introduce a novel Counterfactually-Fair-Prompt (CFP) method towards Unbiased Foundation mOdels (UFO) for fairness-aware LLM-based recommendation. Experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets, MovieLens-1M and Insurance, and compared with both matching-based and sequential-based fairness-aware recommendation models. Results show that CFP achieves better recommendation performance with a high level of fairness. Data and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/agiresearch/UP5.</description>

      <title>Semantic In-Domain Product Identification for Search Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate explicit and implicit product identification in search queries is critical for enhancing user experiences, especially at a company like Adobe which has over 50 products and covers queries across hundreds of tools. In this work, we present a novel approach to training a product classifier from user behavioral data. Our semantic model led to &gt;25% relative improvement in CTR (click through rate) across the deployed surfaces; a &gt;50% decrease in null rate; a 2x increase in the app cards surfaced, which helps drive product visibility.</description>

      <title>InstructRetro: Instruction Tuning post Retrieval-Augmented Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretraining auto-regressive large language models~(LLMs) with retrieval demonstrates better perplexity and factual accuracy by leveraging external databases. However, the size of existing pretrained retrieval-augmented LLM is still limited (e.g., Retro has 7.5B parameters), which limits the effectiveness of instruction tuning and zero-shot generalization. In this work, we introduce Retro 48B, the largest LLM pretrained with retrieval. Specifically, we continue to pretrain a 43B GPT model on additional 100 billion tokens using the Retro augmentation method by retrieving from 1.2 trillion tokens. Notably, the obtained foundation model, Retro 48B, largely outperforms the counterpart GPT 43B trained on 1.2T tokens in terms of perplexity with only 2.58% additional GPU hours, demonstrating the significant scaling potential of the method. After instruction tuning on Retro, InstructRetro demonstrates significant improvement over the instruction tuned GPT on a wide range of zero-shot tasks. Specifically, the average improvement of InstructRetro is 7% over its GPT counterpart across 8 short-form QA and reading comprehension tasks, 10% over GPT across 4 challenging long-form QA tasks, and 16% over GPT across 3 summarization tasks. Surprisingly, we find that one can ablate the encoder from InstructRetro architecture and directly use its decoder backbone, while achieving comparable results. Our results highlight the promising direction to obtain a better GPT decoder through continued pretraining with retrieval before instruction tuning. Our code and checkpoints are publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/retro-48b-instruct-4k.</description>

      <title>GEO: Generative Engine Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has ushered in a new paradigm of search engines that use generative models to gather and summarize information to answer user queries. This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improves \textit{user} utility and \textit{generative search engine} traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder - website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over \textit{when} and \textit{how} their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in GE responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\% in GE responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of GEs and content creators.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Generation for Domain-specific Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Question answering (QA) has become an important application in the advanced development of large language models. General pre-trained large language models for question-answering are not trained to properly understand the knowledge or terminology for a specific domain, such as finance, healthcare, education, and customer service for a product. To better cater to domain-specific understanding, we build an in-house question-answering system for Adobe products. We propose a novel framework to compile a large question-answer database and develop the approach for retrieval-aware finetuning of a Large Language model. We showcase that fine-tuning the retriever leads to major improvements in the final generation. Our overall approach reduces hallucinations during generation while keeping in context the latest retrieval information for contextual grounding.</description>
