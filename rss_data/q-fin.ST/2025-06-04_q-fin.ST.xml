      <title>Why Regression? Binary Encoding Classification Brings Confidence to Stock Market Index Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock market indices serve as fundamental market measurement that quantify systematic market dynamics. However, accurate index price prediction remains challenging, primarily because existing approaches treat indices as isolated time series and frame the prediction as a simple regression task. These methods fail to capture indices' inherent nature as aggregations of constituent stocks with complex, time-varying interdependencies. To address these limitations, we propose Cubic, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly models the adaptive fusion of constituent stocks for index price prediction. Our main contributions are threefold. i) Fusion in the latent space: we introduce the fusion mechanism over the latent embedding of the stocks to extract the information from the vast number of stocks. ii) Binary encoding classification: since regression tasks are challenging due to continuous value estimation, we reformulate the regression into the classification task, where the target value is converted to binary and we optimize the prediction of the value of each digit with cross-entropy loss. iii) Confidence-guided prediction and trading: we introduce the regularization loss to address market prediction uncertainty for the index prediction and design the rule-based trading policies based on the confidence. Extensive experiments across multiple stock markets and indices demonstrate that Cubic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in stock index prediction tasks, achieving superior performance on both forecasting accuracy metrics and downstream trading profitability.</description>

      <title>CatNet: Controlling the False Discovery Rate in LSTM with SHAP Feature Importance and Gaussian Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce CatNet, an algorithm that effectively controls False Discovery Rate (FDR) and selects significant features in LSTM. CatNet employs the derivative of SHAP values to quantify the feature importance, and constructs a vector-formed mirror statistic for FDR control with the Gaussian Mirror algorithm. To avoid instability due to nonlinear or temporal correlations among features, we also propose a new kernel-based independence measure. CatNet performs robustly on different model settings with both simulated and real-world data, which reduces overfitting and improves interpretability of the model. Our framework that introduces SHAP for feature importance in FDR control algorithms and improves Gaussian Mirror can be naturally extended to other time-series or sequential deep learning models.</description>
