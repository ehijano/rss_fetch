      <title>Controls Abstraction Towards Accelerator Physics: A Middle Layer Python Package for Particle Accelerator Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control system middle layers act as a co-ordination and communication bridge between end users, including operators, system experts, scientists, and experimental users, and the low-level control system interface. This article describes a Python package -- Controls Abstraction Towards Acclerator Physics (CATAP) -- which aims to build on previous experience and provide a modern Python-based middle layer with explicit abstraction, YAML-based configuration, and procedural code generation. CATAP provides a structured and coherent interface to a control system, allowing researchers and operators to centralize higher-level control logic and device information. This greatly reduces the amount of code that a user must write to perform a task, and codifies system knowledge that is usually anecdotal. The CATAP design has been deployed at two accelerator facilities, and has been developed to produce a procedurally generated facility-specific middle layer package from configuration files to enable its wider dissemination across other machines.</description>

      <title>Physical Properties of Materials and Testing Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of materials in particle accelerator applications implies the consideration of physical properties in different environments than usual industrial applications. Cryogenic temperatures, high radiation, medium to high vacuum and high magnetic fields are requirements for which the behavior of materials has to be evaluated. In this lecture, Thermal, Electrical and Magnetic properties are briefly introduced, highlighting the mechanisms governing variation with temperature and magnetic field. Standards and testing methods for different properties are described, illustrated with practical examples. With regard to the characterization of thermal properties of a material, testing methods of heat capacity and thermal conductivity are described, with details of the main working principle and measurement examples. Determination of electrical resistivity and the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) are the main characteristics of electrical properties, together with specific characterization of superconducting materials. Testing magnetic properties deserve special attention; different methods are commonly employed to characterize non-magnetic and magnetic materials. In magnetic metals and ferrites non-linear behavior and hysteresis effects need to be considered in order to assess their suitability for applications or to model material performance.</description>

      <title>Matching Optimization for TRIUMF's Rare Isotope Linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fringe field effects are computed from simulated and measured quadrupole magnetic field gradients, enabling a more realistic modelling of the medium energy section optics in TRIUMF's RIB postaccelerator. Quantifying the fringe field optics using the method developed by Matsuda and Wollnik allows for the use of parallel modelling tune optimizations for machine operation, providing operators with an efficient means to re-tune the variable energy drift tube linac for RIB delivery.</description>
