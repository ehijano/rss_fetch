      <title>LiteCUA: Computer as MCP Server for Computer-Use Agent on AIOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present AIOS 1.0, a novel platform designed to advance computer-use agent (CUA) capabilities through environmental contextualization. While existing approaches primarily focus on building more powerful agent frameworks or enhancing agent models, we identify a fundamental limitation: the semantic disconnect between how language models understand the world and how computer interfaces are structured. AIOS 1.0 addresses this challenge by transforming computers into contextual environments that language models can natively comprehend, implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server architecture to abstract computer states and actions. This approach effectively decouples interface complexity from decision complexity, enabling agents to reason more effectively about computing environments. To demonstrate our platform's effectiveness, we introduce LiteCUA, a lightweight computer-use agent built on AIOS 1.0 that achieves a 14.66% success rate on the OSWorld benchmark, outperforming several specialized agent frameworks despite its simple architecture. Our results suggest that contextualizing computer environments for language models represents a promising direction for developing more capable computer-use agents and advancing toward AI that can interact with digital systems. The source code of LiteCUA is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/LiteCUA, and it is also integrated into the AIOS main branch as part of AIOS at https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS.</description>
