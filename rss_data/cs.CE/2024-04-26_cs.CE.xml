      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Predicting the Next Targets of Activist Funds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a predictive model to identify potential targets of activist investment funds, which strategically acquire significant corporate stakes to drive operational and strategic improvements and enhance shareholder value. Predicting these targets is crucial for companies to mitigate intervention risks, for activists to select optimal targets, and for investors to capitalize on associated stock price gains. Our analysis utilizes data from the Russell 3000 index from 2016 to 2022. We tested 123 variations of models using different data imputation, oversampling, and machine learning methods, achieving a top AUC-ROC of 0.782. This demonstrates the model's effectiveness in identifying likely targets of activist funds. We applied the Shapley value method to determine the most influential factors in a company's susceptibility to activist investment. This interpretative approach provides clear insights into the driving forces behind activist targeting. Our model offers stakeholders a strategic tool for proactive corporate governance and investment strategy, enhancing understanding of the dynamics of activist investing.</description>

      <title>Design optimization of advanced tow-steered composites with manufacturing constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tow steering technologies, such as Automated fiber placement, enable the fabrication of composite laminates with curvilinear fiber, tow, or tape paths. Designers may therefore tailor tow orientations locally according to the expected local stress state within a structure, such that strong and stiff orientations of the tow are (for example) optimized to provide maximal mechanical benefit. Tow path optimization can be an effective tool in automating this design process, yet has a tendency to create complex designs that may be challenging to manufacture. In the context of tow steering, these complexities can manifest in defects such as tow wrinkling, gaps, overlaps. In this work, we implement manufacturing constraints within the tow path optimization formulation to restrict the minimum tow turning radius and the maximum density of gaps between and overlaps of tows. This is achieved by bounding the local value of the curl and divergence of the vector field associated with the tow orientations. The resulting local constraints are effectively enforced in the optimization framework through the Augmented Lagrangian method. The resulting optimization methodology is demonstrated by designing 2D and 3D structures with optimized tow orientation paths that maximize stiffness (minimize compliance) considering various levels of manufacturing restrictions. The optimized tow paths are shown to be structurally efficient and to respect imposed manufacturing constraints. As expected, the more geometrical complexity that can be achieved by the feedstock tow and placement technology, the higher the stiffness of the resulting optimized design.</description>

      <title>On Hybrid Gene Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a class of hybrid dynamical systems called hybrid gene regulatory networks (HGRNs) which was proposed to model gene regulatory networks. In HGRNs, there exist well-behaved trajectories that reach a fixed point or converge to a limit cycle, as well as chaotic trajectories that behave non-periodic or indeterministic. In our work, we investigate these irregular behaviors of HGRNs and present theoretical results about the decidability of the reachability problem, the probability of indeterministic behavior of HGRNs, and chaos especially in 2-dimensional HGRNs.</description>

      <title>A splitting, discontinuous Galerkin solver for the cell-by-cell electroneutral Nernst-Planck framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical models for excitable tissue with explicit representation of individual cells are highly detailed and can, unlike classical homogenized models, represent complex cellular geometries and local membrane variations. However, these cell-based models are challenging to approximate numerically, partly due to their mixed-dimensional nature with unknowns both in the bulk and at the lower-dimensional cellular membranes. We here develop and evaluate a novel solution strategy for the cell-based KNP-EMI model describing ionic electrodiffusion in and between intra- and extracellular compartments with explicit representation of individual cells. The strategy is based on operator splitting, a multiplier-free formulation of the coupled dynamics across sub-regions, and a discontinuous Galerkin discretization. In addition to desirable theoretical properties, such as local mass conservation, the scheme is practical as it requires no specialized functionality in the finite element assembly and order optimal solvers for the resulting linear systems can be realized with black-box algebraic multigrid preconditioners. Numerical investigations show that the proposed solution strategy is accurate, robust with respect to discretization parameters, and that the parallel scalability of the solver is close to optimal - both for idealized and realistic two and three dimensional geometries.</description>

      <title>Data-driven building energy efficiency prediction using physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analytical prediction of building energy performance in residential buildings based on the heat losses of its individual envelope components is a challenging task. It is worth noting that this field is still in its infancy, with relatively limited research conducted in this specific area to date, especially when it comes for data-driven approaches. In this paper we introduce a novel physics-informed neural network model for addressing this problem. Through the employment of unexposed datasets that encompass general building information, audited characteristics, and heating energy consumption, we feed the deep learning model with general building information, while the model's output consists of the structural components and several thermal properties that are in fact the basic elements of an energy performance certificate (EPC). On top of this neural network, a function, based on physics equations, calculates the energy consumption of the building based on heat losses and enhances the loss function of the deep learning model. This methodology is tested on a real case study for 256 buildings located in Riga, Latvia. Our investigation comes up with promising results in terms of prediction accuracy, paving the way for automated, and data-driven energy efficiency performance prediction based on basic properties of the building, contrary to exhaustive energy efficiency audits led by humans, which are the current status quo.</description>
