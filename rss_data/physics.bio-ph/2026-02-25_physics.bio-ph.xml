      <title>Programming Shapes with Competing Layered Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying shape changing thick surfaces induced by differential growth helps us understand morphogenesis in biology and offers opportunities for device design. While ideal 2D differential growth maps have been well studied for both isotropic and anisotropic growth, scenarios involving gradients in thickness growth are far less explored. In this paper, we focus on a bilayer system in which the two layers undergo independent but incompatible growth. We examine how the strength of the growth patterns and the aspect ratio of the bilayer influence the resulting shapes. We first investigate the effect of global area difference in the bilayer. Next, we make one of the two layers active and program it with positive or negative, localized or uniform curvature. We then present examples involving competition between two active surfaces with opposite curvature signs or different curvature distributions and understand how the final configurations follow from the principles identified earlier. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to program biologically inspired shapes, such as dental epithelium and the ventral furrow in Drosophila, using a bilayer with simple, distinct deformation gradients.</description>

      <title>Tipping points in complex ecological systems</title>

Abstract: Tipping points are one of the hot topics in modern physics of complex systems. But what is a tipping point? A generic definition declares it as ``a state of the system where a small change in its parameters can lead to a significant change in its properties''. Additional ingredients that often enter the definition of tipping process are the abruptness of the resulting change and its irreversibility, i.e. it is impossible to recover the initial state if one reverses the protocol of change of the parameters. However, there exists a number of different mathematical structures that can show this behavior, the one that was originally suggested as a tipping point (nowadays usually referred to as bifurcation induced tipping) is just one of many. Different preconditions and/or different level of details included into the model, reflecting also different environmental forcing, can lead to a variety of tipping mechanisms. Furthermore, in a spatially extended system and/or a system with multiple scales, different parts can react to a change in environmental conditions differently or at a different time, interacting with each other to create a tipping cascade. In this paper, using ecosystems as a paradigm of complex nonlinear open systems, we provide a critical overview of the progress made in tipping point science over the last 15 years. We highlight the main findings, identify gaps in our knowledge, and outline a roadmap for further progress.</description>

      <title>Lost in Projection? Gaussian Filtering Recovers Hidden Conformational States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To interpret molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is common practice to reduce the dimensionality of the molecular coordinates to a low-dimensional collective variable $x$. Projecting the high-dimensional MD data onto $x$ yields a free energy landscape $\Delta G(x)$, which highlights low-energy regions corresponding to conformational states. The accurate definition of these states, however, is often impeded by projection artifacts, resulting in artificially shortened state lifetimes or even the complete disappearance of states from the analysis. As demonstrated for a two-dimensional toy model, Gaussian low-pass filtering of the high-dimensional MD coordinates can restore the underlying free energy landscape, allowing to recover previously hidden states. When applied to an all-atom folding trajectory of HP35, the number of microstates increases by an order of magnitude, which leads to metastable states that are long-lived and much better defined structurally, even compared to dynamically cored state trajectories.</description>

      <title>Discovering universal temperature regulation dynamics in animals</title>

Abstract: Hibernation is an adaptation to extreme environmental seasonality that has been studied for almost 200 years, but our understanding of the underlying physiological system remains lacking due to the partially observed nature of the system. During hibernation, small mammals, such as the Arctic ground squirrel, exhibit dramatic oscillations in body temperature, typically one of the only physiological states measured, of up to 40 $^{\circ}$C. These spikes are known as interbout arousals and typically occur 10-20 times throughout hibernation. The physiological process that drives interbout arousals is unknown, but two distinct macro-scale mechanisms have been hypothesized. Using model selection for partially observed systems and classical dynamical systems theory, we are able to differentiate between these two hypotheses using only body temperature data recorded from a free-ranging Arctic ground squirrel, and show that our model can capture the broad features of the observed seasonal physiological transitions. We then modify our discovered physiological model of Arctic ground squirrel to include neurally-encoded environmental information and find that we can qualitatively match body temperature data recorded from a wide range of species, including a bird, a shrew, and a bear, which also dynamically modulate body temperature. Our results suggest that a universal, environmentally sensitive core regulator could control body temperature across a diverse range of species -- a restructuring of our current understanding of the physiological organization across species. While the findings presented here are applicable to thermophysiology, the general modeling procedure is applicable to time series data collected from partially observed biological, chemical, physical, mechanical, and cosmic systems for which the goal is to elucidate the underlying mechanism or control structure.</description>

      <title>Entropy-driven physical amplification in multivalent biosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00346v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensitive detection of low-abundance molecular targets is widely assumed to require enzymatic amplification, such as PCR, to achieve low detection limits. In amplification-free platforms, sensitivity is traditionally constrained by equilibrium binding affinity. Here we show that multivalent linker entropy provides a distinct physical route to exponential sensitivity enhancement in purely equilibrium sensing architectures. Using a statistical-mechanical theory supported by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that redistributing a fixed total interaction strength over increasing linker valency exponentially lowers adsorption thresholds. This scaling emerges not from stronger energetic affinity, but from the rapid growth of combinatorial binding configurations, revealing entropy as an intrinsic amplification mechanism. Consequently, detection limits can be tuned independently of bond strength, enabling ultrasensitive responses without enzymatic replication. Our results establish a general physical design principle for engineering amplification-free detection systems capable of approaching PCR-level sensitivities through entropy-driven collective effects.</description>
