      <title>UniFi: Combining Irregularly Sampled CSI from Diverse Communication Packets and Frequency Bands for Wi-Fi Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Wi-Fi sensing systems rely on injecting high-rate probing packets to extract channel state information (CSI), leading to communication degradation and poor deployability. Although Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a promising direction, existing solutions still rely on auxiliary packet injection because they exploit only CSI from data frames. We present UniFi, the first Wi-Fi-based ISAC framework that fully eliminates intrusive packet injection by directly exploiting irregularly sampled CSI from diverse communication packets across multiple frequency bands. UniFi integrates a CSI sanitization pipeline to harmonize heterogeneous packets and remove burst-induced redundancy, together with a time-aware attention model that learns directly from non-uniform CSI sequences without resampling. We further introduce CommCSI-HAR, the first dataset with irregularly sampled CSI from real-world dual-band communication traffic. Extensive evaluations on this dataset and four public benchmarks show that UniFi achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with a compact model size, while fully preserving communication throughput.</description>

      <title>EEG-to-Voice Decoding of Spoken and Imagined speech Using Non-Invasive EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restoring speech communication from neural signals is a central goal of brain-computer interface research, yet EEG-based speech reconstruction remains challenging due to limited spatial resolution, susceptibility to noise, and the absence of temporally aligned acoustic targets in imagined speech. In this study, we propose an EEG-to-Voice paradigm that directly reconstructs speech from non-invasive EEG signals without dynamic time warping (DTW) or explicit temporal alignment. The proposed pipeline generates mel-spectrograms from EEG in an open-loop manner using a subject-specific generator, followed by pretrained vocoder and automatic speech recognition (ASR) modules to synthesize speech waveforms and decode text. Separate generators were trained for spoken speech and imagined speech, and transfer learning-based domain adaptation was applied by pretraining on spoken speech and adapting to imagined speech. A minimal language model-based correction module was optionally applied to correct limited ASR errors while preserving semantic structure. The framework was evaluated under 2 s and 4 s speech conditions using acoustic-level metrics (PCC, RMSE, MCD) and linguistic-level metrics (CER, WER). Stable acoustic reconstruction and comparable linguistic accuracy were observed for both spoken speech and imagined speech. While acoustic similarity decreased for longer utterances, text-level decoding performance was largely preserved, and word-position analysis revealed a mild increase in decoding errors toward later parts of sentences. The language model-based correction consistently reduced CER and WER without introducing semantic distortion. These results demonstrate the feasibility of direct, open-loop EEG-to-Voice reconstruction for spoken speech and imagined speech without explicit temporal alignment.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Basil Yield Prediction in IoT-Enabled Indoor Vertical Hydroponic Farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As agriculture faces increasing pressure from water scarcity, especially in regions like Tunisia, innovative, resource-efficient solutions are urgently needed. This work explores the integration of indoor vertical hydroponics with Machine Learning (ML) techniques to optimize basil yield while saving water. This research develops a prediction system that uses different ML models and assesses their performance. The models were systematically trained and tested using data collected from IoT sensors of various environmental parameters like CO2, light. The experimental setup features 21 basil crops and uses Raspberry Pi and Arduino. 10k data points were collected and used to train and evaluate three ML models: Linear Regression (LR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The comparative analysis of the performance of each model revealed that, while LSTM showed high predictive capability and accuracy of 99%, its execution time was 10 times longer than LR and its RAM usage was about 3 times higher than DNN's when simulated on a standard CPU environment. Conversely, the DNN model had an accuracy rate of 98%. This proves an efficient balance between computational speed and prediction quality, which makes this model well-suited for real-life deployment. Moreover, LR excelled in fast processing of basic prediction with an execution time of 11 seconds. This makes the LR model more suitable for low-complexity or resource-limited applications. These performance trade-offs highlight the potential of DNN-based solutions for building responsive, high-accuracy decision-support systems tailored to agricultural environments, making it suitable for future edge-device deployment.</description>

      <title>PaperNet: Efficient Temporal Convolutions and Channel Residual Attention for EEG Epilepsy Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals contain rich temporal-spectral structure but are difficult to model due to noise, subject variability, and multi-scale dynamics. Lightweight deep learning models have shown promise, yet many either rely solely on local convolutions or require heavy recurrent modules. This paper presents PaperNet, a compact hybrid architecture that combines temporal convolutions, a channel-wise residual attention module, and a lightweight bidirectional recurrent block which is used for short-window classification. Using the publicly available BEED: Bangalore EEG Epilepsy Dataset, we evaluate PaperNet under a clearly defined subject-independent training protocol and compare it against established and widely used lightweight baselines. The model achieves a macro-F1 of 0.96 on the held-out test set with approximately 0.6M parameters, while maintaining balanced performance across all four classes. An ablation study demonstrates the contribution of temporal convolutions, residual attention, and recurrent aggregation. Channel-wise attention weights further offer insights into electrode relevance. Computational profiling shows that PaperNet remains efficient enough for practical deployment on resource-constrained systems through out the whole process. These results indicate that carefully combining temporal filtering, channel reweighting, and recurrent context modeling can yield strong EEG classification performance without excessive computational cost.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Source Separation, Synchronization, Localization and Mapping for 6G Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipath-based simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) is a promising approach for future 6G networks to jointly estimate the positions of transmitters and receivers together with the propagation environment. In cooperative MP-SLAM, information collected by multiple mobile terminals (MTs) is fused to enhance accuracy and robustness. Existing methods, however, typically assume perfectly synchronized base stations (BSs) and orthogonal transmission sequences, rendering inter-BS interference at the MTs negligible. In this work, we relax these assumptions and address simultaneous source separation, synchronization, and mapping. A relevant example arises in modern 5G systems, where BSs employ muting patterns to mitigate interference, yet localization performance still degrades. We propose a novel BS-dependent data association and synchronization bias model, integrated into a joint Bayesian framework and inferred via the sum-product algorithm on a factor graph. The impact of joint synchronization and source separation is analyzed under various system configurations. Compared with state-of-the-art cooperative MP-SLAM assuming orthogonal and synchronized BSs, our statistical analysis shows no significant performance degradation.</description>

      <title>FARIS: Fluid-Active-RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a fluid-active reconfigurable intelligent surface (FARIS) that combines fluid-based port repositioning with per-element active amplification to enhance the performance of 6G network. To characterize the performance, we formulate an ergodic-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes both the active amplification-reflection vector and the discrete selection of fluid active elements under practical hardware constraints. The problem is addressed via an alternating optimization (AO) framework, which progressively improves the rate. Complexity and convergence analyses that follow furnish deeper insight into the algorithmic operation and performance enhancement. Numerical results confirm that the proposed FARIS with AO framework consistently outperforms conventional FRIS/ARIS, delivering higher rates across diverse environments, often even when using fewer active elements or a smaller physical aperture.</description>

      <title>CoDS: Collaborative Perception via Digital Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication has been introduced into collaborative perception systems for autonomous driving, offering a promising approach to enhancing data transmission efficiency and robustness. Despite its potential, existing semantic communication approaches predominantly rely on analog transmission models, rendering these systems fundamentally incompatible with the digital architecture of modern vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks and posing a significant barrier to real-world deployment. To bridge this critical gap, we propose CoDS, a novel collaborative perception framework based on digital semantic communication, designed to realize semantic-level transmission efficiency within practical digital communication systems. Specifically, we develop a semantic compression codec that extracts and compresses task-oriented semantic features while preserving downstream perception accuracy. Building on this, we propose a novel semantic analog-to-digital converter that converts these continuous semantic features into a discrete bitstream, ensuring integration with existing digital communication pipelines. Furthermore, we develop an uncertainty-aware network (UAN) that assesses the reliability of each received feature and discards those corrupted by decoding failures, thereby mitigating the cliff effect of conventional channel coding schemes under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoDS significantly outperforms existing semantic communication and traditional digital communication schemes, achieving state-of-the-art perception performance while ensuring compatibility with practical digital V2X systems.</description>

      <title>Compressive Toeplitz Covariance Estimation From Few-Bit Quantized Measurements With Applications to DOA Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating the Hermitian Toeplitz covariance matrix under practical hardware constraints of sparse observations and coarse quantization. Within the triangular-dithered quantization framework, we propose an estimator called Toeplitz-projected sample covariance matrix (Q-TSCM) to compensate for the quantization-induced bias, together with its finite-bit counterpart termed the $2k$-bit Toeplitz-projected sample covariance matrix ($2k$-TSCM), obtained by truncating the pre-quantization observations. Under the complex Gaussian assumption, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds of the estimators that reveal a quadratic dependence on the quantization level and capture the effect of sparse sampling patterns through the so-called coverage coefficient. To further improve performance, we propose the quantized sparse and parametric approach (Q-SPA) based on a covariance-fitting criterion, which enforces additionally positive semidefiniteness at the cost of solving a semidefinite program. Numerical experiments are presented that corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimators in the application to direction-of-arrival estimation.</description>

      <title>A Novel Geometry-Aware GPR-Based Energy-Efficient and Low-Overhead Channel Estimation Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we model the wireless channel as a complex-valued Gaussian process (GP) over the transmit and receive antenna arrays. The channel covariance is characterized using an antenna-geometry-based spectral mixture covariance function (GB-SMCF), which captures the spatial structure of the antenna arrays. To address the problem of accurate channel state information (CSI) estimation from very few noisy observations, we develop a Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based channel estimation framework that employs the GB-SMCF as a prior covariance model with online hyperparameter optimization. In the proposed scheme, the full channel is learned by transmitting pilots from only a small subset of transmit antennas while receiving them at all receive antennas, resulting in noisy partial CSI at the receiver. These limited observations are then processed by the GPR framework, which updates the GB-SMCF hyperparameters online from incoming measurements and reconstructs the full CSI in real time. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GB-SMCF-based estimator outperforms baseline methods while reducing pilot overhead and training energy by up to 50$\%$ compared to conventional schemes.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Multi-Target Detection and Tracking with mmWave 5G NR Waveforms on RFSoC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a real-time implementation of multi-target detection and tracking using 5G New Radio (NR) physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) waveform with 400 MHz bandwidth at 28 GHz carrier frequency. The hardware platform is built on a radio frequency system-on-chip (RFSoC) 4x2 board connected with a pair of Sivers EVK02001 mmWave beamformers for transmission and reception. The entire sensing transceiver processing and fast beam control are realized purely in the programmable logic (PL) part of the RFSoC, enabling low-latency and fully hardware-accelerated operation. The continuously acquired sensing data constitute 3D range-angle (RA) tensors, which are processed on a host PC using adaptive background subtraction, cell-averaging constant false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) detection with density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering, and extended Kalman filtering (EKF), to detect and track targets in the environment. Our software-defined radio (SDR) testbed integrates heterogeneous computing resources, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs, thereby providing design flexibility for a wide range of tasks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis develops signal-processing algorithms and implementation schemes under constraints of minimal parallelism and memory space, with the goal of improving energy efficiency of low-power computing hardware. We propose (i) a power/energy consumption model for clocked CMOS logic that supports selecting optimal parallelism, (ii) integer-friendly approximation methods for elementary functions that reduce lookup-table size via constrained piecewise-polynomial (quasi-spline) constructions with accuracy guarantees, (iii) provably conflict-free data placement and execution order for mixed-radix streaming FFT on multi-bank and single-port memories, including a self-sorting FFT variant, and (iv) a parallelism/memory analysis of the fast Schur algorithm for superfast Toeplitz system solving, motivated by echo-cancellation workloads. The results provide constructive theorems, schedules, and design trade-offs enabling efficient specialized accelerators.</description>

      <title>Multistatic Radar Performance in the Presence of Distributed Wireless Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a multistatic radar (MSR) system utilizing a distributed wireless synchronization protocol. The wireless synchronization protocol uses a two-tone waveform exchange for frequency synchronization and a bi-directional waveform exchange for time synchronization, independent of GPS. A Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bound (BCRLB) framework is developed to quantify the impact of synchronization offsets on joint delay and Doppler estimation, and consequently, on target localization and velocity estimation accuracy. Simulation results derived from the analytical expressions establish the extent to which the residual synchronization offsets degrade the MSR's performance. The performance of the synchronization links primarily depends on the synchronization-link channel and transmit parameters; optimizing these parameters enables the MSR configuration to surpass the monostatic performance and approach the ideal case. Furthermore, the simulated synchronization-link parameters suggest that practical implementation is feasible.</description>

      <title>Instance Communication System for Intelligent Connected Vehicles: Bridging the Gap from Semantic to Instance-Level Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs) rely on high-speed data transmission for efficient and safety-critical services. However, the scarcity of wireless resources limits the capabilities of ICVs. Semantic Communication (SemCom) systems can alleviate this issue by extracting and transmitting task-relevant information, termed semantic information, instead of the entire raw data. Despite this, we reveal that residual redundancy persists within SemCom systems, where not all instances under the same semantic category are equally critical for downstream tasks. To tackle this issue, we introduce Instance Communication (InsCom), which elevates communication from the semantic level to the instance level for ICVs. Specifically, InsCom uses a scene graph generation model to identify all image instances and analyze their inter-relationships, thus distinguishing between semantically identical instances. Additionally, it applies user-configurable, task-critical criteria based on subject semantics and relation-object pairs to filter recognized instances. Consequently, by transmitting only task-critical instances, InsCom significantly reduces data redundancy, substantially enhancing transmission efficiency within limited wireless resources. Evaluations across various datasets and wireless channel conditions show that InsCom achieves a data volume reduction of over 7.82 times and a quality improvement ranging from 1.75 to 14.03 dB compared to the state-of-the-art SemCom systems.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Phase Errors in Phase-Dependent Amplitudes of Near-Field RISs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates mutual coupling between phase-dependent amplitudes (PDAs) and designed phase shifts within pixels of near-field (NF) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in the presence of phase errors (PEs). In contrast to existing research that treats phase shifts with errors (PSEs) and the PDAs separately, we introduce a remaining power (RP) metric to quantify the proportion of power preserved in the signals reflected by the RIS, and we prove its asymptotic convergence to theoretical values by leveraging extended Glivenko-Cantelli theorem. Then, the RP of signals passing through RIS pixels is jointly examined under combined phase and amplitude uncertainties. In addition, we propose four pixel reflection models to capture practical conditions, and we derive approximate polynomial upper bounds for the RP with error terms by applying Taylor expansion. Furthermore, based on Friis transmission formula and projected aperture, we propose a general NF channel model that incorporates the coupling between the PSEs and the PDAs. By using Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality and Riemann sums, we derive a closed-form upper bound on spectral efficiency, and the bound becomes tighter as the pixel area decreases. We reveal that as the RIS phase shifts approach the ends of their range, the RP under independent and identically distributed PEs is smaller than that under fully correlated PEs, whereas this relationship reverses when the phase shifts are near the middle of their range. Neglecting the PEs in the PDAs leads to an overestimation of the RIS performance gain, explaining the discrepancies between theoretical and measured results.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Learning for Massive MIMO CSI Feedback in Unseen Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning is promising to enhance the accuracy and reduce the overhead of channel state information (CSI) feedback, which can boost the capacity of frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Nevertheless, the generalizability of current deep learning-based CSI feedback algorithms cannot be guaranteed in unseen environments, which induces a high deployment cost. In this paper, the generalizability of deep learning-based CSI feedback is promoted with physics interpretation. Firstly, the distribution shift of the cluster-based channel is modeled, which comprises the multi-cluster structure and single-cluster response. Secondly, the physics-based distribution alignment is proposed to effectively address the distribution shift of the cluster-based channel, which comprises multi-cluster decoupling and fine-grained alignment. Thirdly, the efficiency and robustness of physics-based distribution alignment are enhanced. Explicitly, an efficient multi-cluster decoupling algorithm is proposed based on the Eckart-Young-Mirsky (EYM) theorem to support real-time CSI feedback. Meanwhile, a hybrid criterion to estimate the number of decoupled clusters is designed, which enhances the robustness against channel estimation error. Fourthly, environment-generalizable neural network for CSI feedback (EG-CsiNet) is proposed as a novel learning framework with physics-based distribution alignment. Based on extensive simulations and sim-to-real experiments in various conditions, the proposed EG-CsiNet can robustly reduce the generalization error by more than 3 dB compared to the state-of-the-arts.</description>

      <title>Confidence analysis-based hybrid heartbeat detection for ballistocardiogram using template matching and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heartbeat interval can be detected from ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals in a non-contact manner. Conventional methods achieved heartbeat detection from different perspectives, where template matching (TM) and deep learning (DL) were based on the similarity of neighboring heartbeat episodes and robust spatio-temporal characteristics, respectively, and thus, performed varied from case to case. Inspired by the above facts, we propose confidence analysis-based hybrid heartbeat detection using both TM and DL, and further explore the advantages of both methods in various scenarios. To be specific, the confidence of the heartbeat detection results was evaluated by the consistency of signal morphology and the variability of the detected heartbeat intervals, which could be formulated by the averaged correlation between each heartbeat episode and the detected template and the normalized standard deviation among detected heartbeat intervals, respectively, where the results with higher confidence were remained. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method, we conducted experiments using practical clinical BCG dataset with 34 subjects including 924,235 heartbeats. Numerical results showed that the proposed hybrid method achieved an average absolute interval error of 20.73 ms, yielding a reduction of 29.28 ms and 10.13 ms compared to solo TM and DL methods, respectively. Besides, case study showed the robustness of heartbeat detection of TM and DL to individual differences and signal quality, respectively, and in turn, validated that the hybrid method could benefit from the complementary advantages of both methods, which demonstrated the superiority of the proposed hybrid method in practical BCG monitoring scenarios.</description>

      <title>Masked Sequence Autoencoding for Enhanced Defect Visualization in Active Infrared Thermography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active infrared thermography (AIRT) became a crucial tool in aerospace non-destructive testing (NDT), enabling the detection of hidden defects and anomalies in materials by capturing thermal responses over time. In AIRT, autoencoders are widely used to enhance defect detection by reducing the dimensionality of thermal data and improving the signal-to-noise ratio. However, traditional AIRT autoencoders often struggle to disentangle subtle defect features from dominant background responses, leading to suboptimal defect analysis under varying material and inspection conditions. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a Masked CNN-Attention Autoencoder (AIRT-Masked-CAAE) that integrates convolutional feature extraction with attention mechanisms to capture both local thermal patterns and global contextual dependencies. The AIRT-Masked-CAAE introduces a masked sequence autoencoding strategy, where the network learns to infer missing thermal responses from surrounding contextual cues, while suppressing background redundancy. In addition, the proposed masked sequence autoencoding approach enables training on only a subset of the thermal sequence, while providing generalizable latent representations and reducing training time by a factor of 30. The AIRT-Masked-CAAE framework was evaluated using specimens made of PVC, CFRP, and PLA. The results demonstrate that the AIRT-Masked-CAAE surpasses state-of-the-art AIRT autoencoders in terms of contrast, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and metrics based on neural networks.</description>

      <title>Flexible Intelligent Metasurface for Downlink Communications under Statistical CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM) is a recently developed, groundbreaking hardware technology with promising potential for 6G wireless systems. Unlike conventional rigid antenna array (RAA)-based transmitters, FIM-assisted transmitters can dynamically alter their physical surface through morphing, offering new degrees of freedom to enhance system performance. In this letter, we depart from prior works that rely on instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and instead address the problem of average sum spectral efficiency maximization under statistical CSI in a FIM-assisted downlink multiuser multiple-input single-output setting. To this end, we first derive the spatial correlation matrix for the FIM-aided transmitter and then propose an iterative FIM optimization algorithm based on the gradient projection method. Simulation results show that with statistical CSI, the FIM-aided system provides a significant performance gain over its RAA-based counterpart in scenarios with strong spatial channel correlation, whereas the gain diminishes when the channels are weakly correlated.</description>

      <title>Unscented and Higher-Order Linear Covariance Fidelity Checks and Measures of Non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear covariance (LinCov) techniques have gained widespread traction in the modeling of uncertainty, including in the preliminary study of spacecraft navigation performance. While LinCov methods offer improved computational efficiency compared to Monte Carlo based uncertainty analysis, they inherently rely on linearization approximations. Understanding the fidelity of these approximations and identifying when they are deficient is critically important for spacecraft navigation and mission planning, especially when dealing with highly nonlinear systems and large state uncertainties. This work presents a number of computational techniques for assessing linear covariance performance. These new LinCov fidelity measures are formulated using higher-order statistics, constrained optimization, and the unscented transform.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Massive MIMO with Orthogonal Chirp Division Multiplexing for Near-Field Sensing and Communication Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper integrates the emerging ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) technique with orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM) waveform to tackle the challenging near-field integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) problem. Specifically, we conceive a comprehensive ISAC architecture, where an UM-MIMO base station adopts OCDM waveform for communications and a co-located sensing receiver adopts the frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) detection principle to simplify the associated hardware. For sensing tasks, several OCDM subcarriers, namely, dedicated sensing subcarriers (DSSs), are each transmitted through a dedicated sensing antenna (DSA) within the transmit antenna array. By judiciously designing the DSS selection scheme and optimizing receiver parameters, the FMCW-based sensing receiver can decouple the echo signals from different DSAs with significantly reduced hardware complexity. This setup enables the estimation of ranges and velocities of near-field targets in an antenna-pairwise manner. Moreover, by leveraging the spatial diversity of UM-MIMO, we introduce the concept of virtual bistatic sensing (VIBS), which incorporates the estimates from multiple antenna pairs to achieve high-accuracy target positioning and three-dimensional velocity measurement. The VIBS paradigm is immune to hostile channel environments characterized by spatial non-stationarity and uncorrelated multipath environment. Furthermore, the channel estimation of UM-MIMO OCDM systems enhanced by the sensing results is investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ISAC scheme enhances sensing accuracy, and also benefits communication performance.</description>

      <title>On Signal Peak Power Constraint of Over-the-Air Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been considered a promising privacy preserving distributed edge learning framework. Over-the-air computation (AirComp) technique leveraging analog transmission enables the aggregation of local updates directly over-the-air by exploiting the superposition properties of wireless multiple-access channel, thereby drastically reducing the communication bottleneck issues of FL compared with digital transmission schemes. This work points out that existing AirComp-FL overlooks a key practical constraint, the instantaneous peak-power constraints imposed by the non-linearity of radiofrequency power amplifiers. We present and analyze the effect of the classic method to deal with this issue, amplitude clipping combined with filtering. We investigate the effect of instantaneous peak-power constraints in AirComp-FL for both single-carrier and multi-carrier orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. We highlight the specificity of AirComp-FL: the samples depend on the gradient value distribution, leading to a higher peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) than that observed for uniformly distributed signals. Simulation results demonstrate that, in practical settings, the instantaneous transmit power regularly exceeds the power-amplifier limit; however, by applying clipping and filtering, the FL performance can be degraded. The degradation becomes pronounced especially in multi-carrier OFDM systems due to the in-band distortions caused by clipping and filtering.</description>

      <title>Experimental Multiport-Network Parameter Estimation for a Dynamic Metasurface Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most use cases of reconfigurable antennas require an accurate forward model mapping configuration to radiated field (and reflections at feeds). Emerging dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) confront the conventional approach of extracting such a model from a numerical simulation with multiple challenges. First, the cost of accurately simulating an intricate and electrically large DMA architecture might be prohibitive. Second, the model-reality mismatch due to fabrication inaccuracies might be substantial, especially at higher frequencies and for DMA architectures leveraging strong inter-element mutual coupling (MC) to maximize their tunability. These considerations motivate an experimental parameter estimation for DMA forward models. The main challenge lies in the forward model's non-linearity due to inter-element MC. Multiport network theory (MNT) can accurately capture MC but the MC parameters cannot be measured directly. In this article, we demonstrate the experimental estimation of a high-accuracy proxy MNT model for a 19-GHz DMA with 7 feeds and 96 elements, where all feeds and elements are strongly coupled via a chaotic cavity. For a given DMA configuration and excitation, our proxy MNT model predicts the reflected field at the feeds and the radiated field with accuracies of 40.3 dB and 37.7 dB, respectively. A simpler, MC-unaware benchmark model only achieves 2.6 dB and 3.3 dB, respectively. We systematically examine the influence of the number of feeds and measured DMA configurations on the model accuracy, motivating the inclusion of "auxiliary calibration feeds" to facilitate the parameter estimation when the intended DMA operation is limited to a single feed. Finally, we measure DMA configurations optimized based on our proxy MNT model.</description>

      <title>Communication Compression for Distributed Learning with Aggregate and Server-Guided Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed learning, particularly Federated Learning (FL), faces a significant bottleneck in the communication cost, particularly the uplink transmission of client-to-server updates, which is often constrained by asymmetric bandwidth limits at the edge. Biased compression techniques are effective in practice, but require error feedback mechanisms to provide theoretical guarantees and to ensure convergence when compression is aggressive. Standard error feedback, however, relies on client-specific control variates, which violates user privacy and is incompatible with stateless clients common in large-scale FL. This paper proposes two novel frameworks that enable biased compression without client-side state or control variates. The first, Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), uses the globally aggregated update from the previous round as a shared control variate for all clients. The second, Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe-S), extends this idea to scenarios where the server possesses a small private dataset; it generates a server-guided candidate update to be used as a more accurate predictor. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. We further prove that CAFe-S converges to a stationary point, with a rate that improves as the server's data become more representative. Experimental results in FL scenarios validate the superiority of our approaches over existing compression schemes.</description>

      <title>SNM-Net: A Universal Framework for Robust Open-Set Gas Recognition via Spherical Normalization and Mahalanobis Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic nose (E-nose) systems face dual challenges in open-set gas recognition: feature distribution shifts caused by signal drift and decision failures induced by unknown interference. Existing methods predominantly rely on Euclidean distance, failing to adequately account for anisotropic gas feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations. To address these issues, this study proposes SNM-Net, a universal deep learning framework for open-set gas recognition. The core innovation lies in a geometric decoupling mechanism achieved through cascaded batch normalization and L2 normalization, which projects high-dimensional features onto a unit hypersphere to eliminate signal intensity fluctuations. Additionally, Mahalanobis distance is introduced as the scoring mechanism, utilizing class-wise statistics to construct adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries. SNM-Net is architecture-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with CNN, RNN, and Transformer backbones. Systematic experiments on the Vergara dataset demonstrate that the Transformer+SNM configuration attains near-theoretical performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.9977 and an unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% (TPR at 5% FPR). This performance significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing a 3.0% improvement in AUROC and a 91.0% reduction in standard deviation compared to Class Anchor Clustering. The framework exhibits exceptional robustness across sensor positions with standard deviations below 0.0028. This work effectively resolves the trade-off between accuracy and stability, providing a solid technical foundation for industrial E-nose deployment.</description>

Abstract: Accurate downhole positioning is critical in oil and gas operations but is often compromised by signal degradation in traditional surface-based Casing Collar Locator (CCL) monitoring. To address this, we present an in-situ, real-time collar recognition system using embedded neural network. We introduce lightweight "Collar Recognition Nets" (CRNs) optimized for resource-constrained ARM Cortex-M7 microprocessors. By leveraging temporal and depthwise separable convolutions, our most compact model reduces computational complexity to just 8,208 MACs while maintaining an F1 score of 0.972. Hardware validation confirms an average inference latency of 343.2 {\mu}s, demonstrating that robust, autonomous signal processing is feasible within the severe power and space limitations of downhole instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Covering in Hamming and Grassmann Spaces: New Bounds and Reed--Solomon-Based Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study covering problems in Hamming and Grassmann spaces through a unified coding-theoretic and information-theoretic framework. Viewing covering as a form of quantization in general metric spaces, we introduce the notion of the average covering radius as a natural measure of average distortion, complementing the classical worst-case covering radius. By leveraging tools from one-shot rate-distortion theory, we derive explicit non-asymptotic random-coding bounds on the average covering radius in both spaces, which serve as fundamental performance benchmarks.
  On the construction side, we develop efficient puncturing-based covering algorithms for generalized Reed--Solomon (GRS) codes in the Hamming space and extend them to a new family of subspace codes, termed character-Reed--Solomon (CRS) codes, for Grassmannian quantization under the chordal distance. Our results reveal that, despite poor worst-case covering guarantees, these structured codes exhibit strong average covering performance. In particular, numerical results in the Hamming space demonstrate that RS-based constructions often outperform random codebooks in terms of average covering radius. In the one-dimensional Grassmann space, we numerically show that CRS codes over prime fields asymptotically achieve average covering radii within a constant factor of the random-coding bound in the high-rate regime. Together, these results provide new insights into the role of algebraic structure in covering problems and high-dimensional quantization.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-based Multi-View Fusion of 4D Radar Tensor and Camera for Robust 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar has been widely adopted in autonomous driving and robot perception due to its low cost and all-weather robustness. However, its inherent sparsity and limited semantic richness significantly constrain perception capability. Recently, fusing camera data with 4D radar has emerged as a promising cost effective solution, by exploiting the complementary strengths of the two modalities. Nevertheless, point-cloud-based radar often suffer from information loss introduced by multi-stage signal processing, while directly utilizing raw 4D radar data incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose WRCFormer, a novel 3D object detection framework that fuses raw radar cubes with camera inputs via multi-view representations of the decoupled radar cube. Specifically, we design a Wavelet Attention Module as the basic module of wavelet-based Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to enhance the representation of sparse radar signals and image data. We further introduce a two-stage query-based, modality-agnostic fusion mechanism termed Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion to efficiently integrate multi-view features from both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WRCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the K-Radar benchmarks, surpassing the best model by approximately 2.4% in all scenarios and 1.6% in the sleet scenario, highlighting its robustness under adverse weather conditions.</description>

      <title>User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Enhanced by Fluid-Antenna Access Points: Uplink Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems in which access points (APs) are equipped with fluid antennas (FAs) and develop a comprehensive framework for channel estimation, antenna port selection, and uplink spectral efficiency (SE) optimization. We propose a generalized LMMSE-based uplink channel estimation scheme that dynamically activates FA ports during pilot transmission, efficiently exploiting antenna reconfigurability under practical training constraints. Building on this, we design a distributed port selection strategy that minimizes per-AP channel estimation error by exploiting spatial correlation among FA ports. We systematically analyze the impact of antenna geometry and spatial correlation using the Jakes' channel model for different AP array configurations, including uniform linear and planar arrays. We then derive SINR expressions for centralized and distributed uplink processing and obtain a closed-form uplink SE expression for centralized maximum-ratio combining using the use-and-then-forget bound. Finally, we propose an alternating-optimization framework to select FA port configurations that maximize the uplink sum SE. Numerical results show that the proposed FA-aware channel estimation and port optimization strategies greatly reduce channel estimation error and significantly improve sum-SE over fixed-antenna and non-optimized FA baselines, confirming FAs as a key enabler for scalable, adaptive CF-mMIMO networks.</description>

      <title>Affine-Projection Recovery of Continuous Angular Power Spectrum: Geometry and Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers recovering a continuous angular power spectrum (APS) from the channel covariance. Building on the projection-onto-linear-variety (PLV) algorithm, an affine-projection approach introduced by Miretti \emph{et. al.}, we analyze PLV in a well-defined \emph{weighted} Fourier-domain to emphasize its geometric interpretability. This yields an explicit fixed-dimensional trigonometric-polynomial representation and a closed-form solution via a positive-definite matrix, which directly implies uniqueness. We further establish an exact energy identity that yields the APS reconstruction error and leads to a sharp identifiability/resolution characterization: PLV achieves perfect recovery if and only if the ground-truth APS lies in the identified trigonometric-polynomial subspace; otherwise it returns the minimum-energy APS among all covariance-consistent spectra.</description>

      <title>Physical Limits of Proximal Tumor Detection via MAGE-A Extracellular Vesicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early cancer detection relies on invasive tissue biopsies or liquid biopsies limited by biomarker dilution. In contrast, tumour-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying biomarkers like melanoma-associated antigen-A (MAGE-A) are highly concentrated in the peri-tumoral interstitial space, offering a promising near-field target. However, at micrometre scales, EV transport is governed by stochastic diffusion in a low copy number regime, increasing the risk of false negatives. We theoretically assess the feasibility of a smart-needle sensor detecting MAGE-A-positive microvesicles near a tumour. We use a hybrid framework combining particle-based Brownian dynamics (Smoldyn) to quantify stochastic arrival and false negative probabilities, and a reaction-diffusion PDE for mean concentration profiles. Formulating detection as a threshold-based binary hypothesis test, we find a maximum feasible detection radius of approximately 275 micrometers for a 6000 s sensing window. These results outline the physical limits of proximal EV-based detection and inform the design of minimally invasive peri-tumoral sensors.</description>

      <title>An extended method for Statistical Signal Characterization using moments and cumulants, as a fast and accurate pre-processing stage of simple ANNs applied to the recognition of pattern alterations in pulse-like waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a feature-extraction procedure based on the statistical characterization of waveforms, applied as a fast pre-processing stage in a pattern recognition task using simple artificial neural network models. This procedure involves measuring a set of 30 parameters, including moments and cumulants obtained from the waveform, its derivative, and its integral. The technique is presented as an extension of the Statistical Signal Characterization method, which is already established in the literature, and we referred to it as ESSC. As a testing methodology, we employed a procedure to distinguish a pulse-like signal from different versions of itself with altered or deformed frequency spectra, under various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions of Gaussian white noise. The recognition task was performed by machine learning networks using the proposed ESSC feature extraction method. Additionally, we compared the results with those obtained using raw data inputs in deep learning networks. The algorithms were trained and tested on cases involving Sinc-, Gaussian-, and Chirp-pulse waveforms. We measure accuracy and execution time for the different algorithms solving these pattern-recognition cases, and evaluate the architectural complexity of building such networks. We conclude that a simple multi-layer perceptron network using ESSC can achieve an accuracy of around 90%, comparable to that of deep learning algorithms, when solving pattern recognition tasks in practical scenarios with SNR above 20dB. Additionally, this approach offers an execution time approximately 4 times shorter and significantly lower network construction complexity, enabling its use in low-resource computational systems.</description>

      <title>Signal Whisperers: Enhancing Wireless Reception Using DRL-Guided Reflector Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach for controlling adjustable metallic reflector arrays to enhance wireless signal reception in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Unlike conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) that require complex channel estimation, our system employs a centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm where individual agents corresponding to reflector segments autonomously optimize reflector element orientation in three-dimensional space using spatial intelligence based on user location information. Through extensive ray-tracing simulations with dynamic user mobility, the proposed multi-agent beam-focusing framework demonstrates substantial performance improvements over single-agent reinforcement learning baselines, while maintaining rapid adaptation to user movement within one simulation step. Comprehensive evaluation across varying user densities and reflector configurations validates system scalability and robustness. The results demonstrate the potential of learning-based approaches for adaptive wireless propagation control.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Tensor-Based Deferral of Gaussian Splitting for Orbit Uncertainty Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate propagation of orbital uncertainty is essential for a range of applications within space domain awareness. Adaptive Gaussian mixture-based approaches offer tractable nonlinear uncertainty propagation through splitting mixands to increase resolution in areas of stronger nonlinearities, as well as by reducing mixands to prevent unnecessary computational effort. Recent work introduced principled heuristics that incorporate information from the system dynamics and initial uncertainty to determine optimal directions for splitting. This paper develops adaptive uncertainty propagation methods based on these robust splitting techniques. A deferred splitting algorithm tightly integrated with higher-order splitting techniques is proposed and shown to offer substantial gains in computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Second-order propagation of mixand moments is also seen to improve accuracy while retaining significant computational savings from deferred splitting. Different immediate and deferred splitting methods are compared in four representative test cases, including a low Earth orbit, a geostationary orbit, a Molniya orbit, and a multi-body cislunar orbit.</description>

      <title>Structure from Noise: Confirmation Bias in Particle Picking in Structural Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational pipelines of single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) include an early particle-picking stage, in which a micrograph or tomogram is scanned to extract candidate particles, typically via template matching or deep-learning-based techniques. The extracted particles are then passed to downstream tasks such as classification and 3D reconstruction. Although it is well understood empirically that particle picking can be sensitive to the choice of templates or learned priors, a quantitative theory of the bias introduced by this stage has been lacking.
  Here, we develop a mathematical framework for analyzing bias in template matching-based detection with concrete applications to cryo-EM and cryo-ET. We study this bias through two downstream tasks: (i) maximum-likelihood estimation of class means in a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and (ii) 3D volume reconstruction from the extracted particle stack. We show that when template matching is applied to pure noise, then under broad noise models, the resulting maximum-likelihood estimates converge asymptotically to deterministic, noise-dependent transforms of the user-specified templates, yielding a structure from noise effect. We further characterize how the resulting bias depends on the noise statistics, sample size, dimension, and detection threshold. Finally, controlled experiments using standard cryo-EM software corroborate the theory, demonstrating reproducible structure from noise artifacts in low-SNR data.</description>

      <title>A Fingerprint Database Generation Method for RIS-Assisted Indoor Positioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance indoor wireless communication and sensing performance. However, the construction of reliable received signal strength (RSS)-based fingerprint databases for RIS-assisted indoor positioning remains an open challenge due to the lack of realistic and spatially consistent channel modeling methods. In this paper, we propose a novel method with open-source code for generating RIS-assisted RSS fingerprint databases. Our method captures the complex RIS-assisted multipath behaviors by extended cluster-based channel modeling and the physical and electromagnetic properties of RIS and transmitter (Tx). And the spatial consistency is incorporated when simulating the fingerprint data collection across neighboring positions. Moreover, an effective sorting algorithm is proposed to solve the online synchronization issue, a closed-form RIS phase configuration strategy is proposed to improve the localization accuracy, and the modeling method of mutual coupling (MC) effect is provided. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the fingerprint database generated by the proposed method. And the positioning performance on the database using different algorithms is analyzed, providing valuable insights for the system design.</description>

      <title>VQ-VAE Based Digital Semantic Communication with Importance-Aware OFDM Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) significantly reduces redundant data and improves transmission efficiency by extracting the latent features of information. However, most of the conventional deep learning-based SemCom systems focus on analog transmission and lack in compatibility with practical digital communications. This paper proposes a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) based digital SemCom system that directly transmits the semantic features and incorporates the importance-aware orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission to enhance the SemCom performance, where the VQ-VAE generates a discrete codebook shared between the transmitter and receiver. At transmitter, the latent semantic features are firstly extracted by VQ-VAE, and then the shared codebook is adopted to match these features, which are subsequently transformed into a discrete version to adapt the digital transmission. To protect the semantic information, an importance-aware OFDM transmission strategy is proposed to allocate the key features near the OFDM reference signals, where the feature importance is derived from the gradient-based method. At the receiver, the features are rematched with the shared codebook to further correct errors. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the conventional DeepSC and achieves better reconstruction performance under low SNR region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), an emerging technology proposed for inclusion in next generation wireless communication systems, are programmable surfaces that can adaptively reflect incident electromagnetic radiation in different desired directions. To reduce the complexity and physical profile of conventional RIS designs, a novel concept known as Wave-Controlled RIS has been proposed, in which standing waves along a transmission line are used to generate the required dc bias for reflective control. This paper shows the design of such a Wave-Controlled RIS and its biasing transmission line. The effectiveness of this approach in generating the correct dc bias from a single standing wave frequency is analyzed through both theoretical modeling and experimental validation, which uncovered a dependence on impedance matching not accounted for by the theory. Additionally, the potential for reflective control using only a single standing wave frequency on the biasing transmission line is explored, demonstrating the ability of single-beam steering toward angles near broadside.</description>

Abstract: Typical quantitative MRI (qMRI) methods estimate parameter maps in a two-step pipeline that first reconstructs images from undersampled k-space data and then performs model fitting, which is prone to biases and error propagation. We propose NLCG-Net, a model-based nonlinear conjugate gradient (NLCG) framework for joint T2/T1 estimation that incorporates a U-Net regularizer trained in a scan-specific, zero-shot fashion. The method directly estimates qMRI maps from undersampled k-space using mono-exponential signal modeling with scan-specific neural network regularization, enabling high-fidelity T1 and T2 mapping. Experimental results on T2 and T1 mapping demonstrate that NLCG-Net improves estimation quality over subspace reconstruction at high acceleration factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06521v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the beamforming design in the joint proactive eavesdropping (PE) and target sensing (TS) systems. The base station (BS) wiretaps the information transmitted by the illegal transmitter and sends the waveform for TS. The shared waveform also serves as artificial noise to interfere with the illegal receiver, thereby achieving successful PE.We firstly optimize the transmitting beampattern of the BS only to maximize the eavesdropping rate or only to minimize the Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao bound, respectively. Then, the joint design of PE and TS is investigated by formulating the PE-centric, the TS-centric, and the normalized weighted optimization problems. The formulated problems are solved by the semi-definite relaxation technique and the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation method to address the complexity of the original problem. Furthermore, the scenario in which the quality of the eavesdropping channel is stronger than that of the illegal channel is considered. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively realize PE and TS simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08066v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 52 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Empowered Near-Field Sensing via Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology exhibits great promise for enhancing the sensing capabilities of future sixth-generation (6G) networks due to its capability to alter antenna array geometry. With the growing prevalence of near-field propagation at ultra-high frequencies, this paper focuses on the application of one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) MA arrays for near-field sensing to jointly estimate the angle and distance information about a target. First, for the 1D MA array scenario, to gain insights into MA-enhanced near-field sensing, we investigate two simplified cases with only angle-of-arrival (AoA) or distance estimation, respectively, assuming that the other information is already known. The worst-case Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) on the mean square errors (MSEs) of the AoA estimation and the distance estimation are derived in these two cases. Then, we jointly optimize the positions of the MAs within the 1D array to minimize these CRBs and derive their closed-form solutions, which yield an identical array geometry to MA-enhanced far-field sensing. For the more challenging joint AoA and distance estimation, since the associated worst-case CRB is a highly complex and non-convex function with respect to the MA positions, a discrete sampling-based approach is proposed to sequentially update the MA positions and obtain an efficient suboptimal solution. Furthermore, we investigate the worst-case CRB minimization problems for a 2D MA array under various conditions and extend our proposed algorithms to solve them efficiently. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enhanced near-field sensing scheme dramatically outperforms conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs). Moreover, the joint angle and distance estimation results in a different array geometry from that in the individual estimation of angle/distance or far-field sensing.</description>

      <title>A Data-Centric Approach to Generalizable Speech Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving robust generalization in speech deepfake detection (SDD) remains a primary challenge, as models often fail to detect unseen forgery methods. While research has focused on model-centric and algorithm-centric solutions, the impact of data composition is often underexplored. This paper proposes a data-centric approach, analyzing the SDD data landscape from two practical perspectives: constructing a single dataset and aggregating multiple datasets. To address the first perspective, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to characterize the data scaling laws for SDD, quantifying the impact of source and generator diversity. To address the second, we propose the Diversity-Optimized Sampling Strategy (DOSS), a principled framework for mixing heterogeneous data with two implementations: DOSS-Select (pruning) and DOSS-Weight (re-weighting). Our experiments show that DOSS-Select outperforms the naive aggregation baseline while using only 3% of the total available data. Furthermore, our final model, trained on a 12k-hour curated data pool using the optimal DOSS-Weight strategy, achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming large-scale baselines with greater data and model efficiency on both public benchmarks and a new challenge set of various commercial APIs.</description>
