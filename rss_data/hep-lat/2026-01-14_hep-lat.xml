      <title>QCD phase-transition under the light of Thermofractal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deconfining transition in $SU(3)$ gauge theory, traditionally interpreted through the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) model as a sharp third-order phase transition in the large-$N_c$ limit, appears as a smooth crossover in lattice QCD. This work demonstrates that the transition is topologically smoothed into a crossover by incorporating the fractal momentum space structure inherent to thermofractals. By matching the non-extensive $\beta$-function to one-loop QCD results, a fundamental scaling of the thermofractal index $q$ is derived as a function of the number of flavours $N_f$. It is proven that applying a $q$-deformed derivative operator $\mathcal{D}_q$ to the $q$-logarithm of the eigenvalue distance results in a non-extensive measure that effectively smears the topological stiffness of the gauge vacuum. A unified master equation for the Polyakov loop $\langle L \rangle$ is presented, governed by the thermofractal index $q$ and a single variance parameter $\sigma^2(T)$ that scales as $T^{1/(q-1)}$. The observed phase dynamics are shown to be asymptotic limits of this unified density: a ``soft'' algebraic growth $\langle L \rangle \propto T^{11}$ in the 1D string-like confined regime for $N_f=0$, and a rapid $1 - \langle L \rangle \propto T^{-21}$ suppression in the 3D deconfined volume for $N_f=3$. This approach provides a microscopic foundation for partial deconfinement theory and reproduces lattice QCD data with a reduced $\chi^2 \approx 1.12$, offering a rigorous reconciliation between matrix model topology and the continuous QCD crossover.</description>

      <title>Merging multidimensional equations of state of strongly interacting matter via a statistical mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general method to merge multidimensional equations of state (EoSs) by combining them in a two-fluid equilibrium statistical mixture in the grand canonical ensemble. The merged grand potential density $\omega$ is built directly from the input EoSs and the fluid fractions are fixed by minimizing $\omega$ at fixed temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$. Thermodynamic consistency and stability are guaranteed as all thermodynamic quantities are consistently derived from a single merged grand potential $\omega(T,\mu_B)$ with the correct convexity properties. Our method can accommodate a first-order phase transition and a critical endpoint with mean-field critical exponents. We use this method to merge a van der Waals Hadron-Resonance-Gas EoS with a holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton EoS that has a critical point and a first-order line. The result is a single EoS, spanning hadronic and deconfined matter over a broad range in $(T,\mu_B)$, which can be readily used in heavy-ion hydrodynamic simulations. Our merging method can be generalized to consider a higher dimensional phase diagram (e.g., by considering more chemical potentials) and more than two input EoSs.</description>

      <title>Insights into Meson and Baryon Structure using Continuum Schwinger Function Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk of visible mass is supposed to emerge from nonperturbative dynamics within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Following years of development and refinement, continuum and lattice Schwinger function methods have recently joined in revealing the three pillars that support this emergent hadron mass (EHM); namely, a nonzero gluon mass-scale, a process-independent effective charge, and dressed-quarks with running masses that take constituent-like values at infrared momenta. One may argue that EHM and confinement are inextricably linked; and theory is now working to expose their manifold expressions in hadron observables and highlight the types of measurements that can be made in order to validate the paradigm. This contribution sketches these ideas via the unified explanation of pion and proton electromagnetic and gravitational form factors.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Complexity of String Breaking in the Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String breaking, the process by which flux tubes fragment into hadronic states, is a hallmark of confinement in strongly-interacting quantum field theories. We examine a suite of quantum complexity measures using Matrix Product States to dissect the string breaking process in the 1+1D Schwinger model. We demonstrate the presence of nonlocal quantum correlations along the string that may affect fragmentation dynamics, and show that entanglement and magic offer complementary perspectives on string formation and breaking beyond conventional observables.</description>

      <title>Rotationally invariant dynamical lattice regulators for Euclidean quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamical lattice regulator for Euclidean quantum field theories on a fixed hypercubic graph $\Lambda\simeq\mathbb{Z}^d$, in which the embedding $x:\Lambda\to\mathbb{R}^d$ is promoted to a dynamical field and integrated over subject to shape regularity constraints. The total action is local on $\Lambda$, gauge invariant, and depends on $x$ only through Euclidean invariants built from edge vectors (local metrics, volumes, etc.), hence the partition function is exactly covariant under the global special Euclidean group SE(d) at any lattice spacing. The intended symmetry restoring mechanism is not rigid global zero modes but short-range *local twisting* of the embedding that mixes local orientations. Our universality discussion is conditioned on a short-range geometry hypothesis (SR): after quotienting the global SE(d) modes, connected correlators of local geometric observables have correlation length O(1) in lattice units.
  We prove Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity for the coupled system with embedding $x$ and generic gauge and matter fields $(U,\Phi)$ in finite volume by treating $x$ as an additional multiplet of scalar fields on $\Lambda$. Assuming (SR), integrating out $x$ at fixed cutoff yields a local Symanzik effective action in which geometry fluctuations generate only SO(d)-invariant irrelevant operators and finite renormalizations. For example, in d=4 we recover the standard one-loop $\beta$-function in a scalar $\phi^4$ test theory. Finally, we describe a practical local Monte Carlo update and report d=2 proof-of-concept simulations showing a well behaved geometry sector and a substantial reduction of axis-vs-diagonal cutoff artefacts relative to a fixed lattice at matched bare parameters.</description>

      <title>Three-particle scattering amplitudes from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I review recent progress in calculating scattering amplitudes and resonance properties involving three particles using results from lattice QCD. The necessary input is the finite-volume spectrum, and the outputs -- via solutions of integral equations -- are scattering amplitudes that can be continued into the complex plane to search for resonance poles. I describe the outlook for future extensions and applications of this work.</description>

      <title>Heavy hadron spectrum from 2+1+1 flavor MILC lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mass spectra and various mass differences of heavy hadrons containing one or more bottom quarks using MILC's $N_f = 2+1+1$ HISQ gauge ensembles at three lattice spacings. For the valence quarks, we employ a combination of lattice actions: the NRQCD action is used for bottom quarks, the anisotropic Clover action for charm quarks, and the $O(a)$-improved Wilson--Clover action for strange and lighter (up/down) quarks. Heavy hadron operators with at least one bottom quark are constructed by considering all possible combinations with charm, strange, and light quarks corresponding to various quantum numbers.</description>
