      <title>Coreset selection for the Sinkhorn divergence and generic smooth divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CO2, an efficient algorithm to produce convexly-weighted coresets with respect to generic smooth divergences. By employing a functional Taylor expansion, we show a local equivalence between sufficiently regular losses and their second order approximations, reducing the coreset selection problem to maximum mean discrepancy minimization. We apply CO2 to the Sinkhorn divergence, providing a novel sampling procedure that requires logarithmically many data points to match the approximation guarantees of random sampling. To show this, we additionally verify several new regularity properties for entropically regularized optimal transport of independent interest. Our approach leads to a new perspective linking coreset selection and kernel quadrature to classical statistical methods such as moment and score matching. We showcase this method with a practical application of subsampling image data, and highlight key directions to explore for improved algorithmic efficiency and theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Sobolev norm inconsistency of kernel interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the consistency of minimum-norm interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces corresponding to bounded kernels. Our main result give lower bounds for the generalization error of the kernel interpolation measured in a continuous scale of norms that interpolate between $L^2$ and the hypothesis space. These lower bounds imply that kernel interpolation is always inconsistent, when the smoothness index of the norm is larger than a constant that depends only on the embedding index of the hypothesis space and the decay rate of the eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Learning and Generalization with Mixture Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many, if not most, machine learning applications the training data is naturally heterogeneous (e.g. federated learning, adversarial attacks and domain adaptation in neural net training). Data heterogeneity is identified as one of the major challenges in modern day large-scale learning. A classical way to represent heterogeneous data is via a mixture model. In this paper, we study generalization performance and statistical rates when data is sampled from a mixture distribution. We first characterize the heterogeneity of the mixture in terms of the pairwise total variation distance of the sub-population distributions. Thereafter, as a central theme of this paper, we characterize the range where the mixture may be treated as a single (homogeneous) distribution for learning. In particular, we study the generalization performance under the classical PAC framework and the statistical error rates for parametric (linear regression, mixture of hyperplanes) as well as non-parametric (Lipschitz, convex and H\"older-smooth) regression problems. In order to do this, we obtain Rademacher complexity and (local) Gaussian complexity bounds with mixture data, and apply them to get the generalization and convergence rates respectively. We observe that as the (regression) function classes get more complex, the requirement on the pairwise total variation distance gets stringent, which matches our intuition. We also do a finer analysis for the case of mixed linear regression and provide a tight bound on the generalization error in terms of heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Preference-centric Bandits: Optimality of Mixtures and Regret-efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of canonical multi-armed bandits is to identify and repeatedly select an arm with the largest reward, often in the form of the expected value of the arm's probability distribution. Such a utilitarian perspective and focus on the probability models' first moments, however, is agnostic to the distributions' tail behavior and their implications for variability and risks in decision-making. This paper introduces a principled framework for shifting from expectation-based evaluation to an alternative reward formulation, termed a preference metric (PM). The PMs can place the desired emphasis on different reward realization and can encode a richer modeling of preferences that incorporate risk aversion, robustness, or other desired attitudes toward uncertainty. A fundamentally distinct observation in such a PM-centric perspective is that designing bandit algorithms will have a significantly different principle: as opposed to the reward-based models in which the optimal sampling policy converges to repeatedly sampling from the single best arm, in the PM-centric framework the optimal policy converges to selecting a mix of arms based on specific mixing weights. Designing such mixture policies departs from the principles for designing bandit algorithms in significant ways, primarily because of uncountable mixture possibilities. The paper formalizes the PM-centric framework and presents two algorithm classes (horizon-dependent and anytime) that learn and track mixtures in a regret-efficient fashion. These algorithms have two distinctions from their canonical counterparts: (i) they involve an estimation routine to form reliable estimates of optimal mixtures, and (ii) they are equipped with tracking mechanisms to navigate arm selection fractions to track the optimal mixtures. These algorithms' regret guarantees are investigated under various algebraic forms of the PMs.</description>

      <title>Decoding Latent Spaces: Assessing the Interpretability of Time Series Foundation Models for Visual Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study explores the interpretability of latent spaces produced by time series foundation models, focusing on their potential for visual analysis tasks. Specifically, we evaluate the MOMENT family of models, a set of transformer-based, pre-trained architectures for multivariate time series tasks such as: imputation, prediction, classification, and anomaly detection. We evaluate the capacity of these models on five datasets to capture the underlying structures in time series data within their latent space projection and validate whether fine tuning improves the clarity of the resulting embedding spaces. Notable performance improvements in terms of loss reduction were observed after fine tuning. Visual analysis shows limited improvement in the interpretability of the embeddings, requiring further work. Results suggest that, although Time Series Foundation Models such as MOMENT are robust, their latent spaces may require additional methodological refinements to be adequately interpreted, such as alternative projection techniques, loss functions, or data preprocessing strategies. Despite the limitations of MOMENT, foundation models supose a big reduction in execution time and so a great advance for interactive visual analytics.</description>

      <title>Causal Identification in Time Series Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the applicability of the Causal Identification algorithm to causal time series graphs with latent confounders. Since these graphs extend over infinitely many time steps, deciding whether causal effects across arbitrary time intervals are identifiable appears to require computation on graph segments of unbounded size. Even for deciding the identifiability of intervention effects on variables that are close in time, no bound is known on how many time steps in the past need to be considered. We give a first bound of this kind that only depends on the number of variables per time step and the maximum time lag of any direct or latent causal effect. More generally, we show that applying the Causal Identification algorithm to a constant-size segment of the time series graph is sufficient to decide identifiability of causal effects, even across unbounded time intervals.</description>

      <title>Financial Data Analysis with Robust Federated Logistic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the analysis of financial data in a federated setting, wherein data is distributed across multiple clients or locations, and the raw data never leaves the local devices. Our primary focus is not only on the development of efficient learning frameworks (for protecting user data privacy) in the field of federated learning but also on the importance of designing models that are easier to interpret. In addition, we care about the robustness of the framework to outliers. To achieve these goals, we propose a robust federated logistic regression-based framework that strives to strike a balance between these goals. To verify the feasibility of our proposed framework, we carefully evaluate its performance not only on independently identically distributed (IID) data but also on non-IID data, especially in scenarios involving outliers. Extensive numerical results collected from multiple public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve comparable performance to those of classical centralized algorithms, such as Logistical Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Sparse mixed linear modeling with anchor-based guidance for high-entropy alloy discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys have attracted attention for their exceptional mechanical properties and thermal stability. However, the combinatorial explosion in the number of possible elemental compositions renders traditional trial-and-error experimental approaches highly inefficient for materials discovery. To solve this problem, machine learning techniques have been increasingly employed for property prediction and high-throughput screening. Nevertheless, highly accurate nonlinear models often suffer from a lack of interpretability, which is a major limitation. In this study, we focus on local data structures that emerge from the greedy search behavior inherent to experimental data acquisition. By introducing a linear and low-dimensional mixture regression model, we strike a balance between predictive performance and model interpretability. In addition, we develop an algorithm that simultaneously performs prediction and feature selection by considering multiple candidate descriptors. Through a case study on high-entropy alloys, this study introduces a method that combines anchor-guided clustering and sparse linear modeling to address biased data structures arising from greedy exploration in materials science.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Gaussians in the Hellinger-Kantorovich-Boltzmann gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study leverages the basic insight that the gradient-flow equation associated with the relative Boltzmann entropy, in relation to a Gaussian reference measure within the Hellinger-Kantorovich (HK) geometry, preserves the class of Gaussian measures. This invariance serves as the foundation for constructing a reduced gradient structure on the parameter space characterizing Gaussian densities. We derive explicit ordinary differential equations that govern the evolution of mean, covariance, and mass under the HK-Boltzmann gradient flow. The reduced structure retains the additive form of the HK metric, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics involved.
  We explore the geodesic convexity of the reduced system, revealing that global convexity is confined to the pure transport scenario, while a variant of sublevel semi-convexity is observed in the general case. Furthermore, we demonstrate exponential convergence to equilibrium through Polyak-Lojasiewicz-type inequalities, applicable both globally and on sublevel sets. By monitoring the evolution of covariance eigenvalues, we refine the decay rates associated with convergence. Additionally, we extend our analysis to non-Gaussian targets exhibiting strong log-lambda-concavity, corroborating our theoretical results with numerical experiments that encompass a Gaussian-target gradient flow and a Bayesian logistic regression application.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Replication Strategies in Trust-Region-Based Bayesian Optimization of Stochastic Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a method for stochastic simulation optimization relying on Gaussian process models within a trust-region framework. We are interested in the case when the variance of the objective function is large. We propose to rely on replication and local modeling to cope with this high-throughput regime, where the number of evaluations may become large to get accurate results while still keeping good performance. We propose several schemes to encourage replication, from the choice of the acquisition function to setup evaluation costs. Compared with existing methods, our results indicate good scaling, in terms of both accuracy (several orders of magnitude better than existing methods) and speed (taking into account evaluation costs).</description>

      <title>What's Wrong with Your Synthetic Tabular Data? Using Explainable AI to Evaluate Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating synthetic tabular data is challenging, since they can differ from the real data in so many ways. There exist numerous metrics of synthetic data quality, ranging from statistical distances to predictive performance, often providing conflicting results. Moreover, they fail to explain or pinpoint the specific weaknesses in the synthetic data. To address this, we apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques to a binary detection classifier trained to distinguish real from synthetic data. While the classifier identifies distributional differences, XAI concepts such as feature importance and feature effects, analyzed through methods like permutation feature importance, partial dependence plots, Shapley values and counterfactual explanations, reveal why synthetic data are distinguishable, highlighting inconsistencies, unrealistic dependencies, or missing patterns. This interpretability increases transparency in synthetic data evaluation and provides deeper insights beyond conventional metrics, helping diagnose and improve synthetic data quality. We apply our approach to two tabular datasets and generative models, showing that it uncovers issues overlooked by standard evaluation techniques.</description>

      <title>Does Feedback Help in Bandits with Arm Erasures?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a distributed multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem over arm erasure channels, motivated by the increasing adoption of MAB algorithms over communication-constrained networks. In this setup, the learner communicates the chosen arm to play to an agent over an erasure channel with probability $\epsilon \in [0,1)$; if an erasure occurs, the agent continues pulling the last successfully received arm; the learner always observes the reward of the arm pulled. In past work, we considered the case where the agent cannot convey feedback to the learner, and thus the learner does not know whether the arm played is the requested or the last successfully received one. In this paper, we instead consider the case where the agent can send feedback to the learner on whether the arm request was received, and thus the learner exactly knows which arm was played. Surprisingly, we prove that erasure feedback does not improve the worst-case regret upper bound order over the previously studied no-feedback setting. In particular, we prove a regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT} + K / (1 - \epsilon))$, where $K$ is the number of arms and $T$ the time horizon, that matches no-feedback upper bounds up to logarithmic factors. We note however that the availability of feedback enables simpler algorithm designs that may achieve better constants (albeit not better order) regret bounds; we design one such algorithm and evaluate its performance numerically.</description>

      <title>Equivariant non-linear maps for neural networks on homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for non-linear equivariant neural network layers on homogeneous spaces. The seminal work of Cohen et al. on equivariant $G$-CNNs on homogeneous spaces characterized the representation theory of such layers in the linear setting, finding that they are given by convolutions with kernels satisfying so-called steerability constraints. Motivated by the empirical success of non-linear layers, such as self-attention or input dependent kernels, we set out to generalize these insights to the non-linear setting. We derive generalized steerability constraints that any such layer needs to satisfy and prove the universality of our construction. The insights gained into the symmetry-constrained functional dependence of equivariant operators on feature maps and group elements informs the design of future equivariant neural network layers. We demonstrate how several common equivariant network architectures - $G$-CNNs, implicit steerable kernel networks, conventional and relative position embedded attention based transformers, and LieTransformers - may be derived from our framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The plug-in estimator of the squared Euclidean 2-Wasserstein distance is conservative, however due to its large positive bias it is often uninformative. We eliminate most of this bias using a simple centering procedure based on linear combinations. We construct a pair of centered plug-in estimators that decrease with the true Wasserstein distance, and are therefore guaranteed to be informative, for any finite sample size. Crucially, we demonstrate that these estimators can often be viewed as complementary upper and lower bounds on the squared Wasserstein distance. Finally, we apply the estimators to Bayesian computation, developing methods for estimating (i) the bias of approximate inference methods and (ii) the convergence of MCMC algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Adaptive $\tau$-Lasso: Robustness and Oracle Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09310v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new regularized version of the robust $\tau$-regression estimator for analyzing high-dimensional datasets subject to gross contamination in the response variables and covariates. The resulting estimator, termed adaptive $\tau$-Lasso, is robust to outliers and high-leverage points. It also incorporates an adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term, which enables the selection of relevant variables and reduces the bias associated with large true regression coefficients. More specifically, this adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term assigns a weight to each regression coefficient. For a fixed number of predictors $p$, we show that the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso has the oracle property, ensuring both variable-selection consistency and asymptotic normality. Asymptotic normality applies only to the entries of the regression vector corresponding to the true support, assuming knowledge of the true regression vector support. We characterize its robustness by establishing the finite-sample breakdown point and the influence function. We carry out extensive simulations and observe that the class of $\tau$-Lasso estimators exhibits robustness and reliable performance in both contaminated and uncontaminated data settings. We also validate our theoretical findings on robustness properties through simulations. In the face of outliers and high-leverage points, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators achieve the best performance or match the best performances of competing regularized estimators, with minimal or no loss in terms of prediction and variable selection accuracy for almost all scenarios considered in this study. Therefore, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators provide attractive tools for a variety of sparse linear regression problems, particularly in high-dimensional settings and when the data is contaminated by outliers and high-leverage points.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Kernel Goodness-of-Fit Tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Goodness-of-fit testing is often criticized for its lack of practical relevance: since ``all models are wrong'', the null hypothesis that the data conform to our model is ultimately always rejected as sample size grows. Despite this, probabilistic models are still used extensively, raising the more pertinent question of whether the model is \emph{good enough} for the task at hand. This question can be formalized as a robust goodness-of-fit testing problem by asking whether the data were generated from a distribution that is a mild perturbation of the model. In this paper, we show that existing kernel goodness-of-fit tests are not robust under common notions of robustness including both qualitative and quantitative robustness. We further show that robustification techniques using tilted kernels, while effective in the parameter estimation literature, are not sufficient to ensure both types of robustness in the testing setting. To address this, we propose the first robust kernel goodness-of-fit test, which resolves this open problem by using kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD) balls. This framework encompasses many well-known perturbation models, such as Huber's contamination and density-band models.</description>

      <title>Higher order definition of causality by optimally conditioned transfer entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The description of the dynamics of complex systems, in particular the capture of the interaction structure and causal relationships between elements of the system, is one of the central questions of interdisciplinary research. While the characterization of pairwise causal interactions is a relatively ripe field with established theoretical concepts and the current focus is on technical issues of their efficient estimation, it turns out that the standard concepts such as Granger causality or transfer entropy may not faithfully reflect possible synergies or interactions of higher orders, phenomena highly relevant for many real-world complex systems. In this paper, we propose a generalization and refinement of the information-theoretic approach to causal inference, enabling the description of truly multivariate, rather than multiple pairwise, causal interactions, and moving thus from causal networks to causal hypernetworks. In particular, while keeping the ability to control for mediating variables or common causes, in case of purely synergetic interactions such as the exclusive disjunction, it ascribes the causal role to the multivariate causal set but \emph{not} to individual inputs, distinguishing it thus from the case of e.g. two additive univariate causes. We demonstrate this concept by application to illustrative theoretical examples as well as a biophysically realistic simulation of biological neuronal dynamics recently reported to employ synergetic computations.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Safe Online Reinforcement Learning in the Linear Quadratic Regulator: Generalized Baselines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many practical applications of online reinforcement learning require the satisfaction of safety constraints while learning about the unknown environment. In this work, we establish theoretical foundations for reinforcement learning with safety constraints by studying the canonical problem of Linear Quadratic Regulator learning with unknown dynamics, but with the additional constraint that the position must stay within a safe region for the entire trajectory with high probability. Our primary contribution is a general framework for studying stronger baselines of nonlinear controllers that are better suited for constrained problems than linear controllers. Due to the difficulty of analyzing non-linear controllers in a constrained problem, we focus on 1-dimensional state- and action- spaces, however we also discuss how we expect the high-level takeaways can generalize to higher dimensions. Using our framework, we show that for \emph{any} non-linear baseline satisfying natural assumptions, $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$-regret is possible when the noise distribution has sufficiently large support, and $\tilde{O}_T(T^{2/3})$-regret is possible for \emph{any} subgaussian noise distribution. In proving these results, we introduce a new uncertainty estimation bound for nonlinear controls which shows that enforcing safety in the presence of sufficient noise can provide ``free exploration'' that compensates for the added cost of uncertainty in safety-constrained control.</description>

      <title>HAVER: Instance-Dependent Error Bounds for Maximum Mean Estimation and Applications to Q-Learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the \emph{value} of the largest mean among K distributions via samples from them (rather than estimating \emph{which} distribution has the largest mean), which arises from various machine learning tasks including Q-learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). While there have been a few proposed algorithms, their performance analyses have been limited to their biases rather than a precise error metric. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called HAVER (Head AVERaging) and analyze its mean squared error. Our analysis reveals that HAVER has a compelling performance in two respects. First, HAVER estimates the maximum mean as well as the oracle who knows the identity of the best distribution and reports its sample mean. Second, perhaps surprisingly, HAVER exhibits even better rates than this oracle when there are many distributions near the best one. Both of these improvements are the first of their kind in the literature, and we also prove that the naive algorithm that reports the largest empirical mean does not achieve these bounds. Finally, we confirm our theoretical findings via numerical experiments where we implement HAVER in bandit, Q-learning, and MCTS algorithms. In these experiments, HAVER consistently outperforms the baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness across different applications.</description>

      <title>Online Conformal Probabilistic Numerics via Adaptive Edge-Cloud Offloading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider an edge computing setting in which a user submits queries for the solution of a linear system to an edge processor, which is subject to time-varying computing availability. The edge processor applies a probabilistic linear solver (PLS) so as to be able to respond to the user's query within the allotted time and computing budget. Feedback to the user is in the form of a set of plausible solutions. Due to model misspecification, the highest-probability-density (HPD) set obtained via a direct application of PLS does not come with coverage guarantees with respect to the true solution of the linear system. This work introduces a new method to calibrate the HPD sets produced by PLS with the aim of guaranteeing long-term coverage requirements. The proposed method, referred to as online conformal prediction-PLS (OCP-PLS), assumes sporadic feedback from cloud to edge. This enables the online calibration of uncertainty thresholds via online conformal prediction (OCP), an online optimization method previously studied in the context of prediction models. The validity of OCP-PLS is verified via experiments that bring insights into trade-offs between coverage, prediction set size, and cloud usage.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Pre-Activations in Neural Networks: Myth or Reality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.12379v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of feature propagation at initialization in neural networks lies at the root of numerous initialization designs. An assumption very commonly made in the field states that the pre-activations are Gaussian. Although this convenient Gaussian hypothesis can be justified when the number of neurons per layer tends to infinity, it is challenged by both theoretical and experimental works for finite-width neural networks. Our major contribution is to construct a family of pairs of activation functions and initialization distributions that ensure that the pre-activations remain Gaussian throughout the network's depth, even in narrow neural networks. In the process, we discover a set of constraints that a neural network should fulfill to ensure Gaussian pre-activations. Additionally, we provide a critical review of the claims of the Edge of Chaos line of works and build an exact Edge of Chaos analysis. We also propose a unified view on pre-activations propagation, encompassing the framework of several well-known initialization procedures. Finally, our work provides a principled framework for answering the much-debated question: is it desirable to initialize the training of a neural network whose pre-activations are ensured to be Gaussian?

      <title>Stochastic Variance-Reduced Newton: Accelerating Finite-Sum Minimization with Large Batches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic variance reduction has proven effective at accelerating first-order algorithms for solving convex finite-sum optimization tasks such as empirical risk minimization. Incorporating second-order information has proven helpful in further improving the performance of these first-order methods. Yet, comparatively little is known about the benefits of using variance reduction to accelerate popular stochastic second-order methods such as Subsampled Newton. To address this, we propose Stochastic Variance-Reduced Newton (SVRN), a finite-sum minimization algorithm that provably accelerates existing stochastic Newton methods from $O(\alpha\log(1/\epsilon))$ to $O\big(\frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\log(n)}\big)$ passes over the data, i.e., by a factor of $O(\alpha\log(n))$, where $n$ is the number of sum components and $\alpha$ is the approximation factor in the Hessian estimate. Surprisingly, this acceleration gets more significant the larger the data size $n$, which is a unique property of SVRN. Our algorithm retains the key advantages of Newton-type methods, such as easily parallelizable large-batch operations and a simple unit step size. We use SVRN to accelerate Subsampled Newton and Iterative Hessian Sketch algorithms, and show that it compares favorably to popular first-order methods with variance~reduction.</description>

      <title>Recursive random binning to detect and display pairwise dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random binnings generated via recursive binary splits are introduced as a way to detect, measure the strength of, and to display the pattern of association between any two variates, whether one or both are continuous or categorical. This provides a single approach to ordering large numbers of variate pairs by their measure of dependence and then to examine any pattern of dependence via a common display, the departure display (colouring bins by a standardized Pearson residual). Continuous variates are first ranked and their rank pairs binned. The Pearson's goodness of fit statistic is applicable but the classic $\chi^2$ approximation to its null distribution is not. Theoretical and empirical investigations motivate several approximations, including a simple $\chi^2$ approximation with real-valued, yet intuitive, degrees of freedom. Alternatively, applying an inverse probability transform from the ranks before binning returns a simple Pearson statistic with the classic degrees of freedom. Recursive random binning with different approximations is compared to recent grid-based methods on a variety of non-null dependence patterns; the method with any of these approximations is found to be well-calibrated and relatively powerful against common test alternatives. Method and displays are illustrated by applying the screening methodology to a publicly available data set having several continuous and categorical measurements of each of 6,497 Portuguese wines. The software is publicly available as the R package AssocBin.</description>

      <title>Policy Learning with Distributional Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore optimal treatment allocation policies that target distributional welfare. Most literature on treatment choice has considered utilitarian welfare based on the conditional average treatment effect (ATE). While average welfare is intuitive, it may yield undesirable allocations especially when individuals are heterogeneous (e.g., with outliers) - the very reason individualized treatments were introduced in the first place. This observation motivates us to propose an optimal policy that allocates the treatment based on the conditional quantile of individual treatment effects (QoTE). Depending on the choice of the quantile probability, this criterion can accommodate a policymaker who is either prudent or negligent. The challenge of identifying the QoTE lies in its requirement for knowledge of the joint distribution of the counterfactual outcomes, which is not generally point-identified. We introduce minimax policies that are robust to this model uncertainty. A range of identifying assumptions can be used to yield more informative policies. For both stochastic and deterministic policies, we establish the asymptotic bound on the regret of implementing the proposed policies. The framework can be generalized to any setting where welfare is defined as a functional of the joint distribution of the potential outcomes.</description>

      <title>DiSK: Differentially Private Optimizer with Simplified Kalman Filter for Noise Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) offers a robust framework for safeguarding individual data privacy. To utilize DP in training modern machine learning models, differentially private optimizers have been widely used in recent years. A popular approach to privatize an optimizer is to clip the individual gradients and add sufficiently large noise to the clipped gradient. This approach led to the development of DP optimizers that have comparable performance with their non-private counterparts in fine-tuning tasks or in tasks with a small number of training parameters. However, a significant performance drop is observed when these optimizers are applied to large-scale training. This degradation stems from the substantial noise injection required to maintain DP, which disrupts the optimizer's dynamics. This paper introduces DiSK, a novel framework designed to significantly enhance the performance of DP optimizers. DiSK employs Kalman filtering, a technique drawn from control and signal processing, to effectively denoise privatized gradients and generate progressively refined gradient estimations. To ensure practicality for large-scale training, we simplify the Kalman filtering process, minimizing its memory and computational demands. We establish theoretical privacy-utility trade-off guarantees for DiSK, and demonstrate provable improvements over standard DP optimizers like DPSGD in terms of iteration complexity upper-bound. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including vision tasks such as CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k and language fine-tuning tasks such as GLUE, E2E, and DART, validate the effectiveness of DiSK. The results showcase its ability to significantly improve the performance of DP optimizers, surpassing state-of-the-art results under the same privacy constraints on several benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Regularized Robustly Reliable Learners and Instance Targeted Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instance-targeted data poisoning attacks, where an adversary corrupts a training set to induce errors on specific test points, have raised significant concerns. Balcan et al (2022) proposed an approach to addressing this challenge by defining a notion of robustly-reliable learners that provide per-instance guarantees of correctness under well-defined assumptions, even in the presence of data poisoning attacks. They then give a generic optimal (but computationally inefficient) robustly reliable learner as well as a computationally efficient algorithm for the case of linear separators over log-concave distributions.
  In this work, we address two challenges left open by Balcan et al (2022). The first is that the definition of robustly-reliable learners in Balcan et al (2022) becomes vacuous for highly-flexible hypothesis classes: if there are two classifiers h_0, h_1 \in H both with zero error on the training set such that h_0(x) \neq h_1(x), then a robustly-reliable learner must abstain on x. We address this problem by defining a modified notion of regularized robustly-reliable learners that allows for nontrivial statements in this case. The second is that the generic algorithm of Balcan et al (2022) requires re-running an ERM oracle (essentially, retraining the classifier) on each test point x, which is generally impractical even if ERM can be implemented efficiently. To tackle this problem, we show that at least in certain interesting cases we can design algorithms that can produce their outputs in time sublinear in training time, by using techniques from dynamic algorithm design.</description>

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) studies decision problems under uncertainty where the probability distribution governing the uncertain problem parameters is itself uncertain. A key component of any DRO model is its ambiguity set, that is, a family of probability distributions consistent with any available structural or statistical information. DRO seeks decisions that perform best under the worst distribution in the ambiguity set. This worst case criterion is supported by findings in psychology and neuroscience, which indicate that many decision-makers have a low tolerance for distributional ambiguity. DRO is rooted in statistics, operations research and control theory, and recent research has uncovered its deep connections to regularization techniques and adversarial training in machine learning. This survey presents the key findings of the field in a unified and self-contained manner.</description>

      <title>Optimal Oblivious Subspace Embeddings with Near-optimal Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An oblivious subspace embedding is a random $m\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ such that, for any $d$-dimensional subspace, with high probability $\Pi$ preserves the norms of all vectors in that subspace within a $1\pm\epsilon$ factor. In this work, we give an oblivious subspace embedding with the optimal dimension $m=\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ that has a near-optimal sparsity of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon)$ non-zero entries per column of $\Pi$. This is the first result to nearly match the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] in terms of the best sparsity attainable by an optimal oblivious subspace embedding, improving on a prior bound of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon^6)$ non-zeros per column [Chenakkod et al., STOC 2024]. We further extend our approach to the non-oblivious setting, proposing a new family of Leverage Score Sparsified embeddings with Independent Columns, which yield faster runtimes for matrix approximation and regression tasks.
  In our analysis, we develop a new method which uses a decoupling argument together with the cumulant method for bounding the edge universality error of isotropic random matrices. To achieve near-optimal sparsity, we combine this general-purpose approach with new traces inequalities that leverage the specific structure of our subspace embedding construction.</description>

      <title>Test-time regression: a unifying framework for designing sequence models with associative memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequence models lie at the heart of modern deep learning. However, rapid advancements have produced a diversity of seemingly unrelated architectures, such as Transformers and recurrent alternatives. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework to understand and derive these sequence models, inspired by the empirical importance of associative recall, the capability to retrieve contextually relevant tokens. We formalize associative recall as a two-step process, memorization and retrieval, casting memorization as a regression problem. Layers that combine these two steps perform associative recall via ``test-time regression'' over its input tokens. Prominent layers, including linear attention, state-space models, fast-weight programmers, online learners, and softmax attention, arise as special cases defined by three design choices: the regression weights, the regressor function class, and the test-time optimization algorithm. Our approach clarifies how linear attention fails to capture inter-token correlations and offers a mathematical justification for the empirical effectiveness of query-key normalization in softmax attention. Further, it illuminates unexplored regions within the design space, which we use to derive novel higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work bridges sequence modeling with classic regression methods, a field with extensive literature, paving the way for developing more powerful and theoretically principled architectures.</description>

      <title>PAC Learning is just Bipartite Matching (Sort of)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this article is to convince you, the reader, that supervised learning in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model is closely related to -- of all things -- bipartite matching! En-route from PAC learning to bipartite matching, I will overview a particular transductive model of learning, and associated one-inclusion graphs, which can be viewed as a generalization of some of the hat puzzles that are popular in recreational mathematics. Whereas this transductive model is far from new, it has recently seen a resurgence of interest as a tool for tackling deep questions in learning theory. A secondary purpose of this article could be as a (biased) tutorial on the connections between the PAC and transductive models of learning.</description>

      <title>Two-Point Deterministic Equivalence for Stochastic Gradient Dynamics in Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel deterministic equivalence for the two-point function of a random matrix resolvent. Using this result, we give a unified derivation of the performance of a wide variety of high-dimensional linear models trained with stochastic gradient descent. This includes high-dimensional linear regression, kernel regression, and random feature models. Our results include previously known asymptotics as well as novel ones.</description>

      <title>Deep learning with missing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of multivariate nonparametric regression with missing covariates, we propose Pattern Embedded Neural Networks (PENNs), which can be applied in conjunction with any existing imputation technique. In addition to a neural network trained on the imputed data, PENNs pass the vectors of observation indicators through a second neural network to provide a compact representation. The outputs are then combined in a third neural network to produce final predictions. Our main theoretical result exploits an assumption that the observation patterns can be partitioned into cells on which the Bayes regression function behaves similarly, and belongs to a compositional H\"older class. It provides a finite-sample excess risk bound that holds for an arbitrary missingness mechanism, and in combination with a complementary minimax lower bound, demonstrates that our PENN estimator attains in typical cases the minimax rate of convergence as if the cells of the partition were known in advance, up to a poly-logarithmic factor in the sample size. Numerical experiments on simulated, semi-synthetic and real data confirm that the PENN estimator consistently improves, often dramatically, on standard neural networks without pattern embedding. Code to reproduce our experiments, as well as a tutorial on how to apply our method, is publicly available.</description>
