      <title>Chasing the Shadows: TTPs in Action to Attribute Advanced Persistent Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current state of Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) attribution primarily relies on time-consuming manual processes. These include mapping incident artifacts onto threat attribution frameworks and employing expert reasoning to uncover the most likely responsible APT groups. This research aims to assist the threat analyst in the attribution process by presenting an attribution method named CAPTAIN (Comprehensive Advanced Persistent Threat AttrIbutioN). This novel APT attribution approach leverages the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) employed by various APT groups in past attacks. CAPTAIN follows two significant development steps: baseline establishment and similarity measure for attack pattern matching. This method starts by maintaining a TTP database of APTs seen in past attacks as baseline behaviour of threat groups. The attribution process leverages the contextual information added by TTP sequences, which reflects the sequence of behaviours threat actors demonstrated during the attack on different kill-chain stages. Then, it compares the provided TTPs with established baseline to identify the most closely matching threat group. CAPTAIN introduces a novel similarity measure for APT group attack-pattern matching that calculates the similarity between TTP sequences. The proposed approach outperforms traditional similarity measures like Cosine, Euclidean, and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) in performing attribution. Overall, CAPTAIN performs attribution with the precision of 61.36% (top-1) and 69.98% (top-2), surpassing the existing state-of-the-art attribution methods.</description>

      <title>Glitch in Time: Exploiting Temporal Misalignment of IMU For Eavesdropping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of voice assistants and related applications has raised significant concerns about the security of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) in smartphones. These devices are vulnerable to acoustic eavesdropping attacks, jeopardizing user privacy. In response, Google imposed a rate limit of 200 Hz on permission-free access to IMUs, aiming to neutralize such side-channel attacks. Our research introduces a novel exploit, STAG, which circumvents these protections. It induces a temporal misalignment between the gyroscope and accelerometer, cleverly combining their data to resample at higher rates and reviving the potential for eavesdropping attacks previously curtailed by Google's security enhancements. Compared to prior methods, STAG achieves an 83.4% reduction in word error rate, highlighting its effectiveness in exploiting IMU data under restricted access and emphasizing the persistent security risks associated with these sensors.</description>

      <title>APILOT: Navigating Large Language Models to Generate Secure Code by Sidestepping Outdated API Pitfalls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), their applications have expanded into diverse fields, such as code assistance. However, the substantial size of LLMs makes their training highly resource- and time-intensive, rendering frequent retraining or updates impractical. Consequently, time-sensitive data can become outdated, potentially misleading LLMs in time-aware tasks. For example, new vulnerabilities are discovered in various programs every day. Without updating their knowledge, LLMs may inadvertently generate code that includes these newly discovered vulnerabilities. Current strategies, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, do not effectively address this issue.
  To address this issue, we propose solution, named APILOT, which maintains a realtime, quickly updatable dataset of outdated APIs. Additionally, APILOT utilizes an augmented generation method that leverages this dataset to navigate LLMs in generating secure, version-aware code. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to measure the effectiveness of APILOT in reducing the incidence of outdated API recommendations across seven different state-of-the-art LLMs. The evaluation results indicate that APILOT can reduce outdated code recommendations by 89.42% on average with limited performance overhead. Interestingly, while enhancing security, APILOT also improves the usability of the code generated by LLMs, showing an average increase of 27.54% in usability. This underscores APILOT's dual capability to enhance both the safety and practical utility of code suggestions in contemporary software development environments.</description>

      <title>T2Pair++: Secure and Usable IoT Pairing with Zero Information Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure pairing is crucial for ensuring the trustworthy deployment and operation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, traditional pairing methods are often unsuitable for IoT devices due to their lack of conventional user interfaces, such as keyboards. Proximity-based pairing approaches are usable but vulnerable to exploitation by co-located malicious devices. While methods based on a user's physical operations (such as shaking) on IoT devices offer greater security, they typically rely on inertial sensors to sense the operations, which most IoT devices lack. We introduce a novel technique called Universal Operation Sensing, enabling IoT devices to sense the user's physical operations without the need for inertial sensors. With this technique, users can complete the pairing process within seconds using simple actions such as pressing a button or twisting a knob, whether they are holding a smartphone or wearing a smartwatch. Moreover, we reveal an inaccuracy issue in the fuzzy commitment protocol, which is frequently used for pairing. To address it, we propose an accurate pairing protocol, which does not use fuzzy commitment and incurs zero information loss. The comprehensive evaluation shows that it is secure, usable and efficient.</description>

      <title>Time Constant: Actuator Fingerprinting using Transient Response of Device and Process in ICS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Command injection and replay attacks are key threats in Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). We develop a novel actuator fingerprinting technique named Time Constant. Time Constant captures the transient dynamics of an actuator and physical process. The transient behavior is device-specific. We combine process and device transient characteristics to develop a copy-resistant actuator fingerprint that resists command injection and replay attacks in the face of insider adversaries. We validated the proposed scheme on data from a real water treatment testbed, as well as through real-time attack detection in the live plant. Our results show that we can uniquely distinguish between process states and actuators based on their Time Constant.</description>

      <title>Examining the Rat in the Tunnel: Interpretable Multi-Label Classification of Tor-based Malware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being the most popular privacy-enhancing network, Tor is increasingly adopted by cybercriminals to obfuscate malicious traffic, hindering the identification of malware-related communications between compromised devices and Command and Control (C&amp;C) servers. This malicious traffic can induce congestion and reduce Tor's performance, while encouraging network administrators to block Tor traffic. Recent research, however, demonstrates the potential for accurately classifying captured Tor traffic as malicious or benign. While existing efforts have addressed malware class identification, their performance remains limited, with micro-average precision and recall values around 70%. Accurately classifying specific malware classes is crucial for effective attack prevention and mitigation. Furthermore, understanding the unique patterns and attack vectors employed by different malware classes helps the development of robust and adaptable defence mechanisms.
  We utilise a multi-label classification technique based on Message-Passing Neural Networks, demonstrating its superiority over previous approaches such as Binary Relevance, Classifier Chains, and Label Powerset, by achieving micro-average precision (MAP) and recall (MAR) exceeding 90%. Compared to previous work, we significantly improve performance by 19.98%, 10.15%, and 59.21% in MAP, MAR, and Hamming Loss, respectively. Next, we employ Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to interpret the decision-making process within these models. Finally, we assess the robustness of all techniques by crafting adversarial perturbations capable of manipulating classifier predictions and generating false positives and negatives.</description>

      <title>CryptoTrain: Fast Secure Training on Encrypted Datase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure training, while protecting the confidentiality of both data and model weights, typically incurs significant training overhead. Traditional Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)-based non-inter-active training models are heavily burdened by computationally demanding bootstrapping. To develop an efficient secure training system, we established a foundational framework, CryptoTrain-B, utilizing a hybrid cryptographic protocol that merges FHE with Oblivious Transfer (OT) for handling linear and non-linear operations, respectively. This integration eliminates the need for costly bootstrapping. Although CryptoTrain-B sets a new baseline in performance, reducing its training overhead remains essential. We found that ciphertext-ciphertext multiplication (CCMul) is a critical bottleneck in operations involving encrypted inputs and models. Our solution, the CCMul-Precompute technique, involves precomputing CCMul offline and resorting to the less resource-intensive ciphertext-plaintext multiplication (CPMul) during private training. Furthermore, conventional polynomial convolution in FHE systems tends to encode irrelevant and redundant values into polynomial slots, necessitating additional polynomials and ciphertexts for input representation and leading to extra multiplications. Addressing this, we introduce correlated polynomial convolution, which encodes only related input values into polynomials, thus drastically reducing the number of computations and overheads. By integrating CCMul-Precompute and correlated polynomial convolution into CryptoTrain-B, we facilitate a rapid and efficient secure training framework, CryptoTrain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CryptoTrain achieves a ~5.3X training time reduction compared to prior methods.</description>

      <title>Cycle Counting under Local Differential Privacy for Degeneracy-bounded Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for counting the number of cycles under local differential privacy for degeneracy-bounded input graphs. Numerous studies have focused on counting the number of triangles under the privacy notion, demonstrating that the expected \(\ell_2\)-error of these algorithms is \(\Omega(n^{1.5})\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the graph. When parameterized by the number of cycles of length four (\(C_4\)), the best existing triangle counting algorithm has an error of \(O(n^{1.5} + \sqrt{C_4}) = O(n^2)\). In this paper, we introduce an algorithm with an expected \(\ell_2\)-error of \(O(\delta^{1.5} n^{0.5} + \delta^{0.5} d_{\max}^{0.5} n^{0.5})\), where \(\delta\) is the degeneracy and \(d_{\max}\) is the maximum degree of the graph. For degeneracy-bounded graphs (\(\delta \in \Theta(1)\)) commonly found in practical social networks, our algorithm achieves an expected \(\ell_2\)-error of \(O(d_{\max}^{0.5} n^{0.5}) = O(n)\). Our algorithm's core idea is a precise count of triangles following a preprocessing step that approximately sorts the degree of all nodes. This approach can be extended to approximate the number of cycles of length \(k\), maintaining a similar \(\ell_2\)-error, namely $O(\delta^{(k-2)/2} d_{\max}^{0.5} n^{(k-2)/2} + \delta^{k/2} n^{(k-2)/2})$ or $O(d_{\max}^{0.5} n^{(k-2)/2}) = O(n^{(k-1)/2})$ for degeneracy-bounded graphs.</description>

      <title>PhD Forum: Efficient Privacy-Preserving Processing via Memory-Centric Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving computation techniques like homomorphic encryption (HE) and secure multi-party computation (SMPC) enhance data security by enabling processing on encrypted data. However, the significant computational and CPU-DRAM data movement overhead resulting from the underlying cryptographic algorithms impedes the adoption of these techniques in practice. Existing approaches focus on improving computational overhead using specialized hardware like GPUs and FPGAs, but these methods still suffer from the same processor-DRAM overhead. Novel hardware technologies that support in-memory processing have the potential to address this problem. Memory-centric computing, or processing-in-memory (PIM), brings computation closer to data by introducing low-power processors called data processing units (DPUs) into memory. Besides its in-memory computation capability, PIM provides extensive parallelism, resulting in significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. We propose a framework that uses recently available PIM hardware to achieve efficient privacy-preserving computation. Our design consists of a four-layer architecture: (1) an application layer that decouples privacy-preserving applications from the underlying protocols and hardware; (2) a protocol layer that implements existing secure computation protocols (HE and MPC); (3) a data orchestration layer that leverages data compression techniques to mitigate the data transfer overhead between DPUs and host memory; (4) a computation layer which implements DPU kernels on which secure computation algorithms are built.</description>

      <title>RESAA: A Removal and Structural Analysis Attack Against Compound Logic Locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semiconductor industry's paradigm shift towards fabless integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing has introduced security threats, including piracy, counterfeiting, hardware Trojans, and overproduction. In response to these challenges, various countermeasures, including Logic locking (LL), have been proposed to protect designs and mitigate security risks. LL is likely the most researched form of intellectual property (IP) protection for ICs. A significant advance has been made with the introduction of compound logic locking (CLL), where two LL techniques are concurrently utilized for improved resiliency against attacks. However, the vulnerabilities of LL techniques, particularly CLL, need to be explored further. This paper presents a novel framework, RESAA, designed to classify CLL-locked designs, identify critical gates, and execute various attacks to uncover secret keys. RESAA is agnostic to specific LL techniques, offering comprehensive insights into CLL's security scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate RESAA's efficacy in identifying critical gates, distinguishing segments corresponding to different LL techniques, and determining associated keys based on different threat models. In particular, for the oracle-less threat model, RESAA can achieve up to 92.6% accuracy on a relatively complex ITC'99 benchmark circuit. The results reported in this paper emphasize the significance of evaluation and thoughtful selection of LL techniques, as all studied CLL variants demonstrated vulnerability to our framework. RESAA is also open-sourced for the community at large.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised critical challenges associated with privacy, security, and data integrity, specifically in infrastructures such as smart cities or smart manufacturing. Blockchain technology provides immutable, scalable, and decentralized solutions to address these challenges, and integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into the IoT environment offers enhanced adaptability and decision-making. This paper investigates the integration of blockchain and DRL to optimize mobile transmission and secure data exchange in IoT-assisted smart cities. Through the clustering and categorization of IoT application systems, the combination of DRL and blockchain is shown to enhance the performance of IoT networks by maintaining privacy and security. Based on the review of papers published between 2015 and 2024, we have classified the presented approaches and offered practical taxonomies, which provide researchers with critical perspectives and highlight potential areas for future exploration and research. Our investigation shows how combining blockchain's decentralized framework with DRL can address privacy and security issues, improve mobile transmission efficiency, and guarantee robust, privacy-preserving IoT systems. Additionally, we explore blockchain integration for DRL and outline the notable applications of DRL technology. By addressing the challenges of machine learning and blockchain integration, this study proposes novel perspectives for researchers and serves as a foundational exploration from an interdisciplinary standpoint.</description>

      <title>Claim-Guided Textual Backdoor Attack for Practical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing and the increased use of large language models have exposed new security vulnerabilities, such as backdoor attacks. Previous backdoor attacks require input manipulation after model distribution to activate the backdoor, posing limitations in real-world applicability. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel Claim-Guided Backdoor Attack (CGBA), which eliminates the need for such manipulations by utilizing inherent textual claims as triggers. CGBA leverages claim extraction, clustering, and targeted training to trick models to misbehave on targeted claims without affecting their performance on clean data. CGBA demonstrates its effectiveness and stealthiness across various datasets and models, significantly enhancing the feasibility of practical backdoor attacks. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/PaperCGBA/CGBA.</description>

      <title>Holistic Automated Red Teaming for Large Language Models through Top-Down Test Case Generation and Multi-turn Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated red teaming is an effective method for identifying misaligned behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches, however, often focus primarily on improving attack success rates while overlooking the need for comprehensive test case coverage. Additionally, most of these methods are limited to single-turn red teaming, failing to capture the multi-turn dynamics of real-world human-machine interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose HARM (Holistic Automated Red teaMing), which scales up the diversity of test cases using a top-down approach based on an extensible, fine-grained risk taxonomy. Our method also leverages a novel fine-tuning strategy and reinforcement learning techniques to facilitate multi-turn adversarial probing in a human-like manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables a more systematic understanding of model vulnerabilities and offers more targeted guidance for the alignment process.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy Regularization: Protecting Training Data Through Loss Function Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training machine learning models based on neural networks requires large datasets, which may contain sensitive information. The models, however, should not expose private information from these datasets. Differentially private SGD [DP-SGD] requires the modification of the standard stochastic gradient descent [SGD] algorithm for training new models. In this short paper, a novel regularization strategy is proposed to achieve the same goal in a more efficient manner.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Multi-Factor Authentication with a Triple-Identity Authentication Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19459v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existing authentication system has two entry points (i.e., username and password fields) to interact with the outside, but neither of them has a gatekeeper, making the system vulnerable to cyberattacks. In order to ensure the authentication security, the system sets a third entry point and use an external MFA service to guard it. The crux of the problem is that the system has no internal mechanism to guard its own entry points as no identifiers can be defined for the username and password without using any personal information. To solve this problem, we open the hash algorithm of a dual-password login-authentication system to three login credentials. Therefore, the intermediate elements of the algorithm can be used to define an identifier to verify the user identity at each entry point of the system. As a result of the above setup, a triple-identity authentication is established, the key of which is that the readily available user's login name and password are randomly converted into a matrix of meaningless hash elements which are concealed, incommunicable, inaccessible, and independent of personal information. So the identifiers defined using such elements can be used by the system to verify the identities of the user at all the entry points of the system, thereby ensuring the authentication security without relying on MFA services.</description>

      <title>Advancing Cyber Incident Timeline Analysis Through Rule Based AI and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timeline Analysis (TA) plays a crucial role in Timeline Forensics (TF) within the field of Digital Forensics (DF). It focuses on examining and analyzing time-based digital artefacts, such as timestamps derived from event logs, file metadata, and other relevant data, to correlate events linked to cyber incidents and reconstruct their chronological sequence. Traditional tools often struggle to efficiently handle the large volume and variety of data generated during DF investigations and Incident Response (IR) processes. This paper introduces a novel framework, GenDFIR, which combines Rule-Based Artificial Intelligence (R-BAI) algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance and automate the TA process. The proposed approach consists of two key stages: (1) R-BAI is used to identify and select anomalous digital artefacts based on predefined rules. (2) The selected artefacts are then transformed into embeddings for processing by an LLM with the assistance of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. The LLM uses its capabilities to perform automated TA on the artefacts and predict potential incident outcomes. To validate the framework, we evaluated its performance, efficiency, and reliability. Several metrics were applied to simulated cyber incident scenarios, which were presented as forensic case documents. Our findings demonstrate the significant potential of integrating R-BAI and LLMs for TA. This innovative approach underscores the power of Generative AI (GenAI), particularly LLMs, and opens up new possibilities for advanced threat detection and incident reconstruction, marking a significant advancement in the field.</description>

      <title>Demo: SGCode: A Flexible Prompt-Optimizing System for Secure Generation of Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces SGCode, a flexible prompt-optimizing system to generate secure code with large language models (LLMs). SGCode integrates recent prompt-optimization approaches with LLMs in a unified system accessible through front-end and back-end APIs, enabling users to 1) generate secure code, which is free of vulnerabilities, 2) review and share security analysis, and 3) easily switch from one prompt optimization approach to another, while providing insights on model and system performance. We populated SGCode on an AWS server with PromSec, an approach that optimizes prompts by combining an LLM and security tools with a lightweight generative adversarial graph neural network to detect and fix security vulnerabilities in the generated code. Extensive experiments show that SGCode is practical as a public tool to gain insights into the trade-offs between model utility, secure code generation, and system cost. SGCode has only a marginal cost compared with prompting LLMs. SGCode is available at: https://sgcode.codes/.</description>

      <title>Continual Adversarial Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09481v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In response to the rapidly evolving nature of adversarial attacks against visual classifiers on a monthly basis, numerous defenses have been proposed to generalize against as many known attacks as possible. However, designing a defense method that generalizes to all types of attacks is not realistic because the environment in which defense systems operate is dynamic and comprises various unique attacks that emerge as time goes on. A well-matched approach to the dynamic environment lies in a defense system that continuously collects adversarial data online to quickly improve itself. Therefore, we put forward a practical defense deployment against a challenging threat model and propose, for the first time, the Continual Adversarial Defense (CAD) framework that adapts to attack sequences under four principles: (1) continual adaptation to new attacks without catastrophic forgetting, (2) few-shot adaptation, (3) memory-efficient adaptation, and (4) high accuracy on both clean and adversarial data. We explore and integrate cutting-edge continual learning, few-shot learning, and ensemble learning techniques to qualify the principles. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach against multiple stages of modern adversarial attacks and demonstrate significant improvements over numerous baseline methods. In particular, CAD is capable of quickly adapting with minimal budget and a low cost of defense failure while maintaining good performance against previous attacks. Our research sheds light on a brand-new paradigm for continual defense adaptation against dynamic and evolving attacks.</description>

      <title>Commitments are equivalent to statistically-verifiable one-way state generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03220v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-way state generators (OWSG) are natural quantum analogs to classical one-way functions. We consider statistically-verifiable OWSGs (sv-OWSG), which are potentially weaker objects than OWSGs. We show that O(n/log(n))-copy sv-OWSGs (n represents the input length) are equivalent to poly(n)-copy sv-OWSGs and to quantum commitments. Since known results show that o(n/log(n))-copy OWSGs cannot imply commitments, this shows that O(n/log(n))-copy sv-OWSGs are the weakest OWSGs from which we can get commitments (and hence much of quantum cryptography).
  Our construction follows along the lines of Hastad, Impagliazzo, Levin and Luby, who obtained classical pseudorandom generators (PRG) from classical one-way functions (OWF), however with crucial modifications. Our construction, when applied to the classical case, provides an alternative to the classical construction to obtain a classical mildly non-uniform PRG from any classical OWF. Since we do not argue conditioned on the output $f(x)$, our construction and analysis is arguably simpler and may be of independent interest. For converting a mildly non-uniform PRG to a uniform PRG, we can use the classical construction.</description>

      <title>We Have a Package for You! A Comprehensive Analysis of Package Hallucinations by Code Generating LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reliance of popular programming languages such as Python and JavaScript on centralized package repositories and open-source software, combined with the emergence of code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs), has created a new type of threat to the software supply chain: package hallucinations. These hallucinations, which arise from fact-conflicting errors when generating code using LLMs, represent a novel form of package confusion attack that poses a critical threat to the integrity of the software supply chain. This paper conducts a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of package hallucinations across different programming languages, settings, and parameters, exploring how a diverse set of models and configurations affect the likelihood of generating erroneous package recommendations and identifying the root causes of this phenomenon. Using 16 popular LLMs for code generation and two unique prompt datasets, we generate 576,000 code samples in two programming languages that we analyze for package hallucinations. Our findings reveal that that the average percentage of hallucinated packages is at least 5.2% for commercial models and 21.7% for open-source models, including a staggering 205,474 unique examples of hallucinated package names, further underscoring the severity and pervasiveness of this threat. To overcome this problem, we implement several hallucination mitigation strategies and show that they are able to significantly reduce the number of package hallucinations while maintaining code quality. Our experiments and findings highlight package hallucinations as a persistent and systemic phenomenon while using state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation, and a significant challenge which deserves the research community's urgent attention.</description>

      <title>Best Linear Unbiased Estimate from Privatized Histograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In differential privacy (DP) mechanisms, it can be beneficial to release "redundant" outputs, in the sense that a quantity can be estimated by combining different combinations of privatized values. Indeed, this structure is present in the DP 2020 Decennial Census products published by the U.S. Census Bureau. With this structure, the DP output can be improved by enforcing self-consistency (i.e., estimators obtained by combining different values result in the same estimate) and we show that the minimum variance processing is a linear projection. However, standard projection algorithms are too computationally expensive in terms of both memory and execution time for applications such as the Decennial Census. We propose the Scalable Efficient Algorithm for Best Linear Unbiased Estimate (SEA BLUE), based on a two step process of aggregation and differencing that 1) enforces self-consistency through a linear and unbiased procedure, 2) is computationally and memory efficient, 3) achieves the minimum variance solution under certain structural assumptions, and 4) is empirically shown to be robust to violations of these structural assumptions. We propose three methods of calculating confidence intervals from our estimates, under various assumptions. We apply SEA BLUE to two 2010 Census demonstration products, illustrating its scalability and validity.</description>
