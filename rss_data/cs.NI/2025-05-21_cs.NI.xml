      <title>6G communications through sub-Terahertz CMOS power amplifiers: Design challenges and trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fifth-generation (5G) network faces limitations in supporting emerging applications, such as artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR) and digital twins. To overcome these confines, sub-Terahertz (sub-THz) and Terahertz (THz) technologies are considered to be key enablers of effective 6G wireless communications, offering higher transmission speeds, longer range and wider bandwidth. Achieving these capabilities requires careful engineering of 6G transceivers, with a focus on efficient power amplifiers (PAs) in the front-end, which play a critical role in effectively amplifying and transmitting signals over long distances. Complimentary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) technology-based PA in sub-THz suffers severe parasitic and limited maximum frequency, however, this has eventually been solved by different design architectures and scaling down of CMOS technology to break through the frequency limitations. In this article, we reviewed the potentials and capabilities of CMOS technology for designing 6G hardware, identified the state-of-art PA designs in the sub-THz band and then examined as well as compared the designs to identify the suitable design strategies for better performance. The circuit optimisation techniques, such as coupled-line, passive gain boosting method, zero-degree power splitting, load-pull matching, diode and capacitor linearisation for better gain, saturated output power and power added efficiency, are considered for the PA design architectures at different sub-THz bands. Furthermore, these methods are summarised and discussed with their advantages and disadvantages in lieu with their performances. The PA design trends, challenges and future perspectives are also presented and discussed. Therefore, this comprehensive review article will serve as a comparative study and reference for future PA designs for radio frequency integrated circuits (RFIC).</description>

      <title>CE-LSLM: Efficient Large-Small Language Model Inference and Communication via Cloud-Edge Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging intelligent service scenarios in 6G communication impose stringent requirements for low latency, high reliability, and privacy preservation. Generative large language models (LLMs) are gradually becoming key enablers for the integration of semantic communication and computation. However, due to the limited computational resources of edge devices and the increasing complexity of heterogeneous terminal access, existing centralized inference approaches fail to meet the dual demands of response efficiency and data privacy in edge-side inference tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel collaborative inference architecture that integrates cloud-based LLMs with edge-deployed small language models (SLMs), enabling dynamic scheduling and sharing of semantic-level intermediate states, and establishing a unified computation-communication paradigm tailored for 6G networks. Specifically, a key-value (KV) cache reuse mechanism is introduced to enhance the semantic understanding of edge models through contextual guidance from the cloud, while significantly reducing edge-side computational and storage overhead. Furthermore, a cross-node parallel scheduling mechanism is proposed to achieve asynchronous coordination between model state loading and decoding computation, thereby improving edge responsiveness. In addition, we investigate layer alignment and representation compression strategies between heterogeneous models to alleviate the communication burden on the edge. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture exhibits superior adaptability and scalability in terms of inference latency, system stability, and concurrent processing capacity.</description>

      <title>VaN3Twin: the Multi-Technology V2X Digital Twin with Ray-Tracing in the Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents VaN3Twin-the first open-source, full-stack Network Digital Twin (NDT) framework for simulating the coexistence of multiple Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technologies with accurate physical-layer modeling via ray tracing. VaN3Twin extends the ms-van3t simulator by integrating Sionna Ray Tracer (RT) in the loop, enabling high-fidelity representation of wireless propagation, including diverse Line-of-Sight (LoS) conditions with focus on LoS blockage due to other vehicles' meshes, Doppler effect, and site-dependent effects-e.g., scattering and diffraction. Unlike conventional simulation tools, the proposed framework supports realistic coexistence analysis across DSRC and C-V2X technologies operating over shared spectrum. A dedicated interference tracking module captures cross-technology interference at the time-frequency resource block level and enhances signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) estimation by eliminating artifacts such as the bimodal behavior induced by separate LoS/NLoS propagation models. Compared to field measurements, VaN3Twin reduces application-layer disagreement by 50% in rural and over 70% in urban environments with respect to current state-of-the-art simulation tools, demonstrating its value for scalable and accurate digital twin-based V2X coexistence simulation.</description>

      <title>Sibling Prefixes: Identifying Similarities in IPv4 and IPv6 Prefixes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the standardization of IPv6 in 1998, both versions of the Internet Protocol have coexisted in the Internet. Clients usually run algorithms such as Happy Eyeballs, to decide whether to connect to an IPv4 or IPv6 endpoint for dual-stack domains. To identify whether two addresses belong to the same device or service, researchers have proposed different forms of alias resolution techniques. Similarly, one can also form siblings of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses belonging to the same device. Traditionally, all of these approaches have focused on individual IP addresses.
  In this work, we propose the concept of "sibling prefixes", where we extend the definition of an IPv4-IPv6 sibling to two IP prefixe-one IPv4 prefix and its sibling IPv6 prefix. We present a technique based on large-scale DNS resolution data to identify 76k IPv4-IPv6 sibling prefixes. We find sibling prefixes to be relatively stable over time. We present SP-Tuner algorithm to tune the CIDR size of sibling prefixes and improve the perfect match siblings from 52% to 82%. For more than half of sibling prefixes, the organization names for their IPv4 and IPv6 origin ASes are identical, and 60% of all sibling prefixes have at least one of the prefixes with a valid ROV status in RPKI. Furthermore, we identify sibling prefixes in 24 hypergiant and CDN networks. Finally, we plan to regularly publish a list of sibling prefixes to be used by network operators and fellow researchers in dual-stack studies.</description>

      <title>Measuring Round-Trip Response Latencies Under Asymmetric Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latency is a key indicator of Internet service performance. Continuously tracking the latency of client requests enables service operators to quickly identify bottlenecks, perform adaptive resource allocation or routing, and mitigate attacks. Passively measuring the response latency at intermediate vantage points is attractive since it provides insight into the experience of real clients without requiring client instrumentation or incurring probing overheads. This paper presents PIRATE, a passive approach to measure response latencies when only the client-to-server traffic is visible, even when transport headers are encrypted. PIRATE estimates the time gap between causal pairs - two requests such that the response to the first triggered the second - as a proxy for the client-side response latency. Our experiments with a realistic web application show that PIRATE can estimate the response latencies measured at the client application layer to within 1 percent. A PIRATE-enhanced layer-4 load balancer (with DSR) cuts tail latencies by 37 percent.</description>

      <title>open5Gcube: A Modular and Usable Framework for Mobile Network Laboratories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mobile network research, the integration of real-world components such as User Equipment (UE) with open-source network infrastructure is essential yet challenging. To address these issues, we introduce open5Gcube, a modular framework designed to integrate popular open-source mobile network projects into a unified management environment. Our publicly available framework allows researchers to flexibly combine different open-source implementations, including different versions, and simplifies experimental setups through containerization and lightweight orchestration. We demonstrate the practical usability of open5Gcube by evaluating its compatibility with various commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) smartphones and modems across multiple mobile generations (2G, 4G, and 5G). The results underline the versatility and reproducibility of our approach, significantly advancing the accessibility of rigorous experimentation in mobile network laboratories.</description>

      <title>A5/1 is in the Air: Passive Detection of 2G (GSM) Ciphering Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the ongoing use of the A5/1 ciphering algorithm within 2G GSM networks. Despite its known vulnerabilities and the gradual phasing out of GSM technology by some operators, GSM security remains relevant due to potential downgrade attacks from 4G/5G networks and its use in IoT applications. We present a comprehensive overview of a historical weakness associated with the A5 family of cryptographic algorithms. Building on this, our main contribution is the design of a measurement approach using low-cost, off-the-shelf hardware to passively monitor Cipher Mode Command messages transmitted by base transceiver stations (BTS). We collected over 500,000 samples at 10 different locations, focusing on the three largest mobile network operators in Germany. Our findings reveal significant variations in algorithm usage among these providers. One operator favors A5/3, while another surprisingly retains a high reliance on the compromised A5/1. The third provider shows a marked preference for A5/3 and A5/4, indicating a shift towards more secure ciphering algorithms in GSM networks.</description>

      <title>Automated, Cross-Layer Root Cause Analysis of 5G Video-Conferencing Quality Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 5G wireless networks are complex, leveraging layers of scheduling, retransmission, and adaptation mechanisms to maximize their efficiency. But these mechanisms interact to produce significant fluctuations in uplink and downlink capacity and latency. This markedly impacts the performance of real-time applications, such as video-conferencing, which are particularly sensitive to such fluctuations, resulting in lag, stuttering, distorted audio, and low video quality. This paper presents a cross-layer view of 5G networks and their impact on and interaction with video-conferencing applications. We conduct novel, detailed measurements of both Private CBRS and commercial carrier cellular network dynamics, capturing physical- and link-layer events and correlating them with their effects at the network and transport layers, and the video-conferencing application itself. Our two datasets comprise days of low-rate campus-wide Zoom telemetry data, and hours of high-rate, correlated WebRTC-network-5G telemetry data. Based on these data, we trace performance anomalies back to root causes, identifying 24 previously unknown causal event chains that degrade 5G video conferencing. Armed with this knowledge, we build Domino, a tool that automates this process and is user-extensible to future wireless networks and interactive applications.</description>

      <title>PSMOA: Policy Support Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithm for Decentralized Data Replication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient data replication in decentralized storage systems must account for diverse policies, especially in multi-organizational, data-intensive environments. This work proposes PSMOA, a novel Policy Support Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm for decentralized data replication that dynamically adapts to varying organizational requirements %. PSMOA integrates NSGA-III with Entropy Weighted TOPSIS to optimize replication such as minimization or maximization of replication time, storage cost, replication based on content popularity, and load balancing while respecting policy constraints. %Our simulations demonstrate PSMOA's superior performance, with load balancing %maintaining 104-107\% %performance improving by 4-7\% relative to baseline. %, while other metrics show stable performance between 98-103\%. PSMOA outperforms NSGA-II and NSGA-III in both Generational Distance (20.29 vs 148.74 and 67.74) and Inverted Generational Distance (0.78 vs 3.76 and 5.61), indicating better convergence and solution distribution. These results validate PSMOA's novelty in optimizing data replication in multi-organizational environments.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Reinforcement Learning for Load Balancing using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been increasingly applied to network control problems, such as load balancing. However, existing RL approaches often suffer from lack of interpretability and difficulty in extracting controller equations. In this paper, we propose the use of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for interpretable RL in network control. We employ a PPO agent with a 1-layer actor KAN model and an MLP Critic network to learn load balancing policies that maximise throughput utility, minimize loss as well as delay. Our approach allows us to extract controller equations from the learned neural networks, providing insights into the decision-making process. We evaluate our approach using different reward functions demonstrating its effectiveness in improving network performance while providing interpretable policies.</description>

      <title>TSA-WF: Exploring the Effectiveness of Time Series Analysis for Website Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Website fingerprinting (WF) is a technique that allows an eavesdropper to determine the website a target user is accessing by inspecting the metadata associated with the packets she exchanges via some encrypted tunnel, e.g., Tor. Recent WF attacks built using machine learning (and deep learning) process and summarize trace metadata during their feature extraction phases. This methodology leads to predictions that lack information about the instant at which a given website is detected within a (potentially large) network trace comprised of multiple sequential website accesses -- a setting known as \textit{multi-tab} WF.
  In this paper, we explore whether classical time series analysis techniques can be effective in the WF setting. Specifically, we introduce TSA-WF, a pipeline designed to closely preserve network traces' timing and direction characteristics, which enables the exploration of algorithms designed to measure time series similarity in the WF context. Our evaluation with Tor traces reveals that TSA-WF achieves a comparable accuracy to existing WF attacks in scenarios where website accesses can be easily singled-out from a given trace (i.e., the \textit{single-tab} WF setting), even when shielded by specially designed WF defenses. Finally, while TSA-WF did not outperform existing attacks in the multi-tab setting, we show how TSA-WF can help pinpoint the approximate instant at which a given website of interest is visited within a multi-tab trace.\footnote{This preprint has not undergone any post-submission improvements or corrections.

      <title>LLM-hRIC: LLM-empowered Hierarchical RAN Intelligent Control for O-RAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in applying large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) techniques to open radio access network (O-RAN), critical challenges remain, such as insufficient cooperation between radio access network (RAN) intelligent controllers (RICs), high computational demands hindering real-time decisions, and the lack of domain-specific finetuning. Therefore, this article introduces the LLM-empowered hierarchical RIC (LLM-hRIC) framework to improve the collaboration between RICs in O-RAN. The LLM-empowered non-real-time RIC (non-RT RIC) acts as a guider, offering a strategic guidance to the near-real-time RIC (near-RT RIC) using global network information. The RL-empowered near-RT RIC acts as an implementer, combining this guidance with local real-time data to make near-RT decisions. We evaluate the feasibility and performance of the LLM-hRIC framework in an integrated access and backhaul (IAB) network setting, and finally, discuss the open challenges of the LLM-hRIC framework for O-RAN.</description>

      <title>QuESat: Satellite-Assisted Quantum Internet for Global-Scale Entanglement Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement distribution across remote distances is critical for many quantum applications. Currently, the de facto approach for remote entanglement distribution relies on optical fiber for on-the-ground entanglement distribution. However, the fiber-based approach is incapable of global-scale entanglement distribution due to intrinsic limitations. This paper investigates a new hybrid ground-satellite quantum network architecture (QuESat) for global-scale entanglement distribution, integrating an on-the-ground fiber network with a global-scale passive optical network built with low-Earth-orbit satellites. The satellite network provides dynamic construction of photon lightpaths based on near-vacuum beam guides constructed via adjustable arrays of lenses, forwarding photons from one ground station to another with very high efficiency over long distances compared to using fiber. To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of QuESat for global communication, we formulate lightpath provisioning and entanglement distribution problems, considering the orbital dynamics of satellites and the time-varying entanglement demands from ground users. A two-stage algorithm is developed to dynamically configure the beam guides and distribute entanglements, respectively. The algorithm combines randomized and deterministic rounding for lightpath provisioning to enable global connectivity, with optimal entanglement swapping for distributing entanglements to meet users' demands. By developing a ground-satellite quantum network simulator, QuESat achieves multi-fold improvements compared to repeater networks.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid growth in the number of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been a recent interest in LLM routing, or directing queries to the cheapest LLM that can deliver a suitable response. We conduct a minimax analysis of the routing problem, providing a lower bound and finding that a simple router that predicts both cost and accuracy for each question can be minimax optimal. Inspired by this, we introduce CARROT, a Cost AwaRe Rate Optimal rouTer that selects a model based on estimates of the models' cost and performance. Alongside CARROT, we also introduce the Smart Price-aware ROUTing (SPROUT) dataset to facilitate routing on a wide spectrum of queries with the latest state-of-the-art LLMs. Using SPROUT and prior benchmarks such as Routerbench and open-LLM-leaderboard-v2 we empirically validate CARROT's performance against several alternative routers.</description>

      <title>On-Device LLM for Context-Aware Wi-Fi Roaming</title>

Abstract: Roaming in Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) is a critical yet challenging task for maintaining seamless connectivity in dynamic mobile environments. Conventional threshold-based or heuristic schemes often fail, leading to either sticky or excessive handovers. We introduce the first cross-layer use of an on-device large language model (LLM): high-level reasoning in the application layer that issues real-time actions executed in the PHY/MAC stack. The LLM addresses two tasks: (i) context-aware AP selection, where structured prompts fuse environmental cues (e.g., location, time) to choose the best BSSID; and (ii) dynamic threshold adjustment, where the model adaptively decides when to roam. To satisfy the tight latency and resource budgets of edge hardware, we apply a suite of optimizations-chain-of-thought prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and quantization. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that our approach surpasses legacy heuristics and DRL baselines, achieving a strong balance between roaming stability and signal quality. These findings underscore the promise of application-layer LLM reasoning for lower-layer wireless control in future edge systems.</description>
