      <title>Statistical Mechanical Analysis of Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze Gaussian processes using statistical mechanics. Although the input is originally multidimensional, we simplify our model by considering the input as one-dimensional for statistical mechanical analysis. Furthermore, we employ periodic boundary conditions as an additional modeling approach. By using periodic boundary conditions, we can diagonalize the covariance matrix. The diagonalized covariance matrix is then applied to Gaussian processes. This allows for a statistical mechanical analysis of Gaussian processes using the derived diagonalized matrix. We indicate that the analytical solutions obtained in this method closely match the results from simulations.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Patterns in Active Four-State Potts Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many types of spatiotemporal patterns have been observed under nonequilibrium conditions. Cycling through four or more states can provide specific dynamics, such as the spatial coexistence of multiple phases. However, transient dynamics have only been studied by previous theoretical models, since absorbing transition into a uniform phase covered by a single state occurs in the long-time limit. Here, we reported steady long-term dynamics using cyclic Potts models, wherein nucleation and growth play essential roles. Under the cyclic symmetry of the four states, the cyclic changes in the dominant phases and the spatial coexistence of the four phases are obtained at low and high flipping energies, respectively. Under asymmetric conditions, the spatial coexistence of two diagonal phases appears in addition to non-cyclic one-phase modes. The circular domains of the diagonal state are formed by the nucleation of other states, and they slowly shrink to reduce the domain boundary. When three-state cycling is added, competition between the two cycling modes changes the spatiotemporal patterns.</description>

      <title>Dynamical behavior of passive particles with harmonic, viscous, and correlated Gaussian forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Navier-Stokes equation and the Burgers equation for the dynamical motion of a passive particle with harmonic and viscous forces, subject to an exponentially correlated Gaussian force. As deriving the Fokker-Planck equation for the joint probability density of a passive particle, we find obviously the important solution of the joint probability density by using double Fourier transforms in three-time domains, and the moments from derived moment equation are numerically calculated. As a result, the dynamical motion of a passive particle with respect to the probability density having two variables of displacement and velocity in the short-time domain has a super-diffusive form, whereas the distribution in the long-time domain is obtained to be Gaussian by analyzing only from the velocity probability density.</description>

      <title>Why gauge invariance applies to statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an introductory account of the recently identified gauge invariance of the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical many-body systems [J. M\"uller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. (to appear) arXiv:2406.19235]. The gauge transformation is a non-commutative shifting operation on phase space that keeps the differential phase space volume element and hence the Gibbs integration measure conserved. When thermally averaged any observable is an invariant, including thermodynamic and structural quantities. Shifting transformations are canonical in the sense of classical mechanics. They also form an infinite-dimensional group with generators of infinitesimal transformations that build a non-commutative Lie algebra. We lay out the connections with the underlying geometry of coordinate displacement and with Noether's theorem. Spatial localization of the shifting yields differential operators that satisfy commutator relationships, which we describe both in purely configurational and in full phase space setups. Standard operator calculus yields corresponding equilibrium hyperforce correlation sum rules for general observables and order parameters. Using Monte Carlos simulations we demonstrate explicitly the gauge invariance for finite shifting. We argue in favour of using the gauge invariance as a statistical mechanical construction principle for obtaining exact results and for formulating smart sampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Resetting for Informed Search Strategies and the Design of Non-equilibrium Steady-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting, the procedure of stopping and re-initializing random processes, has recently emerged as a powerful tool for accelerating processes ranging from queuing systems to molecular simulations. However, its usefulness is severely limited by assuming that the resetting protocol is completely decoupled from the state and age of the process that is being reset. We present a general formulation for state- and time-dependent resetting of stochastic processes, which we call adaptive resetting. This allows us to predict, using a single set of trajectories without resetting and via a simple reweighing procedure, all key observables of processes with adaptive resetting. These include the first-passage time distribution, the propagator, and the steady-state. Our formulation enables efficient exploration of informed search strategies and facilitates the prediction and design of complex non-equilibrium steady states, eliminating the need for extensive brute-force sampling across different resetting protocols.</description>

      <title>The route of random process to ultraslow aging phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logarithmic aging phenomena are prevalent in various systems, including electronic materials and biological structures. This study utilizes a generalized continuous time random walk (CTRW) framework to investigate the mechanisms behind the logarithmic aging phenomena. By incorporating non-Markovian jump processes with significant memory effects, we modify traditional diffusion models to exhibit logarithmic decay in both survival and return probabilities. In addition, we analyze the impact of aging on autocorrelation functions, illustrating how long-term memory behaviors affect the temporal evolution of physical properties. These results connect microscopic models to macroscopic manifestations in real-world systems, advancing the understanding of ultraslow dynamics in disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of cumulant evolution and full counting statistics: application to infinite temperature quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method to efficiently compute quantum generating functions (QGF) for a wide class of observables in one-dimensional quantum systems at high temperature. We obtain high-accuracy estimates for the cumulants and reconstruct full counting statistics from the QGF. We demonstrate its potential on spin $S=1/2$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain, where we can reach time scales hitherto inaccessible to state-of-the-art classical and quantum simulations. Our results challenge the conjecture of the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang universality for isotropic integrable quantum spin chains.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature quantum field theory of Casimir forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum theory of Casimir forces between perfect electrical conductors, based on quantum electrodynamics and quantum statistical physics. This theory utilizes Kapusta's finite-temperature quantum field theory, combined with the Faddeev-Popov ghost formalism. This approach allows us to calculate Casimir forces at finite temperatures, providing both previously known and new physical insights from a unified perspective. Furthermore, our method enables us to compute the stress tensor associated with Casimir forces, in accordance with the Helmholtz free energy of an equilibrium quantum electromagnetic field. Using this methodology, we calculate the excess surface tension on the walls of slit-like pores due to the Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>Thermostatting of Active Hamiltonian Systems via Symplectic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of non-standard, two-dimensional (2D) Hamiltonian models that may show features of active particle dynamics, and therefore, we refer to these models as active Hamiltonian (AH) systems. The idea is to consider a spin fluid where -- on top of spin-spin and particle-particle interactions -- spins are coupled to the particle's velocities via a vector potential. Continuous spin variables interact with each other as in a standard $XY$ model. Typically, the AH models exhibit non-standard thermodynamic properties (e.g., for temperature and pressure) and equations of motion with non-standard forces. This implies that the derivation of symplectic algorithms to solve Hamilton's equations of motion numerically, as well as the thermostatting for these systems, is not straightforward. Here, we derive a symplectic integration scheme and propose a Nos\'e-Poincar\'e thermostat, providing a correct sampling in the canonical ensemble. The expressions for AH systems that we find for temperature and pressure might have parallels with the ongoing debate about the definition of pressure and the equation of state in active matter systems. For a specific AH model, recently proposed by Casiulis et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 124}, 198001 (2020)], we rationalize the symplectic algorithm and the proposed thermostatting, and investigate the transition from a fluid at high temperature to a cluster phase at low temperature where, due to the coupling of velocities and spins, the cluster phase shows a collective motion that is reminiscent to that observed in a variety of active systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fluctuation Dissipation Relations for Active Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breakdown of time-reversal symmetry is a defining property of non-equilibrium systems, such as active matter, which is composed of units that consume energy. We employ a formalism that allows us to derive a class of identities associated with the time-reversal transformation in non-equilibrium field theories, in the spirit of Ward-Takahashi identities. We present a generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem valid for active systems as a particular realization of such an identity, and apply it to the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model for which we verify the identity via a graphical summation method. The field theoretical toolbox developed here helps to quantify the degree of non-equilibrium activity of complex systems exhibiting collective behavior.</description>

      <title>Learning efficient erasure protocols for an underdamped memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply evolutionary reinforcement learning to a simulation model in order to identify efficient time-dependent erasure protocols for a physical realization of a one-bit memory by an underdamped mechanical cantilever. We show that these protocols, when applied to the cantilever in the laboratory, are considerably more efficient than our best hand-designed protocols. The learned protocols allow reliable high-speed erasure by minimizing the heating of the memory during the operation. More generally, the combination of methods used here opens the door to the rational design of efficient protocols for a variety of physics applications.</description>

      <title>Avalanches in CuZrAl metallic glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic glasses have mechanical properties, which exhibit avalanches in the disguise of stress drops. We study these phenomena in a classical metallic glass system CuZrAl by athermal quasistatic shear and varying the element concentrations and for pure CuZr 50/50 case the cooling rate. The resulting mechanical properties are close to the behaviour found experimentally. At small strains, the pristine systems are akin to other glassy systems with a so-called gap distribution with a small positive exponent. Critical avalanching behaviour is found only approaching the yield point. The post-yield stress drops are universal, and the gap distribution becomes flat.</description>

      <title>The geometric phase transition of the three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With intensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite size scaling we undertake a percolation analysis of Wegner's three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model in equilibrium. We confirm that the loops threading excited plaquettes percolate at the thermal critical point $T_{\rm c}$ and we show that their critical exponents coincide with the ones of the loop representation of the dual 3D Ising model. We then construct Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters using a random-cluster representation and find that they also percolate at $T_c$ and moreover give access to all thermal critical exponents. The Binder cumulants of the percolation order parameter of both loops and FK clusters demonstrate a pseudo first order transition. This study sheds light on the critical properties of quantum error correction and lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Dynamically generated concatenated codes and their phase diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate code concatenation as the action of a unitary quantum circuit on an expanding tree geometry and find that for certain classes of gates, applied identically at each node, a binary tree circuit encodes a single logical qubit with code distance that grows exponentially in the depth of the tree. When there is noise in the bulk or at the end of this encoding circuit, the system undergoes a phase transition between a coding phase, where an optimal decoder can successfully recover logical information, and non-coding phase. Leveraging the tree structure, we combine the formalism of "tensor enumerators" from quantum coding theory with standard recursive techniques for classical spin models on the Bethe lattice to explore these phases. In the presence of bulk errors, the coding phase is a type of spin glass, characterized by a distribution of failure probabilities. When the errors are heralded, the recursion relation is exactly solvable, giving us an analytic handle on the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Gravity as a mesoscopic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a probabilistic mesoscopic description to draw conceptual and quantitative analogies between Brownian motion and late-time fluctuations of thermal correlation functions in generic chaotic systems respecting ETH. In this framework, thermal correlation functions of `simple' operators are described by stochastic processes, which are able to probe features of the microscopic theory only in a probabilistic sense. We apply this formalism to the case of semiclassical gravity in AdS$_3$, showing that wormhole contributions can be naturally identified as moments of stochastic processes. We also point out a `Matryoshka doll' recursive structure in which information is hidden in higher and higher moments, and which can be naturally justified within the stochastic framework. We then re-interpret the gravitational results from the boundary perspective, promoting the OPE data of the CFT to probability distributions. The outcome of this study shows that semiclassical gravity in AdS can be naturally interpreted as a mesoscopic description of quantum gravity, and a mesoscopic holographic duality can be framed as a moment-vs-probability-distribution duality.</description>

      <title>Directed Swarm Assembly due to Mixed Misaligned Perception-Dependent Motility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mixture of particles with perception-dependent motility and opposite misaligned visual perception shows to spontaneously self-organize into a self-propelling bean-shaped cluster. The two species initially rotate in opposite directions, which together with the steric interactions, makes them segregate into two main counter-rotating domains forming a cohesive and persistently propelling single cluster. Mixtures of particles with misaligned perception and discontinuous motility are therefore a promising pathway for the design of programmable active matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By means of a minimal physical model, we investigate the interplay of two phase transitions at play in chromatin organization: (1) liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) within the fluid solvating chromatin, resulting in the formation of biocondensates, and (2) the coil-globule crossover of the chromatin fiber, which drives the condensation or extension of the chain. In our model, a species representing a domain of chromatin is embedded in a binary fluid. This fluid phase separates to form a droplet rich in a macromolecule (B). Chromatin particles are trapped in a harmonic potential to reproduce the coil and globular phases of an isolated polymer chain. We investigate the role of the droplet material B on the radius of gyration of this polymer and find that this radius varies nonmonotonically with respect to the volume fraction of B. This behavior is reminiscent of a phenomenon known as $\textit{co-non-solvency}$: a polymer chain in good solvent (S) may collapse when a second good solvent (here B) is added in low quantity, and expand at higher B concentration. Additionally, the presence of finite-size effects on the coil-globule transition results in a qualitatively different impact of the droplet material on polymers of various sizes. In the context of genetic regulation, our results suggest that the size of chromatin domains and the quantity of condensate proteins are key parameters to control whether chromatin may respond to an increase of the quantity of chromatin-binding proteins by condensing or expanding.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Reward and Size of Groups in the Optional Public Goods Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Optional Public Goods Game is a three-strategy game in which an individual can play as a cooperator or defector or decide not to participate. Despite its simplicity, this model can effectively represent many human social dilemmas, such as those found in the use of public services, environmental concerns, or other activities related to society. In this contribution, we present a comprehensive analysis of the conditions under which spontaneous, sustained cooperation emerges and the characteristics of these cooperative states. Through simulations, we demonstrate the conditions leading to the coexistence of the three strategies in a steady equilibrium or the alternate dominance of each strategy in a rock-paper-scissors fashion. The results identify each of the possible scenarios in terms of two key parameters: the multiplication rate of the public good game (reward) and the size of the group of potential players. We also discuss other details of the game that may influence the appearance of cycles, along with relevant characteristics of these cycles, such as the prevalence of cooperation.</description>

      <title>The zero-sum rock-paper-scissors game with non-exponential waiting times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waiting times between successive events play an important role in population dynamics and can vary widely, notably due to environmental conditions. In this work, we focus on the zero-sum rock-paper-scissors (zRPS) model, broadly used to describe cyclic dominance in ecology and biology, with non-Markovian dynamics and study how its survival and fixation properties are affected by interevent times. When the dynamics are Markovian, with exponentially-distributed waiting times, the fate of zRPS games in large well-mixed populations obeys the simple, yet counterintuitive, ``law of the weakest'': the species with the lowest predation-reproduction rate is the most likely to prevail, with a fixation/survival probability asymptotically approaching one. Here, we systematically study how the fixation/survival behavior is influenced by power-law and gamma waiting time distributions, and analyze the deviations from the law of the weakest. Importantly, we determine the phases of the parameter space in which each species dominates, and how these crucially depend on memory and history-dependent interactions. Analytical calculations, which yield nontrivial memory kernels, support our numerical results, shedding light on the evolutionary influence of long waiting times.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion in the Square Soft Lorentz Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate and analyze anomalous diffusion properties of point-like particles in a two-dimensional system with circular scatterers arranged in a square lattice and governed by smooth potentials, referred to as the square soft Lorentz gas. Our numerical simulations reveal a rich interplay of normal and anomalous diffusion depending on the system parameters. To describe diffusion in normal regimes, we develop a unit cell hopping model that, in the single-hop limit, recovers the Machta-Zwanzig approximation and converges toward the numerical diffusion coefficient as the number of hops increases. Anomalous diffusion is characterized by quasiballistic orbits forming Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser islands in phase space, alongside a complex tongue structure in parameter space defined by the interscatterer distance and potential softness. The distributions of the particle displacement vector show notable similarities to both analytical and numerical results for a hard-wall square Lorentz gas, exhibiting Gaussian behavior in normal diffusion and long tails due to quasiballistic orbits in anomalous regimes. Our work thus provides a catalog of key dynamical system properties that characterize the intricate changes in diffusion when transitioning from hard billiards to soft potentials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking in the Superionic Phase of Silver-Iodide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the superionic phase of silver iodide, we observe a distorted tetragonal structure characterized by symmetry breaking in the cation distribution. This phase competes with the well known bcc phase, with a symmetric cation distribution at an energetic cost of only a few meV/atom. The small energy difference suggests that these competing structures may both be thermally accessible near the superionic transition temperature. We also find that the distribution of silver ions depends on the low-temperature parent polymorph, with memory persisting in the superionic phase on the nanosecond time scales accessible in our simulations. Furthermore, simulations on the order 100ns reveal that even at temperatures where the bcc phase is stable, significant fluctuations toward the tetragonal lattice structure remain. Our results are consistent with many "anomalous" experimental observations and offer a molecular mechanism for the "memory effect" in silver iodide.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Induced Competitive Release in a Meta-Population Model for Range Expansions in Disordered Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare evolutionary events, such as the rise to prominence of deleterious mutations, can have drastic impacts on the evolution of growing populations. Heterogeneous environments can reduce the influence of selection on evolutionary outcomes through various mechanisms, including pinning of genetic lineages and of the population fronts. These effects can play significant roles in enabling competitive release of otherwise trapped mutations. In this work we show that environments containing random arrangements of ``hotspot'' patches, where locally abundant resources enhance growth rates equally for all sub-populations, can give rise to massively enriched deleterious mutant clones through an effective reduction of selection efficacy. A geometrical optics description of mutant bubbles, which result from interactions with hotspots, successfully predicts the increase in mutant survival. This prediction requires no fitting parameters and holds well in scenarios of rare mutations and of adaptation from standing variation. In addition, we find that the influence of environmental noise in shaping the fate of rare mutations is maximal near a percolation transition of overlapping discs, beyond which mutant survival decreases.</description>

Abstract: A pedagogical formulation of Loschmidt's paradox and H-theorem is presented with basic notation on occupancy on discrete states without invoking velocity collision operators. A conjecture, so called H-theorem do-conjecture, is formulated. Causal inference perspective on the dynamical evolution of classical many-particle system is invoked. This perspectice introduce a probabilistic view on the state of the system conditioning on the thermodyamic ensemble, i.e., function of state-variables representing the ensemble. A numerical simulation of random walkers for deterministic diffusion demonstrate the causal effect of interventional ensemble, showing a dynamical behaviour as a test of the proposed conjecture. Moreover, the chosen game like dynamics provides an accessible practical example, named Ising-Conway Entropy Game, in order to demonstrate increase in entropy over time, as a toy system of statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation relations for a few observable currents at their own beat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coarse-grained models are widely used to explain the effective behavior of partially observable physical systems with hidden degrees of freedom. Reduction procedures in state space typically disrupt Markovianity and a fluctuation relation cannot be formulated. A recently developed framework of transition-based coarse-graining gave rise to a fluctuation relation for a single current, while all others are hidden. Here, we extend the treatment to an arbitrary number of observable currents. Crucial for the derivation are the concepts of mixed currents and their conjugated effective affinities, that can be inferred from the time series of observable transitions. We also discuss the connection to generating functions, transient behavior, and how our result recovers the fluctuation relation for a complete set of currents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the time-resolved dynamics of an underdamped harmonic oscillator can be used to do multifunctional computation, performing distinct computations at distinct times within a single dynamical trajectory. We consider the amplitude of an oscillator whose inputs influence its frequency. The activity of the oscillator at fixed time is a nonmonotonic function of its inputs, and so it can solve problems such as XOR that are not linearly separable. The activity of the oscillator at fixed input is a nonmonotonic function of time, and so it is multifunctional in a temporal sense, able to carry out distinct nonlinear computations at distinct times within the same dynamical trajectory. We show that a single oscillator, observed at different times, can act as all of the elementary logic gates and can perform binary addition, the latter usually implemented in hardware using 5 logic gates. We show that a set of $n$ oscillators, observed at different times, can perform an arbitrary number of analog-to-$n$-bit digital conversions. We also show that oscillators can be trained by gradient descent to perform distinct classification tasks at distinct times. Computing with time-dependent functionality can be done in or out of equilibrium, and suggests a way of reducing the number of parameters or devices required to do nonlinear computations.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of extensive many-body Hamiltonians with few-body interactions and a many-body mobility edge: all eigenstates below a nonzero energy density are localized in an exponentially small fraction of "energetically allowed configurations" within Hilbert space. Our construction is based on quantum perturbations to a classical low-density parity check code. In principle, it is possible to detect this eigenstate localization by measuring few-body correlation functions in efficiently preparable mixed states.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum thermodynamics in a non-equilibrium regime: Application to Stirling engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a thermodynamic theory in the non-equilibrium regime, which we describe as a thermodynamic system-bath model [S. Koyanagi and Y. Tanimura, J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{160}, 234112 (2024)]. Based on the dimensionless (DL) minimum work principle, non-equilibrium thermodynamic potentials are expressed in terms of non-equilibrium extensive and intensive variables in time derivative form. This is made possible by incorporating the entropy production rate into the definitions of non-equilibrium thermodynamic potentials. These potentials can be evaluated from the DL non-equilibrium-to-equilibrium minimum work principle, which is derived from the principle of DL minimum work and is equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics. We thus obtain the non-equilibrium Massieu-Planck potentials as entropic potentials and the non-equilibrium Helmholtz-Gibbs potentials as free energies. Unlike fluctuation theorem and stochastic thermodynamics theory, this theory does not require the assumption of a factorized initial condition and is valid in the full quantum regime where the system and bath are quantum mechanically entangled. Our results are numerically verified by simulating a thermostatic Stirling engine consisting of two isothermal processes and two thermostatic processes using the quantum hierarchical Fokker--Planck equations and the classical Kramers equation derived from the thermodynamic system-bath model. We then show that, from weak to strong system-bath interactions, the thermodynamic process can be analyzed using a non-equilibrium work diagram analogous to the equilibrium one for given time-dependent intensive variables. The results can be used to develop efficient heat machines in non-equilibrium regimes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical signatures of discontinuous phase transitions: How phase coexistence determines exponential versus power-law scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding the finite-size scaling of the Liouvillian gap and dynamical fluctuations at discontinuous phase transitions, with various studies reporting either exponential or power-law behavior. We clarify this issue by employing large deviation theory. We distinguish two distinct classes of discontinuous phase transitions that have different dynamical properties. The first class is associated with phase coexistence, i.e., the presence of multiple stable attractors of the system dynamics (e.g., local minima of the free energy functional) in a finite phase diagram region around the phase transition point. In that case, one observes asymptotic exponential scaling related to stochastic switching between attractors (though the onset of exponential scaling may sometimes occur for very large system sizes). In the second class, there is no phase coexistence away from the phase transition point, while at the phase transition point itself there are infinitely many attractors. In that case, one observes power-law scaling related to the diffusive nature of the system relaxation to the stationary state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a computer code for the thermodynamic quantum Fokker-Planck equations (T-QFPE), derived from a thermodynamic system-bath model. This model consists of an anharmonic subsystem coupled to multiple Ohmic baths at different temperatures, which are connected to or disconnected from the subsystem as a function of time. The code numerically integrates the T-QFPE and their classical expression to simulate isothermal, isentropic, thermostatic, and entropic processes in both quantum and classical cases. The accuracy of the results was verified by comparing the analytical solutions of the Brownian oscillator. Additionally, we illustrated a breakdown of the Markovian Lindblad-master equation in the pure quantum regime. As a demonstration, we simulated a thermostatic Stirling engine employed to develop non-equilibrium thermodynamics [S. Koyanagi and Y. Tanimura, J. Chem. Phys 161, 114113 (2024)] under quasi-static conditions. The quasi-static thermodynamic potentials, described as intensive and extensive variables, were depicted as work diagrams. In the classical case, the work done by the external field is independent of the system-bath coupling strength. In contrast, in the quantum case, the work decreases as the coupling strength increases due to quantum entanglement between the subsystem and bath. The codes were developed for multicore processors using Open multiprocessing (OpenMP) and for graphics processing units (GPU) using the Compute United Device Architecture (CUDA). These codes are provided as supplementary materials.</description>

Abstract: Universality and scaling are fundamental concepts in equilibrium continuous phase transitions. Here, we unveil a unique and universal scaling behavior of the critical time in slowly driven dynamical quantum phase transition. Going beyond the analogy with equilibrium phase transition, we find that the critical time exhibits a power-law scaling with quenching rate and the scaling exponent is fully determined by underlining universality class. We explain this unique scaling behavior based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. This universal scaling behavior is verified to be valid not only in noninteracting single-particle system, but also in many-body interacting system, and not only in Hermitian system, but also in non-Hermitian system. Our study unravels a deep and fundamental relationship between dynamical phase transition and equilibrium phase tranition.</description>

Abstract: We study the fluctuations in equilibrium for a dynamics of rods with random length. This includes the classical hard rod elastic collisions, when rod lengths are constant and equal to a positive value. We prove that in the diffusive space-time scaling, an initial fluctuation of density of particles of velocity $v$, after recentering on its Euler evolution, evolve randomly shifted by a Brownian motion of variance $\mathcal D(v)$.</description>

      <title>Fixed-magnetization Ising model with a slowly varying magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motivation for this paper is the analysis of the fixed-density Ising lattice gas in the presence of a gravitational field. This is a seen as a particular instance of an Ising model with a slowly varying magnetic field in the fixed magnetization ensemble. We first characterize the typical magnetization profiles in the regime in which the contribution of the magnetic field competes with the bulk energy term. We then discuss in more detail the particular case of a gravitational field and the arising interfacial phenomena. In particular, we identify the macroscopic profile and propose several conjectures concerning the interface appearing in the phase coexistence regime. The latter are supported by explicit computations in an effective model. Finally, we state some conjectures concerning equilibrium crystal shapes in the presence of a gravitational field, when the latter contributes to the energy only to surface order.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Energy-Conserving Quantum Circuits with XY interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum circuits constructed from $\sqrt{iSWAP}$ gates and, more generally, from the entangling gates that can be realized with the XX+YY interaction alone. Such gates preserve the Hamming weight of states in the computational basis, which means they respect the global U(1) symmetry corresponding to rotations around the z axis. Equivalently, assuming that the intrinsic Hamiltonian of each qubit in the system is the Pauli Z operator, they conserve the total energy of the system. We develop efficient methods for synthesizing circuits realizing any desired energy-conserving unitary using XX+YY interaction with or without single-qubit rotations around the z-axis. Interestingly, implementing generic energy-conserving unitaries, such as CCZ and Fredkin gates, with 2-local energy-conserving gates requires the use of ancilla qubits. When single-qubit rotations around the z-axis are permitted, our scheme requires only a single ancilla qubit, whereas with the XX+YY interaction alone, it requires 2 ancilla qubits. In addition to exact realizations, we also consider approximate realizations and show how a general energy-conserving unitary can be synthesized using only a sequence of $\sqrt{iSWAP}$ gates and 2 ancillary qubits, with arbitrarily small error, which can be bounded via the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Our methods are also applicable for synthesizing energy-conserving unitaries when, rather than the XX+YY interaction, one has access to any other energy-conserving 2-body interaction that is not diagonal in the computational basis, such as the Heisenberg exchange interaction. We briefly discuss the applications of these circuits in the context of quantum computing, quantum thermodynamics, and quantum clocks.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transition in random rod packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04903v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random packings of stiff rods are self-supporting mechanical structures stabilized by long range interactions induced by contacts. To understand the geometrical and topological complexity of the packings, we first deploy X-ray computerized tomography to unveil the structure of the packing. This allows us to directly visualize the spatial variations in density, orientational order and the entanglement, a mesoscopic field that we define in terms of a local average crossing number, a measure of the topological complexity of the packing. We find that increasing the aspect ratio of the constituent rods in a packing leads to a proliferation of regions of strong entanglement that eventually percolate through the system, and correlated with a sharp transition in the mechanical stability of the packing. To corroborate our experimental findings, we use numerical simulations of contacting elastic rods and characterize their stability to static and dynamic loadings. Our experiments and computations lead us to an entanglement phase diagram which we also populate using published experimental data from pneumatically tangled filaments, worm blobs, and bird nests along with additional numerical simulations using these data sets. Together, these show the regimes associated with mechanically stable entanglement as a function of the statistics of the packings and loading, with lessons for a range of systems from reconfigurable architectures and textiles to active morphable filamentous assemblies.</description>

      <title>Nematic Phase of the n-Component Cubic-Spin Spin Glass in d=3: Liquid-Crystal Phase in a Dirty Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nematic phase, previously seen in the d=3 classical Heisenberg spin-glass system, occurs in the n-component cubic-spin spin-glass system, between the low-temperature spin-glass phase and the high temperature disordered phase, for number of components n &gt;= 3, in spatial dimension d=3, thus constituting a liquid-crystal phase in a dirty (quenched-disordered) magnet. This result is obtained from renormalization-group calculations that are exact on the hierarchical lattice and, equivalently, approximate on the cubic spatial lattice. The nematic phase completely intervenes between the spin-glass phase and the disordered phase. The Lyapunov exponents of the spin-glass chaos are calculated from n=1 up to n=12 and show odd-even oscillations with respect to n.</description>

      <title>From Zero to Hero: How local curvature at artless initial conditions leads away from bad minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an analytical study of the evolution of the Hessian during gradient descent dynamics, and relate a transition in its spectral properties to the ability of finding good minima. We focus on the phase retrieval problem as a case study for complex loss landscapes. We first characterize the high-dimensional limit where both the number $M$ and the dimension $N$ of the data are going to infinity at fixed signal-to-noise ratio $\alpha = M/N$. For small $\alpha$, the Hessian is uninformative with respect to the signal. For $\alpha$ larger than a critical value, the Hessian displays at short-times a downward direction pointing towards good minima. While descending, a transition in the spectrum takes place: the direction is lost and the system gets trapped in bad minima. Hence, the local landscape is benign and informative at first, before gradient descent brings the system into a uninformative maze. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we show that this dynamical transition plays a crucial role for finite (even very large) $N$: it allows the system to recover the signal well before the algorithmic threshold corresponding to the $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit. Our analysis sheds light on this new mechanism that facilitates gradient descent dynamics in finite dimensions, and highlights the importance of a good initialization based on spectral properties for optimization in complex high-dimensional landscapes.</description>

      <title>Axial, Planar-Diagonal, Body-Diagonal Fields on the Cubic-Spin Spin Glass in d=3: A Plethora of Ordered Phases under Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nematic phase, previously seen in the d=3 classical Heisenberg spin-glass system, occurs in the n-component cubic-spin spin-glass system, between the low-temperature spin-glass phase and the high-temperature disordered phase, for number of spin components n \geq 3, in spatial dimension d=3, thus constituting a liquid-crystal phase in a dirty (quenched-disordered) magnet. Furthermore, under application of a variety of uniform magnetic fields, a veritable plethora of phases are found. Under uniform magnetic fields, 17 different phases and two spin-glass phase diagram topologies (meaning the occurrences and relative positions of the many phases), qualitatively different from the conventional spin-glass phase diagram topology, are seen. The chaotic rescaling behaviors and their Lyapunov exponents are calculated in each of these spin-glass phase diagram topologies. These results are obtained from renormalization-group calculations that are exact on the d=3 hierarchical lattice and, equivalently, approximate on the cubic spatial lattice. Axial, planar-diagonal, or body-diagonal finite-strength uniform fields are applied to n=2 and 3 component cubic-spin spin-glass systems in d=3.</description>

      <title>Analytical derivation and extension of the anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling in the transverse field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A defect density which quantifies the deviation from the spin ground state characterizes non-equilibrium dynamics during phase transitions. The widely recognized Kibble-Zurek scaling predicts how the defect density evolves during phase transitions. However, it can be perturbed by a noise, leading to the anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling. In this research, we analytically investigate the effect of Gaussian white noise on the transition probabilities of the Landau-Zener model. We apply this analysis to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model and obtain an analytical approximate solution of the defect density. Our analysis reveals that when the introduced noise is small, the model follows the previously known anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling. Conversely, when the noise increases, the scaling can be obtained by using the adiabatic approximation. This result indicates that deriving the anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling does not require solving differential equations, instead, it can be achieved simply by applying the adiabatic approximation. Furthermore, we identify the parameter that minimizes the defect density based on the new scaling, which allows us to verify how effective the already known scaling of the optimized parameter is.</description>

      <title>Electronic thermal resistivity and quasi-particle collision cross-section in semi-metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16984v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron-electron collisions lead to a T-square component in the electrical resistivity of Fermi liquids. The case of liquid $^3$He illustrates that the \textit{thermal} resitivity of a Fermi liquid has a T-square term, expressed in m$\cdot$W$^{-1}$. Its natural units are $\hbar/k_FE_F^2$. Here, we present a high-resolution study of the thermal conductivity in bismuth, employing magnetic field to extract the tiny electronic component of the total thermal conductivity and resolving signals as small as $\approx 60 \mu$K. We find that the electronic thermal resistivity follows a T-square temperature dependence with a prefactor twice larger than the electric T-square prefactor. Adding this information to what has been known for other semi-metals, we find that the prefactor of the T-square thermal resistivity scales with the square of the inverse of the Fermi temperature, implying that the dimensionless fermion-fermion collision cross-section is roughly proportional to the Fermi wavelength, indicating that it is not simply set by the strength of the Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>The superconducting clock-circuit: Improving the coherence of Josephson radiation beyond the thermodynamic uncertainty relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of superconducting electronics, the on-chip generation of AC radiation is essential for further advancements. Although a Josephson junction can emit AC radiation from a purely DC voltage bias, the coherence of this radiation is significantly limited by Johnson-Nyquist noise. We relate this limitation to the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) in the field of stochastic thermodynamics. Recent findings indicate that the thermodynamic uncertainty relation can be broken by a classical pendulum clock. We demonstrate how the violation of the TUR can be used as a design principle for radiation sources by showing that a superconducting clock circuit emits coherent AC radiation from a DC bias.</description>

      <title>Improved models for ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas using quantum phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, it is shown that the improvements can be introduced into the current models of ideal Fermi and ideal gas to take into account the quantum nature of phase space related to the uncertainty principle. The construction of the improved models is based on the use of the concepts of phase space representation of quantum mechanics and quantum phase space that were introduced and developed recently. Hamiltonian operator of a gas particle and its eigenstates are firstly determined and the use of quantum statistical mechanics leads to the deduction of the thermodynamics properties of the ideal gas itself. The explicit expressions of thermodynamic quantities such as the grand canonical potential, the thermodynamic particles number, the internal energy, the Von Neumann entropy and the pressure as well as the state equations, corresponding to the improved models, are established for both bosons and fermions. The corrections introduced by these expressions are expected to be particularly significant at low temperature and for confined volume. They permit in particular to highlight the existence of quantum shape and size effects. It is also shown that the thermodynamics functions and variables are directly related to the momenta quantum statistical variances. Well-known relations corresponding to classical ideal gas model can be retrieved from the improved models as asymptotic limits at high temperature and for large volume.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a stochastically driven non-equilibrium quantum system where the driving protocols consist of hopping and waiting processes. The waiting times between two hopping processes satisfy a heavy-tailed distribution. By calculating the squared width of the wavepackets, our findings demonstrate the emergence of various anomalous transport phenomenons when the system remains unchanged within the heavy-tailed regime, including superdiffusive, subdiffusive, and standard diffusive motion. Only subdiffusion occurs when the system has evolved during the waiting process. All these transport behaviors are accompanied by a breakdown of ergodicity, highlighting the complex dynamics induced by the stochastic driving mechanism.</description>

      <title>Origin of Robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Phases in Stacked Hermitian Systems: Non-Hermitian Level Repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators, which possess a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase, have attracted great attention for two decades. It is generally believed that when an even number of layers of the quantum spin Hall insulators are stacked, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase becomes unstable due to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nature. While the counterexamples of the instability were observed in several literates, there is no systematic understanding. In this work, we provide a systematic understanding that the robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase in a Hermitian system with chiral symmetry against stacking. We clarify that the robustness generally originates from level repulsion in the corresponding non-Hermitian system derived from Hermitization. We demonstrate this by treating a class DIII superconductor in 1D with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology and the corresponding non-Hermitian 1D system in class AII$^\dagger$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topology.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization Study on Avalanches in Many-Body Localized Constrained Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Avalanches are believed to be the mechanism behind the transition from many-body localization to the thermal phase. We utilize spin chains with constraints to study the physics of quantum avalanches by exact diagonalization of disordered systems coupled to a thermal bath. Single-spin observables are used to characterize localization and quantify the influence of the thermal bath on disordered spin chains. Constraints on the Hilbert space confine the dynamics to a subspace, effectively reducing the Hilbert space dimension and enabling the study of larger systems with limited computational resources. We study the PXP model, and in addition, we construct spin chains with constraints by searching for constraints with a genetic algorithm to reach larger system sizes. We define quantities to measure the strength of avalanches and use these to compare different models. We find that avalanches are more pronounced in models with constraints compared to those without constraints. Results from exact diagonalization are compared with those from studying the master equation. We also identify models that exhibit no thermal phases and find stable ergodicity breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stationary measures of last passage percolation with geometric weights and the log-gamma polymer in a strip of the $\mathbb Z^2$ lattice are characterized in arXiv:2306.05983 using variants of Schur and Whittaker processes, called two-layer Gibbs measures. In this article, we prove contour integral formulas characterizing the multipoint joint distribution of two-layer Schur and Whittaker processes. We also express them as Doob transformed Markov processes with explicit transition kernels. As an example of application of our formulas, we compute the growth rate of the KPZ equation on $[0,L]$ with arbitrary boundary parameters.</description>

      <title>Geometric Formula for 2d Ising Zeros: Examples &amp; Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11109</link>

Abstract: A geometric formula for the zeros of the partition function of the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model was recently proposed in terms of the angles of 2d triangulations embedded in the flat 3d space. Here we proceed to an analytical check of this formula on the cubic graph, dual to a double pyramid, and provide a thorough numerical check by generating random 2d planar triangulations. Our method is to generate Delaunay triangulations of the 2-sphere then performing random local rescalings. For every 2d triangulations, we compute the corresponding Ising couplings from the triangle angles and the dihedral angles, and check directly that the Ising partition function vanishes for these couplings (and grows in modulus in their neighborhood). In particular, we lift an ambiguity of the original formula on the sign of the dihedral angles and establish a convention in terms of convexity/concavity. Finally, we extend our numerical analysis to 2d toroidal triangulations and show that the geometric formula does not work and will need to be generalized, as originally expected, in order to accommodate for non-trivial topologies.</description>

      <title>On the topology of solutions to random continuous constraint satisfaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the set of solutions to $M$ random polynomial equations whose $N$ variables are restricted to the $(N-1)$-sphere. Each equation has independent Gaussian coefficients and a target value $V_0$. When solutions exist, they form a manifold. We compute the average Euler characteristic of this manifold in the limit of large $N$, and find different behavior depending on the target value $V_0$, the ratio $\alpha=M/N$, and the variances of the coefficients. We divide this behavior into five phases with different implications for the topology of the solution manifold. When $M=1$ there is a correspondence between this problem and level sets of the energy in the spherical spin glasses. We conjecture that the transition energy dividing two of the topological phases corresponds to the energy asymptotically reached by gradient descent from a random initial condition, possibly resolving an open problem in out-of-equilibrium dynamics.</description>
