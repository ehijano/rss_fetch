      <title>Machine learning discoveries of ASCL2-X synergy in ETC-1922159 treated colorectal cancer cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achaete-scute complex homolog 2 (ASCL2) codes a part of the basic helix-loop-helix (BHLH) transcription factor family. WNTs have been found to directly affect the stemness of the tumor cells via regulation of ASCL2. Switching off the ASCL2 literally blocks the stemness process of the tumor cells and vice versa. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells treated with ETC-1922159, ASCL2 was found to be down regulated along with other genes. A recently developed search engine ranked combinations of ASCL2-X (X, a particular gene/protein) at 2nd order level after drug administration. Some rankings confirm the already tested combinations, while others point to those that are untested/unexplored. These rankings reveal which ASCL2-X combinations might be working synergistically in CRC. In this research work, I cover combinations of ASCL2 with WNT, transforming growth factor beta (TGFB), interleukin (IL), leucine rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor (LGR), NOTCH, solute carrier family (SLC), SRY-box transcription factor (SOX), small nucleolar RNA host gene (SNHG), KIAA, F-box protein (FBXO), family with sequence similarity (FAM), B cell CLL/lymphoma (BCL), autophagy related (ATG) and Rho GTPase activating protein (ARHGAP) family.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling of hydrogel scaffold anisotropy during extrusion-based 3D printing for tissue engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02734v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extrusion-based 3D printing is a widely utilized tool in tissue engineering, offering precise 3D control of bioinks to construct organ-sized biomaterial objects with hierarchically organized cellularized scaffolds. The internal organization of scaffold constituents must replicate the structural anisotropy of the targeted tissue to effectively promote cellular behavior during 3D cell culture. The choice of polymers in the bioink and extrusion process topological properties significantly impact tissue engineering constructs' structural anisotropy and cellular response. Our study employed a hydrogel bioink consisting of fibrinogen, alginate, and gelatin, providing biocompatibility, printability, and shape retention post-printing. Topological properties in flowing polymers are determined by macromolecule conformation, namely orientation and stretch degree. We utilized the micro-macro approach to describe hydrogel macromolecule orientation during extrusion, offering a two-scale fluid behavior description. The study aimed to use the Fokker-Planck equation to represent constituent population (polymer chain) state within a hydrogel's representative elementary volume during extrusion-based 3D printing. Our findings indicate that a high shear rate drives constituent orientation in tubular nozzle syringe setups, overcoming fluid rheological behavior. Additionally, the interaction coefficient (C_i), representing microscopic fluid particle interaction, surpasses hydrogel behavior for constituent orientation prediction. This approach provides an initial but robust framework to model scaffold anisotropy, enabling optimization of the extrusion process while maintaining computational feasibility.</description>
