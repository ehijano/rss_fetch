      <title>Each simple polytope in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has a point with $10$ normals to the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is conjectured since long that for any convex body $P\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ there exists a point in its interior which belongs to at least $2n$ normals from different points on the boundary of $P$. The conjecture is proven for $n=2,3,4$.
  We treat the same problem for convex polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and prove that each generic simple polytope has a point in its interior with $10$ normals to the boundary. This is an exact bound: there exists a tetrahedron with no more than $10$ normals from a point in its interior.</description>

      <title>On lower bounds of the density of planar periodic sets without unit distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the maximal density $m_1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ of planar sets without unit distances is a fundamental problem in combinatorial geometry. This paper investigates lower bounds for this quantity. We introduce a novel approach to estimating $m_1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ by reformulating the problem as a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem on graphs constructed from flat torus, focusing on periodic sets with respect to two non-collinear vectors. Our experimental results supported by theoretical justifications of proposed method demonstrate that for a sufficiently wide range of parameters this approach does not improve the known lower bound $0.22936 \le m_1(\mathbb{R}^2)$. The best discrete sets found are approximations of Croft's construction. In addition, several open source software packages for MIS problem are compared on this task.</description>

      <title>Topological expanders, coarse geometry and thick embeddings of complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify the topological expansion properties of bounded degree simplicial complexes in terms of a family of sublinear functions, in analogy with the separation profile of Benjamini-Schramm-Tim\'ar for classical expansion of bounded degree graphs. We prove that, like the separation profile, these new invariants are monotone under regular maps between complexes satisfying appropriate higher connectivity assumptions. In the dimension $1$ case, we recover the cutwidth profile of Huang-Hume-Kelly-Lam. We also prove the seemingly new result that any $1$-dimensional topological expander necessarily contains a graphical expander.
  In higher dimensions, we give full calculations of these new invariants for Euclidean spaces, which are natural analogues of waist and width-volume inequalities due to Gromov and Guth respectively. We present several other methods of obtaining upper bounds including na\"ive (yet useful) direct product and fibring theorems, and show how lower bounds can be obtained via thick embeddings of complexes, in analogy with previous work of Barrett-Hume. Using this, we find lower bounds for $k$-expansion of $(k+1)$-fold horocyclic products of trees, and for rank $k$ symmetric spaces of non-compact type. As a further application, we prove that for every $k\geq 2$ there is no coarse embedding (and more generally, no regular map) from the $k$-fold horocyclic product of $3$-regular trees to either any product $(\mathbb{H}^2)^{k-2}\times H \times D$ where $\mathbb{H}^2$ is the real hyperbolic plane, $H$ is a bounded degree hyperbolic graph and $D$ is a doubling metric space, or to any symmetric space whose non-compact factor has corank (dimension minus rank) is strictly less than $k$.</description>

      <title>When the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between finite-dimensional space and its subset is finite?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between $\mathbb{R}^n$ and its subset $A$ is finite if and only if $A$ is an $\varepsilon$-net in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$. For infinite-dimensional Euclidean spaces this is not true. The proof is essentially based on upper estimate of the Euclidean Gromov--Hausdorff distance by means of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance.</description>

      <title>Stretch maps on the affine-additive group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define linear and radial stretch maps in the affine-additive group, and prove that they are minimizers of the mean quasiconformal distortion functional. For the proofs we use a method based on the notion of modulus of a curve family and the minimal stretching property (MSP) of the afore-mentioned maps. MSP relies on certain given curve families compatible with the respective geometric settings of the strech maps.</description>

      <title>Preserving curvature lower bounds when Ricci flowing non-smooth initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we survey some results on Ricci flowing non-smooth initial data. Among other things, we give a non-exhaustive list of various weak initial data which can be evolved with the Ricci flow. We also survey results which show that various curvature lower bounds will, possibly up to a constant, be preserved, if we start with such possibly non-smooth initial data. Some proofs/proof sketches are given in certain cases. A list of some open problems related to these areas is given in the last section of the paper.</description>

      <title>Geometric invariants of locally compact groups: the homological perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the homological version of $\Sigma$-theory for locally compact Hausdorff groups, leaving the homotopical version for another paper. Both versions are connected by a Hurewicz-like theorem. They can be thought of as directional versions of type $\mathrm{CP}_m$ and type $\mathrm{C}_m$, respectively. And classical $\Sigma$-theory is recovered if we equip an abstract group with the discrete topology. This paper provides criteria for type $\mathrm{CP}_m$ and homological locally compact $\Sigma^m$. Given a short exact sequence with kernel of type $\mathrm{CP}_m$, we can derive $\Sigma^m$ of the extension on the sphere that vanishes on the kernel from the quotient and likewise. Given a short exact sequence with abelian quotient, $\Sigma$-theory on the extension can tell if the kernel is of type $\mathrm{CP}_m$.</description>
