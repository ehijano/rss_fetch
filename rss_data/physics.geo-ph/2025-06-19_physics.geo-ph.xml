      <title>Forecasting the spatiotemporal evolution of fluid-induced microearthquakes with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model achieves $R^2 &gt;0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 &gt;0.88$ for the 15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate, uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.</description>

      <title>Blended parameterization in an atmospheric model: Improving severestorm ensemble prediction by considering uncertainties in model physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics parameterizations are often needed for numerical weather prediction (NWP) of precipitation forecast. This is mainly because the resolutions of most computational atmospheric models are not fine enough to explicitly resolve sub-grid scale processes associated with precipitation systems. The various options in each physical parameterization scheme introduce model physics uncertainty, leading to variations in simulated precipitation due to differing representations of physical processes. We aim to quantify and reduce uncertainties in severe storm prediction arising from selecting physics parameterization schemes. In this study, we introduced a method called "blended parameterization" in an atmospheric model. This method parameterizes the selection of physical parameterization schemes using weighting parameters. This approach reduces the model selection problem to the optimization of these weighting parameters. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was used to estimate the posterior probability distribution of the weighting parameters. The large computational cost of MCMC was resolved by a surrogate model that efficiently mimics the relationship between weighting parameters and likelihood. Subsequently, the weighting parameters were sampled from the posterior distribution, followed by conducting an ensemble simulation to predict rainfall in Vietnam. Our optimized "blended parameterized" ensemble prediction system outperformed a conventional physical ensemble prediction system similar to that operationally used in Vietnam.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Networks with Fourier Features for Seismic Wavefield Simulation in Time-Domain Nonsmooth Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have great potential for flexibility and effectiveness in forward modeling and inversion of seismic waves. However, coordinate-based neural networks (NNs) commonly suffer from the "spectral bias" pathology, which greatly limits their ability to model high-frequency wave propagation in sharp and complex media. We propose a unified framework of Fourier feature physics-informed neural networks (FF-PINNs) for solving the time-domain wave equations. The proposed framework combines the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) strategy with an independently pre-trained wave velocity surrogate model to mitigate the singularity at the point source. The performance of the activation functions and gradient descent strategies are discussed through ablation experiments. In addition, we evaluate the accuracy comparison of Fourier feature mappings sampled from different families of distributions (Gaussian, Laplace, and uniform). The second-order paraxial approximation-based boundary conditions are incorporated into the loss function as a soft regularizer to eliminate spurious boundary reflections. Through the non-smooth Marmousi and Overthrust model cases, we emphasized the necessity of the absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) constraints. The results of a series of numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method for modeling high-frequency wave propagation in sharp and complex media.</description>

      <title>Realization of a clock-based global height system: A simulation study for Europe and Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chronometric levelling is a novel technique for the realisation of the International Height Reference System (IHRS). A detailed study of this technique is carried out through closed-loop simulations, aiming to unify regional/local height systems (LHS) in Europe and Brazil. Focusing on a unification accuracy of 1 cm, realistic scenarios with various error parameters/vertical datum parameters in LHS and clock observation uncertainties were analysed. The errors associated with local heights raised from datum offsets, local vertical datum alignment discrepancies in latitude and longitude, accumulated tilts depending on the distance from the reference tide gauge and levelling point elevation-dependent offsets were introduced. Clocks achieving a fractional uncertainty of 10^-18 and 10^-17 were assumed in the simulations, considering temporal correlations of clock intrinsic uncertainties, external effects on clock observations such as tidal effects, propagation delay in terms of link uncertainties and presence of outliers. We determine the preferred distributions of clocks in a network for the best estimation of error parameters. The estimation of the error parameters is related to the spatial distribution of the clocks, hence, an optimal setup of placing clocks at the most distant levelling points, reference tide gauges and elevated points is implemented. Further, a configuration of clock distribution is proposed with master clocks and local clocks with reduced links. Taking into consideration all these realistic constraints, a unification accuracy of 1 cm can be obtained. The unified European and Brazilian height systems are further related to the global geoid such that all geoid-related heights achieve an accuracy of 3 cm.</description>
