      <title>Phase transition in a kinetic mean-field game model of inertial self-propelled agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The framework of Mean-field Games (MFGs) is used for modelling the collective dynamics of large populations of non-cooperative decision-making agents. We formulate and analyze a kinetic MFG model for an interacting system of non-cooperative motile agents with inertial dynamics and finite-range interactions, where each agent is minimizing a biologically inspired cost function. By analyzing the associated coupled forward-backward in time system of nonlinear Fokker-Planck and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, we obtain conditions for closed-loop linear stability of the spatially homogeneous MFG equilibrium that corresponds to an ordered state with non-zero mean speed. Using a combination of analysis and numerical simulations, we show that when energetic cost of control is reduced below a critical value, this equilibrium loses stability, and the system transitions to a travelling wave solution. Our work provides a game-theoretic perspective to the problem of collective motion in non-equilibrium biological and bio-inspired systems.</description>

      <title>Coevolutionary game dynamics with localized environmental resource feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic environments shape diverse dynamics in evolutionary game systems. We introduce spatial heterogeneity of resources into the Prisoner's Dilemma Game model to explore the co-evolution of individuals' strategies and environmental resources. The adequacy of resources significantly affects the survival competitiveness of surrounding individuals. Feedback between individuals' strategies and the resources they can use leads to the dynamic of the "oscillatory tragedy of the commons". Our findings indicate that when the influence of individuals' strategies on the update rate of resources is significantly high, individuals can form sustained spatial clustered patterns. These sustained patterns can directly trigger a transition in the system from the persistent periodic oscillating state to an equilibrium state. These findings align with observed phenomena in real ecosystems, where organisms organize their spatial structures to maintain system stability. We discuss critical phenomena in detail, demonstrating that the aforementioned phase transition is robust across various system parameters including: the strength of cooperators in restoring the environment, the initial distributions of cooperators, and noise.</description>
