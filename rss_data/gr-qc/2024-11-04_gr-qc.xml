      <title>Cosmic observation of a model in the horizon of $ f(Q, C) $-gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a cosmological model in $ f(Q, C) $ gravity within the framework of symmetric teleparallel geometry. In addition to the non-metricity scalar $Q $, our formulation includes the boundary term $ C $, which accounts for its deviation from the standard Levi-Civita Ricci scalar $ R^* $ in the Lagrangian. We derive the field equations for the metric and affine connection, employ them within a cosmological setting, and a vanishing affine connection to derive modified Friedmann equations. We use the latest observational dataset OHD in the redshift range $ z \in [0, 2.36]$, Pantheon + SH0ES in the redshift range $ z \in (0.01, 2.26)$, BAO, and the joint datasets OHD + Pantheon + SH0ES and OHD + Pantheon + SH0ES + BAO to constrain the model parameters of our model by employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to minimize the $\chi^2$ term. Using the constrained free model parameters we examine the behaviour of different physical parameters of the model and notice that the model transits from deceleration to acceleration. Finally, we observe that the model demonstrates an expanding quintessence dark energy model and converges to the $ \Lambda $CDM in later times.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the $H^2 + H^{-2}$ Dark Energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduced a phenomenological dark energy model $H^{2}+H^{-2}$ model) that incorporates the first-order approximation of Kaniadakis holographic entropy dark energy and utilizes the Hubble horizon, $1/H$ as the infrared cutoff. The advantage of this model is that it can relieve the Hubble tension issue and cicumventing the potential issue of a "big rip". In this article, we will study the thermodynamics of the model and obtain the corrected temperature. In addition, we found that the model modified the entropy area relationship by adding an area cubic term in addition to the area term.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the scalar field potential in non-metricity gravity through Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the universe has been widely confirmed, posing challenges to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, particularly the cosmological coincidence problem. This has motivated the exploration of modified gravity theories, including non-metricity gravity, which explains cosmic acceleration without dark energy. In this work, we incorporate a quintessence scalar field into the non-metricity framework to model both inflation and late-time acceleration. Employing the Gaussian process method with a square exponential kernel, we reconstruct the scalar field potential, $V(\phi)$, from observational Hubble data sets coming from cosmic chronometers (CC) as well as from the method of radial baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in a model-independent approach. This approach allows us to obtain a suitable quintessence scalar field model that aligns with the observational Hubble data under the framework of power-law non-metricity gravity. Additionally, we compare our reconstructed potential with power-law scalar field potentials, revealing that these models show better agreement with the observational data, providing new insights into the dynamics of the universe. In contrast, we find that the early dark energy has minimal effect on the present-time accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some well-known metrics used as models of static non-rotating black holes are considered. These are the Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter, Bardeen-Kiselev and McVittie models. A significant difference between them in how adequately they can describe or be the basis for describing observed astronomical objects is demonstrated. A simple method for constructing new models of static non-rotating black holes is presented. It has been shown that a region of gravitational repulsion may exist around the horizon of a Bardeen-Kiselev black hole.</description>

      <title>Orbital eccentricity in general relativity from catastrophe theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the orbital eccentricity is a key feature of the gravitational two-body problem, providing an unambiguous definition in General Relativity poses significant challenges. Despite such foundational issue, the eccentricity of binary black holes has important implications in gravitational-wave astronomy. We present a novel approach to consistently define the orbital eccentricity in General Relativity, grounded in the mathematical field of catastrophe theory. Specifically, we identify the presence of catastrophes -- i.e., breakdowns of the stationary-phase approximation -- in numerical-relativity waveforms and exploit them to develop a robust and fully gauge-invariant estimator of the eccentricity. Our procedure does not require orbital fitting and naturally satisfies the Newtonian limit. We extract gauge-free eccentricity estimates from about 100 numerical-relativity simulations and find that the resulting values are systematically lower compared to those reported alongside the simulations themselves.</description>

      <title>Accreting Black Holes radiate classical Vaidya radiation to pave way for Hawking radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that locally defined marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS) is null and coincident with the event horizon of an unperturbed static Schwarzschild black hole. This is however not true for an accreting black hole for which MOTS separates out and turns spacelike. In this letter, we obtain the necessary and sufficient condition for MOTS to remain null and coincident with the event horizon even when matter is continuously accreting on. This also has an important bearing on the quantum Hawking radiation which is supposed to emanate from the MOTS, and it cannot propagate out to infinity unless MOTS is null. The condition is, infalling timelike Type I fluid should turn null or Type II, as it falls on the horizon. This transition from timelike to null is caused by the tidal deformation of the infalling fluid, and that produces an outward directed heat flux giving rise to Vaidya radiation emanating out of the boundary of accreting zone. We thus predict a remarkable new phenomena that accreting black hole radiates classical Vaidya radiation that paves the way for the Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Matter-Dark Energy Transition: A Dynamical Systems Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we deviate from the traditional examination of the evolving universe through the scale factor and instead consider a parameter \(\chi_{ME}\), defined by the ratio of two competing energy densities: matter (DM) and dynamic dark energy (DDE). While the scale factor's role is not neglected, it is inherently embedded within the evolution equations of these competing energy densities. By employing dynamical systems techniques, we investigate the behaviour of this ratio \(\chi_{ME}\) to understand the dynamics surrounding the cosmological transition from matter domination to dark energy domination. This methodological shift allows for a more nuanced analysis of the matter-to-dark energy transition.</description>

      <title>Null geodesics in extremal Kerr-Newman black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the null geodesics in the extremal Kerr-Newman exterior. We clarify the roots of the radial potential and obtain the parameter space of the azimuthal angular momentum and the Carter constant of the light rays for varieties of the orbits. It is known that one of the unique features of extremal black holes for the null geodesics is the existence of the stable double root at the horizon, giving rise to the stable spherical motion. For the black hole's spin $a&lt;M/2$, the stable double root is isolated from the unstable one. However, for $ a\ge M/2$, the unstable and stable double roots merge at the triple root so that the unstable double root in some parameter region can lie at the horizon, giving a very different shape to the light ring. We then find the analytical expressions of light orbits, which can reach spatial infinity for both non-equatorial and equatorial motions. In particular, for the orbits starting from the near horizon of the extremal Kerr-Newman black holes (NHEKN) with the parameters for the unstable double and triple roots, the solutions are remarkably simple in terms of elementary functions. It is also found that the analytical solutions of the equatorial motion can shed light on the deflection of the light by black holes. Varying the azimuthal angular momentum, as either the double or triple root at the horizon is approached from the turning point, the stronger power-law divergence in the deflection angle is found in comparison with the typical logarithmic divergence in non-extremal black holes in the strong deflection limit (SDL). This could be another interesting effect of light deflection by extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>In Search of Cosmic Time: Complete Observables and the Clock Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper consider a new and deeply challenging face of the problem of time in the context of cosmology drawing on the work of Thiemann (2006). Thiemann argues for a radical response to cosmic problem of time that requires us to modify the classical Friedmann equations. By contrast, we offer a conservative proposal for solution of the problem by bringing together ideas from the contemporary literature regarding reference frames (Bamonti 2023; Bamonti and Gomes 2024), complete observables (Gryb and Th\'ebault 2016, 2023), and the model-based account of time measurement (Tal 2016). On our approach, we must reinterpret our criteria of observability in light of the clock hypothesis and the model-based account of measurement in order to preserve the Friedmann equations as the dynamical equations for the universe.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Motion of Test Particles around the Scalar Hairy Black Holes with Asymmetric Vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An asymptotically flat hairy black hole (HBH) can exhibit distinct characteristics when compared to the Schwarzschild black hole, due to the evasion of no-hair theorem by minimally coupling the Einstein gravity with a scalar potential which possesses asymmetric vacua, i.e, a false vacuum $(\phi=0)$ and a true vacuum $(\phi=\phi_1)$. In this paper, we investigate the geodesic motion of both massive test particles and photons in the vicinity of HBH with $\phi_1=0.5$ and $\phi_1=1.0$ by analyzing their effective potentials derived from the geodesic equation. By fixing $\phi_1$, the effective potential of a massive test particle increases monotonically when its angular momentum $L$ is very small. When $L$ increases to a critical value, the effective potential possesses an inflection point which is known as the innermost stable of circular orbit (ISCO), where the test particle can still remain stable in a circular orbit with a minimal radius without being absorbed by the HBH or fleeing to infinity. Beyond the critical value of $L$, the effective potential possesses a local minimum and a local maximum, indicating the existence of unstable and stable circular orbits, respectively. Moreover, the HBH possesses an unstable photon sphere but its location slightly deviates from the Schwarzschild black hole. The trajectories of null geodesics in the vicinity of HBH can also be classified into three types, which are the direct, lensing and photon sphere, based on the deflection angle of light, but the values of impact parameters can vary significantly than the Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>Is there a dynamical tendency in H0 with late time measurements?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrepancy between the Hubble constant $H_0$ values derived from early-time and late-time measurements, reaching up to $4\sigma$, represents the most serious challenge in modern cosmology and astrophysics. In this work, we investigate if a similar tension exists between only late time measurements at different redshifts. We use the latest public datasets including Cosmic Chronometers, Megamasers, SNe Ia and DESI-BAO, that span from redshift $z \sim 0$ up to $z\sim 2.3$. By dividing the data into redshift bins, we derive $H_0$ values from each bin separately. Our analysis reveals a phenomenological dynamic evolution in $H_0$ across different redshift ranges, with a significance from $1.5\sigma$ and $2.3\sigma$, depending on the parameterization. Consistency of the model demands observational constancy of $H_0$ since it is an integration constant within the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Thus, these findings suggest that the observed Hubble tension might not only exist between early and late-time measurements but also among late-time data themselves, providing new insights into the nature of the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>A Universal Quantum Computer From Relativistic Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an explicit construction of a relativistic quantum computing architecture using a variational quantum circuit approach that is shown to allow for universal quantum computing. The variational quantum circuit consists of tunable single-qubit rotations and entangling gates that are implemented successively. The single qubit rotations are parameterized by the proper time intervals of the qubits' trajectories and can be tuned by varying their relativistic motion in spacetime. The entangling layer is mediated by a relativistic quantum field instead of through direct coupling between the qubits. Within this setting, we give a prescription for how to use quantum field-mediated entanglement and manipulation of the relativistic motion of qubits to obtain a universal gate set, for which compact non-perturbative expressions that are valid for general spacetimes are also obtained. We also derive a lower bound on the channel fidelity that shows the existence of parameter regimes in which all entangling operations are effectively unitary, despite the noise generated from the presence of a mediating quantum field. Finally, we consider an explicit implementation of the quantum Fourier transform with relativistic qubits.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike a classical charged bosonic field, a classical charged fermion field on a static charged black hole does not exhibit superradiant scattering. We demonstrate that the quantum analogue of this classical process is however present. We construct a vacuum state for the fermion field which has no incoming particles from past null infinity, but which contains, at future null infinity, a nonthermal flux of particles. This state describes both the discharge and energy loss of the black hole, and we analyze how the interpretation of this phenomenon depends on the ambiguities inherent in defining the quantum vacuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pursue a generalization isometries and Killing equations to N=1 4D supergravity. Continuous symmetries of spacetime such as spatial homogeneity and isotropy are defined in terms of Killing vectors. In supergravity, the metric, or rather the tetrad, is not a standalone entity, but is part of a multiplet containing also the Rarita-Schwinger spinor-vector and some auxiliary fields. Starting with a superfield generalization of the isometry definition in tetrad form, we derive two extensions of the Killing equations for the whole supergravity multiplet; for spatial isotropy, the first one yields a vanishing spinor-vector, whereas the second one admits a nonzero solution by a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ truncation of the Rarita-Schwinger field.</description>

Abstract: Spinor bilinears of generalized spinors and their properties are investigated. Generalized Killing and twistor spinor equations are considered and their relations to the equations satisfied by special types of differential forms are found. Killing equation in generalized geometry is written in terms of the generalized covariant derivative and Killing-Yano forms are described in the framework of generalized geometry. Construction of generalized Killing-Yano forms and generalized closed conformal Killing-Yano forms in terms of the spinor bilinears of generalized Killing spinors are determined.</description>

      <title>The shape of the Chameleon fifth-force on the mass components of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of Chameleon gravity, we present a semi-analytical solution of the chameleon field profile in accurately modelled galaxy cluster's mass components, namely: the stellar mass of the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG), the baryonic mass in galaxies (other than the BCG), the mass of the Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) and the diffuse cold dark matter (CDM). The obtained semi-analytic profile is validated against the numerical solution of the chameleon field equation and implemented in the \textsc{MG-MAMPOSSt} code for kinematic analyses of galaxy clusters in modified gravity scenarios. By means of mock halos, simulated both in GR and in modified gravity, we show that the combination of velocities and positions of cluster member galaxies, along with data of the stellar velocity dispersion profile of the BCG, can impose constraints on the parameter space of the Chameleon model; for a cluster generated in GR, these constraints are at the same level as a joint lensing+kinematics analysis of a cluster modelled with a single mass profile, without the BCG data.</description>

      <title>Bekenstein bound on black hole entropy in non-Gaussian statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bekenstein bound, inspired by the physics of black holes, is introduced to constrain the entropy growth of a physical system down to the quantum level in the context of a generalized second law of thermodynamics. We first show that the standard Bekenstein bound is violated when the entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole is described in non-Gaussian statistics Barrow, Tsallis, and Kaniadakis due to the presence of the related indices $\Delta$, $q$ and $\kappa$, respectively. Then, by adding the GUP effects into the Bekenstein bound, we find that the generalized bound is satisfied in the context of the mentioned entropies through a possible connection between the entropies indices and the GUP parameter $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Second-order Gravitational Waves in Axion-like Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a hybrid inflation model driven by an axion-like particle (ALP) $\phi$. The model predicts a spectral index $n_s \simeq 0.964$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 0.003$, in agreement with Planck data and potentially testable by next generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments such as CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD. We find that the PBH mass and the peak of the associated scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) spectrum are correlated with the ALP mass. In particular, PBHs in the mass range $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$ can constitute either the entire dark matter (DM) content of the universe or a significant fraction of it. The predicted second-order GWs from this mechanism are within the sensitivity reach of future observatories like LISA and ET. The typical reheating temperature in the model is around $10^6 - 10^7$ GeV is consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints.</description>

Abstract: General theory of relativity can be equivalently formulated on a flat space-time associating a torsion-free affine connection of non-vanishing non-metricity scalar $Q$. In this paper, we present an extension of this, viz., the $f(Q)$ theory of gravity, and explore the early evolution of the universe in the background of anisotropic Bianchi-I model. The $f(Q)$ theory in the current setting through its geometric modification is quite successful in explaining the late time accelerated expansion. Here we note that it accommodates latest released constraints on the inflationary parameters by Planck's collaboration group with excellent precession, but fails to produce a viable decelerated expansion in the radiation dominated era.</description>

      <title>Rapid identification of time-frequency domain gravitational wave signals from binary black holes using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in deep learning techniques have offered an alternative and complementary approach to traditional matched filtering methods for the identification of gravitational wave (GW) signals. The rapid and accurate identification of GW signals is crucial for the progress of GW physics and multi-messenger astronomy, particularly in light of the upcoming fourth and fifth observing runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. In this work, we use the 2D U-Net algorithm to identify the time-frequency domain GW signals from stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) mergers. We simulate BBH mergers with component masses from 5 to 80 $M_{\odot}$ and account for the LIGO detector noise. We find that the GW events in the first and second observation runs could all be clearly and rapidly identified. For the third observing run, about $80\%$ GW events could be identified. In particular, GW190814, currently unknown, is a special case that can be identified by the network, while other binary neutron star mergers and neutron star-black hole mergers can not be identified. Compared to the traditional convolutional neural network, the U-Net algorithm can output the time-frequency domain signal images rather than probabilities, providing a more intuitive investigation. Moreover, some of the results through U-Net can provide preliminary inference on the chirp mass information. In conclusion, the U-Net algorithm can rapidly identify the time-frequency domain GW signals from BBH mergers and potentially be helpful for future parameter inferences.</description>

      <title>Destroying the Event Horizon of Cold Dark Matter-Black Hole System</title>

Abstract: Since the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture was proposed, research on this conjecture has been ongoing. This paper explores the conjecture in black holes that are closer to those existing in the real universe (i.e., rotating black holes enveloped by dark matter). In this paper, we obtained a first-order corrected analytical solution for the black hole event horizon through an approximate solution. The validity of the first-order corrected analytical solution will be provided in the appendix. We conduct our study by introducing a test particle and a scalar field into the black hole. Our conclusions show that, in extremal case, both a test particle and a scalar field can disrupt the event horizon of the Kerr-like black hole; in near-extremal case, both a test particle and a scalar field can disrupt the event horizon of the Kerr-like black hole. When cold dark matter is not considered, the conclusion is consistent with previous research.</description>

      <title>Implementation of a GHZ-Teukolsky puncture scheme for gravitational self-force calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-adiabatic models of extreme- and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals will require calculations of second-order gravitational self-force effects in the spacetime of a spinning, Kerr black hole. We take a step toward such calculations by implementing the recently formulated Teukolsky puncture scheme with Green-Hollands-Zimmerman metric reconstruction [CQG 39, 015019 (2022)]. This scheme eliminates the critical obstacle of gauge singularities that arise in the standard no-string metric reconstruction. Our first proof-of-principle implementation is limited to the simple case of circular orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime, but the method also applies to generic orbits on a Kerr background. We conclude with a discussion of various approaches to the second-order self-force problem in Kerr.</description>

Abstract: The torsion of spacetime, if exists, plays an important role at the very early universe when the spin density of particles was very high. It is generally believed that in extremely high energies of the early universe a new physics called trans-Planckian physics should be considered. Since the initial conditions for inflation are probably a result of this new physics, here we consider spin and torsion as trans- Planckian effects and analyze their influence on the power spectrum of scalar and tensor perturbations at the end of the inflationary era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most self-force calculations rely, in one way or another, on representations of a particle's Detweiler- Whiting singular field. We present a simple method of calculating the singular field to high order in a local expansion in powers of distance from the particle. As a demonstration, we compute the singular field to 14th order in distance, 10 orders beyond the previous state of the art, in the simple case of a scalar charge in circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. We provide the result in both a 4-dimensional form and a decomposed form suitable for use in an m-mode puncture scheme. Our method should have applications in overcoming bottlenecks in current self-force calculations at both first and second order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Self-force framework for transition-to-plunge waveforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact binaries with asymmetric mass ratios are key expected sources for next-generation gravitational wave detectors. Gravitational self-force theory has been successful in producing post-adiabatic waveforms that describe the quasi-circular inspiral around a non-spinning black hole with sub-radian accuracy, in remarkable agreement with numerical relativity simulations. Current inspiral models, however, break down at the innermost stable circular orbit, missing part of the waveform as the secondary body transitions to a plunge into the black hole. In this work we derive the transition-to-plunge expansion within a multiscale framework and asymptotically match its early-time behaviour with the late inspiral. Our multiscale formulation facilitates rapid generation of waveforms: we build second post-leading transition-to-plunge waveforms, named 2PLT waveforms. Although our numerical results are limited to low perturbative orders, our framework contains the analytic tools for building higher-order waveforms consistent with post-adiabatic inspirals, once all the necessary numerical self-force data becomes available. We validate our framework by comparing against numerical relativity simulations, surrogate models and the effective one-body approach.</description>

Abstract: We compare light propagation through an intense electromagnetic background as described by three different nonlinear electrodynamics: Born-Infeld (BI), Euler-Heisenberg (EH), and Modified Maxwell (MM). We use the concept of effective metric to determine the phase velocities of a propagating wave from the BI and EH nonlinear electrodynamics and use them to set constraints on the MM nonlinear parameter. In a second part of the paper, we consider the black hole solutions of the nonlinear electrodynamics coupled with General Relativity and determine the shadows cast by the static black holes. Confronting the observations of the shadows of M87$^*$ and Sagittarius A$^*$ with our theoretical results allows us to set restrictions on the nonlinear parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was shown recently that extended black hole thermodynamics, where the cosmological constant is a dynamical variable, giving rise to a pressure $p$ and its conjugate volume $V$, can be given a natural setting in the context of braneworld models. We study the specific heat capacities $C_p(T)$ and $C_V(T)$ of the quantum version of the BTZ black hole that lives in the induced gravity theory on the brane. There are multiple branches of solutions, and we explore and characterize key features of the possible behaviour. We identify and study a critical point in the space of solutions where both specific heats diverge. In the regime of weak backreaction where we a close to an ordinary theory of gravity, the black hole is "sub-entropic", but as backreaction is increased we note that there are parts of parameter space that has regions where it is "super-entropic". While a study of the sign of the specific heats does not always show a corresponding instability (conjectured in the literature), the presence of strong backreaction makes interpretation unclear.</description>

Abstract: Any non-trivial scattering with massless fields in four spacetime dimensions will generically produce an out-state with memory. Scattering with any massless fields violates the standard assumption of asymptotic completeness -- that all "in" and "out" states lie in the standard (zero memory) Fock space -- and therefore leads to infrared (IR) divergences in the standard $S$-matrix amplitudes. In this paper we define an infrared finite scattering theory which assumes only (1) the existence of in/out algebras and (2) that Heisenberg evolution is an automorphism of these algebras. The resulting "superscattering" map $\$$ allows for transitions between different in/out memory states and agrees with the standard $S$-matrix when it is defined. We construct $\$$-amplitudes by defining (3) a "generalized asymptotic completeness" which accommodates states with memory in the space of asymptotic states and (4) a complete basis of improper states which generalize the usual $n$-particle momentum basis to account for states with memory. Using only general properties of $\$$, we prove an analog of the Weinberg soft theorems in quantum gravity and QED which imply that all $\$$-amplitudes are well-defined in the infrared. We comment on how one must generalize this framework to consider $\$$-amplitudes for theories with collinear divergences (e.g., massless QED and Yang-Mills theories).</description>

Abstract: The spectral collocation method (SCM) exhibits a clear superiority in solving ordinary and partial differential equations compared to conventional techniques, such as finite difference and finite element methods. This makes SCM a powerful tool for addressing the Schr\"odinger-like equations with boundary conditions in physics. However, the Chebyshev differential matrix (CDM), commonly used in SCM to replace the differential operator, is not Hermitian but pseudo-Hermitian. This non-Hermiticity subtly affects the pseudospectra and leads to a loss of completeness in the eigenstates. Consequently, several issues arise with these eigenstates. In this paper, we revisit the non-Hermitian Liouville quantum mechanics by emphasizing the pseudo-Hermiticity of the CDM and explore its expanded models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spectral instability can be influenced by the compactification parameter.</description>
