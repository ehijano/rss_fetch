      <title>Convergence of Pivoted Cholesky Algorithm for Lipschitz Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the continuous analogue of the Cholesky factorization, namely the pivoted Cholesky algorithm. Our analysis establishes quantitative convergence guarantees for kernels of minimal smoothness. We prove that for a symmetric positive definite Lipschitz continuous kernel $K:\Omega\times \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ on a compact domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, the residual of the Cholesky algorithm with any pivoting strategy is uniformly bounded above by a constant multiple of the fill distance of pivots. In particular, our result implies that under complete pivoting (where the maximum value of the diagonal of the residual is selected as the next pivot): \begin{equation*}
  \|R_n\|_{\infty} = \mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d}), \end{equation*} where $R_n$ is the residual after $n$ Cholesky steps and $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ is the absolute maximum value of $R_n$. Moreover, if $K$ is differentiable in both variables with a Lipschitz derivative, our convergence rate improves to $\mathcal{O}(n^{-2/d})$. Our result closes a gap between theory and practice as previous analyses required $C^2$-regularity of $K$ to establish convergence, whereas empirical evidence indicated robust performance even for non-differentiable kernels. We further detail how our convergence results propagate to downstream applications, including discrete analogues, Gaussian process regression, and the P-greedy interpolation method.</description>

      <title>p-multigrid method for the discontinuous Galerkin discretization of elliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a $W$-cycle $p$-multigrid method for solving the $p$-version symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (SIPDG) discretization of elliptic problems. This SIPDG discretization employs hierarchical Legendre polynomial basis functions. Inspired by the uniform convergence theory of the $W$-cycle $hp$-multigrid method in [P. F. Antonietti, et al., SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 53 (2015)], we provide a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed $p$-multigrid method, considering both inherited and non-inherited bilinear forms of SIPDG discretization. Our theoretical results show significant improvement over [P. F. Antonietti, et al., SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 53 (2015)], reducing the required number of smoothing steps from $O(p^2)$ to $O(p)$, where $p$ is the polynomial degree of the discrete broken polynomial space. Moreover, the convergence rate remains independent of the mesh size. Several numerical experiments are presented to verify our theoretical findings. Finally, we numerically verify the effectiveness of the $p$-multigrid method for unfitted finite element discretization in solving elliptic interface problems on general $C^{2} $-smooth interfaces.</description>

      <title>Semi-Discrete in Time Method for Time-Dependent Equations by Random Neural Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network-based solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have attracted considerable attention, yet they often face challenges in accuracy and computational efficiency. In this work, we focus on time-dependent PDEs and observe that coupling space and time in a single network can increase the difficulty of approximation. To address this, we propose a semi-discrete in time method (SDTM) which leverages classical numerical time integrators and random neural basis (RNB). Additional adaptive operations are introduced to enhance the network's ability to capture features across scales to ensure uniform approximation accuracy for multi-scale PDEs. Numerical experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and confirm the convergence of the temporal integrator as well as the network's approximation performance.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Importance Sampling for Estimating Occupation Time for SDE Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study considers the estimation of the complementary cumulative distribution function of the occupation time (i.e., the time spent below a threshold) for a process governed by a stochastic differential equation. The focus is on the right tail, where the underlying event becomes rare, and using variance reduction techniques is essential to obtain computationally efficient estimates. Building on recent developments that relate importance sampling (IS) to stochastic optimal control, this work develops an optimal single level IS (SLIS) estimator based on the solution of an auxiliary Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation (PDE). The cost of solving the HJB-PDE is incorporated into the total computational work, and an optimized trade off between preprocessing and sampling is proposed to minimize the overall cost. The SLIS approach is extended to the multilevel setting to enhance efficiency, yielding a multilevel IS (MLIS) estimator. A necessary and sufficient condition under which the MLIS method outperforms the SLIS method is established, and a common likelihood MLIS formulation is introduced that satisfies this condition under appropriate regularity assumptions. The classical multilevel Monte Carlo complexity theory can be extended to accommodate settings where the single-level variance varies with the discretization level. As a special case, the variance-decay behavior observed in the IS framework stems from the zero variance property of the optimal control. Notably, the total work complexity of MLIS can be better than an order of two. Numerical experiments in the context of fade duration estimation demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach and validate these theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Low-rank approximation of analytic kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many algorithms in scientific computing and data science take advantage of low-rank approximation of matrices and kernels, and understanding why nearly-low-rank structure occurs is essential for their analysis and further development. This paper provides a framework for bounding the best low-rank approximation error of matrices arising from samples of a kernel that is analytically continuable in one of its variables to an open region of the complex plane. Elegantly, the low-rank approximations used in the proof are computable by rational interpolation using the roots and poles of Zolotarev rational functions, leading to a fast algorithm for their construction.</description>

      <title>Mixed finite element projection methods for the unsteady Brinkman equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $H(\text{div})$-conforming mixed finite element methods for the unsteady Brinkman equations for incompressible single-phase flow with fixed in space porous solid inclusions. We employ a projection scheme with incremental pressure correction, which requires at each time step the solution of a predictor and a projection problem. The predictor problem, which uses a stress-velocity mixed formulation, accounts for the viscous effects, while the projection problem, which is based on a velocity-pressure mixed formulation, accounts for the incompressibility. The spatial discretization is based on the Raviart-Thomas or Brezzi-Douglas-Marini mixed finite element spaces on simplicial grids. The velocity computed at the end of each time step is pointwise divergence-free. Unconditional stability of the fully-discrete scheme and first order in time accuracy are established. Due the $H$(div)-conformity of the formulation, the methods are robust in both the Stokes and the Darcy regimes. In the specific code implementation, we discretize the computational domain using generally unstructured triangular (in 2D) and tetrahedral (in 3D) grids, and we use the Raviart--Thomas space $RT_1$, applying a second order multipoint flux mixed finite element scheme with a quadrature rule that samples the flux degrees of freedom. In the predictor problem this allows for a local elimination of the viscous stress and results in element-based symmetric and positive definite systems for each velocity component with $\left(d+1\right)$ degrees of freedom per simplex (where $d$ is the dimension of the problem). In a similar way, we locally eliminate the corrected velocity in the projection problem, and solve an element-based system for the pressure. A series of challenging numerical experiments is presented to verify the convergence and performance of the proposed scheme</description>

      <title>A numerical scheme for a fully nonlinear free boundary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method to approximate viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear free transmission problems. The method discretises a two-layer regularisation of a PDE, involving a functional and a vanishing parameter. The former is handled via a fixed-point argument. We then prove that the numerical method converges to a one-parameter regularisation of the free boundary problem. Regularity estimates enable us to take the vanishing limit of such a parameter and recover a viscosity solution of the free transmission problem. Our main contribution is the design of a computational strategy, based on fixed-point arguments and approximated problems, to solve fully nonlinear free boundary models. We finish the paper with two numerical examples to validate our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate calculation of electronic potential energy surfaces for ground and excited states is crucial for understanding photochemical processes, particularly near conical intersections. While classical methods are limited by scaling and quantum algorithms by hardware, this thesis focuses on the State-Averaged Orbital-Optimized Variational Quantum Eigensolver (SA-OO-VQE). This hybrid quantum-classical algorithm provides a balanced description of multiple electronic states by combining quantum state preparation with classical state-averaged orbital optimization.
  A key contribution is the implementation and evaluation of the Differential Evolution algorithm within the SA-OO-VQE framework, with a comparative study against classical optimizers like the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) and Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithms. The performance of these optimizers is assessed by calculating ground and first excited state energies for H$_2$, H$_4$, and LiH.
  The thesis also demonstrates SA-OO-VQE's capability to accurately model potential energy surfaces near conical intersections, using formaldimine as a case study. The results show that orbital optimization is essential for correctly capturing the potential energy surface topology, a task where standard methods with fixed orbitals fail. Our findings indicate that while Differential Evolution presents efficiency challenges, gradient-based methods like BFGS and SLSQP offer superior performance, confirming that the SA-OO-VQE approach is crucial for treating complex electronic structures.</description>

      <title>Rare Event Simulation of Quantum Error-Correcting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a practical approach for accessing the logical failure rates of quantum error-correcting (QEC) circuits under low physical (component) failure rate regimes. Standard Monte Carlo is often the de facto approach for studying the failure rates of quantum circuits. However, in the study of fault-tolerant error-correcting circuits, the ability to extend this approach to low physical failure rates is limited. In particular, the use of Monte Carlo to access circuits that are relatively large or have high correcting power becomes more difficult as we lower the input failure rates of the individual components (gates) in the circuit. For these reasons, many simulations studying the circuit model go no lower than end-to-end logical failure rates in the 10^{-6} regime. In this report, we outline an approach that borrows from earlier work by Bravyi and Vargo to the more complex circuit noise model. Earlier works studied both the capacity and phenomenological noise models, but the work is insufficient for generating similar simulations in the circuit-noise model. To the best of our knowledge, our team is the first to develop a full prescription of the rare event simulation by splitting technique for the circuit-based noise model. We have also generated promising results that are confirmed by standard Monte Carlo simulation under an accessible regime. This work shows that we can access noise in the circuit-model prescription of quantum error-correcting code to failure rates below 10^{-20} regime.</description>

      <title>A Conformal Prediction Framework for Uncertainty Quantification in Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving PDEs, yet existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches for PINNs generally lack rigorous statistical guarantees. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a distribution-free conformal prediction (CP) framework for UQ in PINNs. This framework calibrates prediction intervals by constructing nonconformity scores on a calibration set, thereby yielding distribution-free uncertainty estimates with rigorous finite-sample coverage guarantees for PINNs. To handle spatial heteroskedasticity, we further introduce local conformal quantile estimation, enabling spatially adaptive uncertainty bands while preserving theoretical guarantee. Through systematic evaluations on typical PDEs (damped harmonic oscillator, Poisson, Allen-Cahn, and Helmholtz equations) and comprehensive testing across multiple uncertainty metrics, our results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves reliable calibration and locally adaptive uncertainty intervals, consistently outperforming heuristic UQ approaches. By bridging PINNs with distribution-free UQ, this work introduces a general framework that not only enhances calibration and reliability, but also opens new avenues for uncertainty-aware modeling of complex PDE systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents eXtended Physics-Informed Neural Network (X-PINN), a novel and robust framework for addressing fracture mechanics problems involving multiple cracks in fractured media. To address this, an energy-based loss function, customized integration schemes, and domain decomposition procedures are proposed. Inspired by the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM), the neural network solution space is enriched with specialized functions that allow crack body discontinuities and singularities at crack tips to be explicitly captured. Furthermore, a structured framework is introduced in which standard and enriched solution components are modeled using distinct neural networks, enabling flexible and effective simulations of complex multiple-crack problems in 1D and 2D domains, with convenient extensibility to 3D problems. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Physics-based deep kernel learning for parameter estimation in high dimensional PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring parameters of high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) poses significant computational and inferential challenges, primarily due to the curse of dimensionality and the inherent limitations of traditional numerical methods. This paper introduces a novel two-stage Bayesian framework that synergistically integrates training, physics-based deep kernel learning (DKL) with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to robustly infer unknown PDE parameters and quantify their uncertainties from sparse, exact observations. The first stage leverages physics-based DKL to train a surrogate model, which jointly yields an optimized neural network feature extractor and robust initial estimates for the PDE parameters. In the second stage, with the neural network weights fixed, HMC is employed within a full Bayesian framework to efficiently sample the joint posterior distribution of the kernel hyperparameters and the PDE parameters. Numerical experiments on canonical and high-dimensional inverse PDE problems demonstrate that our framework accurately estimates parameters, provides reliable uncertainty estimates, and effectively addresses challenges of data sparsity and model complexity, offering a robust and scalable tool for diverse scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>HYCO: Hybrid-Cooperative Learning for Data-Driven PDE Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Hybrid-Cooperative Learning (HYCO), a hybrid modeling framework that iteratively integrates physics-based and data-driven models through a mutual regularization mechanism. Unlike traditional approaches that impose physical constraints directly on synthetic models, HYCO treats the physical and synthetic components as co-trained agents: the physical and synthetic models are nudged toward agreement, while the synthetic model is enhanced to better fit the available data. This cooperative learning scheme is naturally parallelizable and improves robustness to noise as well as to sparse or heterogeneous data. Extensive numerical experiments on both static and time-dependent problems demonstrate that HYCO outperforms classical physics-based and data-driven methods, recovering accurate solutions and model parameters even under ill-posed conditions. The method also admits a natural game-theoretic interpretation, enabling alternating optimization and paving the way for future theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>A Variational Framework for Residual-Based Adaptivity in Neural PDE Solvers and Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Residual-based adaptive strategies are widely used in scientific machine learning but remain largely heuristic. We introduce a unifying variational framework that formalizes these methods by integrating convex transformations of the residual. Different transformations correspond to distinct objective functionals: exponential weights target the minimization of uniform error, while linear weights recover the minimization of quadratic error. Within this perspective, adaptive weighting is equivalent to selecting sampling distributions that optimize the primal objective, thereby linking discretization choices directly to error metrics. This principled approach yields three benefits: (1) it enables systematic design of adaptive schemes across norms, (2) reduces discretization error through variance reduction of the loss estimator, and (3) enhances learning dynamics by improving the gradient signal-to-noise ratio. Extending the framework to operator learning, we demonstrate substantial performance gains across optimizers and architectures. Our results provide a theoretical justification of residual-based adaptivity and establish a foundation for principled discretization and training strategies.</description>

      <title>Optimality Conditions for Multivariate Chebyshev Approximation: A Survey</title>

Abstract: Uniform polynomial approximation, also called minimax approximation or Chebyshev approximation, consists in searching polynomial approximation that minimizes the worst case error. Optimality conditions for the uniform approximation of univariate functions defined in an interval are governed by the equioscillation theorem, which is also a key ingredient in algorithms for computing best uniform approximation, like Remez's algorithm and the two phase method. Multivariate polynomial approximation is more complicated, and several optimality conditions for uniform multivariate polynomial approximation generalize the equioscillation theorem. We review these conditions, including, from oldest to newest, Kirchberger's kernel condition, Kolmogorov criteria, Rivlin and Shapiro's annihilating measures. An emphasis is given to conditions for strong optimality, which has some strong theoretical and practical importance, including Bartelt's and Smarzewsky's conditions. Optimality conditions related to more general relative Chebyshev centers are also presented, including Tanimoto's and Levis et al.'s conditions. In a second step, conditions obtained by standard convex analysis, subdifferential and directional derivative, applied to uniform approximation are formulated. Their relationship to previous conditions is investigated, providing sometimes enlightening interpretations of the laters, e.g., relating Kolmogorov criterion with directional derivative, and strong uniqueness with sharp minimizers. Finally, numerical applications of the two-step approach to three uniform approximation problems are presented, namely the approximation of the multidimensional Runge function, the approximation of the two dimensional inverse model of the DexTAR parallel robot, and the approximation problem consisting in minimizing the sum of both the polynomial approximation error and the polynomial evaluation error in Horner form.</description>

      <title>A space-time variational formulation for the many-body electronic Schr{\"o}dinger evolution equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove in this paper that the solution of the time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation can be expressed as the solution of a global space-time quadratic minimization problem that is amenable to Galerkin time-space discretization schemes, using an appropriate least-square formulation. The present analysis can be applied to the electronic many-body time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation with an arbitrary number of electrons and interaction potentials with Coulomb singularities. We motivate the interest of the present approach with two goals: first, the design of Galerkin space-time discretization methods; second, the definition of dynamical low-rank approximations following a variational principle different from the classical Dirac-Frenkel principle, and for which it is possible to prove the global-in-time existence of solutions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo for partial differential equations with generalized Gaussian input uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in uncertainty quantification for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) with Gevrey regular inputs. The Gevrey class contains functions that are infinitely smooth with a growth condition on the higher-order partial derivatives, but which are nonetheless not analytic in general. Recent studies by Chernov and Le (Comput. Math. Appl., 2024, and SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 2024) as well as Harbrecht, Schmidlin, and Schwab (Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 2024) analyze the setting wherein the input random field is assumed to be uniformly bounded with respect to the uncertain parameters. In this paper, we relax this assumption and allow for parameter-dependent bounds. The parametric inputs are modeled as generalized Gaussian random variables, and we analyze the application of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration to assess the PDE response statistics using randomly shifted rank-1 lattice rules. In addition to the QMC error analysis, we also consider the dimension truncation and finite element errors in this setting.</description>

      <title>Robust and Optimal Mixed Methods for a Fourth-Order Elliptic Singular Perturbation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A series of robust and optimal mixed methods based on two mixed formulations of the fourth-order elliptic singular perturbation problem are developed in this paper. First, a mixed method based on a second-order system is proposed without relying on Nitsche's technique or interpolations. Robust and optimal error estimates are derived using an $L^2$-bounded interpolation operator for tensors. Then, its connections to other discrete methods, including weak Galerkin methods and a mixed finite element method based on a first-order system, are established. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Stage-Parallel Implicit Runge--Kutta methods via low-rank matrix equation corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit Runge--Kutta (IRK) methods are highly effective for solving stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) but can be computationally expensive for large-scale problems due to the need of solving coupled algebraic equations at each step. This study improves IRK efficiency by leveraging parallelism to decouple stage computations and reduce communication overhead, specifically we stably decouple a perturbed version of the stage system of equations and recover the exact solution by solving a Sylvester matrix equation with an explicitly known low-rank right-hand side. Two IRK families -- symmetric methods and collocation methods -- are analyzed, with extensions to nonlinear problems using a simplified Newton method. Implementation details, shared memory parallel code, and numerical examples, particularly for ODEs from spatially discretized PDEs, demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed IRK technique.</description>

      <title>Tensor train solution to uncertain optimization problems with shared sparsity penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop both first and second order numerical optimization methods to solve non-smooth optimization problems featuring a shared sparsity penalty, constrained by differential equations with uncertainty. To alleviate the curse of dimensionality we use tensor product approximations. To handle the non-smoothness of the objective function we employ a smoothed version of the shared sparsity objective. We consider both a benchmark elliptic PDE constraint, and a more realistic topology optimization problem in engineering. We demonstrate that the error converges linearly in iterations and the smoothing parameter, and faster than algebraically in the number of degrees of freedom, consisting of the number of quadrature points in one variable and tensor ranks. Moreover, in the topology optimization problem, the smoothed shared sparsity penalty actually reduces the tensor ranks compared to the unpenalised solution. This enables us to find a sparse high-resolution design under a high-dimensional uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Enabling Local Neural Operators to perform Equation-Free System-Level Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Operators (NOs) provide a powerful framework for computations involving physical laws that can be modelled by (integro-) partial differential equations (PDEs), directly learning maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces that bypass both the explicit equation identification and their subsequent numerical solving. Still, NOs have so far primarily been employed to explore the dynamical behavior as surrogates of brute-force temporal simulations/predictions. Their potential for systematic rigorous numerical system-level tasks, such as fixed-point, stability, and bifurcation analysis - crucial for predicting irreversible transitions in real-world phenomena - remains largely unexplored. Toward this aim, inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale framework, we propose and implement a framework that integrates (local) NOs with advanced iterative numerical methods in the Krylov subspace, so as to perform efficient system-level stability and bifurcation analysis of large-scale dynamical systems. Beyond fixed point, stability, and bifurcation analysis enabled by local in time NOs, we also demonstrate the usefulness of local in space as well as in space-time ("patch") NOs in accelerating the computer-aided analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. We illustrate our framework via three nonlinear PDE benchmarks: the 1D Allen-Cahn equation, which undergoes multiple concatenated pitchfork bifurcations; the Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE, which features a saddle-node tipping point; and the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, consisting of two coupled PDEs that exhibit both Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations.</description>

      <title>A primal-dual price-optimization method for computing equilibrium prices in mean-field games models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a simple yet efficient Lagrangian method for computing equilibrium prices in a mean-field game price-formation model. We prove that equilibrium prices are optimal in terms of a suitable criterion and derive a primal-dual gradient-based algorithm for computing them. One of the highlights of our computational framework is the efficient, simple, and flexible implementation of the algorithm using modern automatic differentiation techniques. Our implementation is modular and admits a seamless extension to high-dimensional settings with more complex dynamics, costs, and equilibrium conditions. Additionally, automatic differentiation enables a versatile algorithm that requires only coding the cost functions of agents. It automatically handles the gradients of the costs, thereby eliminating the need to manually form the adjoint equations.</description>

      <title>A Kernel-based Stochastic Approximation Framework for Nonlinear Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic approximation framework for learning nonlinear operators between infinite-dimensional spaces utilizing general Mercer operator-valued kernels. Our framework encompasses two key classes: (i) compact kernels, which admit discrete spectral decompositions, and (ii) diagonal kernels of the form $K(x,x')=k(x,x')T$, where $k$ is a scalar-valued kernel and $T$ is a positive operator on the output space. This broad setting induces expressive vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that generalize the classical $K=kI$ paradigm, thereby enabling rich structural modeling with rigorous theoretical guarantees. To address target operators lying outside the RKHS, we introduce vector-valued interpolation spaces to precisely quantify misspecification error. Within this framework, we establish dimension-free polynomial convergence rates, demonstrating that nonlinear operator learning can overcome the curse of dimensionality. The use of general operator-valued kernels further allows us to derive rates for intrinsically nonlinear operator learning, going beyond the linear-type behavior inherent in diagonal constructions of $K=kI$. Importantly, this framework accommodates a wide range of operator learning tasks, ranging from integral operators such as Fredholm operators to architectures based on encoder-decoder representations. Moreover, we validate its effectiveness through numerical experiments on the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.</description>
