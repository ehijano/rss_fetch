      <title>A Dynamical Approach to the Berezin--Li--Yau Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a dynamical method for proving the sharp Berezin--Li--Yau inequality. The approach is based on the volume-preserving mean curvature flow and a new monotonicity principle for the Riesz mean $R_\Lambda(\Omega_t)$. For convex domains we show that $R_\Lambda$ is monotone non-decreasing along the flow. The key input is a geometric correlation inequality between the boundary spectral density $Q_\Lambda$ and the mean curvature $H$, established in all dimensions: in $d=2$ via circular symmetrization, and in $d\ge 3$ via the boundary Weyl expansion together with the Laugesen--Morpurgo trace minimization principle. Since the flow converges smoothly to the ball, the monotonicity implies the sharp Berezin--Li--Yau bound for every smooth convex domain. As an application, we obtain a sharp dynamical Ces\`aro--P\'olya inequality for eigenvalue averages.</description>

      <title>Geometric invariants and the Monge-Ampere equation in K\"ahler geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a contribution to the special issue of Surveys in Differential Geometry celebrating the 75th birthday of Shing-Tung Yau. The bulk of the paper is devoted to a survey of some new geometric inequalities and estimates for the Monge-Ampere equation, obtained by the authors in the last few years in joint work with F. Tong, J. Song, and J. Sturm. These all depend in an essential way on Yau's solution of the Calabi conjecture, which is itself nearing its own 50th birthday. The opportunity is also taken to survey briefly many current directions in complex geometry, which he more recently pioneered.</description>

Abstract: Let $M, N$ be compact Riemannian manifolds. Then, for fixed volume fraction, in the product of a sufficiently small homothetic copy of $M$ with $N$, every isoperimetric region is the product of $M$ with an isoperimetric region in $N$, provided the boundaries of the isoperimetric regions in $N$ are smooth.</description>

      <title>Bochner's technique in Einstein's non-symmetric geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A. Einstein considered a manifold with a non-symmetric (0,2)-tensor $G$ and a linear connection $\nabla=(\Gamma^k_{ij})$ satisfying the condition $\dfrac{\partial G_{ij}}{\partial x^k} = \Gamma^p_{ik}G_{pj} +\Gamma^p_{kj}G_{ip}$. Guided by the construction of an almost Lie algebroid (on a vector bundle), we define the following concepts of Bochner's technique for the Einstein's non-symmetric geometry: the $\nabla^{f}$-connection, Bochner and Hodge $f$-Laplacians on tensors, the $f$-curvature operator and the Weitzenb\"{o}ck type curvature operator of Einstein's connection. We prove Weitzenb\"{o}ck type decomposition formula and obtain vanishing results about the null space of the Bochner and Hodge $f$-Laplacians.</description>

      <title>Equiaffine immersions and pseudo-Riemannian space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an explicit construction that produces immersions into the pseudosphere $\mathbb{S}^{n,n+1}$ and the pseudohyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n+1,n}$ starting from equiaffine immersions in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and conversely. We describe how these immersions interact with a para-Sasaki metric defined on $\mathbb{H}^{n+1,n}$ via a principal $\mathbb{R}$-bundle structure over a para-K\"ahler manifold. In the case where the immersion in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is an $n$-dimensional hyperbolic affine sphere, we obtain spacelike maximal immersions in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1,n}$ that satisfy a transversality condition with respect to the principal $\mathbb{R}$-bundle structure. As a first application, we show that, given a certain boundary set $\Lambda_\Omega \subset \partial_\infty \mathbb{H}^{n+1,n}$, associated with a properly convex subset $\Omega \subset \mathbb{RP}^n$ and homeomorphic to an $(n-1)$-sphere, there exists an $n$-dimensional maximal spacelike submanifold in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1,n}$ whose boundary is precisely $\Lambda_\Omega$. As a second application, we show that the Blaschke lift of the hyperbolic affine sphere, introduced by Labourie for $n=2$, into the symmetric space of $\mathrm{SL}(n+1,\mathbb{R})$ is a harmonic map.</description>

      <title>Extensions and Applications of Stein-Weiss Operators to Traceless Symmetric Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order differential operators arising from the representation-theoretic decomposition of the covariant derivative play a central role in Riemannian geometry. In this paper, we study Stein-Weiss $O(n)$-gradients acting on covariant symmetric trace-free tensors of arbitrary rank $p \ge 2$. By analyzing the decomposition of $T^*M \otimes S_0^p(M)$ into its $O(n)$-irreducible components, we explicitly describe the corresponding generalized gradients and compute Weitzenbock formulas for their adjoint compositions. These results extend Bouguignon four-dimensional formulas for $p = 2$ and generalize previous work of other authors to higher-rank symmetric tensors. The formulas obtained provide a unified framework for understanding second-order Stein-Weiss operators and yield tools applicable to deformation complexes, curvature estimates, and stability problems in geometric analysis. The article continues the authors' earlier investigations of Stein-Weiss operators on natural tensor bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the set of potential functions on noncompact quasi-Einstein manifolds. We show that the space of all positive potential functions on a three-dimensional noncompact quasi-Einstein manifold has dimension at most two, and that equality holds if and only if the manifold is isometric to a product $B\times\mathbb{R}$, where $B$ is a $\lambda$-Einstein surface or one of the examples obtained by L. Berard Bergery and described in Besse's book. Moreover, we prove that any asymptotically flat $n$-dimensional quasi-Einstein manifold with $\lambda=0$ is necessarily Ricci-flat.</description>

      <title>Massless Majorana spinors in the Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that massive Majorana spinors \eqref{1.2} do not exist if they are $t$-dependent or $\phi$-dependent in Kerr, or Kerr-(A)dS spacetimes. For massless Majorana spinors in the non-extreme Kerr spacetime, the Dirac equation can be separated into radial and angular equations, parameterized by two complex constants $\epsilon_1$, $\epsilon_2$. If at least one of $\epsilon_1$, $\epsilon_2$ is zero, massless Majorana spinors can be solved explicitly. If $\epsilon_1$, $\epsilon_2$ are nonzero, we prove the nonexistence of massless time-periodic Majorana spinors in the non-extreme Kerr spacetime which are $L^p$ outside the event horizon for $ 0&lt;p\le\frac{6}{|\epsilon_1|+|\epsilon_2| +2}$. We then provide the Hamiltonian formulation for massless Majorana spinors and prove that the self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian leads to the angular momentum $a=0$ and spacetime reduces to the Schwarzschild spacetime, moreover, the massless Majorana spinor must be $\phi$-independent. Finally, we show that, in the Schwarzschild spacetime, for initial data with $L^2$ decay at infinity, the probability of the massless Majorana spinors to be in any compact region of space tends to zero as time tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Rates and architectures for learning geometrically non-trivial operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods have proven capable of recovering operators between high-dimensional spaces, such as solution maps of PDEs and similar objects in mathematical physics, from very few training samples. This phenomenon of data-efficiency has been proven for certain classes of elliptic operators with simple geometry, i.e., operators that do not change the domain of the function or propagate singularities. However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples. Furthermore, we investigate architectures that explicitly encode the geometry of these transforms, demonstrating that an architecture reminiscent of cross-attention based on levelset methods yields a parameterization that is universal, stable, and learns double fibration transforms from very few training examples. Our results contribute to a rapidly-growing line of theoretical work on learning operators for scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>High Codimension Mean Curvature Flow with Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.07163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a mean curvature flow with surgery for submanifolds of arbitrary codimension. The theory applies to closed submanifolds satisfying a natural quadratic pinching condition, which serves as the high-codimension analogue of 2-convexity and is preserved under the flow in dimensions $n \geq 8$. Our results therefore are in line with the current state-of-the-art in codimension one (where at present 2-convexity is required for surgery). Central to our analysis is a collection of new a priori estimates for the second fundamental form, uniform across surgeries, which yield a precise description of high-curvature regions and permit controlled surgeries. This provides the first notion of mean curvature flow through singularities with topological control in higher codimensions. As a consequence we obtain a sharp classification: Every closed quadratically 2-convexity submanifold is diffeomorphic either to $\mathbb{S}^n$ or to a finite connected sum of $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$-bundles over $\mathbb{S}^1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate certain immersions of constant curvature from Riemann surfaces into flag manifolds equipped with invariant metrics, namely primitive lifts associated to pseudoholomorphic maps of surfaces into complex Grassmannians. We prove that a primitive immersion from the two-sphere into the full flag manifold which has constant curvature with respect to \emph{at least one} invariant metric is unitarily equivalent to the primitive lift of a Veronese map, hence it has constant curvature with respect to \emph{all} invariant metrics. We prove a partial generalization of this result to the case where the domain is a general simply connected Riemann surface. On the way, we consider the problem of finding the invariant metric on the flag manifold, under a certain normalization condition, that maximizes the induced area of the two-sphere by a given primitive immersion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a graded bracket of forms on multicontact manifolds. This bracket satisfies a graded Jacobi identity as well as two different versions of the Leibniz rule, one of them being a weak Leibniz rule, extending the well-known notions in contact geometry. In addition, we develop the multisymplectization of multicontact structures to relate these brackets to the ones present in multisymplectic geometry and obtain the field equations in an abstract context. The Jacobi bracket also permits to study the evolution of observables and study the dissipation phenomena, which we also address. Finally, we apply the results to classical dissipative field theories.</description>

      <title>The $p$-th dual Minkowski problem for the $k$-torsional rigidity corresponding to a $k$-Hessian equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the dual curvature measures [Y. Huang, E. Lutwak, D. Yang \&amp; G. Y. Zhang, Acta. Math. 216 (2016): 325-388], which connects the cone-volume measure and Aleksandrov's integral curvature, and has created a precedent for the theoretical research of the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory.
  Motivated by the foregoing groundbreaking works, the present paper introduces the $p$-th dual $k$-torsional rigidity associated with a $k$-Hessian equation and establishes its Hadamard variational formula with $1\leq k\leq n-1$, which induces the $p$-th dual $k$-torsional measure. Further, based on the $p$-th dual $k$-torsional measure, this article, for the first time, proposes the $p$-th dual Minkowski problem of the $k$-torsional rigidity which can be equivalently converted to a nonlinear partial differential equation in smooth case: \begin{align}\label{eq01} f(x)=\tau(|\nabla h|^2+h^2)^{\frac{p-n}{2}}h_{\Omega}(x)|Du(\nu^{-1}_\Omega(x))|^{k+1}\sigma_{n-k}(h_{ij}(x)+h_\Omega(x)\delta_{ij}), \end{align} where $\tau&gt;0$ is a constant, $f$ is a positive smooth function defined on $S^{n-1}$ and $\sigma_{n-k}$ is the $(n-k)$-th elementary symmetric function of the principal curvature radii. We confirm the existence of smooth non-even solution to the $p$-th dual Minkowski problem of the $k$-torsional rigidity for $p&lt;n-2$ by the method of a curvature flow which converges smoothly to the solution of equation (\ref{eq01}). Specially, a novel approach for the uniform lower bound estimation in the $C^0$ estimation for the solution to the curvature flow is presented with the help of invariant functional $\Phi(\Omega_t)$.</description>

      <title>Gibbs polystability of Fano manifolds, stability thresholds and symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the probabilistic approach for constructing Kahler-Einstein metrics on log Fano manifolds - involving random point processes - to the case of non-discrete automorphism groups, by explicitly breaking the symmetry. This yields a new algebraic notion of Gibbs polystability, conjecturally equivalent to K-polystability. The definition involves a limit of log canonical thresholds on the GIT semistable locus of the N-fold products of the Fano manifold that we conjecture coincides with an analytic reduced stability threshold encoding the coercivity of the K-energy functional modulo automorphisms. These conjectures follow from an overarching conjectural Large Deviation Principle for the limit when N tends to infinity. We prove several of our conjectures for log Fano curves. By imposing a moment constraint, we derive a strengthened form of the sharp logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality on the two-sphere, that implies the sharp form of Aubin's refinement of the Moser-Trudinger inequality. In companion papers we will present applications to Onsager's point vortex model on the two-sphere and the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Complex structures of the Gibbons-Hawking ansatz with infinite topological type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the complex structures of complete hyperk\"ahler four-manifolds of infinite topological type arising from the Gibbons-Hawking ansatz. We show that for almost all complex structures in the hyperk\"ahler family, the manifold is biholomorphic to a hypersurface in $\mathbb{C}^3$ defined by an explicit entire function. For the remaining complex structures, we further prove that the manifold is biholomorphic to the minimal resolution of a singular surface in $\mathbb{C}^3$ under certain conditions. Thus, we partially extend LeBrun's celebrated work to the context of countably many punctures.</description>

      <title>Filtrations on quantum cohomology from the Floer theory of $\mathbb{C}^*$-actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13026v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a filtration by ideals on quantum cohomology for symplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action that extends to a pseudoholomorphic $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. These spaces include all Conical Symplectic Resolutions, in particular all Quiver Varieties. In particular, we obtain a family of filtrations on singular cohomology for any Conical Symplectic Resolution, that is sensitive to the choice of $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. The symplectic form is rarely exact at infinity for these spaces, so substantial foundational work is carried out to rigorously define Floer theory, in particular symplectic cohomology. Using Floer theory, we construct a periodic persistence module, giving rise to a graded periodic barcode associated to the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This encodes birth-death phenomena of Floer invariants. Our filtrations can be viewed as a Floer-theoretic analogue of Atiyah-Bott filtrations, arising from stratifying a manifold by gradient flowlines of a Morse-Bott function, but they are distinct from those and they can detect non-topological properties of the quantum product.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fluids via matrix hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14282v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2-D) incompressible, inviscid fluids produce fascinating patterns of swirling motion. How and why the patterns emerge are long-standing questions, first addressed in the 19th century by Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, and Kelvin. Countless researchers have since contributed to innovative techniques and results. Yet, the overarching problem of swirling 2-D motion and its long-time behavior remains largely open. Here we shed light on this problem via a link to isospectral matrix flows. The link is established through V. Zeitlin's beautiful model for the numerical discretization of Euler's equations in 2-D. When considered on the sphere, Zeitlin's model offers deep connections between 2-D hydrodynamics and unitary representations of the rotation group. Consequently, it provides a dictionary that maps hydrodynamical concepts to matrix Lie theory, which in turn gives connections to matrix factorizations, random matrices, and integrability theory, for example. Results about finite-dimensional matrices can then be transferred to infinite-dimensional fluids via quantization theory, which is here used as an analysis tool (albeit traditionally describing the limit between quantum and classical physics). We demonstrate how the dictionary is constructed and how it unveils techniques for 2-D hydrodynamics. We also give accompanying convergence results for Zeitlin's model on the sphere.</description>

      <title>A microlocal pathway to spectral asymmetry: curl and the eta invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of eta invariant is traditionally defined by means of analytic continuation. We prove, by examining the particular case of the operator curl, that the eta invariant can equivalently be obtained as the trace of the difference of positive and negative spectral projections, appropriately regularised. Our construction is direct, in the sense that it does not involve analytic continuation, and is based on the use of pseudodifferential techniques. This provides a novel approach to the study of spectral asymmetry of non-semibounded (pseudo)differential systems on manifolds which encompasses and extends previous results.</description>

      <title>Geometric Solution of the Loop Equation and Quark Confinement in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13688v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic confining area law for pure $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ Yang--Mills theory, satisfying the hierarchy of multiloop equations for arbitrary regular loops and any number of colors $N_c$. The solution is constructed using a quaternionic Hodge-dual minimal surface in a 16-dimensional auxiliary space. Unlike random surfaces, this construction defines an effectively topological string theory where the bulk dynamics reduces to the area of a conformal map of the 2D disk, with all nontrivial dynamics encoded in the boundary loop.
  The Wilson loop factorizes into a confining dressing factor and a perturbative term: $W[C] = W_{\text{pert}}[C]\, e^{-\kappa S[C]}$. We show that the geometric factor $e^{-\kappa S[C]}$ is an exact multiplicative zero mode of the loop-space diffusion operator and of the full MM multiloop hierarchy for any finite $N_c$, extending the planar area law to the physical case $N_c=3$. The functional $S[C]$ obeys the inequality $S[C] \ge \sqrt{2}\,A[C]$ (where $A[C]$ is the Euclidean minimal area), providing a sufficient condition for confinement.
  The area law is given explicitly by the spectral formula $S[C] = 2\sqrt{2}\,(\lambda_3 + \lambda_4)$, using the two largest eigenvalues of the Douglas--Gram matrix. We demonstrate that this functional is an exact additive zero mode of the loop diffusion operator, protected algebraically by the Bianchi identity, and globally defined for regular loops $C \in H^{1/2}(\mathbb{S}^1,\mathbb{R}^4)$. Matching this factor with the gluon condensate via the OPE determines the physical string tension $\kappa \sim \Lambda_{\text{QCD}}^2$. This framework yields a first-principles derivation of confinement in QCD and new tools for the high-lying meson spectrum.</description>
