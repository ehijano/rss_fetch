      <title>Fixing the dynamical evolution of self-interacting vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of the Cauchy problem for self-interacting massive vector fields often face instabilities and apparent pathologies. We explicitly demonstrate that these issues, previously reported in the literature, are actually due to the breakdown of the well-posedness of the initial-value problem. This is akin to shortcomings observed in scalar-tensor theories when derivative self-interactions are included. Building on previous work done for k-essence, we characterize the well-posedness breakdowns, differentiating between Tricomi and Keldysh-like behaviors. We show that these issues can be avoided by ``fixing the equations'', enabling stable numerical evolutions in spherical symmetry. Additionally, we show that for a class of vector self-interactions, no Tricomi-type breakdown takes place. Finally, we investigate initial configurations for the massive vector field which lead to gravitational collapse and the formation of black holes.</description>

      <title>Well-posed initial value formulation of general effective field theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a proof that all polynomial higher-derivative effective field theories of vacuum gravity admit a well-posed initial value formulation when augmented by suitable regularising terms. These regularising terms can be obtained by field redefinitions and allow to rewrite the resulting equations of motion as a system of second-order nonlinear wave equations. For instance, our result applies to the quadratic, cubic, and quartic truncations of the effective field theory of gravity that have previously appeared in the literature. The regularising terms correspond to fiducial massive modes, however, their masses can be chosen to be non-tachyonic and heavier than the cutoff scale and hence these modes should not affect the dynamics in the regime of validity of effective field theory. Our well-posed formulation is not limited to the weakly coupled regime of these theories, is manifestly covariant and does neither require fine tuning of free parameters nor involves prescribing arbitrary equations.</description>

      <title>Hawking radiation and the Landauer Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Hawking black-hole evaporation saturates the Landauer Principle of information thermodynamics. Our result implies that information loss experienced by a black hole during Hawking evaporation takes place as efficiently as possible. We also extend the analysis to the case of Barrow entropy as a phenomenological realization of a fractal event horizon, where the Landauer Principle informs amongst different options for the black hole temperature. To our knowledge, this work is the first identification of the two results as expressions of the same process.</description>

      <title>Whispers from the quantum core: the ringdown of semiclassical stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This investigation delves into the ringdown signals produced by semiclassical stars, which are ultra-compact, regular solutions of the Einstein equations incorporating stress-energy contributions from quantum vacuum polarization. These stars exhibit an approximately Schwarzschild exterior and an interior composed of a constant-density classical fluid and a cloud of vacuum polarization. By adjusting their compactness and density, we can alter the internal structure of these stars without modifying the exterior. This adaptability enables us to examine the sensitivity of the ringdown signal to the innermost regions of the emitting object and to compare it with similar geometries that differ substantially only at the core. Our results indicate that echo signals are intrinsically linked to the presence of stable light rings and can be very sensitive to the internal structure of the emitting object. This point was previously overlooked, either due to the imposition of reflective boundary conditions at the stellar surface or due to the assumption of low curvature interior geometries. Specifically, for stellar-sized semiclassical stars, we find that the interior travel time is sufficiently prolonged to render the echoes effectively unobservable. These findings underscore the potential efficacy of ultra-compact objects as black hole mimickers and emphasize that any phenomenological constraints on such objects necessitate a detailed understanding of their specific properties and core structure.</description>

      <title>Compact stars in $f(Q) = Q +\xi Q^2$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) is not the only way gravity can be geometrised. Instead of curvature, the Teleparallel Theory attributes gravity to torsion $T$, which is related to the antysimmetric part of connection, and the Symmetric Teleparallel theory no longer preserves metricity, describing gravity through the non-metricity tensor $Q_{\alpha\mu\nu}\equiv \nabla_\alpha g_{\mu\nu}.$ These descriptions give form to what is known as geometrical trinity of gravity. Recently, the extensions of GR have been intensively investigated in order to solve the theoretical impasses which have arisen. In this sense, it is also useful to investigate the extensions of alternative descriptions of gravity, which leads us to the so-called $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ gravities. In this paper, we consider a family of $f(Q)$ models and obtain their corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-{Volkoff} equations applied to {polytropic} stars. Using numerical integration, it is possible to solve a system of differential equations and calculate, among other things, the maximum mass and mass-radius relation allowed. In addition, we explicitly show the non-metricity behavior inside and outside the star.</description>

      <title>Robust and improved constraints on higher-curvature gravitational effective-field-theory with the GW170608 event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective field theory methods allow us to modify general relativity through higher-curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action, while preserving Lorentz invariance and the number of gravitational degrees of freedom. We here construct an approximate inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model within the cubic, parity-preserving class of effective-field-theory extensions to Einstein's theory for the gravitational waves emitted by quasi-circular binary black holes with aligned/anti-aligned spins. Using this waveform model, we first explore the detectability of non-Einsteinian effective-field-theory effects through an extended version of effective cycles to illustrate the need to include non-Einsteinian amplitude corrections. We then use this model to analyze the GW170608 event in a full Bayesian framework, and we place new improved and more robust constraints on the coupling constants of the effective field theory. Our Bayesian model selection study disfavors the non-Einsteinian theory with a (log) Bayes factor of $\log \mathcal{B}^{\text{EFT}}_{\text{GR}} = -2.81$. Our Bayesian parameter estimation study places the constraints $\bar{\alpha}_1=0.87^{+1.95}_{-1.03}$ and $ \bar{\alpha}_2=-0.35^{+4.12}_{-2.92}$ at $90\%$ confidence on the coupling parameters of the effective-field theory. These constraints are $3.5$ stronger than previous constraints, informative relative to the prior, and independent of the choice of prior on the coupling parameters of the modified theory.</description>

      <title>Linearized Stability of Harada Thin-Shell Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Darmois-Israel-Sen junction conditions, and with help of Visser's cut-and-paste method, we study the dynamics of thin-shell wormholes that are made of two conformally Killing gravity (a.k.a Harada gravity) black holes. We check the energy conditions for different values of the new parameter that Harada introduced, as alternative for dark energy. We examine the radial acceleration to reveal the attractive and repulsive characteristics of the thin-shell wormhole throat. We consider the dynamics and stability of the wormhole around the static solutions of the linearized radial perturbations at the wormhole throat. Finally, we determine the regions of stability by applying the concavity test on the ''speed of sound'' as a function in the throat radius and other spacetime parameters, particularly the new Harada parameter.</description>

      <title>Measuring the anisotropies in astrophysical and cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds with Taiji and LISA networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the capabilities of space-based gravitational-wave detector networks, specifically Taiji and LISA, to measure the anisotropies in stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs), which are characterized by the angular power spectrum. We find that a detector network can improve the measurement precision of anisotropies by at most fourteen orders of magnitude, depending on the angular multipoles. By doing so, we can enhance our understanding of the physical origins of SGWB, both in astrophysical and cosmological contexts. We assess the prospects of the detector networks for measuring the parameters of angular power spectrum. We further find an inevitable effect of cosmic variance, which strengthens the importance of configuring detector networks. Our findings also suggest a potential detection of the kinematic dipole due to Doppler boosting of SGWB.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian Tests of Gravitational Quantum Field Theory with Spin and Scaling Gauge Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A self-consistent gravitational quantum field theory, with gravitational force treated on the same footing as the other three fundamental interactions, was established recently. The gravidynamics predicted by such a theory could lead to important implications, and the comparisons with experimental results may provide us opportunities to test such new approach of gravity based on the framework of the quantum field theory of gauge interactions. In this work, we start with the effective field equation of the gravitational quantum field theory, and then solve the perturbative gravigauge field order by order up to the 1st post-Newtonian level under the assumption of a simplified energy-momentum tensor of perfect fluids. Having the constraints on the related post-Newtonian parameters from the most up-to-date observational data, the new bound on the combined coupling in the gravitational quantum field theory $|\gamma_G(\alpha_G-\alpha_W/2)| \leq (2.4\pm30)\times10^{-6}$ is obtained. Under such bound, we found that the new gravitational quantum field theory successfully passed and found no conflict with the contemporary keynote Solar system experiments of gravity.</description>

      <title>Scalar tidal response of a rotating BTZ black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the tidal response of a rotating BTZ black hole to the scalar tidal perturbation. We show that the real component of the tidal response function isn't zero, indicating that a rotating BTZ black hole possesses non-zero tidal Love numbers. Additionally, we observe scale-dependent behaviour, known as log-running, in the tidal response function. We also conduct a separate analysis on an extremal rotating BTZ black hole, finding qualitative similarities with its non-extremal counterpart. In addition, we present a procedure to calculate the tidal response function of a charged rotating BTZ black hole as well.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider an $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m AdS black hole to study thermodynamics. We study the $P-V$ criticality and thermodynamical stability of the black hole. We obtained a first-order phase transition, which may be interpreted as the large/small black hole phase transition. Therefore, we obtained a van der Waals behaviour and obtained critical points. Finally, we calculate quantum work used to resolve the information loss paradox.</description>

      <title>A particle's perspective on screening mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Screening mechanisms are a natural method for suppressing long-range forces in scalar-tensor theories as they link the local background density to their strength. Focusing on Brans-Dicke theories, those including a non-minimal coupling between a scalar degree of freedom and the Ricci scalar, we study the origin of these screening mechanisms from a field theory perspective, considering the influence of the Standard Model on the mechanisms. Additionally, we further consider the role of scale symmetries on screening, demonstrating that only certain sectors, those obtaining their mass via the Higgs mechanism, contribute to screening the fifth forces. This has significant implications for baryons, which obtain most of their mass from the gluon's binding energy. Given that the Planck mass is related to the vacuum expectation value of the non-minimally coupled field, we find an extensive region of the parameter space where screening mechanisms create a spatially dependent gravitational constant. We say that the field over-screens when this effect is more significant than the fifth forces suppressed by screening mechanisms, as we illustrate for the chameleon and symmetron models.</description>

      <title>TCC in the interior of moduli space and its implications for the string landscape and cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical Friedmann-Robertson-Walker solutions that describe a universe undergoing a transition from an accelerating expansion phase in the past to an eternal decelerating expansion phase in the future, driven by a scalar field evolving in a potential energy landscape. We show that any solution for which the accelerating phase violates the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC), even in the interior of moduli space, never approaches the asymptotic vacuum with zero particles. Based on the assumption that the effective field theory must be valid for the vacuum on the asymptotic boundary, as motivated by holography and string theory, we argue that (multi-field) scalar potentials with such solutions are disallowed, thus strengthening the case for TCC. In particular, the results imply a new set of complex and highly-nonlinear constraints across the entire string landscape which may make realizing inflation impossible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Newton-Cartan geometry to the kinetic theory of gases that includes non-relativistic gravitational effects and the principle of general covariance. Starting with an introduction to the basics of Newton-Cartan geometry, we examine the motion of point particles within this framework, leading to a detailed analysis of kinetic theory and the derivation of conservation equations. The equilibrium distribution function is explored, and the example of a rotating gas in a gravitational field is discussed. Further, we develop covariant hydrodynamic equations and extend our analysis through a gradient expansion approach to assess first-order constitutive relations for rotating gases. Finally, we address the frame-dependence paradox, presenting a novel resolution that addresses apparent discrepancies. Our construction resolves a fifty-year-old debate about the frame-indifferent formulation of kinetic theory. The resolution is presented in a modern, symmetry-based approach.</description>

      <title>Testing screened modified gravity with SDSS-IV-MaNGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fifth forces are ubiquitous in modified gravity theories, and must be screened to evade stringent local tests. This can introduce unusual behaviour in galaxy phenomenology by affecting galaxies' components differently. Here we use the SDSS-IV-MaNGA dataset to search for a systematic excess of gas circular velocity over stellar circular velocity, expected in thin-shell-screened theories in the partially screened regime. Accounting for asymmetric drift and calibrating our model on screened subsamples, we find no significant evidence for a screened fifth force. We bound the fifth-force strength to $\Delta G/G_\text{N} &lt; 0.1$ for all astrophysical ranges, strengthening to $\sim$0.01 at Compton wavelength of 3 Mpc for the Hu-Sawicki model, for instance. This implies a stringent constraint on scalar-tensor theories, for example $f_{\mathcal{R}0} \lesssim 10^{-8}$ in Hu-Sawicki $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions for Semilinear Waves on Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish precise asymptotic expansions for solutions to semilinear wave equations with power-type nonlinearities on asymptotically flat spacetimes. For cubic nonlinearities $a(t,x)\phi^3$, we prove $\phi(t, x) = 2c_0 t^{-2} + O(t^{-3+})$ in compact spatial regions, with $c_0$ computable. For $a(t,x)\phi^p$ with $p \geq 4$, we show $\phi(t, x) = d t^{-3} + O(t^{-4+})$, extending Price's law to the nonlinear setting. Our approach combines radiation field analysis with a generalized low-energy resolvent expansion, providing a bridge between spectral and physical space methods. These results sharpen previous decay estimates and yield complete asymptotics across the entire spacetime, including black hole backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Analogue for Quantum Field Theory with a Source term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a non-relativistic fluid analogue model for a scalar field coupled to a classical source. The generic analogue gravity model involves the phonon field which is coupled to the acoustic metric. We work in the special relativity limit of the acoustic analogue. By assuming a time dependent external potential on the fluid system, we are able to model a source term for the scalar field. Upon quantisation, phonon creation due to the source is studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String geometry theory is a candidate of the non-perturvative formulation of string theory. In this theory, strings constitute not only particles but also the space-time. In this review, we identify perturbative vacua, and derive the path-integrals of all order perturbative strings on the corresponding string backgrounds by considering the fluctuations around the vacua. On the other hand, the most dominant part of the path-integral of string geometry theory is the zeroth order part in the fluctuation of the action, which is obtained by substituting the perturbative vacua to the action. This part is identified with the effective potential of the string backgrounds and obtained explicitly. The global minimum of the potential is the string vacuum. The urgent problem is to find the global minimum. We introduce both analytical and numerical methods to solve it.</description>

      <title>Holographic Einstein Ring of Deformed AdS-Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Einstein ring of a deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole (BH) is investigated under the wave optics framework. When the source is fixed on the AdS boundary, we can obtain the corresponding response function generated on the opposite side of the boundary. Utilizing a specialized optical system equipped with a convex lens enables us to capture an image of the BH's holographic Einstein ring on the screen. The influence of the relevant physical parameters and the observed inclination on the characteristics of the Einstein ring can also be studied, which found that the alteration of the observer's position, the image displayed on the screen changes from an axisymmetric ring to an arc, ultimately becoming a solitary point of luminosity. Furthermore, variations in the relevant physical parameters naturally exert an influence on the Einstein ring, resulting in various changes to both its radius and brightness. We also discover the photon ring of the BH from the perspective of the geometric optics, and the numerical results demonstrate that the incident angle of the photon ring is consistent with that of the Einstein ring. It is found that the validity of studying the Einstein ring by wave optics. The investigation on the Einstein rings formed by the deformed AdS-Schwarzschild BHs is anticipated to yield more comprehensive insights into the spacetime geometry, enabling its distinction from Schwarzschild BH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the holographic dictionary from the proposal that treats Newton's constant as a thermodynamic variable, we establish a thermodynamic topological equivalence between the AdS black holes in the bulk and the thermal states in the dual CFT. The findings further reveal that the thermodynamic topological characteristics of the RegMax AdS black holes are strongly influenced by the characteristic parameter of the regularized Maxwell theory. Additionally, we investigate the phase transition between low and high entropy thermal states within a canonical ensemble in the dual CFT. Our observations indicate that the phase transition behavior of the thermal states mirrors that of the black holes. By modeling the phase transition process as a stochastic process, we are able to calculate the rates of phase transition between the thermal states. This result enhances our understanding of the dominant processes involved in the phase transition of the thermal states in the dual CFT.</description>

      <title>Linear waves on the expanding region of Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes: forward asymptotics and scattering from infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study solutions to the linear wave equation on the cosmological region of Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes. We show that all sufficiently regular finite-energy solutions to the linear equation possess a particular finite-order asymptotic expansion near the future boundary. Specifically, we prove that several terms in this asymptotic expansion are identically zero. This is accomplished with new weighted higher-order energy estimates that capture the global expansion of the cosmological region. Furthermore we prove existence and uniqueness of scattering solutions to the linear wave equation on the expanding region. Given two pieces of scattering data at infinity, we construct solutions that have the same asymptotics as forward solutions. The proof involves constructing asymptotic solutions to the wave equation, as well as a new weighted energy estimate that is suitable for the backward problem. This scattering result extends to a large class of expanding spacetimes, including the Kerr de Sitter family.</description>

Abstract: The second-order coherence of light is a widely recognized physical quantity used to assess the quantum characteristics of light, and its properties have been extensively investigated in the field of quantum optics. Recently, it has been proposed that second-order coherence can be utilized as an indicator of quantum entanglement. In this study, we evaluated the second-order coherence in the context of the moving-mirror model, which serves as an analog model for Hawking radiation from a black hole. We discuss the relation between entanglement and the second-order coherence of Hawking radiation paying attention to the noise effect due to the thermality of Hawking radiation, which reduces the quantum correlation in the entanglement-harvesting protocol with two-qubit detectors.</description>

      <title>Prospect of Precision Cosmology and Testing General Relativity using Binary Black Holes- Galaxies Cross-correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified theories of gravity predict deviations from General Relativity (GR) in the propagation of gravitational waves (GW) across cosmological distances. A key prediction is that the GW luminosity distance will vary with redshift, differing from the electromagnetic (EM) luminosity distance due to varying effective Planck mass. We introduce a model-independent, data-driven approach to explore these deviations using multi-messenger observations of dark standard sirens (Binary Black Holes, BBH). By combining GW luminosity distance measurements from dark sirens with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, BBH redshifts inferred from cross-correlation with spectroscopic or photometric galaxy surveys, and sound horizon measurements from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we can make a data-driven test of GR (jointly with the Hubble constant) as a function of redshift. Using the multi-messenger technique with the spectroscopic DESI galaxy survey, we achieve precise measurements of deviations in the effective Planck mass variation with redshift. For the Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope (CEET), the best precision is approximately 3.6\%, and for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK), it is 7.4\% at a redshift of $\rm{z = 0.425}$. Additionally, we can measure the Hubble constant with a precision of about 1.1\% from CEET and 7\% from LVK over five years of observation with a 75\% duty cycle. We also explore the potential of cross-correlation with photometric galaxy surveys from the Rubin Observatory, extending measurements up to a redshift of $\rm{z \sim 2.5}$. This approach can reveal potential deviations from models affecting GW propagation using numerous dark standard sirens in synergy with DESI and the Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Quantum backreaction effect in optical soliton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical solitons classically are stationary solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We perform a quantum field theoretic treatment by quantising a linearised fluctuation field around the classical soliton solution which can be seen as providing a background spacetime for the field. The linearised fluctuation modifies the soliton background, which is often neglected, reminiscent of the nondepleted-pump approximation. Going beyond this approximation and by using a number-conserving Bogoljubov approach, we find unstable modes that grow as the soliton propagates. Eventually, these unstable modes induce a considerable (backreaction) effect in the soliton. We calculate the backreaction in the classical field fully analytically in the leading second order. The result is a quadratic local decrease of the soliton photon number in propagation due to the backreaction effect of the unstable mode. Provided the initial pulse is close to the classical soliton solution, the unstable mode contributions always become dominant. We also consider practical scenarios for observing this quantum-induced soliton distortion, in the spectral domain. The backreaction, which we expect to be present in bright and dark, discrete and continuous solitons and other nonlinear pulses plays an important role for future optical analogue gravity experiments, for soliton lasers, and optical communications.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIIa. Microwave background parity violation without parity-violating microphysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, which assumes statistical isotropy and parity invariance, predicts the absence of correlations between even-parity and odd-parity observables of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Contrary to these predictions, large-angle CMB temperature anomalies generically involve correlations between even-$\ell$ and odd-$\ell$ angular power spectrum $C_\ell$, while recent analyses of CMB polarization have revealed non-zero equal-$\ell$ $EB$ correlations. These findings challenge the conventional understanding, suggesting deviations from statistical isotropy, violations of parity, or both. Cosmic topology, which involves changing only the boundary conditions of space relative to standard cosmology, offers a compelling framework to potentially account for such parity-violating observations. Topology inherently breaks statistical isotropy, and can also break homogeneity and parity, providing a natural paradigm for explaining observations of parity-breaking observables without the need to add parity violation to the underlying microphysics. Our investigation delves into the harmonic space implications of topology for CMB correlations, using as an illustrative example $EB$ correlations generated by tensor perturbations under both parity-preserving and parity-violating scenarios. Consequently, these findings not only challenge the foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model but also open new avenues for exploring the topological structure of the Universe through CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Initial Conditions for the Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial conditions on the anisotropies of the stochastic gravitational-wave background of cosmological origin (CGWB) largely depend on the mechanism that generates the gravitational waves. Since the CGWB is expected to be non-thermal, the computation of the initial conditions could be more challenging w.r.t. the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), whose interactions with other particles in the early Universe lead to a blackbody spectrum. In this paper, we show that the initial conditions for the cosmological background generated by quantum fluctuations of the metric during inflation deviate from adiabaticity. These primordial gravitational waves are indeed generated by quantum fluctuations of two independent degrees of freedom (the two polarization states of the gravitons). Furthermore, the CGWB plays a negligible role in the Einstein's equations, because its energy density is subdominant w.r.t. ordinary matter. Therefore, the only possible way to compute the initial conditions for inflationary gravitons is to perturb the energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational field defined in terms of the small-scale tensor perturbation of the metric. This new and self-consistent approach shows that a large, non-adiabatic initial condition is present even during the single-field inflation. Such a contribution enhances the total angular power spectrum of the CGWB compared to the standard adiabatic case, increasing also the sensitivity of the anisotropies to the presence of relativistic and decoupled particles in the early Universe. In this work we have also proved that our findings are quite general and apply to both single-field inflation and other scenarios in which the CGWB is generated by the quantum fluctuations of the metric, like the curvaton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript revisits the phenomenological emergent dark energy model (PEDE) by confronting it with recent cosmological data from early and late times. In particular we analyze PEDE model by using the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements coming from both Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI) data release 1 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Additionally, the measurements from cosmic chronometers, supernovae type Ia (Pantheon+), quasars, hydrogen II galaxies and cosmic background radiation distance priors are considered. By performing a Bayesian analysis based on Monte Carlo Markov Chain, we find consistent results on the constraints when SDSS and DESI are considered. However, we find higher values on the Hubble constant than Supernova $H_0$ for the Equation of State (SH0ES) does although it is still in agreement, within $1\sigma$ confidence level, when BAO measurements are added. Furthermore, we estimate the age of the Universe younger $\sim3\%$ than the one predicted by the standard cosmology. Additionally, we report values of $q_0 = -0.771^{+0.007}_{-0.007}$, $z_T = 0.764^{+0.011}_{-0.011}$ for the deceleration parameter today and the deceleration-acceleration transition redshift, respectively.</description>

      <title>Neutron-quark stars: Discerning viable alternatives for the higher-density part of the equation of state of compact stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By taking into account the latest observations and theoretical constraints, we investigate the merger and post-merger of binary neutron stars (NSs) with numerical simulations employing hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EOSs). We name our hybrid stars Neutron-quark stars (NQS), because the transition from hadrons to quarks starts at a density lower than the central density of $\sim 1 M_{\odot}$ stars. The two scenarios of transition to quark matter, a strong first-order phase transition (1PT) or a crossover, feature either a drop to almost zero or a rapid increase (peak) in the square of the sound speed $c_s^2$, implying a softening or stiffening during the transition, respectively. Although the properties of NQSs in equilibrium may not be distinguishable from those of NSs, we find that the post-merger gravitational-wave (GW) main frequency $f_2$ for the crossover scenario is generally lower than that of hadronic models with the same tidal deformability, indicating that a crossover transition is in principle observable when both the inspiral and post-merger signals are detected. Since it is viable according to current multi-messenger constraints, we also consider an EOS with a 1PT taking place at 1.8 times the nuclear saturation density ($n_0$), with a stiff quark EOS ($c_s^2 = 2/3~c^2$) after the transition. It is the first time that such a binary merger is studied numerically in full general relativity. Although its $f_2$ is $\sim 300$ Hz higher than that of its baseline, the relation between $f_2$ and the tidal deformability of inspiralling stars is close to that for hadronic EOSs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1703.03059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When Morris and Thorne first proposed that wormholes might be actual physical structures suitable for interstellar travel, they needed to pay close attention to certain traversability conditions such as low tidal forces, which placed severe constraints on the wormhole geometry. Even more problematical was the need for "exotic matter" resulting from the unavoidable violation of the null energy condition required to hold a wormhole open. The purpose of this paper is to overcome these problems by starting with the charged wormhole model of Kim and Lee and assuming a noncommutative-geometry background: the violation of the null energy condition can be attributed to the latter, while the electric charge allows the reduction of the tidal forces to acceptable levels without invoking the trivial zero-tidal-force assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider, from a dynamical systems point of view, a trivalent spin network model in Loop Quantum Gravity presenting self-organized criticality (SOC), arising from a spin propagation dynamics. We obtain a partition function for the domains of stability connecting gauge non-invariant avalanches, leading to an entropy formula for the asymptotic SOC state. The microscopic origin of this SOC entropy is therefore given by the excitation-relaxation spin dynamics in the avalanche cycle. The puncturing of TSN edges participating in the avalanche are counted in terms of an ensemble perimeter over the implicit avalanches. By identifying this perimeter with that of an isolated $(2+1)$-dim. black hole horizon, we conjecture that the SOC entropy reduces to the Bekenstein-Hawking perimeter-entropy law for the Ba\~nados, Teitelboim, and Zanelli (BTZ) black hole, by an appropriate adjustment of a potential function based on the thermodynamical formalism of Sinai, Ruelle and Bowen.</description>

By incorporating nonlinear self-interaction into the massive charged scalar field in general relativity, we discover that the allowed static solutions suggest two such novel dynamic mechanisms, which are further confirmed by our numerical simulations. The first one originates from the linearly unstable hairy black hole, but the bomb can be avoided by dialing the coefficient of the tiny scalar pulse. This distinguishes it from superradiant instability, where the bomb is an inevitable destiny. The second one is an intrinsically nonlinear process, which can even drive a linearly stable Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole to become a black hole bomb by releasing substantial energy to develop scalar hair. This is also in sharp contrast with superradiant instability which can only drive an unstable black hole. These findings not only open up new avenues for black hole energy burst, but also have potential implications for new phenomena occurring around astrophysical black holes.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Connections: From Mathematical Foundations Towards Yano-Schr\"odinger Cosmology</title>

Abstract: Schr\"odinger connections are a special class of affine connections, which despite being metric incompatible, preserve length of vectors under autoparallel transport. In the present paper, we introduce a novel coordinate-free formulation of Schr\"odinger connections. After recasting their basic properties in the language of differential geometry, we show that Schr\"odinger connections can be realized through torsion, non-metricity, or both. We then calculate the curvature tensors of Yano-Schr\"odinger geometry and present the first explicit example of a non-static Einstein manifold with torsion. We generalize the Raychaudhuri and Sachs equations to the Schr\"odinger geometry. The length-preserving property of these connections enables us to construct a Lagrangian formulation of the Sachs equation. We also obtain an equation for cosmological distances. After this geometric analysis, we build gravitational theories based on Yano-Schr\"odinger geometry, using both a metric and a metric-affine approach. For the latter, we introduce a novel cosmological hyperfluid that will source the Schr\"odinger geometry. Finally, we construct simple cosmological models within these theories and compare our results with observational data as well as the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Cosmic evolution of the Kantowski-Sachs universe in the context of a bulk viscous string in teleparallel gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we analyzed the Kantowski-Sachs cosmological model along with teleparallel gravity, where a bulk viscous fluid containing one-dimensional cosmic strings serves as the source for the energy$-$momentum tensor. To obtain the deterministic solution of the field equations, we employed the proportionality condition linking the shear scalar $(\sigma)$ and the expansion scalar $(\theta)$, establishing a relationship between metric potentials. Another approach employed is the utilization of the Hybrid Expansion Law (HEL). The discussion focuses on the behaviour of the accelerating universe concerning the specific choice of a nonlinear (or power law model) of teleparallel gravity $f(T)=\alpha T + \beta T^m$, where
  $T$ is the torsion scalar, $\alpha$ , and $\beta$ are model parameters and $m$ is restricted to greater than or equal to 2. The effective equation of the state parameter $(\omega_{eff})$ of models I, II and III will support the acceleration behavior of the universe. We observed that the null energy condition and weak energy condition are obeyed but violate the strong energy condition as per the present accelerating expansion. Under specific model parameter constraints, the universe shows a transition from a decelerating to an accelerated phase.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic particle production scenario in algebraically coupled quintessence field with dark matter fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of an algebraically coupled quintessence field with a dark matter fluid, considering a scenario involving non-adiabatic particle production through the action principle by modifying the interaction Lagrangian. The interaction parameter serves as the source of dark matter particles and entropy production. As particle creation occurs due to the interaction between the field and fluid sectors, the system manifests additional pressure. Our analysis includes studying the system's dynamics by considering an exponential type of interaction corresponding to the field's exponential potential. We assess the system's background dynamics using the dynamical system stability technique and obtain the necessary constraints on the model parameters. We also determine the best-fit values of the model parameters against OHD+Pantheon+ data by adopting a data analysis technique and compare the evidence to $\Lambda$CDM. Based on the AIC information criterion, the current model shows strong support; however, the BIC does not show very strong support.</description>

      <title>Loop Special Relativity: Kaluza-Klein area metric as a line element for stringy events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let a physical event constitute a simple loop in spacetime. This in turn calls for a generalized loop line element (= distance$^2$ between two neighboring loops) capable of restoring, at the shrinking loop limit, the special relativistic line element (= distance$^2$ between the two neighboring centers-of-mass, respectively). Sticking at first stage to a flat Euclidean/Minkowski background, one is led to such a preliminary loop line element, where the role of coordinates is played by the oriented cross-sections projected by the loop event. Such cross-sections are generically center-of-mass independent, unless (owing to a topological term) the loop events are intrinsically wrapped around a Kaluza-Klein like compact fifth dimension. Serendipitously, it is the Kaluza-Klein ingredient which, on top of its traditional assignments, is shown to govern the extension of Pythagoras theorem to loop space. Associated with $M_4 \otimes S_1$ is then a 10-dim loop spacetime metric, whose 4-dim center-of-mass core term is supplemented by a 6-dim Maxwell-style fine structure. The imperative inclusion of a positive (say Nambu-Goto) string tension within the framework of Loop Special Relativity is fingerprinted by a low periodicity breathing mode. Nash global isometric embedding is conjectured to play a major role in the construction of Loop General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Tipler Naked Singularities in $N$ Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02940v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spacetime singularity, identified by the existence of incomplete causal geodesics in the spacetime, is called a (Tipler) strong curvature singularity if the volume form acting on independent Jacobi fields along causal geodesics vanishes in the approach of the singularity. It is called naked if at least one of these causal geodesics is past incomplete. Here, we study the formation of strong curvature naked singularities arising from spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of general type-I matter fields in an arbitrarily finite number of dimensions. In the spirit of Joshi and Dwivedi [26], and Goswami and Joshi [31], we first construct regular initial data in terms of matter variables and geometric quantities, subject to the dominant and null energy conditions. Using this initial data, we derive two distinct (but not mutually exclusive) conditions, which we call the positive root condition (PRC) and the simple positive root condition (SPRC), that serve as necessary and sufficient conditions, respectively, for the existence of naked singularities. In doing so, we generalize the results of [26] and [31]. We further restrict the PRC and the SPRC by imposing the curvature growth condition (CGC) of Clarke and Krolak [24] on all causal curves that satisfy the causal convergence condition. The CGC gives a sufficient condition for the naked singularities implying the PRC and implied by the SPRC, to be of strong curvature type; thereby also implying the inextendibility of the spacetime. Using the CGC, we extend the results of [28] (that hold for dimension $N=4$) to the case $N=5$, showing that strong curvature naked singularities can occur in this case. However, for the case $N\geq6$, we show that past-incomplete causal curves that identify naked singularities do not satisfy the CGC. These results shed light on the validity of the cosmic censorship conjectures in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Einstein-dilation-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and electric charge of compact binary systems from GW230529</title>

Abstract: In this work, we study the implications of GW230529 on gravity theories and the charge of black holes. The GW230529, which was initially released in O4a, is most likely neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. We reanalyze the data from the GW230529 event to obtain bounds on the Einstein-dilation-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity parameter $\sqrt{\alpha_{\rm EdGB}}$ and the electric charge of compact binary systems. The event places a $90\%$ credible upper bounds on $\sqrt{\alpha_{\rm EdGB}}$ of $\lesssim 0.298$ km. After including high order corrections of EdGB gravity, the bounds improve to $\sqrt{\alpha_{\rm EdGB}} \lesssim 0.260$ km. Analyses of GW230529 also yield a $90\%$ credible upper bounds on the combination of charge-to-mass ratio of the binary components $\zeta \lesssim 0.024$. The constraints are more stringent than those derived from previously observed single gravitational wave merger event.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Mergers in Holographic Space-time Models of Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic space-time, a theory of quantum gravity that generalizes string theory and quantum field theory, predicts black holes in the early matter-dominated era of its models of inflation. Before these black holes can decay, there is a chance that enough of these particles merge to produce radiation visible today in the Cosmic Microwave background. To discover if this is the case, we perform a rudimentary computer simulation. We show that no problematic black holes are formed by mergers in the Holographic Space-time models of inflation. However, we conclude that tiny bound structures containing black holes remnants form in this theory unconditionally. Since black hole decay products are mostly massive standard model particles, and perhaps their superpartners, the fate of these structures is a complicated dynamical problem that requires further study. It suggests the possibility of primordial structures on the order of the horizon size at the beginning of the radiation dominated era. This is about $10^9\ L_P$ in the current model.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Constraining linearly scale-independent modifications of gravity with the spectroscopic and photometric primary probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The future Euclid space satellite mission will offer an invaluable opportunity to constrain modifications to Einstein's general relativity at cosmic scales. We focus on modified gravity models characterised, at linear scales, by a scale-independent growth of perturbations while featuring different testable types of derivative screening mechanisms at smaller non-linear scales. We considered three specific models, namely JBD, a scalar-tensor theory with a flat potential, the nDGP gravity, a braneworld model in which our Universe is a four-dimensional brane embedded in a five-dimensional Minkowski space-time, and $k$-mouflage (KM) gravity, an extension of $k$-essence scenarios with a universal coupling of the scalar field to matter. In preparation for real data, we provide forecasts from spectroscopic and photometric primary probes by Euclid on the cosmological parameters and the additional parameters of the models, respectively, $\omega_{\rm BD}$, $\Omega_{\rm rc}$ and $\epsilon_{2,0}$. The forecast analysis employs the Fisher matrix method applied to weak lensing (WL); photometric galaxy clustering (GCph), spectroscopic galaxy clustering (GCsp) and the cross-correlation (XC) between GCph and WL. In an optimistic setting at 68.3\% confidence interval, we find the following percentage relative errors with Euclid alone: for $\log_{10}{\omega_{\rm BD}}$, with a fiducial value of $\omega_{\rm BD}=800$, 27.1\% using GCsp alone, 3.6\% using GCph+WL+XC and 3.2\% using GCph+WL+XC+GCsp; for $\log_{10}{\Omega_{\rm rc}}$, with a fiducial value of $\Omega_{\rm rc}=0.25$, we find 93.4\%, 20\% and 15\% respectively; and finally, for $\epsilon_{2,0}=-0.04$, we find 3.4\%, 0.15\%, and 0.14\%.

      <description>arXiv:2309.14418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general construction of a geometric notion of circuit complexity for Gaussian states (both bosonic and fermionic) in terms of Riemannian geometry. We lay out general conditions that a Riemannian metric function on the space of Gaussian states should satisfy in order for it to yield a physically reasonable measure of complexity. This general formalism can naturally accommodate modifications to complexity geometries that arise from cost functions that depend nontrivially on the instantaneous state and on the direction on circuit space at each point. We explore these modifications and, as a particular case, we show how to account for time-reversal symmetry breaking in measures of complexity, which is often natural from an experimental (and thermodynamical) perspective, but is absent in commonly studied complexity measures. This establishes a first step towards building a quantitative, geometric notion of complexity that faithfully mimics what is experienced as "easy" or "hard" to implement in a lab from a physically motivated point of view.</description>

      <title>PyMerger: Detecting Binary Black Hole merger from Einstein Telescope Using Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10409v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PyMerger, a Python tool for detecting binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the Einstein Telescope (ET), based on a Deep Residual Neural Network model (ResNet). ResNet was trained on data combined from all three proposed sub-detectors of ET (TSDCD) to detect BBH mergers. Five different lower frequency cutoffs ($F_{\text{low}}$): 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 15 Hz, 20 Hz, and 30 Hz, with match-filter Signal-to-Noise Ratio ($MSNR$) ranges: 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, and &gt;8, were employed in the data simulation. Compared to previous work that utilized data from single sub-detector data (SSDD), the detection accuracy from TSDCD has shown substantial improvements, increasing from $60\%$, $60.5\%$, $84.5\%$, $94.5\%$ to $78.5\%$, $84\%$, $99.5\%$, $100\%$, and $100\%$ for sources with $MSNR$ of 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, and &gt;8, respectively. The ResNet model was evaluated on the first Einstein Telescope mock Data Challenge (ET-MDC1) dataset, where the model demonstrated strong performance in detecting BBH mergers, identifying 5,566 out of 6,578 BBH events, with optimal SNR starting from 1.2, and a minimum and maximum $D_{L}$ of 0.5 Gpc and 148.95 Gpc, respectively. Despite being trained only on BBH mergers without overlapping sources, the model achieved high BBH detection rates. Notably, even though the model was not trained on BNS and BHNS mergers, it successfully detected 11,477 BNS and 323 BHNS mergers in ET-MDC1, with optimal SNR starting from 0.2 and 1, respectively, indicating its potential for broader applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06994v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermodynamics of a heat-conducting ideal gas system. The study is based on i) the first law of thermodynamics from action formulation which expects heat-dependence of energy density and ii) the existence condition of a (local) Lorentz boost between an Eckart observer and a Landau-Lifshitz observer--a condition that extends the stability criterion of thermal equilibrium. The implications of these conditions include: i) Heat contributes to the energy density through the combination $q/n\Theta^2$ where $q$, $n$, and $\Theta$ represent heat, the number density, and the temperature, respectively. ii) The energy density has a unique minimum at $q=0$. iii) The temperature upper bound suppresses the heat dependence of the energy density inverse quadratically. This result explains why the expected heat dependence is difficult to observe in ordinary situation thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton Accretion around the Rotating Hairy Horndeski Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling of the shock cone formed around a static, hairy Horndeski black hole with Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion has been conducted. We model the dynamical changes of the shock cone resulting from the interaction of matter with the Horndeski black hole. The effects of the scalar hair, the black hole rotation parameter, and the impacts of the asymptotic speed have been examined. As the absolute value of the hair parameter increases, the matter in the region of the shock cone is observed to move away from the black hole horizon. After h/M&lt;-0.6, a visible change in the physical structure of the shock cone occurs. On the other hand, it has been revealed that the asymptotic speed significantly affects the formation of the shock cone. As h/M increases in the negative direction and the asymptotic speed increases, the stagnation point moves closer to the black hole horizon. When the value of the hair parameter changes, the rest-mass density of the matter inside the cone decreases, whereas the opposite is observed with the asymptotic speed. Additionally, the formed shock cone has excited QPO modes. The deformation of the cone due to the hair parameter has led to a change or complete disappearance of the QPOs. Meanwhile, at asymptotic speeds of V_{\infty}/c&lt; 0.4, all fundamental frequency modes are formed, while at V_{\infty}/c=0.4, only the azimuthal mode is excited, and 1:2:3:4:... resonance conditions occur. No QPOs have formed at V_{\infty}/c = 0.6. The results obtained from numerical calculations have been compared with theoretical studies for M87*, and it has been observed that the possible values of h/M found in the numerical simulations are consistent with the theory. Additionally, the results have been compared with those for the GRS 1915+105 black hole, and the hair parameters corresponding to the observed frequencies have been determined.</description>

      <title>Infrared finite scattering theory: Amplitudes and soft theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18637</link>

Abstract: Any non-trivial scattering with massless fields in four spacetime dimensions will generically produce an out-state with memory. Scattering with any massless fields violates the standard assumption of asymptotic completeness -- that all "in" and "out" states lie in the standard (zero memory) Fock space -- and therefore leads to infrared (IR) divergences in the standard $S$-matrix amplitudes. In this paper we define an infrared finite scattering theory which assumes only (1) the existence of in/out algebras and (2) that Heisenberg evolution is an automorphism of these algebras. The resulting "superscattering" map $\$$ allows for transitions between different in/out memory states and agrees with the standard $S$-matrix when it is defined. We construct $\$$-amplitudes by defining (3) a "generalized asymptotic completeness" which accommodates states with memory in the space of asymptotic states and (4) a complete basis of improper states which generalize the usual $n$-particle momentum basis to account for states with memory. Using only general properties of $\$$, we prove an analog of the Weinberg soft theorems in quantum gravity and QED which imply that all $\$$-amplitudes are well-defined in the infrared. We comment on how one must generalize this framework to consider $\$$-amplitudes for theories with collinear divergences (e.g., massless QED and Yang-Mills theories).</description>

      <title>A comprehensive data-driven odyssey to explore the equation of state of dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we reconstruct the dark energy equation of the state parameter $w$ from the combination of background and perturbation observations, specifically combining the Hubble parameter data from cosmic chronometer observations and the logarithmic growth rate data from the growth rate observations. We do this analysis using posterior Gaussian process regression without considering any specific cosmological model or parametrization. However there are three main assumptions: (I) a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric is considered for the cosmological background, (II) there is no interaction between dark energy and matter sectors, and (III) for the growth of inhomogeneity, sub-Hubble approximation and linear perturbations are considered. This study is unique in the sense that the reconstruction of $w$ is independent of any derived parameters such as the present values of the matter-energy density parameter and Hubble parameter. From the reconstruction, we look at how the dark energy equation of state evolves between redshifts 0 and 1.5, finding a slight hint of dynamical behavior in dark energy. However, the evidence is not significant. We also find a leaning towards non-phantom behavior over phantom behavior. We observe that the $\Lambda$CDM model ($w=-1$) nearly touches the lower boundary of the 1$\sigma$ confidence region in the redshift range $0.6 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.85$. However, it comfortably resides within the 2$\sigma$ confidence region in the whole redshift range under investigation, $0\leq z \leq 1.5$. Consequently, the non-parametric, model-independent reconstruction of dark energy provides no compelling evidence to deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM model when considering cosmic chronometer and growth rate observations.</description>

      <title>Accelerating universe at early and late times in extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scenario that can explain the early-time inflation and the late-time dark energy within a unified framework. A scalar potential combining power-law and exponential type in a context of extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity is critically important for this realization. A realistic scenario can be achieved in a two-field model in which one directional motion in field space realizes the slow-roll inflation. The inflaton ends up with oscillatory period and turns its direction to another direction that is identified as the quintessence field, giving rise to the dark energy at late times. The inflaton oscillation is expected to realize efficient heating if parametric amplification works. Along the quintessence direction, the present universe is on the way to reach the asymptotic fixed point. We search for successful parameter region, taking potential function in the form of low-order field powers times decreasing exponential in two dimensional field space.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks for black hole interiors: non-isometries, quantum extremal surfaces, and wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use hyperbolic tensor networks to construct a holographic map for black hole interiors that adds a notion of locality to the non-isometric codes proposed by Akers, Engelhardt, Harlow, Penington, and Vardhan. We use tools provided by these networks to study the relationship between non-isometries and quantum extremal surfaces behind the horizon. Furthermore, we introduce a limited notion of dynamics for these interior tensor networks based on the qudit models introduced by Akers et al., and study the evolution of quantum extremal surfaces in an evaporating black hole. We also find a tensor network description of a wormhole connecting the black hole interior to the radiation, providing a mechanism for interior states and operators to be encoded in the radiation after the Page time. As a particular case, we construct a tensor network realization of the backwards-forwards maps recently proposed to incorporate non-trivial effective dynamics in dynamical constructions of these non-isometric black hole codes.</description>
