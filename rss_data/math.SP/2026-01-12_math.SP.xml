      <title>Generalized Spectral Clustering of Low-Inertia Power Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale integration of distributed energy resources has led to a rapid increase in the number of controllable devices and a significant change in system dynamics. This has necessitating the shift towards more distributed and scalable control strategies to manage the increasing system complexity. In this work, we address the problem of partitioning a low-inertia power network into dynamically coherent subsystems to facilitate the utilization of distributed control schemes. We show that an embedding of the power network using the spectrum of the linearized synchronization dynamics matrix results in a natural decomposition of the network. We establish the connection between our approach and the broader framework of spectral clustering using the Laplacian matrix of the admittance network. The proposed method is demonstrated on the IEEE 30-bus test system, and numerical simulations show that the resulting clusters using our approach are dynamically coherent. We consider the robustness of the clusters identified in the network by analyzing the sensitivity of the small eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenspaces, which determines the coherency structure of the oscillator dynamics, to variations in the steady-state operating points of the network.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic behavior of the spectral gap for discrete Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we elaborate on the asymptotic behavior of the spectral gap of a class of discrete Schr\"odinger operators defined on a path graph in the limit of infinite volume. We confirm recent results and generalize them to a larger class of potentials using entirely different methods. Notably, we also resolve a conjecture previously proposed in this context. This then yields new insights into the rate at which the spectral gap tends to zero as the volume increases.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Infinitely Smooth Kernel Matrices in the Single Cluster Limit, with Applications to Multivariate Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of infinitely smooth multivariate kernel matrices when the nodes form a single cluster. We show that the geometry of the nodes plays an important role in the scaling of the eigenvalues of these kernel matrices. For the multivariate Dirichlet kernel matrix, we establish a criterion for the sampling set ensuring precise scaling of eigenvalues. Additionally, we identify specific sampling sets that satisfy this criterion. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the problem of super-resolution, i.e. stable recovery of sparse measures from bandlimited Fourier measurements.</description>

      <title>Quasi-compactness for dominated kernels with application to quasi-stationary distribution theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a domination principle for positive operators, which provides an upper bound on the essential spectral radius and yields quasi-compactness criteria on weighted supremum spaces with Lyapunov type functions and local domination. In particular, for kernels acting on such spaces, we obtain $r_{ess}(P)\leq r_{ess}(Q)$ whenever $0\leq P\leq Q$ as kernels, a property that is known to fail in general on $L^p$ spaces, $p&lt;+\infty$.
  We then describe the asymptotics of iterates of positive quasi-compact kernels, showing convergence, after suitable renormalization, towards a finite decomposition over eigenelements, and we study the long-time behaviour of quasi-compact continuous-time semigroups. For the latter, we prove that measurability in time and quasi-compactness at a single positive time imply quasi-compactness at all times, exclude periodic behaviour, and entail convergence to eigenelements as time goes to infinity.
  Finally, we apply these results to absorbed Markov processes and quasi-stationary distributions. In this setting, the domination and Lyapunov criteria allow one to work in reducible situations and to relax classical regularity assumptions, for instance replacing strong Feller conditions by domination from a regular kernel or by locally uniformly integrable densities on suitable weighted supremum spaces.</description>
