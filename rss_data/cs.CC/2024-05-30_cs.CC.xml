      <title>Complexity of Deciding Injectivity and Surjectivity of ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks with ReLU activation play a key role in modern machine learning. In view of safety-critical applications, the verification of trained networks is of great importance and necessitates a thorough understanding of essential properties of the function computed by a ReLU network, including characteristics like injectivity and surjectivity. Recently, Puthawala et al. [JMLR 2022] came up with a characterization for injectivity of a ReLU layer, which implies an exponential time algorithm. However, the exact computational complexity of deciding injectivity remained open. We answer this question by proving coNP-completeness of deciding injectivity of a ReLU layer. On the positive side, as our main result, we present a parameterized algorithm which yields fixed-parameter tractability of the problem with respect to the input dimension. In addition, we also characterize surjectivity for two-layer ReLU networks with one-dimensional output. Remarkably, the decision problem turns out to be the complement of a basic network verification task. We prove NP-hardness for surjectivity, implying a stronger hardness result than previously known for the network verification problem. Finally, we reveal interesting connections to computational convexity by formulating the surjectivity problem as a zonotope containment problem</description>

      <title>A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Trading Optimization in the Forex Market with Multi-Agent Asynchronous Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's forex market traders increasingly turn to algorithmic trading, leveraging computers to seek more profits. Deep learning techniques as cutting-edge advancements in machine learning, capable of identifying patterns in financial data. Traders utilize these patterns to execute more effective trades, adhering to algorithmic trading rules. Deep reinforcement learning methods (DRL), by directly executing trades based on identified patterns and assessing their profitability, offer advantages over traditional DL approaches. This research pioneers the application of a multi-agent (MA) RL framework with the state-of-the-art Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm. The proposed method employs parallel learning across multiple asynchronous workers, each specialized in trading across multiple currency pairs to explore the potential for nuanced strategies tailored to different market conditions and currency pairs. Two different A3C with lock and without lock MA model was proposed and trained on single currency and multi-currency. The results indicate that both model outperform on Proximal Policy Optimization model. A3C with lock outperforms other in single currency training scenario and A3C without Lock outperforms other in multi-currency scenario. The findings demonstrate that this approach facilitates broader and faster exploration of different currency pairs, significantly enhancing trading returns. Additionally, the agent can learn a more profitable trading strategy in a shorter time.</description>

      <title>On a Hierarchy of Spectral Invariants for Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a hierarchy of graph invariants that naturally extends the spectral invariants defined by F\"urer (Lin. Alg. Appl. 2010) based on the angles formed by the set of standard basis vectors and their projections onto eigenspaces of the adjacency matrix. We provide a purely combinatorial characterization of this hierarchy in terms of the walk counts. This allows us to give a complete answer to F\"urer's question about the strength of his invariants in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs in comparison to the 2-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, extending the recent work of Rattan and Seppelt (SODA 2023). As another application of the characterization, we prove that almost all graphs are determined up to isomorphism in terms of the spectrum and the angles, which is of interest in view of the long-standing open problem whether almost all graphs are determined by their eigenvalues alone. Finally, we describe the exact relationship between the hierarchy and the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms for small dimensions, as also some other important spectral characteristics of a graph such as the generalized and the main spectra.</description>

      <title>Canonization of a random circulant graph by counting walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that almost all graphs are canonizable by a simple combinatorial routine known as color refinement. With high probability, this method assigns a unique label to each vertex of a random input graph and, hence, it is applicable only to asymmetric graphs. The strength of combinatorial refinement techniques becomes a subtle issue if the input graphs are highly symmetric. We prove that the combination of color refinement with vertex individualization produces a canonical labeling for almost all circulant digraphs (Cayley digraphs of a cyclic group). To our best knowledge, this is the first application of combinatorial refinement in the realm of vertex-transitive graphs. Remarkably, we do not even need the full power of the color refinement algorithm. We show that the canonical label of a vertex $v$ can be obtained just by counting walks of each length from $v$ to an individualized vertex. Our analysis also implies that almost all circulant graphs are canonizable by Tinhofer's canonization procedure. Finally, we show that a canonical Cayley representation can be constructed for almost all circulant graphs by the 2-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimal Communication Complexity of Chained Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the CHAIN communication problem introduced by Cormode et al. [ICALP 2019]. It is a generalization of the well-studied INDEX problem. For $k\geq 1$, in CHAIN$_{n,k}$, there are $k$ instances of INDEX, all with the same answer. They are shared between $k+1$ players as follows. Player 1 has the first string $X^1 \in \{0,1\}^n$, player 2 has the first index $\sigma^1 \in [n]$ and the second string $X^2 \in \{0,1\}^n$, player 3 has the second index $\sigma^2 \in [n]$ along with the third string $X^3 \in \{0,1\}^n$, and so on. Player $k+1$ has the last index $\sigma^k \in [n]$. The communication is one way from each player to the next, starting from player 1 to player 2, then from player 2 to player 3 and so on. Player $k+1$, after receiving the message from player $k$, has to output a single bit which is the answer to all $k$ instances of INDEX.
  It was proved that the CHAIN$_{n,k}$ problem requires $\Omega(n/k^2)$ communication by Cormode et al., and they used it to prove streaming lower bounds for approximation of maximum independent sets. Subsequently, it was used by Feldman et al. [STOC 2020] to prove lower bounds for streaming submodular maximization. However, these works do not get optimal bounds on the communication complexity of CHAIN$_{n,k}$, and in fact, it was conjectured by Cormode et al. that $\Omega(n)$ bits are necessary, for any $k$.
  As our main result, we prove the optimal lower bound of $\Omega(n)$ for CHAIN$_{n,k}$. This settles the open conjecture of Cormode et al. in the affirmative. The key technique is to use information theoretic tools to analyze protocols over the Jensen-Shannon divergence measure, as opposed to total variation distance. As a corollary, we get an improved lower bound for approximation of maximum independent set in vertex arrival streams through a reduction from CHAIN directly.</description>

      <title>New Quantum Algorithms for Computing Quantum Entropies and Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a series of quantum algorithms for computing a wide range of quantum entropies and distances, including the von Neumann entropy, quantum R\'{e}nyi entropy, trace distance, and fidelity. The proposed algorithms significantly outperform the prior best (and even quantum) ones in the low-rank case, some of which achieve exponential speedups. In particular, for $N$-dimensional quantum states of rank $r$, our proposed quantum algorithms for computing the von Neumann entropy, trace distance and fidelity within additive error $\varepsilon$ have time complexity of $\tilde O(r/\varepsilon^2)$, $\tilde O(r^5/\varepsilon^6)$ and $\tilde O(r^{6.5}/\varepsilon^{7.5})$, respectively. By contrast, prior quantum algorithms for the von Neumann entropy and trace distance usually have time complexity $\Omega(N)$, and the prior best one for fidelity has time complexity $\tilde O(r^{12.5}/\varepsilon^{13.5})$.
  The key idea of our quantum algorithms is to extend block-encoding from unitary operators in previous work to quantum states (i.e., density operators). It is realized by developing several convenient techniques to manipulate quantum states and extract information from them. The advantage of our techniques over the existing methods is that no restrictions on density operators are required; in sharp contrast, the previous methods usually require a lower bound on the minimal non-zero eigenvalue of density operators.</description>

      <title>Statistical and Computational Guarantees of Kernel Max-Sliced Wasserstein Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport has been very successful for various machine learning tasks; however, it is known to suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Hence, dimensionality reduction is desirable when applied to high-dimensional data with low-dimensional structures. The kernel max-sliced (KMS) Wasserstein distance is developed for this purpose by finding an optimal nonlinear mapping that reduces data into $1$ dimensions before computing the Wasserstein distance. However, its theoretical properties have not yet been fully developed. In this paper, we provide sharp finite-sample guarantees under milder technical assumptions compared with state-of-the-art for the KMS $p$-Wasserstein distance between two empirical distributions with $n$ samples for general $p\in[1,\infty)$. Algorithm-wise, we show that computing the KMS $2$-Wasserstein distance is NP-hard, and then we further propose a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) formulation (which can be solved efficiently in polynomial time) and provide a relaxation gap for the SDP solution. We provide numerical examples to demonstrate the good performance of our scheme for high-dimensional two-sample testing.</description>
