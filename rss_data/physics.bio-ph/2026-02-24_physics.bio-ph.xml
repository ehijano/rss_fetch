      <title>The arrangement of anisotropic spin couplings can optimize sensitivity of the cryptochrome radical pair to the direction of geomagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing of the geomagnetic field direction by many living organisms is commonly thought to involve radical pairs, such as those formed photochemically between the flavin and tryptophan radicals in the cryptochrome proteins. Previous theoretical studies have shown that strongly axial hyperfine couplings in the cryptochrome radicals greatly enhance the formation of a signaling state of the protein when the magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the hyperfine axis of either of the radicals. However, further analysis led to the conclusion that sharpness of detecting those magnetic directions is strongly suppressed by the inter-radical electron spin coupling. Here, we perform theoretical simulations of the compass function for a set of arrangements of the intra- and inter-radical spin couplings in the idealized cryptochrome radical pair, and find certain arrangements that preserve the sharpness in detecting the direction of the geomagnetic field. One particular arrangement, with the hyperfine axes of the radicals orthogonal to the symmetry axis of inter-radical coupling, provides even sharper field-direction sensitivity than that contributed solely by the anisotropy of the hyperfine coupling.</description>

      <title>Collective Variable-Guided Engineering of the Free-Energy Surface of a Small Peptide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering the free-energy surfaces (FES) of proteins and peptides is central to controlling conformational ensembles and their responses to perturbations. However, predicting how chemical modifications such as point mutations reshape the FES and shift conformational equilibria remains challenging, particularly in data-scarce settings. Building on the Collective Variables for Free Energy Surface Tailoring (CV-FEST) framework, we develop a computational approach that leverages short, unbiased molecular dynamics trajectories to guide mutation analysis. Using the ten-residue beta-hairpin CLN025 and a systematic library of its single-point mutants, we apply Harmonic Linear Discriminant Analysis (HLDA) to extract collective variables from the conformational data. We find that the HLDA eigenvector learned solely from short wild-type trajectories provides residue-level insight into the propensity of mutations at specific positions to thermodynamically stabilize or destabilize the folded state. Extending this analysis, we show that shifts in the leading HLDA eigenvalue across mutants, a measure of changes in separability between the conformational ensembles along the HLDA coordinate, correlate strongly with mutation-induced changes in the free-energy difference between states, as reflected in melting temperatures. Benchmarked against Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics simulations, these findings suggest a promising and computationally affordable route toward guiding the engineering of biomolecular free-energy landscapes.</description>

      <title>Guiding Peptide Kinetics via Collective-Variable Tuning of Free-Energy Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent advances in AI have transformed protein structure prediction, protein function is also often strongly influenced by the thermodynamic and kinetic features encoded in its underlying free-energy surface. Here, we propose a framework to rationally modify these surfaces in order to control conformational transition rates, built on the Collective Variables for Free Energy Surface Tailoring (CV-FEST) framework, and validate it on point mutations of the miniprotein Chignolin. The framework relies on Harmonic Linear Discriminant Analysis (HLDA) based collective variables (CVs) constructed from short molecular dynamics trajectories restricted to the metastable states, requiring only limited sampling within each state. Notably, the HLDA CV derived solely from the wild-type system already provides residue-level scores that predict whether mutations at specific positions are likely to accelerate or slow conformational transitions. Furthermore, we find that the leading HLDA eigenvalue associated with the derived CV, a quantitative measure of the one-dimensional statistical separation between folded and unfolded ensembles, correlates strongly with conformational transition rates across mutations. Together, these results show that kinetic effects of point mutations can be inferred from minimal local sampling, providing a practical route to the rational engineering of conformational transition rates without exhaustive simulations or large training datasets.</description>

      <title>Microwave focusing with temporal interference for non-invasive deep brain stimulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is effective in treating neurological disorders but involves invasive surgery. Non-invasive DBS aims to overcome surgical risks by means of externally applied electromagnetic fields. In this work, we present a method for non-invasive microwave focusing of amplitude-modulated electric fields in the human brain using an external antenna array. The method combines iterative time-reversal (iTR) and genetic-algorithm-based temporal interference (TI) optimization to determine antenna positions, orientations, operating frequency, amplitudes, and phases of each element. Magnetic point dipoles are used as idealized radiative sources, providing a design-independent benchmark for optimization studies. Furthermore, this work incorporates realistic tissue properties from voxelized anatomical head models, accounting for variations in permittivity and conductivity. The iTR algorithm provides an initial antenna configuration that serves as a reliable starting point for the subsequent TI optimization, improving convergence and focusing precision. The results demonstrate that amplitude-modulated electromagnetic fields can be selectively and precisely shaped within predefined focal regions. Thereby, this study demonstrates a proof-of-principle of non-invasive microwave field focusing using iTR and TI in a realistic human head model.</description>

      <title>Liquid photonic-molecule microlasers for ultrasensitive biosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplet microlasers, as promising tools for biophotonics and biomedical sciences, have witnessed rapid advances due to their flexible reconfigurability, high sensitivity to stimuli, and label-free biosensing ability. However, designing these biosensors with simultaneously critical properties of low lasing threshold, high spectral purity, and ultimate sensitivity remains challenging. Here, we propose a versatile strategy to build liquid photonic molecules (LPMs) that combine all these features in a single device. We find that through tailoring the spectral Vernier overlap in size-mismatched droplets, this device enables single-mode lasing with a low threshold of ~610 nJ mm-2. The LPM lasers are engineered for dynamic tunability using a molecular isomerization strategy, which induces spectral mode hopping and thus yields a nearly ten-fold enhancement in spectral sensitivity over single droplets. Moreover, by leveraging the self-referenced intensity response of the LPM lasing modes, we demonstrate a three-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in biomolecular sensing, with a detection limit of 30 aM and a dynamic range spanning nine orders of magnitude. Our work offers exciting prospects for bio-integrated liquid sensors in diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Three-slab model for the dielectric permittivity of a lipid bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A model for the tensorial dielectric permittivity of phospholipid membranes is presented here. The four-nanometer-thick membrane is treated as a composite made up of three dielectric slabs: one for each of the two phospholipid head-group regions, and one for the entire domain spanned by the lipid tails. Equal and opposite bound surface charge densities surround each head-group slab, and account for the membrane dipole potential. Three-slab model parameters are obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, and capture both the zero-field electric potential and the membrane response to applied electric fields. The tail region is well-approximated as having vacuum permittivity, while the head-group region is highly anisotropic due to the configurations of molecular dipoles. For the bilayers studied, the out-of-plane permittivity of the head-group region is 10--15 times that of the vacuum, while the in-plane permittivity is an order of magnitude larger. Membrane responses to applied electric fields up to 30 millivolts per nanometer are found to be in the linear regime. The model overcomes a fundamental limitation of microscopic theories -- where the out-of-plane permittivity is ill-posed in the head-group region due to large gradients in the local electric field -- by averaging over slab widths, thereby introducing new length scales. Our approach can be extended to characterize general interfacial systems with similarly ill-defined permittivities.</description>

      <title>Geometric Limits of Mitotic Pressure Under Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cells often divide under mechanical confinement, where surrounding structures restrict shape changes during cytokinesis. Although forces generated during confined division have been measured experimentally, it remains unclear how confinement geometry and mechanics determine the transmitted force. Here we develop a minimal mechanical theory of cell division under confinement. Modeling the cell as an incompressible volume bounded by an interface with effective isotropic tension, we show that confinement restricts the set of mechanically admissible furrow shapes. As the furrow radius decreases, it reaches it reaches a confinement-induced minimum. Beyond this point, further ingression does not alter the interface shape, and both pressure and axial force saturate. We analyze force and pressure in rigid, soft, and strong three-dimensional confinement and demonstrate that a single geometric mechanism underlies these distinct cases. After rescaling force and length by the appropriate geometric scale, cells of different size and surface tension collapse onto a single universal curve. The relevant length scale is the cell size for rigid and soft confinement, and the confinement size in fully enclosing three-dimensional confinement. In soft confinement, environmental stiffness and spindle-generated axial forces determine the operating force and pressure, while the geometric constraint fixes the maximal attainable levels. In summary, our results show that mitotic force transmission and mitotic pressure during cytokinesis are bounded by confinement geometry, with material properties and active forces selecting the operating point within these geometry-imposed limits.</description>

      <title>Feasibility as a moving target: Fluctuating species interactions lead to universal power law in equilibrium abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical ecology has traditionally equated persistence with the stability of a fixed equilibrium point. Here we argue that the primary threat to ecosystem persistence need not be the loss of stability, but instead the escape of the stable equilibrium to a negative orthant. In a realistic setting, fluctuations in interactions do not merely disturb abundances about an equilibrium but can displace the equilibrium point itself. We theoretically and empirically analyze such displacements of the equilibrium point in a complex community. Theoretically, we find that light-tailed fluctuations in species interactions, no matter how small, lead to a heavy-tailed power law $P(y)=1/y^\alpha$ for the equilibrium abundance $y$ of a species. Remarkably, the exponent $\alpha=2$ is a universal value independent of interaction structure, community size, and species. Empirically, our analysis of 34 species reveals a power law signal for most, with a median exponent $\alpha \sim2.56$. Next, we derive a formula for the critical noise, $\sigma_c$, beyond which the community experiences feasibility loss ``with near certainty''. We find that $\sigma_c(N)\sim N^{-1}$, implying that larger communities are significantly more fragile to noise induced feasibility loss. Lastly, we define and calculate biologically measurable analytical metrics for both global and species-specific feasibility escape rates, and implement these metrics in dynamic simulations of 98 real world mutualistic and food web networks, to successfully predict their fragility.</description>

      <title>Critical Scaling and Metabolic Regulation in a Ginzburg--Landau Theory of Cognitive Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a phenomenological effective field theory in which biological intelligence emerges as a macroscopic order parameter sustained by continuous metabolic flux. By modeling cognition as a coarse-grained neural activity field governed by a variational free energy, we derive closed-form expressions for information capacity and structural susceptibility using a Gaussian maximum entropy approximation. The theory predicts a universal algebraic divergence of the susceptibility, $\chi \sim K^{-3/2}$, as the structural stiffness $K$ approaches the instability threshold. The exponent $\gamma = 3/2$ is consistent with the mean-field branching process universality class, thereby providing a theoretical rationale for the observed avalanche size exponent $\tau \approx 3/2$ in cortical dynamics without invoking microscopic equivalence. We identify adult cognition as a metabolically pinned non-equilibrium steady state maintained near the critical regime $\Gamma \equiv K/\alpha \approx 1$ by continuous metabolic regulation, while pathological decline corresponds to a delocalization transition triggered by the violation of structural stability conditions. The framework generates concrete, falsifiable predictions for attention scaling, altered states of consciousness, and transcranial magnetic stimulation responses, each of which can be tested against existing neuroimaging and electrophysiological datasets.</description>

      <title>A label-free method to quantify early-stage amyloid aggregation under flow via intrinsic phenylalanine fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aggregation of amyloid-forming peptides is a dynamic, complex process that underlies their diverse biological activities, from physiological functions to disease-associated dysfunctions. While the structure of fibrillar end-products is well-characterized for most amyloids, the heterogeneous and often transient oligomers, likely key in cytotoxicity, remain poorly investigated, especially for peptides with low-yield aromatic residues. Here, by exploiting and developing flow induced dispersion analysis in both peak and front modes, we demonstrate that intrinsic phenylalanine fluorescence can be harnessed to quantify the conversion of diffusing monomers into non-diffusing oligomers and fibrils. We further characterize low-molecular-weight oligomers, and their size evolution from 2 to 10 nm over time. Importantly, we validate the robustness of our approach using two tryptophan-free and fast-fibrillating amyloid peptides, PSM$\alpha$3 and hIAPP, known for their key roles in S. aureus virulence and type 2 diabetes respectively. Our results overcome the limitations of traditional biochemical and biophysical amyloid assays by extending analysis from large oligomers and fibrils to small heterogeneous oligomers, under near-physiological conditions. This study thus offers a new analytical framework, thereby filling a critical gap in amyloid research, to probe the early stages of aggregation, key in the design of alternative therapeutics for amyloid-diseases.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis of cell aggregates: morphology and dynamics of migrating active droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological tissues have been observed to display emergent fluid-like properties, owing to physical interactions between cells. However, it remains unclear in general how these fluid-like properties affect tissue structure and function. Here, we are motivated by recent experiments in which cell aggregates were observed to behave as active droplets during collective migration along chemical gradients, or chemotaxis. To understand this process, we develop a minimal model of a growing thin active droplet driven by a self-generated chemical gradient. In broad agreement with the experiments, dynamic simulations reveal that chemotacting droplets exhibit proliferation-driven morphological transitions. To fully characterise these transitions, we perform a multiple scales analysis to show that the droplet dynamics follow a sequence of travelling wave solutions defined by a nonlinear eigenvalue problem parametrised by the slowly increasing droplet volume. Our analysis reveals that morphological transitions can occur continuously or through a discontinuous bifurcation. Further asymptotic analysis of the travelling wave problem reveals that these morphological transitions arise from exponentially small ("beyond-all-orders") asymptotic terms that originate from the rear and front contact lines. Moreover, we show that the nature of the transitions is fully determined by two key dimensionless parameters, which quantify the internal stress balance within the droplet and the strength of the coupling between the droplet migration dynamics and the external chemical field. Overall, our results provide a complete characterisation of the morphodynamics of a class of migrating active thin droplets, with implications in a range of biological systems where cell aggregates exhibit fluid-like behaviour.</description>

Abstract: In the context of multi-agent systems of binary interacting particles, a kinetic model for action potential dynamics on a neural network is proposed, accounting for heterogeneity in the neuron-to-neuron connections, as well as in the brain structure. Two levels of description are coupled: in a single area, pairwise neuron interactions for the exchange of membrane potential are statistically described; among different areas, a graph description of the brain network topology is included. Equilibria of the kinetic and macroscopic settings are determined and numerical simulations of the system dynamics are performed with the aim of studying the influence of the network heterogeneities on the membrane potential propagation and synchronization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In eukaryotic cells, mitochondria form networks that range from highly fused interconnected structures to fragmented populations of individual organelles that undergo transient interactions. These structures can be described as temporal networks of physical units, whose dynamic topology is determined by fusion, fission, and motion of the mitochondria through intracellular space. The heterogeneity of the mitochondrial population is governed by diffusive transport and inter-unit exchange of proteins, lipids, ions, and RNA within these networks. We present a unifying framework for the dispersion of material within temporal networks of spatially embedded units that span across a broad connectivity range. Specifically, we consider filling of the networks with a locally produced but globally consumed material, demonstrating that the steady-state content is determined by the balance of timescales for spatial encounter between clusters, local fusion, fission, and diffusive transport within a cluster. As the connectivity increases, filling behavior transitions from three-dimensional spread through a `social network' limited by cluster interactions to low-dimensional transport through a largely stationary `physical network' limited by material diffusivity. We extract parameters for mitochondrial networks in three human cell lines, demonstrating that different cells can access both the social and the physical network regimes. These results provide a quantitative basis for predicting the homogenization of biomolecules through a mitochondrial population. Our framework unifies a variety of temporal network structures into an overarching theory for transport through populations of interacting and interconnected units.</description>

Abstract: The distribution and interactions of cellular organelles play a critical role in mediating cellular physiology and pathology. Large-scale electron microscopy enables visualization of organelle distribution and interactions at the tissue level with nanometer resolution, but robust and efficient computational analysis tools are lacking. Here, we present a deep learning tool for universal large-scale 2D/3D electron microscopy analysis, DeepOrganelle. This new tool enables high-throughput, cell-resolved spatiotemporal mapping and digitization of organelle distribution and interactions. When applied to spermatogenesis across 12 stages and 22 differentiation status of the germ cells, DeepOrganelle uncovered previously unrecognized, stage-dependent dynamics of mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contact sites within one subphase of prophase I during meiosis. It also revealed coordinated organelle redistribution in Sertoli cells towards the blood-testis barrier, digitizing the remodeling dynamics of the tissue. This study demonstrates that DeepOrganelle provides a powerful framework that captures subcellular dynamics at the whole-tissue level.</description>

      <title>Attractive and repulsive terms in multi-filament dispersion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00419v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filamentary objects such as nano-wires, nanotubes and DNA are of current interest in physics, nanoscience, chemistry, biology and medicine. They can interact via strong, exceptionally long-ranged many-object van der Waals (vdW, dispersion) forces, causing them to cluster into multi-object bundles. We analyse their vdW interactions perturbatively, predicting $N$-object vdW energy contributions that alternate in sign with increasing $N$. Our findings are confirmed here via the first detailed analysis of a 4-cylinder vdW model. We also provide novel insights permitting these tendencies to be understood simply in terms of electronic screening and anti-screening. Our results suggest that a non-perturbative calculation will be required for reliable prediction of dispersion interactions in these ubiquitous systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Non-reciprocally Interacting Particles and Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions that violate Newton's law 'actio=reactio' are ubiquitous in nature and are currently intensively investigated in active matter, chemical reaction networks, population dynamics, and many other fields. An outstanding challenge is the thermodynamically consistent formulation of the underlying stochastic dynamics that obeys local detailed balance and allows for a rigorous analysis of the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting particles. Here, we present such a framework for a broad class of active systems and derive by systematic coarse-graining exact expressions for the macroscopic entropy production. Four independent contributions to the thermodynamic dissipation can be identified, among which the energy flux sustaining vorticity currents manifests the presence of non-reciprocal interactions. Then, Onsager's non-reciprocal relations, the fluctuation-response relation, the fluctuation relation and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for non-reciprocal systems are derived. Finally, we demonstrate that our general framework is applicable to a plethora of active matter systems and chemical reaction networks and opens new paths to understand the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Effective synchronization amid noise-induced chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two remote agents with synchronized clocks may use them to act in concert and communicate. This necessitates some means of creating and maintaining synchrony. One method, not requiring any direct interaction between the agents, is to expose them to a common, environmental, stochastic forcing. This "noise-induced synchronization" only occurs under sufficiently mild forcing; stronger forcing disrupts synchronization. We investigate the regime of strong noise, where the clocks' relative phases evolve chaotically. Using a simple realization of disruptive noise, we demonstrate effective synchronization. First, although the relative phases of the two clocks varied erratically, we confirm that they became statistically independent of initial conditions and hence equivalent after a well-defined timescale. Second, we show that an agent can estimate an effective phase that closely agrees with the other's phase. Thus, synchronization is practically attainable beyond the regime of conventional noise-induced synchronization. We finally discuss how it might be used in living systems.</description>

      <title>Ion Permeation in Nanoscale Films: Fundamental Limitation and Evaluation of Dielectric Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale films play a central role in biology and osmotic separations. Their water/salt selectivity is often regarded as intrinsic property, favoring thinner membranes for faster permeation. Here we highlight and quantify a fundamental limitation arising from the dependence of ion self-energy on film thickness, governed by its ratio to Bjerrum length. The resulting relation factors out this dependence from intrinsic ion permeability, which agrees well with available data and enables evaluation of dielectric properties of ultrathin films, advancing understanding of ion transport in membranes.</description>

      <title>Osmotic forces modify lipid membrane fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10352</link>

Abstract: In hydrodynamic descriptions of lipid bilayers, the membrane is often approximated as being impermeable to the surrounding, solute-containing fluid. However, biological and in vitro lipid membranes are influenced by their permeability and the resultant osmotic forces -- whose effects remain poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of a fluctuating, planar lipid membrane that is ideally selective: fluid can pass through it, while the electrically-neutral solutes cannot. We find that the canonical membrane relaxation mode, in which internal membrane forces are balanced by fluid drag, no longer exists over all wavenumbers. Rather, this mode only exists when it is slower than solute diffusion -- corresponding to a finite range of wavenumbers. The well-known equipartition result quantifying the size of membrane undulations due to thermal perturbations is consequently limited in its validity to the aforementioned range. Moreover, this range shrinks as the membrane surface tension is increased, and above a critical tension the membrane mode vanishes. Our findings are relevant when interpreting experimental measurements of membrane fluctuations, especially in vesicles at moderate to high tensions.</description>

      <title>The Beauty of Mathematics in Helfrich's Biomembrane Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16002</link>

Abstract: It is with great regret that Prof. Wolfgang Helfrich passed away on 28 September 2025 in Berlin. As the founder of the membrane liquid crystal model, Prof. Helfrich made outstanding contributions to membrane physics and liquid crystal display technology. This review article is written in his memory. Biomembranes, primarily composed of lipid bilayers, are not merely passive barriers but dynamic and complex materials whose shapes are governed by the principles of soft matter physics. This review explores the shape problem in biomembranes through the lens of material science and liquid crystal theory. Beginning with classical analogies to crystals and soap bubbles, it details the application of the Helfrich elastic model to explain the biconcave shape of red blood cells. The discussion extends to multi-layer systems, drawing parallels between the focal conic structures of smectic liquid crystals, the geometries of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, and the reversible transitions in peptide assemblies. Furthermore, it examines icosahedral self-assemblies and shape formation in two-dimensional lipid monolayers at air/water interfaces. At the end of the paper, we find that the shapes such as cylinders, spheres, tori, bicocave discoids and Delaunay surfaces form a group. This result is merely an intrinsic geometric feature of these shapes and is independent of the biomembrane equation. When the pressure on the membrane, surface tension, and bending modules meet certain conditions, the biomembrane will take on these shapes. The review concludes by highlighting the unifying power of continuum elastic theories in describing a vast array of membrane morphologies across biological and synthetic systems.</description>
