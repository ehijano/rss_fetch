      <title>Thin-film boundary-layer diffusion of non-equilibrium flow to kinetically limited reactive surfaces via Damk\"ohler thermochemistry tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional ablation thermochemistry tables for atmospheric entry are derived from boundary-layer element diffusion assuming homogeneous and heterogeneous thermochemical equilibrium at the vehicle surface. Prior techniques for finite-rate surface reactions predominantly embed specific heterogeneous reaction models within the homogeneous equilibrium solution procedures and tables. This paper disseminates a boundary-layer integral solution for wall-gas free oxygen coupled to finite-rate surface kinetics. Solutions are pre-tabulated along normalized kinetics variables without direct integration into an equilibrium thermochemistry solver. This technique allows greater flexibility in presumed kinetics rates and wall-gas conditions in simple air-carbon systems, but the extensibility to state-of-the-art simulations and complex materials remains uncertain. A derivation and preliminary results are presented to the encourage further development.</description>

      <title>Whisker-Like Sensors: Effective Design, Pauline Pounds, Manivannan M</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bio-inspired whisker sensors are employed in diverse applications such as fluid-flow sensing, texture analysis, and environmental exploration. However, existing designs often face challenges related to durability, fabrication complexity, and response consistency. To address these issues, we propose a modular architecture that decomposes whisker sensors into five functional components: the whisker element (WE), compliant element (CE), sensing element (SE), support structure (SS), and data acquisition module (DAQ). We develop and compare four in-house sensor designs built using this architecture, each differing in material choice, sensing modality, and mechanical structure. To unify heterogeneous sensor outputs, we introduce a calibration strategy that maps raw sensor readings-whether from pressure, magnetic flux, or visual features-into a common representation: the bending moment at the whisker base. This representation supports consistent interpretation and comparison across sensing techniques. We adopt texture roughness analysis as a representative sensing task to evaluate design trade-offs. Each whisker sensor's frequency-domain response is benchmarked against a high-resolution laser sensor using standardized roughness specimens. Empirical results show that rigid whiskers improve accuracy in texture classification, while flexible whiskers provide robustness for exploratory robotics tasks. Among the evaluated designs, the Hall-effect sensor with a rubber CE demonstrates the most favorable balance of durability, reconfigurability, and fabrication simplicity.</description>

      <title>The hot-electron closure of the moment-based gyrokinetic plasma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the hot-electron limit (HEL) closure of the moment hierarchy used to solve the gyrokinetic equations, denoted as gyromoment (GM). By expanding gyroaveraging kernels in the small temperature ratio Ti/Te limit and retaining only essential O(Ti/Te) terms, we obtain a closed system for density, parallel velocity, and parallel and perpendicular temperatures. In the Z-pinch geometry, the GM system with HEL closure is analytically equivalent to the one developed by Ivanov et al. (2022). Numerical benchmarks confirm the closure's accuracy in Z-pinch geometry, reproducing established linear growth rates, nonlinear heat transport, and low-collisionality dynamics. Extension to tokamak-relevant s-alpha geometry, and comparison with gyrokinetic simulations, reveals the HEL closed GM model capabilities and limitations: while transport levels and temporal dynamics are qualitatively preserved even at Ti/Te=1, the absence of higher-order kinetic moments prevents accurate Dimits shift prediction and transport suppression.</description>

      <title>Twisting Signals for Joint Radar-Communications: An OAM Vortex Beam Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) technology has attracted much research interest in recent years because of its characteristic helical phase front twisting around the propagation axis and natural orthogonality among different OAM states to encode more degrees of freedom than classical planar beams. Leveraging upon these features, OAM technique has been applied to wireless communication systems to enhance spectral efficiency and radar systems to distinguish spatial targets without beam scanning. Leveraging upon these unique properties, we propose an OAM-based millimeter-wave joint radar-communications (JRC) system comprising a bi-static automotive radar and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Different from existing uniform circular array (UCA) based OAM systems where each element is an isotropic antenna, an OAM spatial modulation scheme utilizing a uniform linear array (ULA) is adopted with each element being a traveling-wave antenna, producing multiple Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) vortex beams simultaneously. Specifically, we first build a novel bi-static automotive OAM-JRC model that embeds communication messages in a radar signal, following which a target position and velocity parameters estimation algorithm is designed with only radar frames. Then, an OAM-based mode-division multiplexing (MDM) strategy between radar and JRC frames is presented to ensure the JRC parameters identifiability and recovery. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the JRC system through deriving recovery guarantees and Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of radar target parameters and evaluating the bit error rate (BER) of communication, respectively. Our numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed OAM-based JRC system and parameter estimation method.</description>

      <title>Photon Blockade Mediated by Two-Photon Absorption in an Optical Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon blockade (PB) is a quantum effect in strongly nonlinear systems where a single photon prevents the system from being excited to a higher level, generating anti-bunched light fields. It enables the generation of single-photon sources for quantum information processing. Conventional photon blockade (CPB) leverages strong nonlinear interactions to generate an anharmonic energy spectrum. Unconventional photon blockade (UPB) utilizes destructive quantum interference between excitation pathways. Recently, environmentally induced photon blockade (EPB) has emerged as a novel approach, exploiting two-photon absorption (TPA) to realize photon blockade. In this work, we combine UPB and EPB together, considering the TPA effect in the optical parametric amplifier (OPA), thereby achieving a more stable PB with stronger suppression of multi-photon states.</description>

      <title>Barrier Electrostatics and Contact Engineering for Ultra-Wide Bandgap AlGaN HFETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructure field-effect transistors (HFETs) exhibiting a high breakdown field (&gt; 5.3 MV/cm) and a low contact resistance (~1.55 {\Omega}mm), tailored for high-power radiofrequency applications. A split-doped barrier architecture, employing two distinct doping concentrations, is shown to enhance both the breakdown field and contact resistance. This design enables a state-of-the-art combination of maximum drain current (487 mA/mm) and breakdown field, along with a high cutoff frequency of 7.2 GHz. These results demonstrate a viable pathway to push device performance toward the material limits while minimizing contact resistance in UWBG AlGaN HFETs, paving the way for next-generation high-power, high-frequency applications.</description>

      <title>Phase-matched Deep Ultraviolet Chiral Bound States in the Continuum Metalens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent light sources in deep ultra-violet (DUV) is essential for various applications such as biomedical imaging and biosensing. Nonlinear crystals (NLCs) generate DUV light, but limited by its bulky thickness, low transparency, and strict narrowband phase-matching conditions. Demonstrating compact, broadband, chiral, and focused DUV light integrated device is elusive. In this work, we present the first demonstration of chiral DUV third harmonic generation (THG) in a dielectric metasurface made from crystalline silicon (c-Si) of compact thickness 400 nm. Metasurface supports chiral bound states in the continuum resonance at fundamental wavelength 800 nm with experimental high Q-factor of 130 and modal phase-matched plasmonic resonance at the third harmonic wavelength for efficient THG. Generating DUV-THG power is up to 12 nW using peak power of 15 GW/cm2. Furthermore, we developed a nonlocal metalens operating in DUV for focusing the chiral DUV-THG using the same chiral BIC cavity and phase-gradient approach. Our platform creates efficient, ultracompact, and multifunctional integrated devices for future integrated DUV nanophotonics devices in MedTech, imaging, and advanced manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Arbitrary Splitting-Ratio Optical Splitter Based on Low-Loss Sb2Se3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable beam splitters capable of being arbitrarily programmed for the power splitting ratios are vital for the adaptive optical networks and photonic computing. Conventional mechanisms such as thermo-optic, free-carrier, or mechanical tuning are usually volatile and require continuous power, limiting their suitability for low-frequency and low power-consumption programmable operations. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an electrically reconfigurable beam splitter based on the low-loss phase-change material Sb2Se3, enabling multi-level and arbitrary splitting-ratio (SR) control. By locally triggering phase transitions in the coupling region with integrated micro-electrodes, we exploit the high refractive-index contrast between different phases and negligible absorption in the near-infrared wavelength of Sb2Se3 to precisely tune the coupling strength with non-volatile retention. 8-level of power splitting states is achieved within a compact footprint of ~14.5-{\mu}m in the experiments, with insertion loss is ~1 dB across 1515-1550 nm and near-zero static power. Combining the advantages of compactness, broad bandwidth, low loss, non-volatility, and multi-level control experimentally, this device provides a universal building block for scalable, energy-efficient reconfigurable photonic circuits, with great prospects in optical computing and intelligent communication systems.</description>

      <title>Contact line friction of bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact line friction (CLF) of bubbles is ubiquitous, from bubbles on a beer glass to H2 bubbles sliding over electrodes in electrolysis. However, a fundamental understanding of CLF of bubbles is still missing, mainly due to the challenge of precisely controlling bubble sliding. For example, it is not clear how bubbles start sliding and how CLF of bubbles depends on velocity. We therefore developed a bubble friction force instrument to directly measure bubble CLF. This force develops from a static regime, through a transition, to a kinetic regime. This entire process is quantitatively described by a modified Kawasaki-Furmidge equation. Bubble CLF was measured for velocities from 0.2 micron/s to 2 mm/s, revealing a transition from a constant CLF regime below about 60 micron/s to a velocity-dependent CLF regime on surfaces with various wettability. The velocity dependence stems from interfacial adaptation governed by the liquid ionic environment with a relaxation time of around 10 microsecond. Moreover, CLF of bubbles can be measured on hydrophilic surfaces and under a challenging H2 atmosphere, overcoming the limitations of current droplet-based methods. Our results provide a quantitative basis for understanding CLF of bubbles with relevance to many applications, including bubble manipulation and electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous real-time multispectral fluorescence and reflectance imaging for enhanced intraoperative guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intraoperative optical imaging is essential for surgical precision and patient safety, but current systems present anatomical and fluorescence information separately, causing delays and increasing cognitive load. A unified system for simultaneous visualization is critically needed to enhance guidance and efficiency. To develop and validate a multispectral imaging system that overcomes fragmented intraoperative imaging by simultaneously capturing and integrating white light reflectance and multiple fluorescence signals in real-time, enhancing surgical precision and safety. The system integrates two synchronized color cameras with optimized optical components, including custom filters and a beam splitter, tailored for clinically relevant fluorophores protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), fluorescein sodium, and indocyanine green (ICG). Advanced image processing techniques enhance visualization accuracy. Performance was evaluated using phantoms simulating clinical conditions. The system provided real time, simultaneous visualization of white light and multiple fluorescence signals without mode switching. Fluorescence emissions from PpIX, fluorescein sodium, and ICG were accurately separated using linear unmixing algorithms. Reflectance images showed high color fidelity, with Delta E values indicating imperceptible to barely perceptible differences compared to a conventional camera. Latency was minimal, ensuring immediate visual feedback suitable for intraoperative use. This multispectral imaging system addresses the limitations of fragmented intraoperative imaging by enabling continuous, real time, integrated visualization of anatomical and fluorescence information. It streamlines workflow, reduces cognitive load, and supports more precise interventions. By leveraging components similar to conventional surgical microscopes, it offers a practical, cost effective solution aligned with clinical needs.</description>

      <title>The critical role of substrates in mitigating the power-efficiency trade-off in near-field thermophotovoltaics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-field thermophotovoltaic systems can achieve ultra-high power densities, however, this often comes at the cost of reduced efficiency. We show that this power-efficiency trade-off can be mitigated through substrate engineering. We exploit gradient-based optimization and show that thin lossless metallic films with plasma frequencies resonantly matched to the plasmonic emitter can yield high power and spectral efficiency by spectrally enhancing and confining radiative heat transfer to a narrow spectral range just above the photovoltaic bandgap. Compared to noble metals and air-bridged structures, designs deriving from such optimization yield more than an order-of-magnitude increase in radiative power density while maintaining high efficiency. Our results highlight the critical role of the substrate and the potential of substrate optimization for overcoming fundamental limitations of near-field thermophotovoltaic systems.</description>

      <title>Digit classification using photonic reservoir computing based on a silicon microring resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate first experimental investigation on the performance of a single-node reservoir computer based on a silicon microring resonator (MRR) operating on the digit recognition task. The input layer of the reservoir is composed of a single laser, a Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulator, which encodes intensity of the light applied to the MRR input. The input signal is transformed into a virtual high-dimensional space through thermal nonlinearity in the MRR. The MRR response is recorded with readout network consisting of a photodetector and an oscilloscope. To study the principle of operation we measure nonlinear frequency response as well as dynamic response of the MRR. The resonator demonstrates a negative shift of the resonance frequency with an increase in input power due to the dominating thermo-optic effect. In addition to the frequency shift, the MRR transmission coefficient grows at the red side of the resonance. This effect underlies the nonlinear transient dynamics at the MRR output and provides an intrinsic fading memory that are the basis for the implementation of a reservoir computer. Here a silicon MRR serves as a single nonlinear physical node. We give proof of concept demonstrations of the developed reservoir architecture by solving the classification task. The performance characteristics is evaluated with the short-term memory and the parity-check tests. Obtained results pave the way to chip-scale optical reservoirs computing.</description>

      <title>Versatile Top-Down Patterning Technique for Perovskite On-Chip Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal-halide perovskites (MHPs) have exciting optoelectronic properties and are under investigation for various applications, such as photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, and lasers. An essential step towards exploiting the full potential of this class of materials is their large-scale, on-chip integration with high-resolution, top-down patterning. The development of such patterning methods for perovskite films is challenging because of their intrinsic ionic nature and adverse reactions with the solvents used in standard lithography processes. Here, we introduce a versatile and precise method comprising photolithography and reactive ion etching (RIE) processes that can be tuned to accommodate different perovskite compositions and morphologies. Our method utilizes conventional photoresists at reduced temperatures to create micron-sized features down to 1 ${\mu}$m, providing high reproducibility from chip to chip. The patterning technique is validated through atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It enables the scalable and high-throughput on-chip monolithic integration of MHPs.</description>
