      <title>Confluence of Conditional Rewriting Modulo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sets of equations E play an important computational role in rewriting-based systems R by defining an equivalence relation =E inducing a partition of terms into E-equivalence classes on which rewriting computations, denoted -&gt;R/E and called *rewriting modulo E*, are issued. This paper investigates *confluence of -&gt;R/E*, usually called *E-confluence*, for *conditional* rewriting-based systems, where rewriting steps are determined by conditional rules. We rely on Jouannaud and Kirchner's framework to investigate confluence of an abstract relation R modulo an abstract equivalence relation E on a set A. We show how to particularize the framework to be used with conditional systems. Then, we show how to define appropriate finite sets of *conditional pairs* to prove and disprove E-confluence. In particular, we introduce *Logic-based Conditional Critical Pairs* which do not require the use of (often infinitely many) E-unifiers to provide a finite representation of the *local peaks* considered in the abstract framework. We also introduce *parametric Conditional Variable Pairs* which are essential to deal with conditional rules in the analysis of E-confluence. Our results apply to well-known classes of rewriting-based systems. In particular, to *Equational (Conditional) Term Rewriting Systems*.</description>

      <title>Coinductive Proofs of Regular Expression Equivalence in Zero Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-knowledge (ZK) protocols enable software developers to provide proofs of their programs' correctness to other parties without revealing the programs themselves. Regular expressions are pervasive in real-world software, and zero-knowledge protocols have been developed in the past for the problem of checking whether an individual string appears in the language of a regular expression, but no existing protocol addresses the more complex PSPACE-complete problem of proving that two regular expressions are equivalent.
  We introduce Crepe, the first ZK protocol for encoding regular expression equivalence proofs and also the first ZK protocol to target a PSPACE-complete problem. Crepe uses a custom calculus of proof rules based on regular expression derivatives and coinduction, and we introduce a sound and complete algorithm for generating proofs in our format. We test Crepe on a suite of hundreds of regular expression equivalence proofs. Crepe can validate large proofs in only a few seconds each.</description>

      <title>Vers une mod\'elisation de la confiance dans le renseignement sur les menaces cyber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is essential for effective system defense. CTI is a collection of information about current or past threats to a computer system. This information is gathered by an agent through observation, or based on a set of sources. Building intelligence only makes sense if you have confidence in it. To achieve this, it is necessary to estimate the confidence in each piece of information gathered, taking into account the different dimensions that can make it up: reliability of the source, competence, plausibility of the information, credibility of the information, for example. The information gathered must then be combined with other information to consolidate an agent's knowledge. Recent advances have been made in the theory underlying the modeling of trust for decision-making based on uncertain information, notably by using multivalued logic. This approach makes it possible to deal with unknown values of trust-building parameters, or to easily integrate dimensions. In this article we present the problem of CTI and CTI information sharing, and the reasons that led us to use a logic-based solution for an initial implementation.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Skills: Reasoning about Knowledge and Oblivion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a class of epistemic logics that captures the dynamics of acquiring knowledge and descending into oblivion, while incorporating concepts of group knowledge. The approach is grounded in a system of weighted models, introducing an ``epistemic skills'' metric to represent the epistemic capacities tied to knowledge updates. Within this framework, knowledge acquisition is modeled as a process of upskilling, whereas oblivion is represented as a consequence of downskilling. The framework further enables exploration of ``knowability'' and ``forgettability,'' defined as the potential to gain knowledge through upskilling and to lapse into oblivion through downskilling, respectively. Additionally, it supports a detailed analysis of the distinctions between epistemic de re and de dicto expressions. The computational complexity of the model checking and satisfiability problems is examined, offering insights into their theoretical foundations and practical implications.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach To Implementing Knowledge Distillation In Tsetlin Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a propositional logic based model that uses conjunctive clauses to learn patterns from data. As with typical neural networks, the performance of a Tsetlin Machine is largely dependent on its parameter count, with a larger number of parameters producing higher accuracy but slower execution. Knowledge distillation in neural networks transfers information from an already-trained teacher model to a smaller student model to increase accuracy in the student without increasing execution time. We propose a novel approach to implementing knowledge distillation in Tsetlin Machines by utilizing the probability distributions of each output sample in the teacher to provide additional context to the student. Additionally, we propose a novel clause-transfer algorithm that weighs the importance of each clause in the teacher and initializes the student with only the most essential data. We find that our algorithm can significantly improve performance in the student model without negatively impacting latency in the tested domains of image recognition and text classification.</description>

      <title>MSO Queries on Trees: Enumerating Answers under Updates Using Forest Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04180v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a framework for maintaining forest algebra representations that are of logarithmic height for unranked trees. Such a representations can be computed in O(n) time and updated in O(log(n)) time. The framework is of potential interest for data structures and algorithms for trees whose complexity depend on the depth of the tree (representation). We provide an exemplary application of the framework to the problem of efficiently enumerating answers to MSO-definable queries over trees which are subject to local updates. We exhibit an algorithm that uses an O(n) preprocessing phase and enumerates answers with O(log(n)) delay between them. When the tree is updated, the algorithm can avoid repeating expensive preprocessing and restart the enumeration phase within O(log(n)) time. Our algorithms and complexity results in the paper are presented in terms of node-selecting tree automata representing the MSO queries.</description>

      <title>The Size-Change Principle for Mixed Inductive and Coinductive types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows how to use Lee, Jones and Ben Amram's size-change principle to check correctness of arbitrary recursive definitions in an ML / Haskell like programming language with inductive and coinductive types. Naively using the size-change principle to check productivity and termination is straightforward but unsound when inductive and coinductive types are nested. We can however adapt the size-change principle to check ``totality'', which corresponds exactly to correctness with respect to the corresponding (co)inductive type.</description>
