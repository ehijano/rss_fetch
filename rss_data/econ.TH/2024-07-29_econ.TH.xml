      <title>Order-theoretical fixed point theorems for correspondences and application in game theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an ascending correspondence $F:X\to 2^X$ with chain-complete values on a complete lattice $X$, we prove that the set of fixed points is a complete lattice. This strengthens Zhou's fixed point theorem. For chain-complete posets that are not necessarily lattices, we generalize the Abian-Brown and the Markowsky fixed point theorems from single-valued maps to multivalued correspondences. We provide an application in game theory.</description>

      <title>With a little help from my friends: essentiality vs opportunity in group criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03565v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a notion of the criticality of a player for simple monotone games based on cooperation with other players, either to form a winning coalition or to break a winning one, with an essential role for all the players involved. We compare it with the notion of differential criticality given by Beisbart that measures power as the opportunity left by other players. We prove that our proposal satisfies an extension of the strong monotonicity introduced by Young, assigns no power to null players and does not reward free riders, and can easily be computed from the minimal winning and blocking coalitions. An application to the Italian elections is presented. Our analysis shows that the measures of group criticality defined so far cannot weigh essential players while only remaining an opportunity measure. We propose a group opportunity test to reconcile the two views.</description>

      <title>Recursive Preferences and Ambiguity Attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06830v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the implications of recursivity and state monotonicity in intertemporal consumption problems under ambiguity. We show that monotone recursive preferences admit a recursive and ex-ante representation, both with translation invariant certainty equivalents. Translation invariance restricts the decision maker's absolute ambiguity attitudes to be constant. As a byproduct, this restriction implies that monotone recursive and convex preferences collapse to the variational model. Using dynamic consistency, we show that our two representations are connected by a condition that extends the standard rectangularity notion for recursive multiple priors. This "generalized rectangularity" condition allows us to uniquely retrieve the ex-ante representation starting fromthe recursive one and to obtain dynamic consistency conditions for preferences exhibiting constant absolute ambiguity aversion. Interpreting generalized rectangularity as a law of iterated nonlinear expectations, we discuss its relevance with respect to large sample theory.</description>
