      <title>Remote Interactions between tropical cyclones: The case of Hurricane Michael and Leslie's high predictability uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study explores Hurricane Michael's impact on Hurricane Leslie's trajectory predictability using ECMWF and NCEP ensemble systems. A clustering method focused on tropical cyclones is used to identify potential paths for Leslie: Cluster 1 accurately predicted Leslie's direction towards the Iberian Peninsula, whereas Clusters 2 and 3 indicated a southern recurve near the Canary Islands. Analysis of potential vorticity and irrotational wind at upper levels showed a significant interaction between Michael, ridge, and trough across the jet stream from +12 h after initialization. Cluster 1 showed a stronger Michael promoting upper-level wind divergence greatest, modifying the jet stream configuration around the ridge and downstream. Alterations in the jet stream's configuration, functioning as a waveguide, propagated downstream, guiding Leslie towards the Iberian Peninsula. Clusters 2 and 3 indicated the trough's failure to incorporate Leslie, resulting in a recurve of the trajectory around the Azores anticyclone. This research enhances comprehension of the interaction between two tropical cyclones via synoptic Rossby wave flow. Moreover, the conceptual framework can aid operational meteorologists in identifying the sources of uncertainty, particularly in track forecasts under synoptic conditions analogous to those examined in this study.</description>

Abstract: The study of the rapid intensification process of Tropical Cyclones (TCs) is a current, yet lacking research topic in Mexico, where thermal and dynamic factors at the microscale and mesoscale fundamentally intervene. Due to the little improvement in the TC intensity, forecasting models and the importance of understanding and predicting their evolution, an investigation was under-taken of the factors that influence the process of rapid intensification, and in general, the intensi-fication of TCs in the Mexican Pacific Ocean, specifically in the western zone that includes states of Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima and north of Michoac\'an.
  The parameters studied were, sea surface temperature (SST), mixing layer depth (MLD), as well as, wind shear (WS). Through a selection process of TCs that met the definition of Rapid In-tensification (RI), the aforementioned parameters were processed and analyzed, which allowed identification of the threshold values that favor the rapid intensification process. The anomalies of + 7,6 % in SST and + 57 % in MLD stand out. Although the wind shear values were not low, a dominance in the thermal factors SST and MLD was observed during the RI process.</description>

      <title>Learning to Simulate Aerosol Dynamics with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerosol effects on climate, weather, and air quality depend on characteristics of individual particles, which are tremendously diverse and change in time. Particle-resolved models are the only models able to capture this diversity in particle physiochemical properties, and these models are computationally expensive. As a strategy for accelerating particle-resolved microphysics models, we introduce Graph-based Learning of Aerosol Dynamics (GLAD) and use this model to train a surrogate of the particle-resolved model PartMC-MOSAIC. GLAD implements a Graph Network-based Simulator (GNS), a machine learning framework that has been used to simulate particle-based fluid dynamics models. In GLAD, each particle is represented as a node in a graph, and the evolution of the particle population over time is simulated through learned message passing. We demonstrate our GNS approach on a simple aerosol system that includes condensation of sulfuric acid onto particles composed of sulfate, black carbon, organic carbon, and water. A graph with particles as nodes is constructed, and a graph neural network (GNN) is then trained using the model output from PartMC-MOSAIC. The trained GNN can then be used for simulating and predicting aerosol dynamics over time. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to accurately learn chemical dynamics and generalize across different scenarios, achieving efficient training and prediction times. We evaluate the performance across three scenarios, highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability in modeling aerosol microphysics and chemistry.</description>

      <title>On the Extrapolation of Generative Adversarial Networks for downscaling precipitation extremes in warmer climates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep-learning downscaling algorithms can generate fine-scale climate projections cost-effectively, it is still unclear how well they will extrapolate to unobserved climates. We assess the extrapolation capabilities of a deterministic Convolutional Neural Network baseline and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) built with this baseline, trained to predict daily precipitation simulated by a Regional Climate Model (RCM). Both approaches emulate future changes in annual mean precipitation well, even when trained on historical data, though training on a future climate improves performance. For extreme precipitation (99.5th percentile), RCM simulations predict a robust end-of-century increase with future warming (~5.8%/{\deg}C on average from five simulations). When trained on a future climate, GANs capture 97% of the warming-driven increase in extreme precipitation compared to 65% in a deterministic baseline. Even GANs trained historically capture 77% of this increase. Overall, GANs offer better generalization for downscaling extremes, which is important in applications relying on historical data.</description>

      <title>A competitive baseline for deep learning enhanced data assimilation using conditional Gaussian ensemble Kalman filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) is a popular technique for data assimilation, with far ranging applications. However, the vanilla EnKF framework is not well-defined when perturbations are nonlinear. We study two non-linear extensions of the vanilla EnKF - dubbed the conditional-Gaussian EnKF (CG-EnKF) and the normal score EnKF (NS-EnKF) - which sidestep assumptions of linearity by constructing the Kalman gain matrix with the `conditional Gaussian' update formula in place of the traditional one. We then compare these models against a state-of-the-art deep learning based particle filter called the score filter (SF). This model uses an expensive score diffusion model for estimating densities and also requires a strong assumption on the perturbation operator for validity. In our comparison, we find that CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF dramatically outperform SF for a canonical problem in high-dimensional multiscale data assimilation given by the Lorenz-96 system. Our analysis also demonstrates that the CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF can handle highly non-Gaussian additive noise perturbations, with the latter typically outperforming the former.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Eddy Identification with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mesoscale eddies are critical in ocean circulation and the global climate system. Standard eddy identification methods are usually based on deterministic optimal point estimates of the ocean flow field. However, uncertainty exists in estimating the flow field due to noisy, sparse, and indirect observations and turbulent flow models. Because of the intrinsic strong nonlinearity in the eddy identification diagnostics, even a small uncertainty in estimating the flow field can cause a significant error in the identified eddies. This paper presents a general probabilistic eddy identification framework that adapts existing identification methods to incorporate uncertainty into the diagnostic, emphasizing the interaction between the uncertainty in state estimation and the nonlinearity in diagnostics for affecting the identification results. The probabilistic eddy identification framework starts by sampling an ensemble of flow realizations from the probabilistic state estimation, followed by applying traditional nonlinear eddy diagnostics to individual realizations. The corresponding eddy statistics are then aggregated from the diagnostic results based on these realizations. The framework is applied to a scenario mimicking the Beaufort Gyre marginal ice zone, where large uncertainty appears in estimating the ocean field using Lagrangian data assimilation with sparse ice floe trajectories. The skills in counting the number of eddies and computing the probability of each eddy event are significantly improved under the probabilistic framework. Notably, incorporating the nonlinear propagation of uncertainty in diagnostics provides a more accurate mean estimate than standard deterministic methods in estimating eddy lifetime. It also facilitates uncertainty quantification in inferring such a crucial dynamical quantity.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Semi-convective Staircases in Rotating Flows: Consequences for Fuzzy Cores in Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observational constraints on the internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that these planets have ``fuzzy" cores, i.e., gradients of the concentration of heavy elements that might span a large fraction of the planet's radius. These cores could be composed of a semi-convective staircase, i.e., multiple convective layers separated by diffusive interfaces arising from double-diffusive instabilities. However, to date, no study has demonstrated how such staircases can avoid layer mergers and persist over evolutionary time scales. In fact, previous work has found that these mergers occur rapidly, leading to only a single convective layer. Using 3D simulations, we demonstrate that rotation prolongs the lifetime of a convective staircase by increasing the timescale for both layer merger and erosion of the interface between the final two layers. We present an analytic model for the erosion phase, predicting that rotation increases the erosion time by a factor of approximately $\mathrm{Ro}^{-1/2}$, where $\mathrm{Ro}$ is the Rossby number of the convective flows (the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time). For Jovian conditions at early times after formation (when convection is vigorous enough to mix a large fraction of the planet), we find the erosion time to be roughly $10^{9}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the non-rotating case and $10^{11}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the rotating case. If these timescales are confirmed with a larger suite of numerical simulations, the existence of convective staircases within the deep interiors of giant planets is a strong possibility, and rotation could be an important factor in the preservation of their fuzzy cores.</description>
