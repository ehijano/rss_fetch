      <title>Simulations of High Temperature Decomposition of Metal-Organic Frameworks to form Amorphous Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic framework (MOF) derived materials formed through high temperature processes show great potential as catalysts. However, understanding of structure-property relationships between the initial MOF and the resulting MOF-derived catalyst is limited because the amorphous nature of the catalyst challenges standard structural characterization methods. Neural network approaches that learn interatomic potentials from density functional theory offer a promising solution. We simulated the pyrolysis of UiO-66, UiO-67 and MIP-206 using both foundational and fine-tuned machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). To mimic experimental conditions, an atmosphere of CO2 and H2 was introduced and the structures were doped with 20 wt% copper to probe the effect of copper on the structural evolution of MOFs. These simulations provide atomistic insights into gas evolution, metal nanoparticle formation, and linker decomposition that were compared to available experimental data. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of MLIPs to accurately model high temperature MOF dynamics under experimentally relevant conditions and guide the design of new catalytic materials.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Measure of Loss Landscape Curvature for Analyzing the Training Dynamics of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($\lambda_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $\Delta \mathbf{\theta}$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.</description>

      <title>Multifractality, percolation threshold and critical point of a nuclear reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multifractal model is used to analyze neutron evolution within a reactor. For chain reactions, various characteristics of multifractal neutron behavior have been determined. These include the dimension of the multifractal carrier, information and correlation dimensions, the entropy of the fractal set, maximum and minimum dimension values, and the multifractal spectrum function. The geometric features of a multifractal allow for the description of a stochastic system consisting of hierarchically subordinate statistical ensembles, which are characterized by Cayley trees. A stationary distribution over hierarchical levels is established, which follows the Tsallis power law. The text also points out some potential applications of fractal patterns in nuclear reactor theory. The chance of percolation, which is when we see a state in the Bethe lattice where there's at least one continuous path through neighboring conducting nodes all the way across, is similar to the likelihood of a self-sustaining fission chain reaction happening. When this probability hits a critical point, we get a (conditionally) infinite cluster of neutrons forming. The percolation probability, influenced by how long the reactor has been running and its size, is linked to the reactor's criticality. We take a look at how the neutron multiplication factor behaves over time. We especially focus on the early stages of a self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reaction. We also highlight the ways to identify the boundaries of the critical region.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature topological transitions in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address issues related to the presence of defects at finite-temperature topological transitions, in particular when defects are modeled in terms of further variables associated with a quenched disorder, corresponding to the limit in which the defect dynamics is very slow. As a paradigmatic model, we consider the classical three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge model in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder associated with the plaquettes of the lattice, whose topological transitions are characterized by the absence of a local order parameter. We study the critical behaviors in the presence of weak disorder. We show that they belong to a new topological universality class, different from that of the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge models without disorder, in agreement with the Harris criterium for the relevance of uncorrelated quenched disorder when the pure system undergoes a continuous transition with positive specific-heat critical exponent.</description>
