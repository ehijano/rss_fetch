      <title>Nonlinear Optical Responses and Quantum Geometric Phases in Multiband Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear optical behavior of quantum systems plays a crucial role in various photonic applications. This study introduces a novel framework for understanding these nonlinear effects by incorporating gauge-covariant formulations based on phase space Lie algebras. By analyzing the evolution of density matrices under phase space displacements, we derive constrained expressions for nonlinear polarization and susceptibility tensors. The implications of geometric phases, such as Berry curvature, are explored, demonstrating their role in suppressing unphysical components of the polarization. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the theoretical predictions, offering insights into nonlinear rectification and topological Hall effects. This approach opens avenues for engineering materials with tailored nonlinear properties, particularly in the realm of metamaterials and topological photonics.</description>

      <title>SMILE: three-dimensional modulation-enhanced localization microscopy with spatially invariant resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulation-enhanced localization microscopy (MELM) has demonstrated significant improvements in both lateral and axial localization precision compared to conventional single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). However, lateral modulated illumination based MELM (MELMxy) remains fundamentally limited to two-dimensional imaging. Here we present three-dimensional Single-Molecule Modulated Illumination Localization Estimator (SMILE) that synergistically integrates lateral illumination modulation with point spread function engineering. By simultaneously exploiting lateral modulation patterns and an accurate point spread function (PSF) model for 3D localization, SMILE achieves near-theoretical-minimum localization uncertainty, demonstrating an average 4-fold enhancement in lateral precision compared to conventional 3D-SMLM. Crucially, SMILE exhibits exceptional compatibility with diverse PSFs and different illumination patterns with various structures including 4Pi configurations, making it a versatile tool that can be easily adapted for different experimental setups. When integrated with 4Pi microscopy, 4Pi-SMILE shows particular promise for achieving sub-10 nm axial resolution and approaching isotropic resolution. From the simulations and proof-of-concept experiments, we verified the superiority of SMILE over 3D-SMLM and ordinary MELM. We highlight SMILE as a novel methodology and robust framework that holds great potential to significantly promote the development of MELM.</description>

      <title>Super light-by-light scattering in vacuum induced by intense vortex lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collision of ultra-intense optical laser and X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) pulses is a promising approach to detecting nonlinear vacuum polarization (VP), a long-standing prediction of quantum electrodynamics remaining to be tested. Identifying the signals induced by polarized vacuum relies on purifying the X-ray polarization and poses significant challenges due to strongly reduced signal and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here we propose an approach that allows one to directly detect VP signals without the need for an X-ray polarizer. We identify a new VP effect in collision of an X-ray probe with an intense laser in a vortex mode, which we call the super light-by-light scattering (super-LBL), through which signal photons are kicked out of the X-ray background with large tangential momentum. Super-LBL originates from the gradient force of the vortical vacuum current in azimuthal direction and induces momentum exchange beyond the transverse momentum of laser-photon. This effect efficiently sets the scattered signal photons apart from the X-ray background, producing observable signals with both the strength and SNR more than two orders of magnitude higher than those from the known VP effects. This finding paves the way for single-shot detection of nonlinear VP phenomena with current ultra-intense laser and XFEL technologies.</description>

      <title>Engineering high Pockels coefficients in thin-film strontium titanate for cryogenic quantum electro-optic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials which exhibit the Pockels effect are notable for their strong electro-optic interaction and rapid response times and are therefore used extensively in classical electro-optic components for data and telecommunication applications. Yet many materials optimized for room-temperature operation see their Pockels coefficients at cryogenic temperatures significantly reduced - a major hurdle for emerging quantum technologies which have even more rigorous demands than their classical counterpart. A noted example is $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$, which features the strongest effective Pockels coefficient at room temperature, only to see it reduced to a third (i.e. $\mathrm{r_{eff}} \approx$ 170 pm/V) at a few Kelvin. Here, we show that this behaviour is not inherent and can even be reversed: Strontium titanate ($\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$), a material normally not featuring a Pockels coefficient, can be engineered to exhibit an $\mathrm{r_{eff}}$ of 345 pm/V at cryogenic temperatures - a record value in any thin-film electro-optic material. By adjusting the stoichiometry, we can increase the Curie temperature and realise a ferroelectric phase that yields a high Pockels coefficient, yet with limited optical losses - on the order of decibels per centimetre. Our findings position $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ as one of the most promising materials for cryogenic quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Langevin model for soliton molecules in ultrafast fiber ring laser cavity: investigating experimentally the interplay between noise and inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of soliton molecules in ultrafast fiber ring laser cavity is strongly influenced by noise. We show how a parsimonious Langevin model can be constructed from experimental data, resulting in a mathematical description that encompasses both the deterministic and stochastic properties of the evolution of the soliton molecules. In particular, we were able to probe the response dynamics of the soliton molecule to an external kick in a sub-critical approach, namely without the need to actually disturb the systems under investigation. Moreover, the noise experienced by the dissipative solitonic system, including its distribution and correlation, can now be also analyzed in details. Our strategy can be applied to any systems where the individual motion of its constitutive particles can be traced; the case of optical solitonic-system laser presented here serving as a proof-of-principle demonstration.</description>

      <title>Perspective of high-speed Mach-Zehnder modulators based on nonlinear optics and complex band structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical modulators are essential building blocks for high-capacity optical communication and massively parallel computing. Among all types of optical modulators, travelling-wave Mach-Zehnder modulators (TW-MZMs) featuring high speed and efficiency are widely used, and have been developed on a variety of integrated material platforms. Existing methods to design and simulate TW-MZMs so far strongly rely on the peculiar material properties, and thus inevitably involve complicated electrical-circuit models. As a result, these methods diverge significantly. In addition, they become increasingly inefficient and inaccurate for TW-MZMs with extending length and levitating modulation speed, posing formidable challenges for millimeter-wave and terahertz operation. Here, we present an innovative perspective to understand and analyze high-speed TW-MZMs. Our perspective leverages nonlinear optics and complex band structures of RF photonic crystals, and is thus entirely electromagnetic-wave-based. Under this perspective, we showcase the design, optoelectronic simulation and experimental validation of high-speed TW-MZMs based on Si and LiNbO$_3$, and further demonstrate unambiguous advantages in simplicity, accuracy and efficiency over conventional methods. Our approach can essentially be applied to nearly any integrated material platform, including those based on semiconductors and electro-absorption materials. With high-frequency electrode designs and optoelectronic co-simulation, our approach facilitates the synergy and convergence of electronics and photonics, and offers a viable route to constructing future high-speed millimeter-wave and terahertz photonics and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Phenomenon of a stronger trapping behaviour in $\Lambda$-type quantum systems with symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\Lambda$, $V$, $\Xi$ (ladder), and other three-level quantum systems with one forbidden transition ($\Lambda$-type systems) play an important role in quantum physics. Various applications require manipulation by such systems using as control shaped laser field. In this work, we study how degeneracy in energy states and Bohr frequencies of these systems affects the efficiency or difficulty of finding optimal shape of the control field. For this, we adopt the notion of higher order traps which was introduced in [A.N. Pechen and D.J. Tannor, Are there traps in quantum control landscapes? Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 106}, 120402 (2011)], where second/third order traps were discovered for $\Lambda$-type systems with one forbidden transition and with non-degenerate energy levels. We study control of such systems with and without denegeracy in their eigenstates and Bohr frequencies, and investigate how these degeneracies influence on the efficiency of optimizing the control laser field. We find that the degeneracy of Bohr frequencies in the $\Xi$ system leads to the appearance of seventh order trap with a more significant attracting domain resulting in a more difficult optimization, while degeneracy in energy states of $\Lambda$-type systems does not lead to increase of the order of the zero control trap compared to the non-degenerate case.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed dual-comb spectroscopy of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multiplexed dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) approach for high-resolution, broadband spectral measurements is presented, demonstrating its effectiveness in studying complex atomic systems. By implementing a photodetector array, we enhance DCS capabilities, addressing the fundamental trade-off between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral coverage. To resolve ambiguities in frequency conversion, we introduced a relative offset in the radio frequency (RF) comb teeth, ensuring accurate spectral reconstruction. As a proof of concept, the absorption spectrum of samarium (Sm) vapor is investigated over a 52nm range, and several previously unreported absorption lines are detected. This is a step toward "Spectroscopy 2.0", enabling massively parallel spectroscopic measurements (including those at &gt;100 T magnetic fields) crucial for atomic physics and fundamental interactions research.</description>

      <title>Combined Quantum and Post-Quantum Security for Earth-Satellite Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental deployment of quantum communication over Earth-satellite channels opens the way to a secure global quantum Internet. In this work, we present results from a real-time prototype quantum key distribution (QKD) system, which entails the development of optical systems including the encoding of entangled photon pairs, the development of transmitters for quantum signaling through an emulated Earth-satellite channel, and the development of quantum-decoding receivers. A unique aspect of our system is the integration of QKD with existing cryptographic methods to ensure quantum-resistant security, even at low-key rates. In addition, we report the use of specially designed error-reconciliation codes that optimize the security versus key-rate trade-off. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, a deployment of the BBM92 protocol that offers both post-quantum security via the advanced encryption standard (AES) and quantum security via an entanglement-based QKD protocol. If either the AES or the QKD is compromised through some adversary attack, our system still delivers state-of-the-art communications secure against future quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Low-Noise Cascaded Frequency Conversion of $637.2$ nm Light to the Telecommunication C-Band in a Single-Waveguide Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interconnected quantum devices are the building blocks of quantum networks, where state transduction plays a central role. The frequency conversion of photons into the telecommunication C-band is decisive in taking advantage of current low-loss transmission lines. Here, we report the difference frequency conversion of $637.2$ nm fluorescent light from a cluster of NV centers in diamond to tunable wavelengths between $1559.6$ nm and $1565.2$ nm. In order to avoid detrimental noise from spontaneous emissions, we use a two-step conversion device based on a single-pumped periodic poled lithium niobate waveguide. We observed a total external (internal) conversion efficiency of $3.0\pm0.1$ ($20.5\pm0.8$) $\%$ with a noise rate of $2.4\pm0.8$ ($16\pm5$) cps/GHz.</description>

      <title>Broadband uniform-efficiency OAM-mode detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-dimensional basis of orbital angular momentum (OAM) has several added and unique advantages for photonics quantum technologies compared to the polarization basis, which is only two-dimensional. However, one of the major roadblocks in implementing OAM-based applications with their full potentials is the absence of an ideal OAM-mode detector. Despite the plethora of efforts in the last three decades, currently, there is no OAM detector that can detect a broad OAM-mode spectrum, has uniform detection-efficiency over all the modes, measures the true spectrum, and works for an arbitrary quantum state without the need for any prior information. In this article, we experimentally demonstrate just such an OAM detector. We report detection of pure and mixed OAM states with fidelities more than 98% and with measurement times of only a few minutes for dimensionalities up to 100. We expect our work to substantially boost the OAM-based photonics quantum technology efforts.</description>

      <title>Discovery of transient topological crystalline order in optically driven SnSe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast optical excitation of quantum materials has opened new frontiers for transiently inducing novel phases of matter, including magnetism, charge density waves, ferroelectricity, and superconductivity beyond the constraints of equilibrium thermodynamics. Triggering a transient topological order in a trivial semiconductor represents a key milestone, as it could provide an on-demand route to topological functionality for device applications. However, achieving a topologically nontrivial phase from a large-gap (~ 1 eV) semiconductor remains a major challenge, as substantial energy modification is required to invert the band gap. Here, we report the discovery of a thermally inaccessible, transient topological crystalline order in a sizable-gap (~ 0.8 eV) layered semiconductor, SnSe, through femtosecond above-gap excitation. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals a Dirac-like linear dispersion forming within the band gap on a subpicosecond timescale. This transient state shows hallmark features of a reflection-invariant topological crystalline insulator, including a high Fermi velocity (2.5x10^5 m/s), multiple Dirac points located away from high-symmetry momenta, and independence from probe photon energy, persisting for several picoseconds even at room temperature. Our findings establish a nonequilibrium pathway to ultrafast topological order in a semiconductor, opening new avenues for optically driven spintronic and quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Passive Demultiplexed Two-photon State Generation from a Quantum Dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-purity multi-photon states are essential for photonic quantum computing. Among existing platforms, semiconductor quantum dots offer a promising route to scalable and deterministic multi-photon state generation. However, to fully realize their potential we require a suitable optical excitation method. Current approaches of multi-photon generation rely on active polarization-switching elements (e.g., electro-optic modulators, EOMs) to spatio-temporally demultiplex single photons. Yet, the achievable multi-photon rate is fundamentally limited by the switching speed of the EOM. Here, we introduce a fully passive demultiplexing technique that leverages a stimulated two-photon excitation process to achieve switching rates that are only limited by the quantum dot lifetime. We demonstrate this method by generating two-photon states from a single quantum dot without requiring any active switching elements. Our approach significantly reduces the cost of demultiplexing while shifting it to the excitation stage, enabling loss-free demultiplexing and effectively doubling the achievable multi-photon generation rate when combined with existing active demultiplexing techniques.</description>

      <title>Turning on the Light: Polymorphism-Induced Photoluminescence in Cysteine Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoluminescence of non-aromatic supramolecular chemical assemblies has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its potential for use in molecular sensing and imaging technologies. The underlying structural origins, the mechanisms of light emission in these systems, and the generality of this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that crystals of L-Cysteine (Cys) formed in heavy water ($\text{D}_2\text{O}$) exhibit distinct packing and hydrogen-bond networks, resulting in significantly enhanced photoluminescence compared to those prepared in $\text{H}_2\text{O}$. Using advanced excited-state simulations, we elucidate the nature of electronic transitions that activate vibrational modes of Cys in $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, particularly those involving thiol (S-H) and amine (C-N) groups, which lead to non-radiative decay. For the crystal formed in $\text{D}_2\text{O}$, these modes appear to be more constrained, and we also observe intersystem crossing from the singlet to the triplet state, indicating a potentially more complex light emission mechanism. Our findings provide new insights into this intriguing phenomenon and introduce innovative design principles for generating emergent fluorophores.</description>

      <title>Modal Statistics in Mode-Division-Multiplexed Systems using Mode Scramblers (Extended)</title>

Abstract: Typical multi-mode fibers exhibit strong intra-group mode coupling and weak inter-group mode coupling. Mode scramblers can be inserted at periodic intervals to enhance inter-group coupling. The deterministic mode coupling of the mode scramblers, in concert with the random mode coupling of the fiber spans, can effect strong random mode coupling between all modes. This reduces both modal dispersion and mode-dependent loss, thereby decreasing receiver complexity and increasing link capacity. In this paper, we analyze the effect of mode scramblers on end-to-end group-delay and mode-dependent loss standard deviations in long-haul multi-mode fiber links. We develop analytical tools in the generalized Jones and Stokes representations. We propose design criteria for mode scramblers that ensure strong end-to-end coupling: the mode-group-averaged power coupling matrix should be primitive and its non-dominant eigenvalues should be near zero. We argue that when the mode scramblers satisfy these criteria, the probability distribution of the system transfer matrix asymptotically approaches that of a system with strong random mode coupling between all modes. Consequently, group-delay and mode-dependent loss standard deviations become sufficient statistics of the eigenvalues of the group-delay operator and the modal gains operator, respectively. We also show that under certain conditions on the uncoupled group delays, it is possible to design self-compensating mode scramblers to reduce group delay accumulation below that of standard strong random coupling.</description>

      <title>Centimetre-Scale Micro-Transfer Printing to enable Heterogeneous Integration of Thin Film Lithium Niobate with Silicon Photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integrated photonics CMOS-compatible silicon nitride (SiN) platform is praised for its low propagation loss, but is limited by its lack of active functionalities such as a strong Pockels coefficient and intrinsic \c{hi}(2) nonlinearity. In this paper, we demonstrate the integration of centimetre-long thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) devices on a SiN platform using the micro-transfer printing (uTP) method. At a wavelength of 1550 nm, propagation losses of approximately 0.9 dB/cm and transition losses of 1.8 dB per facet were measured. Furthermore, the TFLN was integrated into an imbalanced push-pull Mach-Zehnder modulator, achieving a V{\pi} of 3.2 V. The electro-optics nature of the observed modulation is confirmed by measuring the device up to 35 GHz, showing that the printing does not affect the high-speed LN properties.</description>

      <title>Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17224v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>

      <title>Temperature-insensitive fused-tapered fiber couplers based on negative thermal expansion material coating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new method based on negative thermal expansion material coating is proposed to realize temperature insensitive fiber coupler. By coating a layer of modified epoxy resin with a negative thermal expansion coefficient onto the coupling region of fiber coupler, a stable splitting ratio over a wide temperature range can be achieved. A finite-element model for simulating the influence of thermal fluctuations on fused-tapered fiber coupler's splitting ratio is built and verified via experimental test. Furthermore, using this model, the influence of the thickness, length, and thermal expansion coefficient of the coating material on the splitting ratio is studied. Through adjusting the parameters of the coating, the temperature stability of the fiber coupler splitting ratio can be improved by more than one order of magnitude and improved to 1.2*10-5/K. The temperature-insensitive fused-tapered fiber coupler can find important application in optical precision measurement under extreme temperature environment, such as inter-satellite laser interferometry and high-precision fiber gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic Super-dephasing in Collective Atom-Atom Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pure dephasing and spontaneous emission are two non-unitary processes of atoms or spins interacting with fluctuating electromagnetic (EM) modes. The dissipative collective emission processes (e.g., superradiance) originate from interactions with EM modes in resonance with atoms and have received considerable attention. Meanwhile, the analogous non-dissipative collective dephasing phenomena mediated by EM environments remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce the nano-EM super-dephasing phenomenon arising in the photonic environments near materials. We show that collective dephasing in this nano-EM environment is enhanced by over 10 orders of magnitude compared to free space or cavities. This giant enhancement originates from long-range correlations in off-resonant, low-frequency evanescent EM fluctuations, which lead to collectively accelerated (super-) or suppressed (sub-) dephasing in many-body entangled states. We further unravel that nano-EM collective dephasing exhibits universal interaction ranges near materials with different anisotropy that can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. This nano-EM interaction range, which is not present in free-space and cavities, leads to unique scaling laws of super-dephasing in GHZ states different from the conventional $N^2$ scaling of superradiance. Finally, we discuss how to experimentally isolate and control super-dephasing to open interesting frontiers for scalable quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Normal and lateral Casimir-Lifshitz forces between a nanoparticle and a graphene grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the normal and lateral components of the Casimir-Lifshitz (CL) force between a nanoparticle and 1D graphene grating deposited on a fused silica slab. For this purpose, the scattering matrix approach together with the Fourier modal method augmented with local basis functions are used. We find that, by covering a fused silica slab by a graphene grating, the spectrum of the normal CL force at small frequencies is increased by about 100% for a grating filling fraction of 0.5, and even more when the slab is completely covered. The typically employed additive approximation (the weighted average of the force with and without the graphene coating) cannot provide any information on the lateral CL force, and, as we show, cannot provide accurate estimation for the normal CL force. When the nanoparticle is laterally shifted ($x_A$), the normal CL force is modulated and remains attractive. On the contrary, the lateral CL force changes sign twice in each period, showing a series of alternating stable and unstable lateral equilibrium positions, occurring in the graphene strips and of the grating slits regions, respectively. Finally, we show that the lateral shift effect is sensitive to the geometric factor $d/D$ ($d$ is the separation distance, and $D$ is the grating period). We identify two clear regions: a region ($d/D&lt;1.0$) where the lateral shift significantly affects the CL energy, and a region ($d/D \geq 1.0$) where this effect is negligible, with a crossover at $d\approx D$. Our predictions can have relevant implications to experiments and applications of the CL normal and lateral forces acting on nanoparticles interacting with structured objects at the nano/micro scale, and are also directly valid for atoms close to these nanostructures.</description>
