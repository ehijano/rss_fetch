      <title>Topological Classification of Insulators: III. Non-interacting Spectrally-Gapped Systems in All Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-interacting electrons in disordered materials which exhibit a spectral gap, in each of the ten Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, in all space dimensions. We define an appropriate space of Hamiltonians and a topology on it so that the so-called strong topological invariants become complete invariants yielding the Kitaev periodic table, but now derived as the set of path-connected components of the space of Hamiltonians, rather than as $K$-theory groups. We thus confirm the conjecture regarding a one-to-one correspondence between topological phases of gapped non-interacting systems and the respective Abelian groups $\{0\},\mathbb{Z},2\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_2$ in the spectral gap regime. We do this by providing the appropriate notion of locality, as well as a novel, so-called bulk non-triviality, which together reproduce the Kitaev table. Once the natural definitions are identified, the main technical achievement is lifting $K$-theory calculations to $\pi_0$ of unitaries and projections.</description>

      <title>A category of quantum posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.11184v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a category of quantum posets that generalizes the category of posets and monotone functions. Up to equivalence, its objects are hereditarily atomic von Neumann algebras equipped with quantum partial orders in Weaver's sense. We show that this category is complete, cocomplete and symmetric monoidal closed. As a consequence, any discrete quantum family of maps in So{\l}tan's sense from a discrete quantum space to a partially ordered set is canonically equipped with quantum preorder in Weaver's sense. In particular, the quantum power set of a quantum set is so ordered. As an application, we show that each quantum poset embeds into its quantum power set.</description>

      <title>$C^*$-simplicity and boundary actions of discrete quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate several quantum group dynamical notions for the purpose of studying $C^*$-simplicity of discrete quantum groups via the theory of boundary actions. In particular we define a quantum analogue of Powers' Averaging Property (PAP) and a quantum analogue of strongly faithful actions. We show that our quantum PAP implies $C^*$-simplicity and the uniqueness of $\sigma$-KMS states, and that the existence of a strongly $C^*$-faithful quantum boundary action also implies $C^*$-simplicity and, in the unimodular case, the quantum PAP. We illustrate these results in the case of the unitary free quantum groups $\mathbb{F} U_F$ by showing that they satisfy the quantum PAP and that they act strongly $C^*$-faithfully on their quantum Gromov boundary. Moreover we prove that this particular action of $\mathbb{F} U_F$ is a quantum boundary action.</description>

      <title>Quantum graphs and spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We quantize the regularity properties of classical graphs that determine spin models for singly-generated Yang-Baxter planar algebras, including the Kauffman polynomial, and construct explicit examples. A source of examples comes from deforming graphs using higher-idempotent splittings of quantum isomorphisms for which we prove that the relevant algebraic, combinatorial, and topological properties of the original graphs are preserved along with the quantum automorphism group. We also obtain exotic examples of highly regular quantum graphs using the quantum Fourier transform and a method of iterated convolution. Our examples include quantum versions of the strongly regular $9$-Paley, $16$-Clebsch and the Higman-Sims graphs, yielding new models for their regularity parameters. As applications, we construct a compact quantum group that is monoidally equivalent to $SO_q(5)$ at the square of the golden ratio, whose dual is infinite with property (T), and exhibit a highly-regular quantum graph with no classical analogue. Finally, we introduce quantum spin models, construct explicit examples and make contact with quantum Hadamard matrices.</description>

      <title>A Note on Pseudofinite W*-Probability Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce pseudofinite W*-probability spaces. These are W*-probability spaces that are elementarily equivalent to Ocneanu ultraproducts of finite-dimensional von Neumann algebras equipped with arbitrary faithful normal states. We are particularly interested in the case where these finite-dimensional von Neumann algebras are full matrix algebras: the pseudofinite factors. We show that these are indeed factors. We see as a consequence that pseudofinite factors are never of type $\mathrm{III}_0$. Mimicking the construction of the Powers factors, we give explicit families of examples of matrix algebra ultraproducts that are $\mathrm{III}_\lambda$ factors for $\lambda \in (0,1]$. We show that these examples share their universal theories with the corresponding Powers factor and thus have uncomputable universal theories. Finally, we show that pseudofinite factors are full. This generalizes a theorem of Farah-Hart-Sherman which shows that pseudofinite tracial factors do not have property $\Gamma$. It has the consequence that hyperfinite factors of type $\mathrm{III}$ (the Powers factors) are never pseudofinite. Our proofs combine operator algebraic insights with routine continuous logic syntactic arguments: using \L os' theorem to prove that certain sentences which are true for all matrix algebras are inherited by their ultraproducts.</description>

      <title>Base norm spaces--classical, complex, and noncommutative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the theory of base norm spaces to the complex case, and further to the noncommutative setting relevant to `quantum convexity'. In particular, we establish the duality between complex Archimedean order unit spaces and complex base norm spaces, as well as the corresponding duality between their noncommutative counterparts. Additional topics include an exploration of natural connections with various notions of quantum convexity and regularity of noncommutative convex sets, and an analysis of how these concepts interact with complexification. We also define, as in the classical case, a class that contains and generates the noncommutative base norm spaces, but is defined by fewer axioms. We show how this may be applied to provide new and interesting examples of noncommutative base norm spaces.</description>

      <title>Selfless reduced $C^{*}$-algebras of linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the reduced C*-algebra of a nontrivial linear group $\Gamma&lt;GL_{d}(k)$ with trivial amenable radical is selfless. Thus selflessness and simplicity coincide for reduced C*-algebras of linear groups. Similar results are obtained for twisted reduced group C*-algebra.</description>

      <title>An extreme boundary of acylindrically hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every acylindrically hyperbolic group admits a minimal and extremely proximal action on a compact metrizable space. If there are no nontrivial finite normal subgroups, then the action is topologically free. This answers positively a question of Ozawa and the applications to $C^\ast$-algebras are discussed.</description>
