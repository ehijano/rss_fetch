      <title>SeisRDT: Latent Diffusion Model Based On Representation Learning For Seismic Data Interpolation And Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to limitations such as geographic, physical, or economic factors, collected seismic data often have missing traces. Traditional seismic data reconstruction methods face the challenge of selecting numerous empirical parameters and struggle to handle large-scale continuous missing traces. With the advancement of deep learning, various diffusion models have demonstrated strong reconstruction capabilities. However, these UNet-based diffusion models require significant computational resources and struggle to learn the correlation between different traces in seismic data. To address the complex and irregular missing situations in seismic data, we propose a latent diffusion transformer utilizing representation learning for seismic data reconstruction. By employing a mask modeling scheme based on representation learning, the representation module uses the token sequence of known data to infer the token sequence of unknown data, enabling the reconstructed data from the diffusion model to have a more consistent data distribution and better correlation and accuracy with the known data. We propose the Representation Diffusion Transformer architecture, and a relative positional bias is added when calculating attention, enabling the diffusion model to achieve global modeling capability for seismic data. Using a pre-trained data compression model compresses the training and inference processes of the diffusion model into a latent space, which, compared to other diffusion model-based reconstruction methods, reduces computational and inference costs. Reconstruction experiments on field and synthetic datasets indicate that our method achieves higher reconstruction accuracy than existing methods and can handle various complex missing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in Earth's core generates large topographic torques on the mantle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismic and geodynamic studies indicate that the boundary between the Earth's liquid outer core and solid mantle is not spherical, but is likely characterized by topography in the form of inverted mountains and valleys that have typical amplitudes of several kilometers. One of the dynamical consequences of these deformations is that turbulent flow in the core can exert pressure torques on the mantle, thereby resulting in a transfer of angular momentum between the outer core and the mantle. Understanding this transfer of angular momentum is important for explaining variations in the Earth's rotation rate, or length of day. Whether kilometer-sized topography can explain observed variations in length of day is a longstanding question in geophysics. Here we use a suite of state-of-the-art numerical simulations of hydrodynamic convection in a rotating spherical shell with boundary topography to show that topographic torques exhibit a linear dependence on topographic amplitude and approach a quadratic dependence on flow speeds. This observation is explained with the asymptotic theory of rapidly rotating convection. These results imply that topographic torques are of sufficient magnitude to explain length of day variations.</description>
