      <title>Extreme Quantile Treatment Effects under Endogeneity: Evaluating Policy Effects for the Most Vulnerable Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for estimating and conducting inference about extreme quantile treatment effects (QTEs) in the presence of endogeneity. Our approach is applicable to a broad range of empirical research designs, including instrumental variables design and regression discontinuity design, among others. By leveraging regular variation and subsampling, the method ensures robust performance even in extreme tails, where data may be sparse or entirely absent. Simulation studies confirm the theoretical robustness of our approach. Applying our method to assess the impact of job training provided by the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), we find significantly negative QTEs for the lowest quantiles (i.e., the most disadvantaged individuals), contrasting with previous literature that emphasizes positive QTEs for intermediate quantiles.</description>

      <title>An MPEC Estimator for the Sequential Search Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a constrained maximum likelihood estimator for sequential search models, using the MPEC (Mathematical Programming with Equilibrium Constraints) approach. This method enhances numerical accuracy while avoiding ad hoc components and errors related to equilibrium conditions. Monte Carlo simulations show that the estimator performs better in small samples, with lower bias and root-mean-squared error, though less effectively in large samples. Despite these mixed results, the MPEC approach remains valuable for identifying candidate parameters comparable to the benchmark, without relying on ad hoc look-up tables, as it generates the table through solved equilibrium constraints.</description>

      <title>Multiply-Robust Causal Change Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comparing two samples of data, we observe a change in the distribution of an outcome variable. In the presence of multiple explanatory variables, how much of the change can be explained by each possible cause? We develop a new estimation strategy that, given a causal model, combines regression and re-weighting methods to quantify the contribution of each causal mechanism. Our proposed methodology is multiply robust, meaning that it still recovers the target parameter under partial misspecification. We prove that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. Moreover, it can be incorporated into existing frameworks for causal attribution, such as Shapley values, which will inherit the consistency and large-sample distribution properties. Our method demonstrates excellent performance in Monte Carlo simulations, and we show its usefulness in an empirical application. Our method is implemented as part of the Python library DoWhy (arXiv:2011.04216, arXiv:2206.06821).</description>

      <title>Weighted Regression with Sybil Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many online domains, Sybil networks -- or cases where a single user assumes multiple identities -- is a pervasive feature. This complicates experiments, as off-the-shelf regression estimators at least assume known network topologies (if not fully independent observations) when Sybil network topologies in practice are often unknown. The literature has exclusively focused on techniques to detect Sybil networks, leading many experimenters to subsequently exclude suspected networks entirely before estimating treatment effects. I present a more efficient solution in the presence of these suspected Sybil networks: a weighted regression framework that applies weights based on the probabilities that sets of observations are controlled by single actors. I show in the paper that the MSE-minimizing solution is to set the weight matrix equal to the inverse of the expected network topology. I demonstrate the methodology on simulated data, and then I apply the technique to a competition with suspected Sybil networks run on the Sui blockchain and show reductions in the standard error of the estimate by 6 - 24%.</description>
