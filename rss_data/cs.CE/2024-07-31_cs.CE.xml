      <title>Tree-Cotree-Based Tearing and Interconnecting for 3D Magnetostatics: A Dual-Primal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of electromagnetic devices with complex geometries and large-scale discrete systems benefits from advanced computational methods like IsoGeometric Analysis and Domain Decomposition. In this paper, we employ both concepts in an Isogeometric Tearing and Interconnecting method to enable the use of parallel computations for magnetostatic problems. We address the underlying non-uniqueness by using a graph-theoretic approach, the tree-cotree decomposition. The classical tree-cotree gauging is adapted to be feasible for parallelization, which requires that all local subsystems are uniquely solvable. Our contribution consists of an explicit algorithm for constructing compatible trees and combining it with a dual-primal approach to enable parallelization. The correctness of the proposed approach is proved and verified by numerical experiments, showing its accuracy, scalability and optimal convergence.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamic analysis of shear- and torsion-free rods using isogeometric discretization and outlier removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10652v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a discrete formulation of nonlinear shear- and torsion-free rods introduced by Gebhardt and Romero in [20] that uses isogeometric discretization and robust time integration. Omitting the director as an independent variable field, we reduce the number of degrees of freedom and obtain discrete solutions in multiple copies of the Euclidean space (R^3), which is larger than the corresponding multiple copies of the manifold (R^3 x S^2) obtained with standard Hermite finite elements. For implicit time integration, we choose the same integration scheme as Gebhardt and Romero in [20] that is a hybrid form of the midpoint and the trapezoidal rules. In addition, we apply a recently introduced approach for outlier removal by Hiemstra et al. [26] that reduces high-frequency content in the response without affecting the accuracy, ensuring robustness of our nonlinear discrete formulation. We illustrate the efficiency of our nonlinear discrete formulation for static and transient rods under different loading conditions, demonstrating good accuracy in space, time and the frequency domain. Our numerical example coincides with a relevant application case, the simulation of mooring lines.</description>

      <title>A comparison between black-, grey- and white-box modeling for the bidirectional Raman amplifier optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing and optimizing optical amplifiers to maximize system performance is becoming increasingly important as optical communication systems strive to increase throughput. Offline optimization of optical amplifiers relies on models ranging from white-box models deeply rooted in physics to black-box data-driven and physics-agnostic models. Here, we compare the capabilities of white-, grey- and black-box models on the challenging test case of optimizing a bidirectional distributed Raman amplifier to achieve a target frequency-distance signal power profile. We show that any of the studied methods can achieve similar frequency and distance flatness of between 1 and 3.6 dB (depending on the definition of flatness) over the C-band in an 80-km span. Then, we discuss the models' applicability, advantages, and drawbacks based on the target application scenario, in particular in terms of flexibility, optimization speed, and access to training data.</description>
