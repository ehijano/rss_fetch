      <title>Real-time Global Illumination for Dynamic 3D Gaussian Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a real-time global illumination approach along with a pipeline for dynamic 3D Gaussian models and meshes. Building on a formulated surface light transport model for 3D Gaussians, we address key performance challenges with a fast compound stochastic ray-tracing algorithm and an optimized 3D Gaussian rasterizer. Our pipeline integrates multiple real-time techniques to accelerate performance and achieve high-quality lighting effects. Our approach enables real-time rendering of dynamic scenes with interactively editable materials and dynamic lighting of diverse multi-lights settings, capturing mutual multi-bounce light transport (indirect illumination) between 3D Gaussians and mesh. Additionally, we present a real-time renderer with an interactive user interface, validating our approach and demonstrating its practicality and high efficiency with over 40 fps in scenes including both 3D Gaussians and mesh. Furthermore, our work highlights the potential of 3D Gaussians in real-time applications with dynamic lighting, offering insights into performance and optimization.</description>

      <title>Surface-Aware Distilled 3D Semantic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many 3D tasks such as pose alignment, animation, motion transfer, and 3D reconstruction rely on establishing correspondences between 3D shapes. This challenge has recently been approached by matching of semantic features from pre-trained vision models. However, despite their power, these features struggle to differentiate instances of the same semantic class such as "left hand" versus "right hand" which leads to substantial mapping errors. To solve this, we learn a surface-aware embedding space that is robust to these ambiguities. Importantly, our approach is self-supervised and requires only a small number of unpaired training meshes to infer features for new 3D shapes at test time. We achieve this by introducing a contrastive loss that preserves the semantic content of the features distilled from foundational models while disambiguating features located far apart on the shape's surface. We observe superior performance in correspondence matching benchmarks and enable downstream applications including in-part segmentation, pose alignment, and motion transfer.

      <title>Hardware-Rasterized Ray-Based Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, hardware rasterized rendering approach for ray-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (RayGS), obtaining both fast and high-quality results for novel view synthesis. Our work contains a mathematically rigorous and geometrically intuitive derivation about how to efficiently estimate all relevant quantities for rendering RayGS models, structured with respect to standard hardware rasterization shaders. Our solution is the first enabling rendering RayGS models at sufficiently high frame rates to support quality-sensitive applications like Virtual and Mixed Reality. Our second contribution enables alias-free rendering for RayGS, by addressing MIP-related issues arising when rendering diverging scales during training and testing. We demonstrate significant performance gains, across different benchmark scenes, while retaining state-of-the-art appearance quality of RayGS.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Burst Super-Resolution for Polarization Images: Noise Dataset and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Snapshot polarization imaging calculates polarization states from linearly polarized subimages. To achieve this, a polarization camera employs a double Bayer-patterned sensor to capture both color and polarization. It demonstrates low light efficiency and low spatial resolution, resulting in increased noise and compromised polarization measurements. Although burst super-resolution effectively reduces noise and enhances spatial resolution, applying it to polarization imaging poses challenges due to the lack of tailored datasets and reliable ground truth noise statistics. To address these issues, we introduce PolarNS and PolarBurstSR, two innovative datasets developed specifically for polarization imaging. PolarNS provides characterization of polarization noise statistics, facilitating thorough analysis, while PolarBurstSR functions as a benchmark for burst super-resolution in polarization images. These datasets, collected under various real-world conditions, enable comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, we present a model for analyzing polarization noise to quantify noise propagation, tested on a large dataset captured in a darkroom environment. As part of our application, we compare the latest burst super-resolution models, highlighting the advantages of training tailored to polarization compared to RGB-based methods. This work establishes a benchmark for polarization burst super-resolution and offers critical insights into noise propagation, thereby enhancing polarization image reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Mani-GS: Gaussian Splatting Manipulation with Triangular Mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), excel at producing photo-realistic rendering results but lack the flexibility for manipulation and editing which is crucial for content creation. Previous works have attempted to address this issue by deforming a NeRF in canonical space or manipulating the radiance field based on an explicit mesh. However, manipulating NeRF is not highly controllable and requires a long training and inference time. With the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), extremely high-fidelity novel view synthesis can be achieved using an explicit point-based 3D representation with much faster training and rendering speed. However, there is still a lack of effective means to manipulate 3DGS freely while maintaining rendering quality. In this work, we aim to tackle the challenge of achieving manipulable photo-realistic rendering. We propose to utilize a triangular mesh to manipulate 3DGS directly with self-adaptation. This approach reduces the need to design various algorithms for different types of Gaussian manipulation. By utilizing a triangle shape-aware Gaussian binding and adapting method, we can achieve 3DGS manipulation and preserve high-fidelity rendering after manipulation. Our approach is capable of handling large deformations, local manipulations, and soft body simulations while keeping high-quality rendering. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is also effective with inaccurate meshes extracted from 3DGS. Experiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Bokeh Diffusion: Defocus Blur Control in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image models have revolutionized creative fields by generating visually captivating outputs from textual prompts; however, while traditional photography offers precise control over camera settings to shape visual aesthetics -- such as depth-of-field -- current diffusion models typically rely on prompt engineering to mimic such effects. This approach often results in crude approximations and inadvertently altering the scene content. In this work, we propose Bokeh Diffusion, a scene-consistent bokeh control framework that explicitly conditions a diffusion model on a physical defocus blur parameter. By grounding depth-of-field adjustments, our method preserves the underlying scene structure as the level of blur is varied. To overcome the scarcity of paired real-world images captured under different camera settings, we introduce a hybrid training pipeline that aligns in-the-wild images with synthetic blur augmentations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves flexible, lens-like blur control but also supports applications such as real image editing via inversion.</description>

      <title>SANA-Sprint: One-Step Diffusion with Continuous-Time Consistency Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents SANA-Sprint, an efficient diffusion model for ultra-fast text-to-image (T2I) generation. SANA-Sprint is built on a pre-trained foundation model and augmented with hybrid distillation, dramatically reducing inference steps from 20 to 1-4. We introduce three key innovations: (1) We propose a training-free approach that transforms a pre-trained flow-matching model for continuous-time consistency distillation (sCM), eliminating costly training from scratch and achieving high training efficiency. Our hybrid distillation strategy combines sCM with latent adversarial distillation (LADD): sCM ensures alignment with the teacher model, while LADD enhances single-step generation fidelity. (2) SANA-Sprint is a unified step-adaptive model that achieves high-quality generation in 1-4 steps, eliminating step-specific training and improving efficiency. (3) We integrate ControlNet with SANA-Sprint for real-time interactive image generation, enabling instant visual feedback for user interaction. SANA-Sprint establishes a new Pareto frontier in speed-quality tradeoffs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.59 FID and 0.74 GenEval in only 1 step - outperforming FLUX-schnell (7.94 FID / 0.71 GenEval) while being 10x faster (0.1s vs 1.1s on H100). It also achieves 0.1s (T2I) and 0.25s (ControlNet) latency for 1024 x 1024 images on H100, and 0.31s (T2I) on an RTX 4090, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and potential for AI-powered consumer applications (AIPC). Code and pre-trained models will be open-sourced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in the past year. The quality of AI video continues to improve, but at the cost of larger model size, increased data quantity, and greater demand for training compute. In this report, we present Open-Sora 2.0, a commercial-level video generation model trained for only $200k. With this model, we demonstrate that the cost of training a top-performing video generation model is highly controllable. We detail all techniques that contribute to this efficiency breakthrough, including data curation, model architecture, training strategy, and system optimization. According to human evaluation results and VBench scores, Open-Sora 2.0 is comparable to global leading video generation models including the open-source HunyuanVideo and the closed-source Runway Gen-3 Alpha. By making Open-Sora 2.0 fully open-source, we aim to democratize access to advanced video generation technology, fostering broader innovation and creativity in content creation.

      <title>TexGaussian: Generating High-quality PBR Material via Octree-based 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials play a crucial role in modern graphics, enabling photorealistic rendering across diverse environment maps. Developing an effective and efficient algorithm that is capable of automatically generating high-quality PBR materials rather than RGB texture for 3D meshes can significantly streamline the 3D content creation. Most existing methods leverage pre-trained 2D diffusion models for multi-view image synthesis, which often leads to severe inconsistency between the generated textures and input 3D meshes. This paper presents TexGaussian, a novel method that uses octant-aligned 3D Gaussian Splatting for rapid PBR material generation. Specifically, we place each 3D Gaussian on the finest leaf node of the octree built from the input 3D mesh to render the multi-view images not only for the albedo map but also for roughness and metallic. Moreover, our model is trained in a regression manner instead of diffusion denoising, capable of generating the PBR material for a 3D mesh in a single feed-forward process. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our method synthesizes more visually pleasing PBR materials and runs faster than previous methods in both unconditional and text-conditional scenarios, exhibiting better consistency with the given geometry. Our code and trained models are available at https://3d-aigc.github.io/TexGaussian.</description>

      <title>SVGFusion: Scalable Text-to-SVG Generation via Vector Space Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce SVGFusion, a Text-to-SVG model capable of scaling to real-world SVG data without relying on text-based discrete language models or prolonged Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) optimization. The core idea of SVGFusion is to utilize a popular Text-to-Image framework to learn a continuous latent space for vector graphics. Specifically, SVGFusion comprises two key modules: a Vector-Pixel Fusion Variational Autoencoder (VP-VAE) and a Vector Space Diffusion Transformer (VS-DiT). The VP-VAE processes both SVG codes and their corresponding rasterizations to learn a continuous latent space, while the VS-DiT generates latent codes within this space based on the input text prompt. Building on the VP-VAE, we propose a novel rendering sequence modeling strategy which enables the learned latent space to capture the inherent creation logic of SVGs. This allows the model to generate SVGs with higher visual quality and more logical construction, while systematically avoiding occlusion in complex graphic compositions. Additionally, the scalability of SVGFusion can be continuously enhanced by adding more VS-DiT blocks. To effectively train and evaluate SVGFusion, we construct SVGX-Dataset, a large-scale, high-quality SVG dataset that addresses the scarcity of high-quality vector data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SVGFusion over existing SVG generation methods, establishing a new framework for SVG content creation. Code, model, and data will be released at: https://ximinng.github.io/SVGFusionProject/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Gaussian splatting has emerged as a robust technique for representing 3D scenes, enabling real-time rasterization and high-fidelity rendering. However, Gaussians' inherent radial symmetry and smoothness constraints limit their ability to represent complex shapes, often requiring thousands of primitives to approximate detailed geometry. We introduce Deformable Radial Kernel (DRK), which extends Gaussian splatting into a more general and flexible framework. Through learnable radial bases with adjustable angles and scales, DRK efficiently models diverse shape primitives while enabling precise control over edge sharpness and boundary curvature. iven DRK's planar nature, we further develop accurate ray-primitive intersection computation for depth sorting and introduce efficient kernel culling strategies for improved rasterization efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRK outperforms existing methods in both representation efficiency and rendering quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance while dramatically reducing primitive count.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling lighting effects are fundamental tasks in computer vision and graphics. Classic physically-based rendering (PBR) accurately simulates the light transport, but relies on precise scene representations--explicit 3D geometry, high-quality material properties, and lighting conditions--that are often impractical to obtain in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we introduce DiffusionRenderer, a neural approach that addresses the dual problem of inverse and forward rendering within a holistic framework. Leveraging powerful video diffusion model priors, the inverse rendering model accurately estimates G-buffers from real-world videos, providing an interface for image editing tasks, and training data for the rendering model. Conversely, our rendering model generates photorealistic images from G-buffers without explicit light transport simulation. Experiments demonstrate that DiffusionRenderer effectively approximates inverse and forwards rendering, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art. Our model enables practical applications from a single video input--including relighting, material editing, and realistic object insertion.</description>

      <title>LAYOUTDREAMER: Physics-guided Layout for Text-to-3D Compositional Scene Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the field of text-guided 3D scene generation has garnered significant attention. High-quality generation that aligns with physical realism and high controllability is crucial for practical 3D scene applications. However, existing methods face fundamental limitations: (i) difficulty capturing complex relationships between multiple objects described in the text, (ii) inability to generate physically plausible scene layouts, and (iii) lack of controllability and extensibility in compositional scenes. In this paper, we introduce LayoutDreamer, a framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to facilitate high-quality, physically consistent compositional scene generation guided by text. Specifically, given a text prompt, we convert it into a directed scene graph and adaptively adjust the density and layout of the initial compositional 3D Gaussians. Subsequently, dynamic camera adjustments are made based on the training focal point to ensure entity-level generation quality. Finally, by extracting directed dependencies from the scene graph, we tailor physical and layout energy to ensure both realism and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LayoutDreamer outperforms other compositional scene generation quality and semantic alignment methods. Specifically, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the multiple objects generation metric of T3Bench.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-traversal data, commonly collected through daily commutes or by self-driving fleets, provides multiple viewpoints for scene reconstruction within a road block. This data offers significant potential for high-quality novel view synthesis, which is crucial for applications such as autonomous vehicle simulators. However, inherent challenges in multi-traversal data often result in suboptimal reconstruction quality, including variations in appearance and the presence of dynamic objects. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Traversal Gaussian Splatting (MTGS), a novel approach that reconstructs high-quality driving scenes from arbitrarily collected multi-traversal data by modeling a shared static geometry while separately handling dynamic elements and appearance variations. Our method employs a multi-traversal dynamic scene graph with a shared static node and traversal-specific dynamic nodes, complemented by color correction nodes with learnable spherical harmonics coefficient residuals. This approach enables high-fidelity novel view synthesis and provides flexibility to navigate any viewpoint. We conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale driving dataset, nuPlan, with multi-traversal data. Our results demonstrate that MTGS improves LPIPS by 23.5% and geometry accuracy by 46.3% compared to single-traversal baselines. The code and data would be available to the public.</description>
