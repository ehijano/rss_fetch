      <title>Minimum Selective Subset on Some Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a connected simple graph G = (V(G),E(G)), each vertex is assigned a color from the set of colors C={1, 2,..., c}. The set of vertices V(G) is partitioned as V_1, V_2, ... ,V_c, where all vertices in V_j share the same color j. A subset S of V(G) is called Selective Subset if, for every vertex v in V(G), and if v is in V_j, at least one of its nearest neighbors in (S union (V(G)\ V_j)) has the same color as v. The Minimum Selective Subset (MSS) problem seeks to find a selective subset of minimum size. The problem was first introduced by Wilfong in 1991 for a set of points in the Euclidean plane, where two major problems, MCS (Minimum Consistent Subset) and MSS, were proposed.
  In graph algorithms, the only known result is that the MSS problem is NP-complete, as shown in 2018. Beyond this, no further progress has been made to date. In contrast, the MCS problem has been widely studied in various graph classes over the years. Therefore, in this work, we also extend the algorithmic study of MSS on various graph classes. We first present a log(n)-approximation algorithm for general graphs with n vertices and regardless of the number of colors. We also show that the problem remains NP-complete in planar graphs when restricted to just two colors.. Finally, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for computing optimal solutions in trees and unit interval graphs for any number of colors.</description>

      <title>Compact Representation of Semilinear and Terrain-like Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the existence and construction of \textit{biclique covers} of graphs, consisting of coverings of their edge sets by complete bipartite graphs. The \textit{size} of such a cover is the sum of the sizes of the bicliques. Small-size biclique covers of graphs are ubiquitous in computational geometry, and have been shown to be useful compact representations of graphs. We give a brief survey of classical and recent results on biclique covers and their applications, and give new families of graphs having biclique covers of near-linear size.
  In particular, we show that semilinear graphs, whose edges are defined by linear relations in bounded dimensional space, always have biclique covers of size $O(n\polylog n)$. This generalizes many previously known results on special classes of graphs including interval graphs, permutation graphs, and graphs of bounded boxicity, but also new classes such as intersection graphs of L-shapes in the plane. It also directly implies the bounds for Zarankiewicz's problem derived by Basit, Chernikov, Starchenko, Tao, and Tran (\textit{Forum Math. Sigma}, 2021).
  We also consider capped graphs, also known as terrain-like graphs, defined as ordered graphs forbidding a certain ordered pattern on four vertices. Terrain-like graphs contain the induced subgraphs of terrain visibility graphs. We give an elementary proof that these graphs admit biclique partitions of size $O(n\log^3 n)$. This provides a simple combinatorial analogue of a classical result from Agarwal, Alon, Aronov, and Suri on polygon visibility graphs (\textit{Discrete Comput. Geom.} 1994).
  Finally, we prove that there exists families of unit disk graphs on $n$ vertices that do not admit biclique coverings of size $o(n^{4/3})$, showing that we are unlikely to improve on Szemer\'edi-Trotter type incidence bounds for higher-degree semialgebraic graphs.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Time-Varying Scalar Fields using Piecewise-Linear Morse-Cerf Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Morse-Cerf theory considers a one-parameter family of smooth functions defined on a manifold and studies the evolution of their critical points with the parameter. This paper presents an adaptation of Morse-Cerf theory to a family of piecewise-linear (PL) functions. The vertex diagram and Cerf diagram are introduced as representations of the evolution of critical points of the PL function. The characterization of a crossing in the vertex diagram based on the homology of the lower links of vertices leads to the definition of a topological descriptor for time-varying scalar fields. An algorithm for computing the Cerf diagram and a measure for comparing two Cerf diagrams are also described together with experimental results on time-varying scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Unbent Collections of Orthogonal Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been interest in representing single graphs by multiple drawings; for example, using graph stories, storyplans, or uncrossed collections. In this paper, we apply this idea to orthogonal graph drawing. Due to the orthogonal drawing style, we focus on 4-graphs, that is, graphs of maximum degree 4. We restrict ourselves to plane graphs, that is, planar graphs whose embedding is fixed. Our goal is to represent any plane 4-graph $G$ by an unbent collection, that is, a collection of orthogonal drawings of $G$ that adhere to the embedding of $G$ and ensure that each edge of $G$ is drawn without bends in at least one of the drawings. We investigate two objectives. First, we consider minimizing the number of drawings in an unbent collection. We prove that every plane 4-graph can be represented by a collection with at most three drawings, which is tight. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to admit an unbent collection of size $2$. Second, we consider minimizing the total number of bends over all drawings in an unbent collection. We show that this problem is NP-hard and give a 3-approximation algorithm. For the special case of plane triconnected cubic graphs, we show how to compute minimum-bend collections in linear time.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for the Shortest Vector Problem in $2$-dimensional Lattices, Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently solving the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) in two-dimensional lattices holds practical significance in cryptography and computational geometry. While simpler than its high-dimensional counterpart, two-dimensional SVP motivates scalable solutions for high-dimensional lattices and benefits applications like sequence cipher cryptanalysis involving large integers. In this work, we first propose a novel definition of reduced bases and develop an efficient adaptive lattice reduction algorithm \textbf{CrossEuc} that strategically applies the Euclidean algorithm across dimensions. Building on this framework, we introduce \textbf{HVec}, a vectorized generalization of the Half-GCD algorithm originally defined for integers, which can efficiently halve the bit-length of two vectors and may have independent interest. By iteratively invoking \textbf{HVec}, our optimized algorithm \textbf{HVecSBP} achieves a reduced basis in $O(\log n M(n) )$ time for arbitrary input bases with bit-length $n$, where $M(n)$ denotes the cost of multiplying two $n$-bit integers. Compared to existing algorithms, our design is applicable to general forms of input lattices, eliminating the cost of pre-converting input bases to Hermite Normal Form (HNF). The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that for the input lattice bases in HNF, the optimized algorithm \textbf{HVecSBP} achieves at least a $13.5\times$ efficiency improvement compared to existing methods. For general-form input lattice bases, converting them to HNF before applying \textbf{HVecSBP} offers only marginal advantages in extreme cases where the two basis vectors are nearly degenerate. However, as the linear dependency between input basis vectors decreases, directly employing \textbf{HVecSBP} yields increasingly significant efficiency gains, outperforming hybrid approaches that rely on prior \textbf{HNF} conversion.</description>
