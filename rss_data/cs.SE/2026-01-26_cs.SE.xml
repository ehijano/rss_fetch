      <title>VibeTensor: System Software for Deep Learning, Fully Generated by AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VIBETENSOR is an open-source research system software stack for deep learning, generated by LLM-powered coding agents under high-level human guidance. In this paper, "fully generated" refers to code provenance: implementation changes were produced and applied as agent-proposed diffs; validation relied on agent-run builds, tests, and differential checks, without per-change manual diff review. It implements a PyTorch-style eager tensor library with a C++20 core (CPU+CUDA), a torch-like Python overlay via nanobind, and an experimental Node.js/TypeScript interface. Unlike thin bindings, VIBETENSOR includes its own tensor/storage system, schema-lite dispatcher, reverse-mode autograd, CUDA runtime (streams/events/graphs), a stream-ordered caching allocator with diagnostics, and a stable C ABI for dynamically loaded operator plugins. We view this release as a milestone for AI-assisted software engineering: it shows coding agents can generate a coherent deep learning runtime spanning language bindings down to CUDA memory management, validated primarily by builds and tests. We describe the architecture, summarize the workflow used to produce and validate the system, and evaluate the artifact. We report repository scale and test-suite composition, and summarize reproducible microbenchmarks from an accompanying AI-generated kernel suite, including fused attention versus PyTorch SDPA/FlashAttention. We also report end-to-end training sanity checks on 3 small workloads (sequence reversal, ViT, miniGPT) on NVIDIA H100 (Hopper, SM90) and Blackwell-class GPUs; multi-GPU results are Blackwell-only and use an optional CUTLASS-based ring-allreduce plugin gated on CUDA 13+ and sm103a toolchain support. Finally, we discuss failure modes in generated system software, including a "Frankenstein" composition effect where locally correct subsystems interact to yield globally suboptimal performance.</description>

      <title>Combining Tests and Proofs for Better Software Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test or prove? These two approaches to software verification have long been presented as opposites. One is dynamic, the other static: a test executes the program, a proof only analyzes the program text. A different perspective is emerging, in which testing and proving are complementary rather than competing techniques for producing software of verified quality.
  Work performed over the past few years and reviewed here develops this complementarity by taking advantage of Design by Contract, as available in Eiffel, and exploiting a feature of modern program-proving tools based on ``Satisfiability Modulo Theories'' (SMT): counterexample generation. A counterexample is an input combination that makes the program fail. If we are trying to prove a program correct, we hope not to find any. One can, however, apply counterexample generation to incorrect programs, as a tool for automatic test generation. We can also introduce faults into a correct program and turn the counterexamples into an automatically generated regression test suite with full coverage. Additionally, we can use these mechanisms to help produce program fixes for incorrect programs, with a guarantee that the fixes are correct. All three applications, leveraging on the mechanisms of Eiffel and Design by Contract, hold significant promise to address some of the challenges of program testing, software maintenance and Automatic Program Repair.</description>

      <title>Identifying Concurrency Bug Reports via Linguistic Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing ubiquity of multi-core architectures, concurrent systems have become essential but increasingly prone to complex issues such as data races and deadlocks. While modern issue-tracking systems facilitate the reporting of such problems, labeling concurrency-related bug reports remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task. This paper presents a linguistic-pattern-based framework for automatically identifying concurrency bug reports. We derive 58 distinct linguistic patterns from 730 manually labeled concurrency bug reports, organized across four levels: word-level (keywords), phrase-level (n-grams), sentence-level (semantic), and bug report-level (contextual). To assess their effectiveness, we evaluate four complementary approaches-matching, learning, prompt-based, and fine-tuning-spanning traditional machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and pre-trained language models (PLMs). Our comprehensive evaluation on 12 large-scale open-source projects (10,920 issue reports from GitHub and Jira) demonstrates that fine-tuning PLMs with linguistic-pattern-enriched inputs achieves the best performance, reaching a precision of 91% on GitHub and 93% on Jira, and maintaining strong precision on post cut-off data (91%). The contributions of this work include: (1) a comprehensive taxonomy of linguistic patterns for concurrency bugs, (2) a novel fine-tuning strategy that integrates domain-specific linguistic knowledge into PLMs, and (3) a curated, labeled dataset to support reproducible research. Together, these advances provide a foundation for improving the automation, precision, and interpretability of concurrency bug classification.</description>

      <title>SE Research is a Complex Ecosystem: Isolated Fixes Keep Failing -- and Systems Thinking Shows Why</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The software engineering research community is productive, yet it faces a constellation of challenges: swamped review processes, metric-driven incentives, distorted publication practices, and increasing pressures from AI, scale, and outright scams. These issues are often treated in isolation, yet they arise from deep structural dynamics within the research ecosystem itself and distract us from the larger role of research in society. Meaningful progress requires a holistic system-level view. We sketch such a framework drawing on ideas from complex systems, ecosystems, and theory of change. Reframing SE's challenges through this lens reveals non-linear feedback loops that sustain current dysfunctions, and it helps to identify leverage points for reform. These are less a matter of isolated fixes and more a matter of exploring coordinated sets of fixes that operate across the SE ecosystem</description>

      <title>Toward Agentic Software Project Management: A Vision and Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of agentic AI, Software Engineering is transforming to a new era dubbed Software Engineering 3.0. Software project management (SPM) must also evolve with such transformations to boost successful project completion, while keeping humans at the heart of it. Building on our preliminary ideas of "agentic SPM", and supporting literature, we present our vision of an "Agentic Project Manager (PM)" as a multi-agent system for SPM 3.0. They will work like a "junior project manager", or an "intern project manager" collaboratively with software teams. We introduce four working modes, with varying autonomy levels to choose from, based on the SPM task. This addresses concerns with ethics, accountability, and trust related to agentic PMs. We also share insights on human PM role evolution and new skill requirements as a "strategic leader" and a "coach" for humans and agents. While creating the foundation for agentic SPM research, we present a research agenda for the wider research community.</description>

      <title>RubberDuckBench: A Benchmark for AI Coding Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmers are turning to AI coding assistants to answer questions about their code. Benchmarks are needed to soundly evaluate these systems and understand their performance. To enable such a study, we curate a benchmark of real-world contextualized questions derived from Github pull request comments. Out of this work, we present RubberDuckBench: a multilingual benchmark of questions about code, along with detailed rubrics for evaluating answers. We evaluate a diverse set of 20 LLMs (proprietary &amp; open-source) on answering these questions. We find that even state of the art models fail to give consistent, correct responses across the benchmark. Grok 4 (69.29%), Claude Opus 4 (68.5%), and GPT-5 (67.8%) perform best overall, but do not exhibit pairwise significant superiority over the next 9 best performing models. Most models obtain points through partial credit, with the best performing models only answering at most 2 questions completely correctly across all trials. Furthermore, models often hallucinate with lies in 58.3\% of responses on average. Cost analysis reveals no correlation between expense (API pricing or parameter count) and performance. We intend this benchmark to be a target for future research in trustworthy and correct AI coding assistants.</description>

      <title>Bridging Expert Reasoning and LLM Detection: A Knowledge-Driven Framework for Malicious Packages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-source ecosystems such as NPM and PyPI are increasingly targeted by supply chain attacks, yet existing detection methods either depend on fragile handcrafted rules or data-driven features that fail to capture evolving attack semantics. We present IntelGuard, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based framework that integrates expert analytical reasoning into automated malicious package detection. IntelGuard constructs a structured knowledge base from over 8,000 threat intelligence reports, linking malicious code snippets with behavioral descriptions and expert reasoning. When analyzing new packages, it retrieves semantically similar malicious examples and applies LLM-guided reasoning to assess whether code behaviors align with intended functionality. Experiments on 4,027 real-world packages show that IntelGuard achieves 99% accuracy and a 0.50% false positive rate, while maintaining 96.5% accuracy on obfuscated code. Deployed on PyPI.org, it discovered 54 previously unreported malicious packages, demonstrating interpretable and robust detection guided by expert knowledge.</description>

      <title>EvoConfig: Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems for Efficient Autonomous Environment Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reliable executable environment is the foundation for ensuring that large language models solve software engineering tasks. Due to the complex and tedious construction process, large-scale configuration is relatively inefficient. However, most methods always overlook fine-grained analysis of the actions performed by the agent, making it difficult to handle complex errors and resulting in configuration failures. To address this bottleneck, we propose EvoConfig, an efficient environment configuration framework that optimizes multi-agent collaboration to build correct runtime environments. EvoConfig features an expert diagnosis module for fine-grained post-execution analysis, and a self-evolving mechanism that lets expert agents self-feedback and dynamically adjust error-fixing priorities in real time. Empirically, EvoConfig matches the previous state-of-the-art Repo2Run on Repo2Run's 420 repositories, while delivering clear gains on harder cases: on the more challenging Envbench, EvoConfig achieves a 78.1% success rate, outperforming Repo2Run by 7.1%. Beyond end-to-end success, EvoConfig also demonstrates stronger debugging competence, achieving higher accuracy in error identification and producing more effective repair recommendations than existing methods.</description>

      <title>REprompt: Prompt Generation for Intelligent Software Development Guided by Requirements Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of large language models is transforming software development. Beyond serving as code auto-completion tools in integrated development environments, large language models increasingly function as foundation models within coding agents in vibe-coding scenarios. In such settings, prompts play a central role in agent-based intelligent software development, as they not only guide the behavior of large language models but also serve as carriers of user requirements. Under the dominant conversational paradigm, prompts are typically divided into system prompts and user prompts. System prompts provide high-level instructions to steer model behavior and establish conversational context, while user prompts represent inputs and requirements provided by human users. Despite their importance, designing effective prompts remains challenging, as it requires expertise in both prompt engineering and software engineering, particularly requirements engineering. To reduce the burden of manual prompt construction, numerous automated prompt engineering methods have been proposed. However, most existing approaches neglect the methodological principles of requirements engineering, limiting their ability to generate artifacts that conform to formal requirement specifications in realistic software development scenarios. To address this gap, we propose REprompt, a multi-agent prompt optimization framework guided by requirements engineering. Experiment results demonstrate that REprompt effectively optimizes both system and user prompts by grounding prompt generation in requirements engineering principles.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Role of Natural Language Code Comments in Code Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era in automated code translation across programming languages. Since most code-specific LLMs are pretrained on well-commented code from large repositories like GitHub, it is reasonable to hypothesize that natural language code comments could aid in improving translation quality. Despite their potential relevance, comments are largely absent from existing code translation benchmarks, rendering their impact on translation quality inadequately characterised. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study evaluating the impact of comments on translation performance. Our analysis involves more than $80,000$ translations, with and without comments, of $1100+$ code samples from two distinct benchmarks covering pairwise translations between five different programming languages: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our results provide strong evidence that code comments, particularly those that describe the overall purpose of the code rather than line-by-line functionality, significantly enhance translation accuracy. Based on these findings, we propose COMMENTRA, a code translation approach, and demonstrate that it can potentially double the performance of LLM-based code translation. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first in terms of its comprehensiveness, scale, and language coverage on how to improve code translation accuracy using code comments.</description>

      <title>The Green Side of the Lua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development highlights the importance of energy-efficient software to reduce the global carbon footprint. Programming languages and execution models strongly influence software energy consumption, with interpreted languages generally being less efficient than compiled ones. Lua illustrates this trade-off: despite its popularity, it is less energy-efficient than greener and faster languages such as C.
  This paper presents an empirical study of Lua's runtime performance and energy efficiency across 25 official interpreter versions and just-in-time (JIT) compilers. Using a comprehensive benchmark suite, we measure execution time and energy consumption to analyze Lua's evolution, the impact of JIT compilation, and comparisons with other languages. Results show that all LuaJIT compilers significantly outperform standard Lua interpreters. The most efficient LuaJIT consumes about seven times less energy and runs seven times faster than the best Lua interpreter. Moreover, LuaJIT approaches C's efficiency, using roughly six times more energy and running about eight times slower, demonstrating the substantial benefits of JIT compilation for improving both performance and energy efficiency in interpreted languages.</description>

      <title>Supporting Stakeholder Requirements Expression with LLM Revisions: An Empirical Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stakeholders often struggle to accurately express their requirements due to articulation barriers arising from limited domain knowledge or from cognitive constraints. This can cause misalignment between expressed and intended requirements, complicating elicitation and validation. Traditional elicitation techniques, such as interviews and follow-up sessions, are time-consuming and risk distorting stakeholders' original intent across iterations. Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer user intentions from context, suggesting potential for assisting stakeholders in expressing their needs. This raises the questions of (i) how effectively LLMs can support requirement expression and (ii) whether such support benefits stakeholders with limited domain expertise. We conducted a study with 26 participants who produced 130 requirement statements. Each participant first expressed requirements unaided, then evaluated LLM-generated revisions tailored to their context. Participants rated LLM revisions significantly higher than their original statements across all dimensions-alignment with intent, readability, reasoning, and unambiguity. Qualitative feedback further showed that LLM revisions often surfaced tacit details stakeholders considered important and helped them better understand their own requirements. We present and evaluate a stakeholder-centered approach that leverages LLMs as articulation aids in requirements elicitation and validation. Our results show that LLM-assisted reformulation improves perceived completeness, clarity, and alignment of requirements. By keeping stakeholders in the validation loop, this approach promotes responsible and trustworthy use of AI in Requirements Engineering.</description>

      <title>Adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence in the German Software Engineering Industry: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have seen rapid adoption among software developers. While adoption rates in the industry are rising, the underlying factors influencing the effective use of these tools, including the depth of interaction, organizational constraints, and experience-related considerations, have not been thoroughly investigated. This issue is particularly relevant in environments with stringent regulatory requirements, such as Germany, where practitioners must address the GDPR and the EU AI Act while balancing productivity gains with intellectual property considerations. Despite the significant impact of GenAI on software engineering, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has systematically examined the adoption dynamics of GenAI tools within the German context. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive mixed-methods study on GenAI adoption among German software engineers. Specifically, we conducted 18 exploratory interviews with practitioners, followed by a developer survey with 109 participants. We analyze patterns of tool adoption, prompting strategies, and organizational factors that influence effectiveness. Our results indicate that experience level moderates the perceived benefits of GenAI tools, and productivity gains are not evenly distributed among developers. Further, organizational size affects both tool selection and the intensity of tool use. Limited awareness of the project context is identified as the most significant barrier. We summarize a set of actionable implications for developers, organizations, and tool vendors seeking to advance artificial intelligence (AI) assisted software development.</description>

      <title>Developer Perspectives on REST API Usability: A Study of REST API Guidelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: REST is today's most widely used architectural style for providing web-based services. In the age of service-orientation (a.k.a. Software as a Service (SaaS)) APIs have become core business assets and can easily expose hundreds of operations. While well-designed APIs contribute to the commercial success of a service, poorly designed APIs can threaten entire organizations. Recognizing their relevance and value, many guidelines have been proposed for designing usable APIs, similar to design patterns and coding standards. For example, Zalando and Microsoft provide popular REST API guidelines. However, they are often considered as too large and inapplicable, so many companies create and maintain their own guidelines, which is a challenge in itself. In practice, however, developers still struggle to design effective REST APIs. To improve the situation, we need to improve our empirical understanding of adopting, using, and creating REST API guidelines.
  We present an interview study with 16 REST API experts from industry. We determine the notion of API usability, guideline effectiveness factors, challenges of adopting and designing guidelines, and best practices. We identified eight factors influencing REST API usability, among which the adherence to conventions is the most important one. While guidelines can in fact be an effective means to improve API usability, there is significant resistance from developers against strict guidelines. Guideline size and how it fits with organizational needs are two important factors to consider. REST guidelines also have to grow with the organization, while all stakeholders need to be involved in their development and maintenance. Automated linting provides an opportunity to not only embed compliance enforcement into processes, but also to justify guideline rules with educational explanations.</description>

      <title>SWE-Pruner: Self-Adaptive Context Pruning for Coding Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in software development, but their performance is hampered by long interaction contexts, which incur high API costs and latency. While various context compression approaches such as LongLLMLingua have emerged to tackle this challenge, they typically rely on fixed metrics such as PPL, ignoring the task-specific nature of code understanding. As a result, they frequently disrupt syntactic and logical structure and fail to retain critical implementation details. In this paper, we propose SWE-Pruner, a self-adaptive context pruning framework tailored for coding agents. Drawing inspiration from how human programmers "selectively skim" source code during development and debugging, SWE-Pruner performs task-aware adaptive pruning for long contexts. Given the current task, the agent formulates an explicit goal (e.g., "focus on error handling") as a hint to guide the pruning targets. A lightweight neural skimmer (0.6B parameters) is trained to dynamically select relevant lines from the surrounding context given the goal. Evaluations across four benchmarks and multiple models validate SWE-Pruner's effectiveness in various scenarios, achieving 23-54% token reduction on agent tasks like SWE-Bench Verified and up to 14.84x compression on single-turn tasks like LongCodeQA with minimal performance impact.</description>

      <title>Variability-Aware Detection and Repair of Compilation Errors Using Foundation Models in Configurable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern software systems often rely on conditional compilation to support optional features and multiple deployment scenarios. In configurable systems, compilation errors may arise only under specific combinations of features, remaining hidden during development and testing. Such variability-induced errors are difficult to detect in practice, as traditional compilers analyze only a single configuration at a time, while existing variability-aware tools typically require complex setup and incur high analysis costs. In this article, we present an empirical study on the use of foundation models to detect and fix compilation errors caused by feature variability in configurable C systems. We evaluate GPT-OSS-20B and GEMINI 3 PRO, and compare them with TYPECHEF, a state-of-the-art variability-aware parser. Our evaluation considers two complementary settings: 5,000 small configurable systems designed to systematically exercise variability-induced compilation behavior, comprising both systems with and without compilation errors, and 14 real-world GitHub commits, as well as an additional set of mutation testing scenarios (42). Our results show that foundation models can effectively identify variability-induced compilation errors. On small configurable systems, GPT-OSS-20B achieved a precision of 0.97, recall of 0.90, and accuracy of 0.94, substantially increasing detection coverage compared to TYPECHEF, and exhibiting performance comparable to GEMINI 3. For compilation error repair, GPT-OSS-20B produced compilable fixes in over 70% of the cases. In the analysis of real commits, CHATGPT-5.2 detected all injected faults except for two cases and identified a potential real compilation bug in a Linux commit with more than 1,000 modified lines. Our findings indicate that current state-of-the-art foundation models provide a practical and low-effort complement to traditional variability-aware analyses.</description>

      <title>Will It Survive? Deciphering the Fate of AI-Generated Code in Open Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of AI agents as coding assistants into software development has raised questions about the long-term viability of AI agent-generated code. A prevailing hypothesis within the software engineering community suggests this code is "disposable", meaning it is merged quickly but discarded shortly thereafter. If true, organizations risk shifting maintenance burden from generation to post-deployment remediation. We investigate this hypothesis through survival analysis of 201 open-source projects, tracking over 200,000 code units authored by AI agents versus humans. Contrary to the disposable code narrative, agent-authored code survives significantly longer: at the line level, it exhibits a 15.8 percentage-point lower modification rate and 16% lower hazard of modification (HR = 0.842, p &lt; 0.001). However, modification profiles differ. Agent-authored code shows modestly elevated corrective rates (26.3% vs. 23.0%), while human code shows higher adaptive rates. However, the effect sizes are small (Cram\'er's V = 0.116), and per-agent variation exceeds the agent-human gap. Turning to prediction, textual features can identify modification-prone code (AUC-ROC = 0.671), but predicting when modifications occur remains challenging (Macro F1 = 0.285), suggesting timing depends on external organizational dynamics. The bottleneck for agent-generated code may not be generation quality, but the organizational practices that govern its long-term evolution.</description>

      <title>AI builds, We Analyze: An Empirical Study of AI-Generated Build Code Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI coding agents for software development has raised important questions about the quality and maintainability of the code they produce. While prior studies have examined AI-generated source code, the impact of AI coding agents on build systems-a critical yet understudied component of the software lifecycle-remains largely unexplored. This data mining challenge focuses on AIDev, the first large-scale, openly available dataset capturing agent-authored pull requests (Agentic-PRs) from real-world GitHub repositories. Our paper leverages this dataset to investigate (RQ1) whether AI coding agents generate build code with quality issues (e.g., code smells), (RQ2) to what extent AI agents can eliminate code smells from build code, and (RQ3) to what extent Agentic-PRs are accepted by developers. We identified 364 maintainability and security-related build smells across varying severity levels, indicating that AI-generated build code can introduce quality issues-such as lack of error handling, and hardcoded paths or URLs-while also, in some cases, removing existing smells through refactorings (e.g., Pull Up Module and Externalize Properties). Notably, more than 61\% of Agentic-PRs are approved and merged with minimal human intervention. This dual impact underscores the need for future research on AI-aware build code quality assessment to systematically evaluate, guide, and govern AI-generated build systems code.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Feasibility of Selective Instrumentation for Runtime Code Coverage in Large C++ Game Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code coverage is a valuable guide for testing, but in AAA games the overhead of instrumentation conflicts with strict performance requirements and can destabilize automated tests. We propose and assess a selective instrumentation approach tailored to large game engines written in \texttt{C++}, which reduces the scope of instrumentation while preserving relevant coverage data to developer commits. Our framework integrates into an industrial game testing pipeline, enabling developers to receive immediate coverage feedback on tests run against their changes. The compilation overhead of our approach is minimal, allowing instrumentation of over 2,000 commits before doubling build time. In performance evaluations, even the worst-case scenario maintains frame rates above 50\% of the non-instrumented baseline. Across two production test suites maintained by our industry partner, our framework caused no automated test failures, avoiding the instability observed under full instrumentation. Our work shows that commit-level or build-level coverage of large \texttt{C++} game engines can be achieved with minimal overhead and without compromising test stability.</description>

      <title>Computational Foundations for Strategic Coopetition: Formalizing Collective Action and Loyalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-motive multi-agent settings are rife with persistent free-riding because individual effort benefits all members equally, yet each member bears the full cost of their own contribution. Classical work by Holmstr\"om established that under pure self-interest, Nash equilibrium is universal shirking. While i* represents teams as composite actors, it lacks scalable computational mechanisms for analyzing how collective action problems emerge and resolve in coopetitive settings. This technical report extends computational foundations for strategic coopetition to team-level dynamics, building on companion work formalizing interdependence/complementarity (arXiv:2510.18802) and trust dynamics (arXiv:2510.24909). We develop loyalty-moderated utility functions with two mechanisms: loyalty benefit (welfare internalization plus intrinsic contribution satisfaction) and cost tolerance (reduced effort burden for loyal members). We integrate i* structural dependencies through dependency-weighted team cohesion, connecting member incentives to team-level positioning. The framework applies to both human teams (loyalty as psychological identification) and multi-agent systems (alignment coefficients and adjusted cost functions). Experimental validation across 3,125 configurations demonstrates robust loyalty effects (15.04x median effort differentiation). All six behavioral targets achieve thresholds: free-riding baseline (96.5%), loyalty monotonicity (100%), effort differentiation (100%), team size effect (100%), mechanism synergy (99.5%), and bounded outcomes (100%). Empirical validation using published Apache HTTP Server (1995-2023) case study achieves 60/60 points, reproducing contribution patterns across formation, growth, maturation, and governance phases. Statistical significance confirmed at p&lt;0.001, Cohen's d=0.71.</description>

      <title>Cutting the Gordian Knot: Detecting Malicious PyPI Packages via a Knowledge-Mining Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Python Package Index (PyPI) has become a target for malicious actors, yet existing detection tools generate false positive rates of 15-30%, incorrectly flagging one-third of legitimate packages as malicious. This problem arises because current tools rely on simple syntactic rules rather than semantic understanding, failing to distinguish between identical API calls serving legitimate versus malicious purposes. To address this challenge, we propose PyGuard, a knowledge-driven framework that converts detection failures into useful behavioral knowledge by extracting patterns from existing tools' false positives and negatives. Our method utilizes hierarchical pattern mining to identify behavioral sequences that distinguish malicious from benign code, employs Large Language Models to create semantic abstractions beyond syntactic variations, and combines this knowledge into a detection system that integrates exact pattern matching with contextual reasoning. PyGuard achieves 99.50% accuracy with only 2 false positives versus 1,927-2,117 in existing tools, maintains 98.28% accuracy on obfuscated code, and identified 219 previously unknown malicious packages in real-world deployment. The behavioral patterns show cross-ecosystem applicability with 98.07% accuracy on NPM packages, demonstrating that semantic understanding enables knowledge transfer across programming languages.</description>

      <title>From Transactions to Exploits: Automated PoC Synthesis for Real-World DeFi Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain systems are increasingly targeted by on-chain attacks that exploit contract vulnerabilities to extract value rapidly and stealthily, making systematic analysis and reproduction highly challenging. In practice, reproducing such attacks requires manually crafting proofs-of-concept (PoCs), a labor-intensive process that demands substantial expertise and scales poorly. In this work, we present the first automated framework for synthesizing verifiable PoCs directly from on-chain attack executions. Our key insight is that attacker logic can be recovered from low-level transaction traces via trace-driven reverse engineering, and then translated into executable exploits by leveraging the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we propose TracExp, which localizes attack-relevant execution contexts from noisy, multi-contract traces and introduces a novel dual-decompiler to transform concrete executions into semantically enriched exploit pseudocode. Guided by this representation, TracExp synthesizes PoCs and refines them to preserve exploitability-relevant semantics. We evaluate TracExp on 321 real-world attacks over the past 20 months. TracExp successfully synthesizes PoCs for 93% of incidents, with 58.78% being directly verifiable, at an average cost of only \$0.07 per case. Moreover, TracExp enabled the release of a large number of previously unavailable PoCs to the community, earning a $900 bounty and demonstrating strong practical impact.</description>

      <title>Investigating Retargetability Claims for Quantum Compilers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the NISQ-era, there is a wide variety of hardware manufacturers building quantum computers. Each of these companies may choose different approaches and hardware architectures for their machines. This poses a problem for quantum software engineering, as the retargetability of quantum programs across different hardware platforms becomes a non-trivial challenge. In response to this problem, various retargetable quantum compilers have been presented in the scientific literature. These promise the ability to compile software for different hardware platforms, enabling retargetability for quantum software. In this paper, we develop and apply a metric by which the retargetability of the quantum compilers can be assessed. We develop and run a study to analyze key aspects regarding the retargetability of the compilers Tket, Qiskit, and ProjectQ. Our findings indicate that Tket demonstrates the highest level of retargetability, closely followed by Qiskit, while ProjectQ lags behind. These results provide insights for quantum software developers in selecting appropriate compilers for their use-cases, and highlight areas for improvement in quantum compilers.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, yet few benchmarks assess their capabilities in embedded system development. In this paper, we introduce EmbedAgent, a paradigm designed to simulate real-world roles in embedded system development, such as Embedded System Programmer, Architect, and Integrator. This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks that bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these tasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded system programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration. Embedbench consists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware platforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover several key findings. Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the cases, DeepSeek-R1 achieves only a 55.6% pass@1 rate when provided with schematic information, and 50.0% when tasked with generating the schematics itself. In the cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance with MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8% pass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4% pass@1. Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this domain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge during pretraining. Based on these insights, we propose two strategies: retrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback-to enhance LLM performance. These strategies result in significant improvements, with Deepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without. Additionally, the accuracy of the Arduino to ESP32 migration task improves from 21.4% to 27.8%.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Prompting and Execution Feedback for SWE Issue Test Generation and Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A software engineering issue (SWE issue) is easier to resolve when accompanied by a reproduction test. Unfortunately, most issues do not come with functioning reproduction tests, so this paper explores how to generate them automatically. The primary challenge in this setting is that the code to be tested is either missing or wrong, as evidenced by the existence of the issue in the first place. This has held back test generation for this setting: without the correct code to execute, it is difficult to leverage execution feedback to generate good tests. This paper introduces novel techniques for leveraging execution feedback to get around this problem, implemented in a new reproduction test generator called e-Otter++. Experiments show that e-Otter++ represents a leap ahead in the state-of-the-art for this problem, generating tests with an average fail-to-pass rate of 63% on the TDD-Bench Verified benchmark.</description>

      <title>CoRaCMG: Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Commit Message Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commit messages play a key role in documenting the intent behind code changes. However, they are often low-quality, vague, or incomplete, limiting their usefulness. Commit Message Generation (CMG) aims to automatically generate descriptive commit messages from code diffs to reduce developers' effort and improve message quality. Although recent advances in LLMs have shown promise in automating CMG, their performance remains limited. This paper aims to enhance CMG performance by retrieving similar diff-message pairs to guide LLMs to generate commit messages that are more precise and informative. We proposed CoRaCMG, a Contextual Retrieval-augmented framework for Commit Message Generation, structured in three phases: (1) Retrieve: retrieving the similar diff-message pairs; (2) Augment: combining them with the query diff into a structured prompt; and (3) Generate: generating commit messages corresponding to the query diff via LLMs. CoRaCMG enables LLMs to learn project-specific terminologies and writing styles from the retrieved diff-message pairs. We evaluated CoRaCMG across multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen) and compared its performance against SOTA baselines. Experimental results show that CoRaCMG significantly boosts LLM performance across four metrics (BLEU, Rouge-L, METEOR, and CIDEr). Specifically, DeepSeek-R1 achieves relative improvements of 76% in BLEU and 71% in CIDEr when augmented with a single retrieved example pair. After incorporating the single example pair, GPT-4o achieves the highest improvement rate, with BLEU increasing by 89%. Moreover, performance gains plateau after more than three examples are used, indicating diminishing returns. Further analysis shows that the improvements are attributed to the model's ability to capture the terminologies and writing styles of human-written commit messages from the retrieved example pairs.</description>

      <title>Developers' Perspectives on Software Licensing: Current Practices, Challenges, and Tools</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most modern software products incorporate open-source components, requiring development teams to maintain compliance with each component's licenses. Noncompliance can have significant financial, legal, and reputational repercussions. Although some organizations may seek advice from legal practitioners to assist with licensing tasks, developers still play a key role in this process. To this end, it is essential to understand how developers approach licensing compliance tasks, the challenges they encounter, and the tools they use. This work studies these aspects of software licensing practices through a study - conducted by a joint team of software engineering and legal researchers - consisting of a survey with 58 software developers and 7 follow-up interviews. The study resulted in 13 key findings regarding the current state of practice. We discuss the implications of our findings and offer directions for future research, as well as actionable recommendations.</description>

      <title>Prompting in Practice: Investigating Software Practitioners' Use of Generative AI Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of generative AI (GenAI) tools has fundamentally transformed software development. Central to this shift is prompt engineering, the practice of crafting textual prompts to guide GenAI tools in generating useful content. Although prompt engineering has emerged as a critical skill, prior research has focused primarily on cataloging of prompting techniques, with limited attention to how software practitioners employ GenAI within real-world development workflows. To address this gap, this study presents a systematic investigation of practitioners' integration of GenAI tools into software development, drawing on a rigorous survey that examines prompting strategies, conversation patterns, and reliability assessments across core software development tasks.
  We surveyed 72 software practitioners who actively use GenAI to characterize AI usage patterns throughout the development process. By combining qualitative and quantitative analyses of the survey responses, we identified 13 key findings that describe how prompting is performed in practice. Our study shows that while code generation is nearly universal, proficiency strongly correlates with the use of GenAI for more nuanced tasks such as debugging and code review. Practitioners also tend to favor iterative multi-turn conversations to single-shot prompting. Documentation tasks are perceived as most reliable, while complex code generation and debugging remain major challenges. Our findings provide an empirical view of practitioner practices, ranging from basic code generation to deeper integration of GenAI into development workflows, enabling us to offer recommendations for improving both GenAI tools and the ways practitioners interact with them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Runtime introspection of dependencies, i.e., the ability to observe which dependencies are currently used during program execution, is fundamental for Software Supply Chain security. Yet, Java has no support for it. We solve this problem with Classport, a blueprint and system that embeds dependency information into Java class files, enabling the retrieval of dependency information at runtime. We evaluate Classport on six real-world projects, demonstrating the feasibility in identifying dependencies at runtime.</description>

      <title>Toward Practical Deductive Verification: Insights from a Qualitative Survey in Industry and Academia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deductive verification is an effective method to ensure that a given system exposes the intended behavior. In spite of its proven usefulness and feasibility in selected projects, deductive verification is still not a mainstream technique. To pave the way to widespread use, we present a study investigating the factors enabling successful applications of deductive verification and the underlying issues preventing broader adoption. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 practitioners of verification from both industry and academia and systematically analyzed the collected data employing a thematic analysis approach. Beside empirically confirming familiar challenges, e.g., the high level of expertise needed for conducting formal proofs, our data reveal several underexplored obstacles, such as proof maintenance, insufficient control over automation, and usability concerns. We further use the results from our data analysis to extract enablers and barriers for deductive verification and formulate concrete recommendations for practitioners, tool builders, and researchers, including principles for usability, automation, and integration with existing workflows.</description>

      <title>Insecure Ingredients? Exploring Dependency Update Patterns of Bundled JavaScript Packages on the Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings. Furthermore, we crawl the Tranco top 100,000 domains to reveal that 5% - 20% of domains update their dependencies within 16 weeks. Surprisingly, from a longitudinal perspective, bundled packages are updated significantly faster than their CDN-included counterparts, with consequently up to 10 times fewer known vulnerable package versions included. Still, we observe indicators that few widespread vendors seem to be a major driving force behind timely updates, implying that quantitative measures are not painting a complete picture.</description>

      <title>The State of Open Science in Software Engineering Research: A Case Study of ICSE Artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Replication packages are crucial for enabling transparency, validation, and reuse in software engineering (SE) research. While artifact sharing is now a standard practice and even expected at premier SE venues such as ICSE, the practical usability of these replication packages remains underexplored. In particular, there is a marked lack of studies that comprehensively examine the executability and reproducibility of replication packages in SE research. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by evaluating 100 replication packages published as part of ICSE proceedings over the past decade (2015--2024). We assess the (1) executability of the replication packages, (2) efforts and modifications required to execute them, (3) challenges that prevent executability, and (4) reproducibility of the original findings. We spent approximately 650 person-hours in total executing the artifacts and reproducing the study findings. Our findings reveal that only 40\% of the 100 evaluated artifacts were executable, of which 32.5\% (13 out of 40) ran without any modification. Regarding effort levels, 17.5\% (7 out of 40) required low effort, while 82.5\% (33 out of 40) required moderate to high effort to execute successfully. We identified five common types of modifications and 13 challenges leading to execution failure, spanning environmental, documentation, and structural issues. Among the executable artifacts, only 35\% (14 out of 40) reproduced the original results. These findings highlight a notable gap between artifact availability, executability, and reproducibility. Our study proposes three actionable guidelines to improve the preparation, documentation, and review of research artifacts, thereby strengthening the rigor and sustainability of open science practices in SE research.</description>

      <title>From LLMs to Agents in Programming: The Impact of Providing an LLM with a Compiler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated a remarkable capability in natural language and program generation and software development. However, the source code generated by the LLMs does not always meet quality requirements and may fail to compile. Therefore, many studies evolve into agents that can reason about the problem before generating the source code for the solution. The goal of this paper is to study the degree to which such agents benefit from access to software development tools, in our case, a gcc compiler. We conduct a computational experiment on the RosettaCode dataset, on 699 programming tasks in C. We evaluate how the integration with a compiler shifts the role of the language model from a passive generator to an active agent capable of iteratively developing runnable programs based on feedback from the compiler. We evaluated 16 language models with sizes ranging from small (135 million) to medium (3 billion) and large (70 billion). Our results show that access to a compiler improved the compilation success by 5.3 to 79.4 percentage units in compilation without affecting the semantics of the generated program. Syntax errors dropped by 75%, and errors related to undefined references dropped by 87% for the tasks where the agents outperformed the baselines. We also observed that in some cases, smaller models with a compiler outperform larger models with a compiler. We conclude that it is essential for LLMs to have access to software engineering tools to enhance their performance and reduce the need for large models in software engineering, such as reducing our energy footprint.</description>

      <title>Assessing Vulnerability in Smart Contracts: The Role of Code Complexity Metrics in Security Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17343v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software built on poor structural patterns often shows higher exposure to security defects. When code differs from established best practices, verification and maintenance become increasingly difficult, thereby raising the risk of unintentional vulnerabilities. In the context of blockchain technology, where immutable smart contracts handle high-value transactions, the need for strict security assurance is important. This research analyzes the utility of software complexity metrics as diagnostic tools for identifying vulnerable Solidity smart contracts. We evaluate the hypothesis that complexity measures serve as vital, complementary signals for security assessment. Through an empirical examination of 21 distinct metrics, we analyzed their inter-dependencies, statistical association with vulnerabilities, and discriminative capabilities. Our findings indicate a significant degree of redundancy among certain metrics and a relatively low correlation between any single metric and the presence of vulnerabilities. However, the data demonstrates that these metrics possess strong power to distinguish between secure and vulnerable code when analyzed collectively. Notably, with only three exceptions, vulnerable contracts consistently exhibited higher mean complexity scores than their neutral counterparts. While our results show a statistical association, we emphasize that complexity is an indicator rather than a direct cause of vulnerability.</description>

      <title>Scalable Back-End for an AI-Based Diabetes Prediction Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rising global prevalence of diabetes necessitates early detection to prevent severe complications. While AI-powered prediction applications offer a promising solution, they require a responsive and scalable back-end architecture to serve a large user base effectively. This paper details the development and evaluation of a scalable back-end system designed for a mobile diabetes prediction application. The primary objective was to maintain a failure rate below 5% and an average latency of under 1000 ms. The architecture leverages horizontal scaling, database sharding, and asynchronous communication via a message queue. Performance evaluation showed that 83% of the system's features (20 out of 24) met the specified performance targets. Key functionalities such as user profile management, activity tracking, and read-intensive prediction operations successfully achieved the desired performance. The system demonstrated the ability to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without issues, validating its scalability. The implementation of asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ proved crucial in minimizing the error rate for computationally intensive prediction requests, ensuring system reliability by queuing requests and preventing data loss under heavy load.</description>

      <title>Optimising for Energy Efficiency and Performance in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ubiquity of machine learning (ML) and the demand for ever-larger models bring an increase in energy consumption and environmental impact. However, little is known about the energy scaling laws in ML, and existing research focuses on training cost -- ignoring the larger cost of inference. Furthermore, tools for measuring the energy consumption of ML do not provide actionable feedback.
  To address these gaps, we developed Energy Consumption Optimiser (ECOpt): a hyperparameter tuner that optimises for energy efficiency and model performance. ECOpt quantifies the trade-off between these metrics as an interpretable Pareto frontier. This enables ML practitioners to make informed decisions about energy cost and environmental impact, while maximising the benefit of their models and complying with new regulations.
  Using ECOpt, we show that parameter and floating-point operation counts can be unreliable proxies for energy consumption, and observe that the energy efficiency of Transformer models for text generation is relatively consistent across hardware. These findings motivate measuring and publishing the energy metrics of ML models. We further show that ECOpt can have a net positive environmental impact and use it to uncover seven models for CIFAR-10 that improve upon the state of the art, when considering accuracy and energy efficiency together.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Context-Aware Server Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) (MCP Community, 2025) has emerged as a widely used framework for enabling LLM-based agents to communicate with external tools and services. The original MCP implementation (Anthropic, 2024) relies on a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose tasks and issue instructions to servers. In particular, the agents, models, and servers are stateless and do not have access to a global context. However, in tasks involving LLM-driven coordination, it is natural that a Shared Context Store (SCS) could improve the efficiency and coherence of multi-agent workflows by reducing redundancy and enabling knowledge transfer between servers. Thus, in this work, we design and assess the performance of a Context-Aware MCP (CA-MCP) that offloads execution logic to specialized MCP servers that read from and write to a shared context memory, allowing them to coordinate more autonomously in real time. In this design, context management serves as the central mechanism that maintains continuity across task executions by tracking intermediate states and shared variables, thereby enabling persistent collaboration among agents without repeated prompting. We present experiments showing that the CA-MCP can outperform the traditional MCP by reducing the number of LLM calls required for complex tasks and decreasing the frequency of response failures when task conditions are not satisfied. In particular, we conducted experiments on the TravelPlanner (Yang et al., 2024) and REALM-Bench (Geng &amp; Chang, 2025) benchmark datasets and observed statistically significant results indicating the potential advantages of incorporating a shared context store via CA-MCP in LLM-driven multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Text-to-Python against Text-to-SQL: The Impact of Explicit Logic and Ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Text-to-SQL remains the dominant approach for database interaction, real-world analytics increasingly require the flexibility of general-purpose programming languages such as Python or Pandas to manage file-based data and complex analytical workflows. Despite this growing need, the reliability of Text-to-Python in core data retrieval remains underexplored relative to the mature SQL ecosystem. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL. These findings establish Python as a viable foundation for analytical agents-provided that systems effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.
