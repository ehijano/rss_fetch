      <title>Sub-wavelength optical lattice in 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, light-matter interaction has been vastly expanded as a control tool for inducing and enhancing many emergent non-equilibrium phenomena. However, conventional schemes for exploring such light-induced phenomena rely on uniform and diffraction-limited free-space optics, which limits the spatial resolution and the efficiency of light-matter interaction. Here, we overcome these challenges using metasurface plasmon polaritons (MPPs) to form a sub-wavelength optical lattice. Specifically, we report a ``nonlocal" pump-probe scheme where MPPs are excited to induce a spatially modulated AC Stark shift for excitons in a monolayer of MoSe$_2$, several microns away from the illumination spot. Remarkably, we identify nearly two orders of magnitude reduction for the required modulation power compared to the free-space optical illumination counterpart. Moreover, we demonstrate a broadening of the excitons' linewidth as a robust signature of MPP-induced periodic sub-diffraction modulation. Our results open new avenues for exploring power-efficient light-induced lattice phenomena below the diffraction limit in active chip-compatible MPP architectures.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field Control of Magnetic Skyrmion Chirality in a Centrosymmetric 2D van der Waals Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals magnets hosting topological magnetic textures, such as skyrmions, show promise for applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Electrical control of these topological spin textures would enable novel devices with enhanced performance and functionality. Here, using electron microscopy combined with in situ electric and magnetic biasing, we show that the skyrmion chirality, whether left-handed or right-handed, in insulating Cr2Ge2Te6, is controlled by external electric field direction applied during magnetic field cooling process. The electric-field-tuned chirality remains stable, even amid variations in magnetic and electric fields. Our theoretical investigation reveals that nonzero Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between the nearest neighbors, induced by the external electric field, change their sign upon reversing the electric field direction, thereby facilitating chirality selection. The electrical control of magnetic chirality demonstrated in this study can be extended to other non-metallic centrosymmetric skyrmion-hosting magnets, opening avenues for future device designs in topological spintronics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Melting and Freezing of a Skyrmion Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report comprehensive Monte-Carlo studies of the melting of skyrmion lattices in systems of small, medium, and large sizes with the number of skyrmions ranging from $10^{3}$ to over $10^{5}$. Large systems exhibit hysteresis similar to that observed in real experiments on the melting of skyrmion lattices. For sufficiently small systems which achieve thermal equilibrium, a fully reversible sharp solid-liquid transition on temperature with no intermediate hexatic phase is observed. A similar behavior is found on changing the magnetic field that provides the control of pressure in the skyrmion lattice. We find that on heating the melting transition occurs via a formation of grains with different orientations of hexagonal axes. On cooling, the fluctuating grains coalesce into larger clusters until a uniform orientation of hexagonal axes is slowly established. The observed scenario is caused by collective effects involving defects and is more complex than a simple picture of a transition driven by the unbinding and annihilation of dislocation and disclination pairs.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix Approach for Topological Edge States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest and develop a novel approach for describing topological properties of a periodic system purely from the transfer matrix associated to a unit cell. This approach is employed to obtain a simple pictorial proof of the Zak phase bulk-edge correspondence for any one dimensional system. We apply the transfer matrix method to study some generalisations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, such as the tetramer SSH4 model and a dimerised one-dimensional photonic crystal.</description>

      <title>Engineering second-order topological insulators via coupling two first-order topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the engineering of two-dimensional second-order topological insulators with corner states by coupling two first-order topological insulators. We find that the interlayer coupling between two topological insulators with opposite topological invariants results in the formation of edge-state gaps, which are essential for the emergence of the corner states. Using the effective Hamiltonian framework, We elucidate that the formation of topological corner states requires either the preservation of symmetry in the crystal system or effective mass countersigns for neighboring edge states. Our proposed strategy for inducing corner state through interlayer coupling is versatile and applicable to both $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators and quantum anomalous Hall effects. We demonstrate this approach using several representative models including the seminal Kane-Mele model, the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model, and the Rashba graphene model to explicitly exhibit the formation of corner states via interlater coupling. Moreover, we also observe that the stacking of the coupled $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulating systems results in the formation of the time-reversal invariant three-dimensional second-order nodal ring semimetals. Remarkably, the three-dimensional system from the stacking of the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model can be transformed into second-order Dirac semimetals, characterized by one-dimensional hinge Fermi arcs. Our strategy of engineering second-order topological phases via simple interlayer coupling promises to advance the exploration of higher-order topological insulators in two-dimensional spinful systems.</description>

      <title>Sub-symmetry Protected Topology in Topological Insulators and Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploration of topology protected by a certain symmetry is central in condensed matter physics. A recent idea of sub-symmetry-protected (SSP) topology--remains of a broken symmetry can still protect specific topological boundary states--has been developed and demonstrated in an optical system [Nat. Phys. 19, 992-998 (2023)]. Here, we extend this idea further by applying sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation (SSPP) to one-dimensional topological insulating and superconducting systems using the Su-Schrieffer-Hegger (SSH) and Kitaev models. Using the tight-binding and low-energy effective theory, we show that the SSP boundary states retain topological properties while the SSPP results in the asymmetry of boundary states. For the SSH model, an SSP zero-energy edge state localized on one edge possesses quantized polarization. In contrast, the other edge state is perturbed to have non-zero energy, and its polarization is not quantized. For topological superconductors, zero-energy SSP Majorana boundary states for spinful Kitaev models emerge on only one edge, contrary to the conventional belief that Majorana fermions emerge at opposite edges. Our findings can be used as a platform to expand our understanding of topological materials as they broaden our understanding of the symmetry in a topological system and a method to engineer Majorana fermions.</description>

      <title>Optical heterodyne microscopy of operating spin Hall nano-oscillator arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical heterodyne detection is a powerful technique for characterizing a wide range of physical excitations. Here, we use two types of optical heterodyne detection techniques (fundamental and parametric pumping) to microscopically characterize the high-frequency auto-oscillations of single and multiple nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs). To validate the technique and demonstrate its robustness, we study SHNOs made from two different material stacks, NiFe/Pt and W/CoFeB/MgO, and investigate the influence of both the RF injection power and the laser power on the measurements, comparing the optical results to conventional electrical measurements. To demonstrate the key features of direct, non-invasive, submicron, spatial, and phase-resolved characterization of the SHNO magnetodynamics, we map out the auto-oscillation magnitude and phase of two phase-binarized SHNOs used in Ising Machines. This proof-of-concept platform establishes a strong foundation for further extensions, contributing to the ongoing development of crucial characterization techniques for emerging computing technologies based on spintronics devices</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Laser-Induced Dynamics of Non-Equilibrium Electron Spill-Out in Nanoplasmonic Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary quantum plasmonics capture subtle corrections to the properties of plasmonic nano-objects in equilibrium. Here, we demonstrate nonequilibrium spill-out redistribution of the electronic density at the ultrafast time scale. As revealed by time-resolved 2D spectroscopy of nanoplasmonic Fe/Au bilayers, an injection of the laser-excited non-thermal electrons induces transient electron spill-out thus changing the plasma frequency. The response of the local electronic density switches the electronic density behavior from spill-in to strong (an order of magnitude larger) spill-out at the femtosecond time scale. The superdiffusive transport of hot electrons and the lack of a direct laser heating indicate significantly non-thermal origin of the underlying physics. Our results demonstrate an ultrafast and non-thermal way to control surface plasmon dispersion through transient variations of the spatial electron distribution at the nanoscale. These findings expand quantum plasmonics into previously unexplored directions by introducing ultrashort time scales in the non-equilibrium electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Electroluminescence rectification and high harmonic generation in molecular junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of molecular electronics has emerged from efforts to understand electron propagation through single molecules and to use them in electronic circuits. Serving as a testbed for advanced theoretical methods, it reveals a significant discrepancy between the operational time scales of experiments (static to GHz frequencies) and theoretical models (femtoseconds). Utilizing a recently developed time-linear nonequilibrium Green's functions formalism, we model molecular junctions on experimentally accessible timescales. Our study focuses on the quantum pump effect in a Benzenedithiol molecule connected to two copper electrodes and coupled with cavity photons. By calculating both electric and photonic current responses to an ac bias voltage, we observe pronounced electroluminescence and high harmonic generation in this setup. The mechanism of the latter effect is more analogous to that from solids than from isolated molecules, with even harmonics being suppressed or enhanced depending on the symmetry of the driving field.</description>

      <title>Utilizing and extending superconducting circuit toolbox to simulate analog quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been considerable effort to simulate quantum gravity features in solid state systems, such as analog black holes or wormholes. However, superconducting circuits have so far received only limited attention in this regard. Moreover, for quantum superpositions of spacetime geometries - a highly contentious notion within the quantum gravity community itself - there currently exist no solid state blueprints. We here show how quantum circuit hardware can implement a variety of classical and quantum spacetime geometries on lattices, by both using established circuit elements and introducing new ones. We demonstrate the possibility of a metric sharply changing within a single lattice point, thus entering a regime where the spacetime curvature itself is trans-Planckian, and the Hawking temperature ill-defined. In fact, our approach suggests that stable, thermal event horizons are incompatible with strictly discrete lattice models. We thus propose to directly probe the evaporation of a wormhole by tracking the accumulation of charge and phase quantum fluctuations over short time scales, which are a robust signature even in the presence of a dissipative environment. Moreover, we present a loop-hole for the typical black/while hole ambiguity in lattice simulations: the existence of exceptional points in the dispersion relation allows for the creation of pure black (or white) hole horizons - at the expense of radically changing the interior wormhole dynamics. Finally, based on multistable Josephson junctions, we introduce the notion of quantum inductors: circuit elements that can be prepared in a superposition of different inductance values. Such inductors realise regions with a quantum superposition of analog spacetime. The entanglement of signals with the quantum spacetime can be probed by a type of delayed-choice experiment.</description>

      <title>Long-range ballistic propagation of 80$\%$-excitonic-fraction polaritons in a perovskite metasurface at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons, hybrid light-matter elementary excitations arising from the strong coupling regime between excitons in semiconductors and photons in photonic nanostructures, offer a fruitful playground to explore the physics of quantum fluids of light as well as to develop all-optical devices. However, achieving room temperature propagation of polaritons with a large excitonic fraction, which would be crucial, e.g., for nonlinear light transport in prospective devices, remains a significant challenge. } Here we report on experimental studies of exciton-polariton propagation at room temperature in resonant metasurfaces made from a sub-wavelength lattice of perovskite pillars. Thanks to the large Rabi splitting, an order of magnitude larger than the optical phonon energy, the lower polariton band is completely decoupled from the phonon bath of perovskite crystals. The long lifetime of these cooled polaritons, in combination with the high group velocity achieved through the metasurface design, enables long-range propagation regardless of the polariton excitonic fraction. Remarkably, we observed propagation distances exceeding hundreds of micrometers at room temperature, even when the polaritons possess a very high excitonic component, approximately {80}$\%$. Furthermore, the design of the metasurface introduces an original mechanism for directing uni-directional propagation through polarization control. This discovery of a ballistic propagation mode, leveraging high-speed cooled polaritons, heralds a promising avenue for the development of advanced polaritonic devices.</description>

      <title>Locally Phase-Engineered MoTe$_2$ for Near-Infrared Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are ideal systems for two-dimensional (2D) optoelectronic applications, owing to their strong light-matter interaction and various band gap energies. New techniques to modify the crystallographic phase of TMDs have recently been discovered, allowing the creation of lateral heterostructures and the design of all-2D circuitry. Thus far, the potential benefits of phase-engineered TMD devices for optoelectronic applications are still largely unexplored. The dominant mechanisms involved in the photocurrent generation in these systems remain unclear, hindering further development of new all-2D optoelectronic devices. Here, we fabricate locally phase-engineered MoTe$_{2}$ optoelectronic devices, creating a metal (1T') semiconductor (2H) lateral junction and unveil the main mechanisms at play for photocurrent generation. We find that the photocurrent originates from the 1T'-2H junction, with a maximum at the 2H MoTe$_{2}$ side of the junction. This observation, together with the non-linear IV-curve, indicates that the photovoltaic effect plays a major role on the photon-to-charge current conversion in these systems. Additionally, the 1T'-2H MoTe$_{2}$ heterojunction device exhibits a fast optoelectronic response over a wavelength range of 700 nm to 1100 nm, with a rise and fall times of 113 $\mu$s and 110 $\mu$s, two orders of magnitude faster when compared to a directly contacted 2H MoTe$_{2}$ device. These results show the potential of local phase-engineering for all-2D optoelectronic circuitry.</description>

      <title>Decoherence in electron transport: back-scattering, effect on interference and rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoherence is an undesirable, but ubiquitous phenomenon in quantum systems. Here, we study the effect of partial decoherence, induced via a B\"uttiker probe, on two-terminal electronic transport across one-dimensional quantum wires and rings, in both the linear and non-linear regimes. We find that dephasing causes backscattering when introduced locally in a ballistic channel. Further, we find that decoherence results in rectification when inversion is broken in the two-terminal transport set-up by a combination of a local dephasing centre and a static impurity. Interestingly, the rectification strength and even its direction varies strongly with the relative distance between the probe and the scatterer. We further analyze how decoherence affects characteristic quantum effects in electronic transport, such as, Fabry-P\'erot oscillations in double-barrier setups, and Aharonov-Bohm interference in one-dimensional rings, and find that the amplitude of oscillations in conductance is reduced by decoherence.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum metric due to vacancies in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random vacancies in a graphene monolayer induce defect states that are known to form a narrow impurity band centered around zero energy at half-filling. We use a space-resolved formulation of the quantum metric and establish a strong enhancement of the electronic correlations in this impurity band. The enhancement is primarily due to strong correlations between pairs of vacancies situated on different sublattices at anomalously large spatial distances. We trace the strong enhancement to both the multifractal vacancy wave functions, which ties the system exactly at the Anderson insulator transition for all defect concentrations, and preserving the chiral symmetry.</description>

      <title>Zero Energy Bound States on Nano Atomic Line Defect in Iron-based High Temperature Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on Fe atomic line defect in iron-based high temperature superconductors, we explore the origin of the zero energy bound states near the endpoints of the line defect by employing the two-orbit four-band tight binding model. With increasing the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling along the line defect, the zero energy resonance peaks move simultaneously forward to negative energy for $s_{+-}$ pairing symmetry, but split for $s_{++}$ pairing symmetry. The superconducting order parameter correction due to As(Te, Se) atoms missing does not shift the zero energy resonance peaks.

      <title>Holographic description of an anisotropic Dirac semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic quantum matter exploits the AdS/CFT correspondence to study systems in condensed matter physics. An example of these systems are strongly correlated semimetals, which feature a rich phase diagram structure. In this work, we present a holographic model for a Dirac semimetal in $2+1$ dimensions that features a topological phase transition. Our construction relies on deforming a relativistic UV fixed point with some relevant operators that explicitly break rotations and some internal symmetries. The phase diagram for different values of the relevant coupling constants is obtained. The different phases are characterized by distinct dispersion relations for probe fermionic modes in the AdS geometry. We find semi-metallic phases characterized by the presence of Dirac cones and an insulating phase featuring a mass gap with a mild anisotropy. Remarkably, we find as well an anisotropic semi-Dirac phase characterized by a massless a fermionic excitation dispersing linearly in one direction while quadratically in the other.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Model of Magnetic Domain Wall Motion for Fast, High-Accuracy Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain wall (DW) devices have garnered recent interest for diverse applications including memory, logic, and neuromorphic primitives; fast, accurate device models are therefore imperative for large-scale system design and verification. Extant DW motion models are sub-optimal for large-scale system design either over-consuming compute resources with physics-heavy equations or oversimplifying the physics, drastically reducing model accuracy. We propose a DW model inspired by the phenomenological similarities between motions of a DW and a classical object being acted on by forces like air resistance or static friction. Our proposed phenomenological model predicts DW motion within 1.2% on average compared with micromagnetic simulations that are 400 times slower. Additionally our model is seven times faster than extant collective coordinate models and 14 times more accurate than extant hyper-reduced models making it an essential tool for large-scale DW circuit design and simulation. The model is publicly posted along with scripts that automatically extract model parameters from user-provided simulation or experimental data to extend the model to alternative micromagnetic parameters.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transport in long-ranged open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional fermionic lattice system with long-ranged power-law decaying hopping with exponent $\alpha$. The system is further subjected to dephasing noise in the bulk. We investigate two variants of the problem: (i) an open quantum system where the setup is further subjected to boundary reservoirs enabling the scenario of a non-equilibrium steady state charge transport, and (ii) time dynamics of an initially localized single particle excitation in the absence of boundary reservoirs. In both variants, anomalous super-diffusive behavior is observed for $1&lt; \alpha&lt; 1.5$, and for $\alpha&gt; 1.5$ the setup is effectively short-ranged and exhibits conventional diffusive transport. Our findings are supported by analytical calculations based on the multiple-scale analysis technique that leads to the emergence of a fractional diffusion equation for the density profile. Our study unravels an interesting interplay between long-range interaction and dephasing mechanism that could result in the emergence of unconventional behaviour in open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important route of engineering topological states and excitations is to combine superconductors (SC) with the quantum Hall (QH) effect, and over the past decade, significant progress has been made in this direction. While typical measurements of these states focus on electronic properties, little attention has been paid to the accompanying thermal responses. Here, we examine the thermal properties of the interface between a type-II superconducting electrodes and graphene in the QH regime. We use the thermal noise measurement to probe the local electron temperature of the biased interface. Surprisingly, the measured temperature raise indicates that the superconductor provides a significant thermal conductivity, which is linear in temperature. This suggests electronic heat transport and may be unexpected, because the number of the quasiparticles in the superconductor should be exponentially suppressed. Instead, we attribute the measured electronic heat conductivity to the overlap of the normal states in the vortex cores.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elucidating long-range interaction guided organization of matter is a fundamental question in physical systems covering multiple length scales. Here, based on the hexagonal disk model, we analyze the characteristic inhomogeneity created by long-range repulsions, and reveal the intrinsic conformal order in particle packings in mechanical equilibrium. Specifically, we highlight the delicate angle-preserved bending of the lattice to match the inhomogeneity condition. The revealed conformal order is found to be protected by the surrounding topological defects. These results advance our understanding on long-range interacting systems, and open the promising possibilities of using long-range forces to create particle packings not accessible by short-range forces, which may have practical consequences.</description>

Real density matrix approach is employed to obtain analytical and semi-analytical relations for the absorption coefficient, the exciton resonance energy and binding energy of nanoplatelets and nanodisks. The impact of plate geometry (thickness, area) on the spectrum is discussed and the results are compared with the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Driving a Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier into chaos: effects of a non-sinusoidal current-phase relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a comprehensive numerical analysis of the dynamic response of a Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier (JTWPA) by varying the driving parameters, with a focus on the pathways leading to chaotic behavior. By tuning the working conditions, we capture the broad spectrum of dynamical regimes accessible to JTWPAs, delineating the settings under which transition to chaos occurs. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to device formed by junctions characterized by a non--sinusoidal current phase relation (CPR) and exploring the impact of its shape on the amplifier's performance. Through the study of gain characteristics, Poincar\'e sections, and Fourier spectra, we provide an in-depth understanding of how non-linearity and CPR nonsinusoidality influence the JTWPAs' operational effectiveness and stability. This investigation offers insights into optimizing the device designs for enhanced performance and robustness against chaotic disruptions, in order to establish a framework for predicting and controlling JTWPA behavior in practical applications. This effort will pave the way for the development of devices with tailored dynamic responses and for advancements in quantum computing and precision measurement technologies, where stability and high fidelity are of paramount importance.</description>

      <title>Voltage-driven dynamics of $\varphi_0$-S/F/S Josephson junctions chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions with anomalous phase shift $\varphi_0$ ($\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs) realize a coupling between the superconducting phase and the spin degrees of freedom. Consequently, the anomalous phase shift is a hallmark effect of superconducting spintronics and opens great perspectives for applications of such structures for controlling magnetization. Besides controlling the magnetization of a single ferromagnet, the direct coupling between the phase and the magnetization provides a possibility to establish and control a collective behavior of magnetic moments of different weak links in coupled chains of $\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs. Here we investigate voltage-driven dynamics of such chains and predict that the spin-phase coupling makes the conventional voltage-driven regime unstable. As a result the system undergoes a transition to other dynamical regimes, where clear signatures of the spin-phase coupling and the collective behavior are observed.</description>

      <title>Quantum machines based on $\mathrm{Cu}_{3}$-like compounds using the Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model in a triangular ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a theoretical investigation into an antiferromagnetically coupled spin system, specifically $\text{Cu}_{3}-\text{X}(\text{X=As, Sb})$, which exhibits a configuration of a slightly distorted equilateral triangle, as identified in previous literature. This system is modeled using the Heisenberg model within a triangular structure, incorporating exchange interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, g-factors, and an external magnetic field. We explore three quantum machines based on the $\text{Cu}_{3}$-like antiferromagnetically coupled spin system. The magnetocaloric effect (MCE), which is notably more significant at low temperatures, around $T\sim1$K, for a perpendicular magnetic field at approximately $\sim5$T, has been analyzed. We examine the Carnot machine, observing the influence of the external magnetic field on its operation as both a heat engine and refrigerator, and discuss the thermal efficiencies under these conditions. Our findings suggest that enhanced MCE allows for broader operation regions as a heat engine. Additionally, we explore the quantum Otto machine, showing its versatility in functioning as a heat engine, refrigerator, heater, and thermal accelerator. However, it mainly operates as a refrigerator and accelerator. We also explore their corresponding thermal efficiencies. Similarly, we have analyzed the quantum Stirling machine, which is capable of functioning as a heat engine, refrigerator, heater, and thermal accelerator, but it mainly operates as a refrigerator and thermal accelerator. We also examined the corresponding thermal efficiencies. It is worth mentioning that the Otto machine performance as a heat engine is notably influenced by the MCE, while the operational mode of the Stirling machine switches between a heat engine and accelerator around MCE is more prominent.</description>

Abstract: In this theoretical study, we explore F\"orster resonant energy transfer of a single exciton within a two-dimensional array of self-assembled quantum dots arranged randomly on a circular mesa. Employing the stochastic simulation method, we solve the equation of motion for the density matrix, considering a specified decay rate. Our analysis quantifies diffusion through the mean-square displacement from the initially excited quantum dot, revealing distinct temporal stages: ballistic, normal diffusion, and saturation. Furthermore, we observe power-law localization of the exciton. Complementing our numerical investigations, we develop approximate analytical expressions that closely align with the numerical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge states in topological systems have attracted great interest due to their robustness and linear dispersions. Here a superconducting-proximitized edge interferometer is engineered on a topological insulator Ta2Pd3Te5 with asymmetric edges to realize the interfering Josephson diode effect (JDE), which hosts many advantages, such as the high efficiency as much as 73% at tiny applied magnetic fields with an ultra-low switching power around picowatt, and a giant interfering magnetochiral anisotropy with a maximal coefficient gamma = 1.2 x 10^{9} T^{-1}A^{-1}. As an important element to induce such JDE, the second-order harmonic in the current-phase relation is also experimentally confirmed by half-integer Shapiro steps. This edge interferometer offers a novel and effective method to enhance the overall performance of JDE and magnetochiral anisotropy, and boosts great potential applications for future superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetric Planar Hall Effect in Rutile Oxide Films Induced by the Lorentz Force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional Hall effect is linearly proportional to the field component or magnetization component perpendicular to a film. Despite the increasing theoretical proposals on the Hall effect to the in-plane field or magnetization in various special systems induced by the Berry curvature, such an unconventional Hall effect has only been experimentally reported in Weyl semimetals and in a heterodimensional superlattice. Here, we report an unambiguous experimental observation of the antisymmetric planar Hall effect (APHE) with respect to the in-plane magnetic field in centrosymmetric rutile RuO2 and IrO2 single-crystal films. The measured Hall resistivity is found to be linearly proportional to the component of the applied in-plane magnetic field along a particular crystal axis and to be independent of the current direction or temperature. Both the experimental observations and theoretical calculations confirm that the APHE in rutile oxide films is induced by the Lorentz force. Our findings can be generalized to ferromagnetic materials for the discovery of anomalous Hall effects and quantum anomalous Hall effects induced by in-plane magnetization. In addition to significantly expanding knowledge of the Hall effect, this work opens the door to explore new members in the Hall effect family.</description>

Abstract: The quest to identify and observe Majorana fermions in physics and condensed-matter systems remains an important challenge. Here, we introduce a qubit (spin-$1/2$) from the occurrence of two delocalized zero-energy Majorana fermions in a model of two spins-$1/2$ on the Bloch sphere within the fractional one-half topological state. We address specific protocols in time with circularly polarized light and the protection of this delocalized spin-$1/2$ state related to quantum information protocols. We also show how disorder can play a positive and important role allowing singlet-triplet transitions and resulting in an additional elongated region for the fractional phase, demonstrating the potential of this platform related to applications in topologically protected quantum information. We generalize our approach with an array and Majorana fermions at the edges in a ring geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We comment on the recent paper ``Floquet non-Abelian topological insulator and multifold bulk-edge correspondence" by Tianyu Li and Haiping Hu, Nat. Comm. {\bf 14}, 6418 (2023). Apart from the fact that the authors unjustly imply to study multi-gap topology in Floquet systems for the first time, only known homotopic relations are presented. While such insights are used to present interesting Floquet phenomena and phases, which is an attractive result in itself, they cannot be used to deduce the total bulk characterization in the dynamical context without further proof. In fact, the authors essentially rephrase a Zak phase description. These results should in particular be contrasted to earlier results, arXiv:2208.12824, in which static-compatible Zak phases {\it and} dynamical Dirac strings were shown to be able to {\it distinguish} rather similar non-Abelian Floquet phases in $2+1$ dimensional systems. As a result, the claim of a sharp multifold bulk-edge correspondence cannot be concluded from the given arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear transport phenomena offer an exciting probe into the band geometry and symmetry properties of a system. While most studies on nonlinear transport have looked at second-order nonreciprocal responses in noncentrosymmetric systems, the reciprocal third-order effects dominant in centrosymmetric systems remain largely uncharted. Here, we uncover two significant contributions to third-order charge conductivity: one affecting longitudinal resistance and another impacting the Hall effect. We demonstrate that these previously unexplored contributions arise in time-reversal symmetry-broken systems from band geometric quantities such as the Berry curvature and the symplectic connection. We prescribe a detailed symmetry dictionary to facilitate the discovery of these fundamental transport coefficients. Additionally, we unify our quantum kinetic results with the semiclassical wave-packet formalism to unveil all contributions to third-order charge transport. We illustrate our results in antiferromagnetic monolayer SrMnBi$_2$. Our comprehensive study significantly advances the fundamental understanding of reciprocal nonlinear responses.</description>

      <title>Universal hard-edge statistics of non-Hermitian random matrices</title>

Abstract: Random matrix theory is a powerful tool for understanding spectral correlations inherent in quantum chaotic systems. Despite diverse applications of non-Hermitian random matrix theory, the role of symmetry remains to be fully established. Here, we comprehensively investigate the impact of symmetry on the level statistics around the spectral origin -- hard-edge statistics -- and expand the classification of spectral statistics to encompass all the 38 symmetry classes of non-Hermitian random matrices. Within this classification, we discern 28 symmetry classes characterized by distinct hard-edge statistics from the level statistics in the bulk of spectra, which are further categorized into two groups, namely the Altland-Zirnbauer$_0$ classification and beyond. We introduce and elucidate quantitative measures capturing the universal hard-edge statistics for all the symmetry classes. Furthermore, through extensive numerical calculations, we study various open quantum systems in different symmetry classes, including quadratic and many-body Lindbladians, as well as non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We show that these systems manifest the same hard-edge statistics as random matrices and that their ensemble-average spectral distributions around the origin exhibit emergent symmetry conforming to the random-matrix behavior. Our results establish a comprehensive understanding of non-Hermitian random matrix theory and are useful in detecting quantum chaos or its absence in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Induced Delocalization in Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat bands in moir\'e systems are exciting new playgrounds for the generation and study of exotic many-body physics phenomena in low-dimensional materials. Such physics is attributed to the vanishing kinetic energy and strong spatial localization of the flat-band states. Here we use numerical simulations to examine the electronic transport properties of such flat bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene in the presence of disorder. We find that while a conventional downscaling of the mean free path with increasing disorder strength occurs at higher energies, in the flat bands the mean free path can actually increase with increasing disorder strength.This phenomenon is also captured by the disorder-dependent quantum metric, which is directly linked to the ground state localization.This disorder-induced delocalization suggests that weak disorder may have a strong impact on the exotic physics of magic-angle bilayer graphene and other related moir\'e systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subjecting a massive two-dimensional Dirac material to a vortex light beam provides a mechanism for the photo-induction of multiply quantized vortices. Using Floquet theory, we show that electronic vortices, characterized by their total angular momentum, are exclusive to circularly polarized vortex beams. The equations for the driven system at the one photon-resonance are mapped to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations of $s$-wave superconductors with multiply quantized vortices. This mapping provides valuable analytical tools for the analysis of the system's spectral properties.</description>

      <title>Planar Hall Effect in Quasi-Two-Dimensional Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The planar Hall effect in 3D systems is an effective probe for their Berry curvature, topology, and electronic properties. However, the Berry curvature-induced conventional planar Hall effect is forbidden in 2D systems as the out-of-plane Berry curvature cannot couple to the band velocity of the electrons moving in the 2D plane. Here, we demonstrate a unique 2D planar Hall effect (2DPHE) originating from the hidden planar components of the Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment in quasi-2D materials. We identify all planar band geometric contributions to 2DPHE and classify their crystalline symmetry restrictions. Using gated bilayer graphene as an example, we show that in addition to capturing the hidden band geometric effects, 2DPHE is also sensitive to the Lifshitz transitions. Our work motivates further exploration of hidden planar band geometry-induced 2DPHE and related transport phenomena for innovative applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Nuclear Spin Polarization via Ground-State Level Anti-Crossing of Boron Vacancy Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear spin polarization plays a crucial role in quantum information processing and quantum sensing. In this work, we demonstrate a robust and efficient method for nuclear spin polarization with boron vacancy ($\mathrm{V_B^-}$) defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) using ground-state level anti-crossing (GSLAC). We show that GSLAC-assisted nuclear polarization can be achieved with significantly lower laser power than excited-state level anti-crossing, making the process experimentally more viable. Furthermore, we have demonstrated direct optical readout of nuclear spins for $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ in h-BN. Our findings suggest that GSLAC is a promising technique for the precise control and manipulation of nuclear spins in $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ defects in h-BN.</description>

      <title>Microwave-multiplexed qubit controller using adiabatic superconductor logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic qubit controllers (QCs) are the key to build large-scale superconducting quantum processors. However, developing scalable QCs is challenging because the cooling power of a dilution refrigerator is too small (~10 $\mu$W at ~10 mK) to operate conventional logic families, such as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic and superconducting single-flux-quantum logic, near qubits. Here we report on a scalable QC using an ultra-low-power superconductor logic family, namely adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic. The AQFP-based QC, referred to as the AQFP-multiplexed QC (AQFP-mux QC), produces multi-tone microwave signals for qubit control with an extremely small power dissipation of 81.8 pW per qubit. Furthermore, the AQFP-mux QC adopts microwave multiplexing to reduce the number of coaxial cables for operating the entire system. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate an AQFP-mux QC chip that produces microwave signals at two output ports through microwave multiplexing and demultiplexing. Experimental results show an output power of approximately $-$80 dBm and on/off ratio of ~40 dB at each output port. Basic mixing operation is also demonstrated by observing sideband signals.</description>

      <title>Effects of Strong Capacitive Coupling Between Meta-Atoms in rf SQUID Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider, for the first time, the effects of strong capacitive and inductive coupling between radio frequency Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (rf SQUIDs) in an overlapping metamaterial geometry when driven by rf flux at and near their self-resonant frequencies. The equations of motion for the gauge-invariant phases on the Josephson junctions in each SQUID are set up and solved. Our model accounts for the high-frequency displacement currents through capacitive overlap between the wiring of SQUID loops. We begin by modeling two overlapping SQUIDs and studying the response in both the linear and nonlinear high-frequency driving limits. By exploring a sequence of more and more complicated arrays, the formalism is eventually extended to the $N\times N \times 2$ overlapping metamaterial array, where we develop an understanding of the many ($8N^2-8N+3$) resulting resonant modes in terms of three classes of resonances. The capacitive coupling gives rise to qualitatively new self-resonant responses of rf SQUID metamaterials, and is demonstrated through analytical theory, numerical modeling, and experiment in the 10-30 GHz range on capacitively and inductively coupled rf SQUID metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Deep learning methods for Hamiltonian parameter estimation and magnetic domain image generation in twisted van der Waals magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of twist engineering in van der Waals magnets has opened new frontiers in the field of two-dimensional magnetism, yielding distinctive magnetic domain structures. Despite the introduction of numerous theoretical methods, limitations persist in terms of accuracy or efficiency due to the complex nature of the magnetic Hamiltonians pertinent to these systems. In this study, we introduce a deep-learning approach to tackle these challenges. Utilizing customized, fully connected networks, we develop two deep-neural-network kernels that facilitate efficient and reliable analysis of twisted van der Waals magnets. Our regression model is adept at estimating the magnetic Hamiltonian parameters of twisted bilayer CrI3 from its magnetic domain images generated through atomistic spin simulations. The generative model excels in producing precise magnetic domain images from the provided magnetic parameters. The trained networks for these models undergo thorough validation, including statistical error analysis and assessment of robustness against noisy injections. These advancements not only extend the applicability of deep-learning methods to twisted van der Waals magnets but also streamline future investigations into these captivating yet poorly understood systems.</description>

      <title>Equality of magnetization and edge current for interacting lattice fermions at positive temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the bulk magnetization is equal to the edge current in the thermodynamic limit for a large class of models of lattice fermions with finite-range interactions satisfying local indistinguishability of the Gibbs state, a condition known to hold for sufficiently high temperatures. Our result implies that edge currents in such systems are determined by bulk properties and are therefore stable against large perturbations near the boundaries. Moreover, the equality persists also after taking the derivative with respect to the chemical potential. We show that this form of bulk-edge correspondence is essentially a consequence of homogeneity in the bulk and locality of the Gibbs state. An important intermediate result is a new version of Bloch's theorem for two-dimensional systems, stating that persistent currents vanish in the bulk.</description>

Abstract: We study electron-electron interaction induced states of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ in an out-of-plane magnetic field $B\hat{\bf z}$ near one hole per moir\'e unit cell filling. The 3D phase diagram showing the evolution of competing phases with $B$, interaction strength and an out-of-plane electric field is presented at electron fillings that follow the Diophantine equation along Chern number $-\text{sign}\left(B\right)$ line, that is pointing away from the charge neutral filling, where we find prominent Chern insulators consistent with the experiments. We also explain the experimental absence of prominent Chern insulators along the Chern number $+\text{sign}\left(B\right)$ line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CrI3 is a layered ferromagnetic insulator that has recently attracted enormous interest as it was the first example of a stand-alone monolayer ferromagnet, paving the way towards the study of two-dimensional magnetic materials and their use as building blocks of hybrid van der Waals layered heterostructures. Here we go one step down in the dimensionality ladder and report the synthesis and characterization of a tubular one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure where CrI3 nanotubes are encapsulated within multiwall carbon nanotubes, integrating a magnetic insulator and a conductor. By means of the capillary filling of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), we obtained single-wall CrI3 nanotubes with diameters ranging between 2 nm and 10 nm, with an average of 5.3 nm. Using aberration corrected electron microscopy in combination with spectroscopic techniques we confirm the structure and chemical composition of the nanotubes. SQUID measurements, combined with element-specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) indicate unequivocally that the Cr atoms in encapsulated CrI3 nanotubes are magnetic with a collective state compatible with a radial magnetization state predicted both by first-principles calculations and a model Hamiltonian. Our results represent a step forward in establishing 1D van der Waals heterostructures as a playground for the exploration of non-collinear magnetic states arising from the interplay between magnetic anisotropy and curvature in tubular geometries.</description>

      <title>Cephalo: Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models for Bio-Inspired Materials Analysis and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Cephalo, a series of multimodal vision large language models (V-LLMs) designed for materials science applications, integrating visual and linguistic data for enhanced understanding and interaction within human-AI and multi-agent AI frameworks. A key innovation of Cephalo is its advanced dataset generation method, which employs a sophisticated algorithm to accurately detect and separate images and their corresponding textual descriptions from PDF documents, such as scientific papers. The method includes a careful refinement of image-text pairs through integrated vision and language processing, ensuring high-quality, contextually relevant, and well reasoned training data. Cephalo is trained on integrated image and text data extracted from thousands of scientific papers and science-focused Wikipedia pages demonstrates can interpret complex visual scenes, generate precise language descriptions, and answer queries about images effectively. The combination of a vision encoder with an autoregressive transformer supports complex natural language understanding in an integrated model, which can be coupled with other generative methods to create an image-to-text-to-image or image-to-text-to-3D pipeline. To explore the development of larger models from smaller ones, we report both mixture-of-expert methods and model merging. These hybrid approaches allow us to leverage the domain-specific expertise and general conversational capabilities to harness the strengths of multiple models. We examine the models in diverse use cases that incorporate biological materials, fracture and engineering analysis, protein biophysics, and bio-inspired design based on insect behavior. Generative applications include bio-inspired designs, including pollen-inspired architected materials, as well as the synthesis of bio-inspired material microstructures from a photograph of a solar eclipse.</description>

      <title>Analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomedical applications of plasmonic nanoparticle conjugates need control over their optical properties modulated by surface coating with stabilizing or targeting molecules often attached to or embedded in the secondary functionalization shell, such as silica. Although current numerical techniques can simulate the plasmonic response of such structures, it is desirable in practice to have analytical models based on simple physical ideas that can be implemented without considerable computer resources. Here, we present two efficient analytical methods based on improved electrostatic approximation (IEA) and modal expansion method (MEM) combined with the dipole equivalence method (DEM). The last approach avoids additional electromagnetic simulations and provides a direct bridge between analytical IEA and MEM models for bare particles and those with multilayer shells. As simple as the original IEA and MEM, the developed analytical extensions provide accurate extinction and scattering spectra for coated particles compared to exact calculations by separation of variable method and COMSOL. The possibility and accuracy of analytical models are illustrated by extensive simulations for prolate and oblate gold and silver nanoparticles with a maximal size of up to 200 nm, aspect ratio from 2 to 6, and 3-30 nm dielectric coating.</description>
