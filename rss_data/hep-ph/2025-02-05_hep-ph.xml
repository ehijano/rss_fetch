      <title>Derivation of Meson Masses in SU(3) and SU(4) Extended Linear-Sigma Model at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study focuses on the mesonic potential contributions to the Lagrangian of the extended linear-sigma model (eLSM) for scalar and pseudoscalar meson fields across various quark flavors. The present study focuses on the low-energy phenomenology associated with quantum chromodynamics (QCD), where mesons and their interactions serve as the pertinent degrees of freedom, rather than the fundamental constituents of quarks and gluons. Given that SU(4) configurations are completely based on SU(3) configurations, the possible relationships between meson states in SU(3) and those in SU(4) are explored at finite temperature. Meson states, which are defined by distinct chiral properties, are grouped according to their orbital angular momentum $J$, parity $P$, and charge conjugation $C$. Consequently, this organization yields scalar mesons with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, pseudoscalar mesons with $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$, vector mesons with $J^{PC}=1^{--}$, and axialvector mesons with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$. We accomplished the derivation of analytical expressions for a total of seventeen noncharmed meson states and twenty-nine charmed meson states so that an analytical comparison of the noncharmed and charmed meson states at different temperatures becomes feasible and the contributions SU(3) and SU(4) configurations can be estimated, analytically.</description>

      <title>Light quark contributions to Higgs decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The literature establishes that the light fermions contributions to the decays $H\to Z\gamma$ and $H\to\gamma\gamma$ are negligible since their coupling with the Higgs is proportional to $m_f$. In the present letter, we show that although such a conclusion is true for leptons, the light quark contributions are zero when we consider their non-perturbative effects.</description>

      <title>Summing large Pomeron loops in the saturation region: dipole-nucleus collision beyond nonlinear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we found the dipole-nucleus scattering amplitude at high energies by summing large Pomeron loops. It turns out that the energy dependence of this amplitude is the same as for dipole-dipole scattering. It means that the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation, which has been derived to describe this scattering, can be trusted only in the limited range of considerably low energies: $z \,\leq\, \sqrt{2\,\kappa\,C}A^{1/6} $</description>

      <title>Ponderomotive Effects of Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I exhibit a new class of quadratic effects of ultralight dark matter. Axions, dark photons, and dilatons can exert rapidly oscillating forces, torques, and mass shifts on Standard Model particles. These effects average to zero at first order, but shift particle properties at second order, in analogy to the ponderomotive force in optics. Remarkably, these effects scale with the square of the amplitude of the dark matter field, even when the field's direct physical effects depend only on its derivatives. I calculate the resulting observables in electron $g_e - 2$ experiments using classical mechanics, recovering results previously derived using field theory. When considered properly, these particular experiments do not beat astrophysical bounds, but other precision experiments may have interesting sensitivity.</description>

      <title>ALP Production from Abelian Gauge Bosons: Beyond Hard Thermal Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous computations of feebly interacting particle production have encountered issues with unphysical (negative) interaction rates at soft momenta. We address this problem by studying the production of Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) coupled to $U(1)$-gauge fields, employing the full form of 1PI-resummed gauge boson propagators. This approach avoids the need for matching or subtraction procedures, ensuring physically consistent results. We find that the ALP production rate remains positive across all momentum scales and identify the dominant production mechanisms. At soft ALP momenta ($p \lesssim g^2 T$), interactions involving two spacelike gauge bosons dominate the production rate, surpassing other channels by an order of magnitude. In particular, using the full gauge boson propagator suggests that at even softer momenta ($p \lesssim g^4 T$), production involving two timelike gauge bosons becomes significant, potentially exceeding other contributions by another order of magnitude. Using these insights, we update the thermal ALP abundance and refine the estimate of the average ALP momentum, providing important input for structure formation constraints on ALP dark matter in the keV mass range.</description>

      <title>Dark Photons can Prevent Core-Collapse Supernova Explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the accretion phase of a core-collapse supernova (SN), dark-photon (DP) cooling can be largest in the gain layer below the stalled shock wave. In this way, it could counter-act the usual shock rejuvenation by neutrino energy deposition and thus prevent the explosion. This peculiar energy-loss profile derives from the resonant nature of DP production. The largest cooling and thus strongest constraints obtain for DP masses of 0.1-0.4 MeV, a range corresponding to the photon plasma mass in the gain region. Electron-capture SNe, once observationally unambiguously identified, could provide strong bounds even down to nearly 0.01 MeV. For a coupling strength so small that neutrino-driven explosions are expected to survive, the DP cooling of the core is too small to modify the neutrino signal, i.e., our new argument supersedes the traditional SN1987A cooling bound.</description>

      <title>Direct Dark Matter searches with Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar materials with optical phonons in the meV range are excellent candidates for both dark matter direct detection (via dark photon-mediated scattering) and light dark matter absorption. In this study, we propose, for the first time, the metal halide perovskites MAPbI$_3$, MAPbCl$_3$, and CsPbI$_3$ for these purposes. Our findings reveal that CsPbI$_3$ is the best material, significantly improving exclusion limits compared to other polar materials. For scattering, CsPbI$_3$ can probe dark matter masses down to the keV range. For absorption, it enhances sensitivity to detect dark photon masses below $\sim 10~{\rm meV}$. The only material which has so far been investigated and that could provide competitive bounds is CsI, which, however, is challenging to grow in kilogram-scale sizes due to its considerably lower stability compared to CsPbI$_3$. Moreover, CsI is isotropic while the anisotropic structure of CsPbI$_3$ enables daily modulation analysis, showing that a significant percentage of daily modulation exceeding 1% is achievable for dark matter masses below $40~{\rm keV}$.</description>

      <title>Type-II Seesaw Mechanism for Dirac Neutrinos and its Implications on $N_{\text{eff}}$ and Lepton Flavor Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The type II seesaw is a popular mechanism for generating Majorana neutrino masses at the right scale, with well-known implications for Lepton Flavor Violation. In a non-abelian extension of the Standard Model featuring a Z' field, the type-II seesaw mechanism for Dirac neutrino masses naturally arises by imposing lepton number conservation and adding a soft-term breaking a $Z_2$ symmetry of the model. As expected, there are interesting outcomes for $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$, but we noticed that the number of relativistic neutrinos, $N_{\text{eff}}$, has a greater impact driven by processes involving the $Z'$ boson and right-handed neutrinos. The presence of a gauge symmetry behind the physical processes, allows us to explore an interesting interplay between the type II seesaw, lepton flavor violation and $N_{\text{eff}}$. We find that using the indicated value by Planck $N_{\text{eff}}=2.99^{0.34}_{0.33}$ we impose constraints on the masses of the doubly charged scalar and Z' fields which are complementarity to direct searches at colliders.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Solution to the Eta Problem in Spectator Field Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of spectator field models that addresses the eta problem while providing a natural explanation for the observed slight deviation of the spectrum of curvature perturbations from scale-invariance. In particular, we analyze the effects of quantum corrections on the quadratic potential of the spectator field given by its gravitational coupling to the Ricci scalar and the inflaton energy, so-called the Hubble-induced mass term. These quantum corrections create a minimum around which the potential is flatter and to which the spectator field is attracted. We demonstrate that this attractor dynamics can naturally generate the observed slightly red-tilted spectrum of curvature perturbations. Furthermore, focusing on a curvaton model with a quadratic vacuum potential, we compute the primordial non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ and derive a predictive relationship between $f_{\text{NL}}$ and the running of the scalar spectral index. This relationship serves as a testable signature of the model. Finally, we extend the idea to a broader class of models where the spectator field is an angular component of a complex scalar field.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature QCD crossover at non-zero chemical potential: A Dyson-Schwinger approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study QCD at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potential to derive the critical temperature at the chiral phase transition (crossover). We solve a set of Dyson--Schwinger partial differential equations using the exact solution for the Yang--Mills quantum field theory based on elliptical functions. Assuming a Nambu-Jona--Lasino (NJL) model of the quarks, we obtain a very good agreement with recent lattice computations regarding the dependence of the critical temperature on the strong coupling scale. The solution depends on a single scale parameter, as typical for the theory and already known from studies about asymptotic freedom. The analysis is analytically derived directly from QCD.</description>

      <title>Model Independent Effective Dimension Six Operators And Scattering Unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective field theory containing higher dimensional operators violates the unitarity of the $2 \rightarrow 2$ scattering processes in the Standard Model. This unitarity violation depends on the values of the Wilson coefficients corresponding to a higher dimensional operator. We showed that even a small values of some of the Wilson coefficients lead to the unitarity violation at the LHC centre of mass energies. Considering the final states as the gauge bosons in the longitudinal mode, the scalars, and the $t\overline{t}$, we showed that the unitarity violation in $WW \rightarrow WW$, $WW \rightarrow ZZ$, and $ZZ \rightarrow hh$ scattering amplitudes sets bounds on the Wilson coefficients of the dimension six effective operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the computation of real corrections to the impact factor for forward Higgs boson production, preserving the full dependence on the top-quark mass. The results are shown to align with the BFKL factorization framework, particularly in reproducing the expected rapidity divergence. Additionally, the subtraction of this divergence has been demonstrated using the appropriate counterterm within the BFKL scheme. In the infinite-top-mass limit, our findings reproduce the previously established result.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering observables to Generalized Parton Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DDVCS) is a promising channel for Generalized Parton Distribution (GPD) studies as it is a generalization of the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) and Timelike Compton Scattering (TCS) processes. Contrary to DVCS and TCS, the GPD phase space accessed through DDVCS is not constrained by on-shell conditions on the incoming and outgoing photons thus allowing unrestricted GPD extraction from experimental observables. Considering polarized electron and positron beams directed to a polarized proton target, we study the sensitivity of the DDVCS cross-section asymmetries to the chiral-even proton GPDs from different model predictions. The feasibility of such measurements is further investigated in the context of the CLAS and SoLID spectrometers at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and the future Electron-Ion Collider at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum of Global Axion Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking scenario provides a unique opportunity to pinpoint the QCD axion dark matter mass, which is a crucial input for laboratory experiments that are designed for probing specific mass ranges. Predicting their mass requires a precise knowledge of how axions are produced from the decay of topological defects in the early Universe that are inevitably formed. In this contribution, we present recent results on the analysis of the spectrum of axions radiated from global strings based on large scale numerical simulations of the cosmological evolution of the PQ field on a static lattice. We highlight several systematic effects that have been overlooked in previous works, such as the dependence on the initial conditions, contaminations due to oscillations in the spectrum, and discretisation effects; some of which could explain the discrepancy in the current literature. Taking these uncertainties into account and performing the extrapolation to cosmologically relevant string tensions, we find that the dark matter mass is predicted to be in the range of $95\,\mu\text{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 450 \, \mu\text{eV}$, which will be probed by some of the next generation direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>A short review on the compositeness of the $X(3872)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $X(3872)$ could be a shallow $D\bar D^*$ bound state, a compact four-quark state, or a partially composite particle, i.e. a superposition of the two. We will review how these hypotheses could be tested experimentally, examining especially the cases in which the $X$ is a pure bound state or a pure compact tetraquark. The comparison with data is done by comparing the results on the $X\to D\bar D\pi$ decay with the analysis of its lineshape. Looking at decay, the pure bound state hypothesis corresponds to a well-defined region in parameter space defined by the width of the $D^*$ versus the binding energy of the $X$. As far as the lineshape is concerned, the currently available experimental analysis is limited to showing compatibility with the purely compact hypothesis. We propose how to modify the analysis to test the molecular or the partially composite hypotheses. We also review the analysis on the radiative decays of the $X$, showing that it leaves little room for its purely molecular nature, even if pion corrections are included.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Induced Charged Current Coherent Pion Production for Constraining the Muon Neutrino Flux at DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study neutrino induced charge current coherent pion production ($\nu_\mu\text{CC-Coh}\pi$) as a tool for constraining the neutrino flux at the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The neutrino energy and flavor in the process can be directly reconstructed from the outgoing particles, making it especially useful to specifically constrain the muon neutrino component of the total flux. The cross section of this process can be obtained using the Adler relation with the $\pi$-Ar elastic scattering cross section, taken either from external data or, as we explore, from a simultaneous measurement in the DUNE near detector. We develop a procedure that leverages $\nu_\mu\text{CC-Coh}\pi$ events to fit for the neutrino flux while simultaneously accounting for relevant effects in the cross section. We project that this method has the statistical power to constrain the uncertainty on the normalization of the flux at its peak to a few percent. This study demonstrates the potential utility of a $\nu_\mu\text{CC-Coh}\pi$ flux constraint, though further work will be needed to determine the range of validity and precision of the Adler relation upon which it relies, as well as to measure the $\pi$-Ar elastic scattering cross section to the requisite precision. We discuss the experimental and phenomenological developments necessary to unlock the $\nu_\mu\text{CC-Coh}\pi$ process as a "standard candle'' for neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Scattering Processes with Continuous-Variable Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) using continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC). Focusing on ($1+1$)-dimensional $\varphi^4$ scalar field theory, the approach employs the Hamiltonian formalism to map the theory onto a spatial lattice, with fields represented as quantum harmonic oscillators. Using measurement-based quantum computing, we implement non-Gaussian operations for CQVC platforms. The study introduces methods for preparing initial states with specific momenta and simulating their evolution under the $\varphi^4$ Hamiltonian. Key quantum objects, such as two-point correlation functions, validate the framework against analytical solutions. Scattering simulations further illustrate how mass and coupling strength influence field dynamics and energy redistribution. Thus, we demonstrate CVQC's scalability for larger lattice systems and its potential for simulating more complex field theories.</description>

      <title>Zero Modes on the Light Front</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modes with zero longitudinal light-front momentum (zero modes) do have roles to play in the analysis of light-front field theories. These range from improvements in convergence for numerical calculations to implications for the light-front vacuum and beyond to fundamental issues in the connection with equal-time quantization. In particular, the discrepancy in values of the critical coupling for $\phi^4_{1+1}$ theory, between equal-time and light-front quantizations, would appear to be resolvable with the proper treatment of zero modes and near-zero modes. We provide a survey of these issues and point to open questions.</description>

      <title>Renormalon-like factorial enhancements to power expansion/OPE expansion in super-renormalizable QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the issue regarding the high-power behavior of power-expansion/OPE-expansion in supper-renormalizable theory. Using an $O(N)$-model with $N$-components scalars coupled through quartic interaction at the next-to-leading $\frac{1}{N}$ order in the large-$N$ expansion, we show that the IR subtractions cause addition factorial enhancements for high-power terms in the coefficient functions. Moreover, there are also factorial enhancements for the operator condensates, and the factorial enhancements cancel between coefficient functions and operators only {\it off-diagonally} across different powers. The factorial enhancements can be both alternating and non-alternating. The former are similar to ``UV renormalon'' of coefficient functions and cancel with factorial enhancements of operators at lower powers in diagrams with negative degrees of UV divergences. The later are similar to ``IR renormalon'' and cancel with factorial enhancements of renormalized operators at higher powers in diagrams with positive degrees of UV divergences. The factorial enhancement itself will render the momentum-space power expansion divergent.</description>

      <title>A Fuzzy Axiverse from String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this talk, I showcase models for fuzzy axion dark matter within the framework of type IIB string theory, focusing on axions originating from the Ramond-Ramond four-form in compactifications on Calabi-Yau orientifold hypersurfaces. These models are amenable to cosmological tests if a substantial relic abundance of fuzzy dark matter is produced. I present a topologically exhaustive ensemble of more than 350{,}000 Calabi-Yau compactifications with up to seven axions together with a systematic analysis of the misalignment production of fuzzy dark matter. The resulting dark matter composition is generally a mixture of fuzzy axions and heavier axions, including the QCD axion. Dark photons frequently emerge due to the orientifold projection. I will also comment on applications of optimisation strategies based on automatic differentiation for exploring the string axiverse. This talk is partially based on arXiv:2412.12012.</description>

      <title>Absorption of $\psi(2S)$ mesons in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we explore the inclusive $\psi(2S)$ meson photoproduction from nuclei near the kinematic threshold within the collision model, based on the nuclear spectral function, for incoherent direct photon--nucleon charmonium creation processes. The model takes into account the final $\psi(2S)$ absorption, target nucleon binding and Fermi motion. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for production of $\psi(2S)$ mesons on $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at near-threshold photon beam energies of 8.0--16.4 GeV, the absolute momentum differential cross sections for their production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$--10$^{\circ}$, the momentum dependence of the ratio of these cross sections as well as the A-dependences of the ratios (transparency ratios) of the total cross cross sections for $\psi(2S)$ production at photon energy of 13 GeV within the different scenarios for the $\psi(2S)N$ absorption cross section. We also calculate the A-dependence of the ratio of $\psi(2S)$ and $J/\psi$ photoproduction transparency ratios at photon energies around of 11.5 GeV within the adopted scenarios for this cross section. We demonstrate that both the absolute and relative observables considered reveal a definite sensitivity to these scenarios. Therefore, the measurement of such observables in future experiments at the upgraded up to 22 GeV CEBAF facility in the near-threshold energy region might shed light both on the $\psi(2S)N$ absorption cross section and on its part associated with the nondiagonal process $\psi(2S)+N \to J/\psi+N$ at finite momenta, which are of crucial importance in understanding of charmonium production and suppression in high-energy nucleus--nucleus collisions in a search for the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation via Inverted Bubble Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation through inverted bubble collapse. In this scenario, bubbles nucleate sparsely in an incomplete first-order phase transition, followed by a bulk phase transition in the rest of the universe that inverts these pre-existing bubbles into false vacuum regions. These spherically symmetric false-vacuum bubbles subsequently collapse to form PBHs. Unlike conventional PBH formation mechanisms associated with domain wall collapse or bubble coalescence, our inverted bubble collapse mechanism naturally ensures spherical collapse. We demonstrate that, when applied to the electroweak phase transition, this mechanism can produce highly monochromatic PBHs with masses up to ${\cal O}(10^{-6}\,\text{-}\,10^{-5}) M_\odot$, which potentially explain the microlensing events observed in the OGLE and Subaru HSC data.</description>

      <title>Extended Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy: Ghost Condensate Dark Energy with Sextic Dispersion Relation in de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our studies of the ghost condensate (GC) with sixth-order dispersion relation. Contrary to the GC with quartic dispersion relation, we find that the correction to the Newtonian potential explicitly depends on the space and time dependence of matter density. At late times when the Newtonian potential becomes time-independent, one obtains similar oscillatory behavior at the distance $\frac{M_\textrm{Pl}}{M^2}$, but this time at the time scale $\frac{M^4}{M_\textrm{Pl}^3}$, where $M^2$ is the ghost field velocity. We also show that the speed of gravitational wave is modified in a frequency dependent manner at momenta close to $\frac{M_\textrm{Pl}}{\sqrt{|\sigma_1|}}$, where $\sigma_1$ is the coefficient of $\gamma^{ij} \nabla_i K_{lr} \nabla_j K^{lr}$ operator in the unitary gauge action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1005.3998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study extensions of the Standard Model with general new vector bosons. The full Standard Model gauge symmetry is used to classify the extra vectors and constrain their couplings. We derive the corresponding effective Lagrangian, valid at energies lower than the mass of the extra vectors, and use it to extract limits from electroweak precision observables, including LEP 2 data. We consider both universal and nonuniversal couplings to fermions. We study the interplay of several extra vectors, which can have the effect of opening new regions in parameter space. In particular, it allows to explain the anomaly in the bottom forward-backward asymmetry with perturbative couplings. Finally, we analyze quantitatively the implications for the Higgs mass.</description>

Abstract: We present results from a state-of-the-art fit of electroweak precision observables and Higgs-boson signal-strength measurements performed using 7 and 8 TeV data from the Large Hadron Collider. Based on the HEPfit package, our study updates the traditional fit of electroweak precision observables and extends it to include Higgs-boson measurements. As a result we obtain constraints on new physics corrections to both electroweak observables and Higgs-boson couplings. We present the projected accuracy of the fit taking into account the expected sensitivities at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Study of finite volume number density fluctuations in the SU(3) Polyakov loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model for the search of the QCD Critical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.00034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical endpoint (CEP) is a fundamental feature of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram, marking the boundary between quark-gluon plasma and hadronic matter. Heavy-ion collision experiments, such as the RHIC Beam Energy Scan, aim to probe the QCD phase diagram by varying collision energy. However, the short-lived nature of produced particles makes direct measurements challenging, necessitating theoretical models. This study explores the impact of density fluctuations on the CEP using the Polyakov-loop enhanced Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model, focusing on quark number densities in both finite and infinite volume systems. Quark number densities, derived from thermodynamic susceptibilities, serve as reliable predictors for the CEP's location. We calculate density fluctuations and normalize them by $T^3$ as functions of temperature and $T/\mu_x$ (where x represents light quarks, strange quarks, and baryons), analyzing inflection points and maxima to estimate the critical region. To compare the experimental data, the study has been performed at energies identical to those of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan. The results highlight the influence of finite volume effects on quark density fluctuations, and key indicators of QCD phase transitions, and provide quantitative comparisons with experimental data. This work enhances our understanding of QCD phase structure and supports the ongoing search for the CEP in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, bridging theoretical predictions and experimental observations.</description>

Abstract: We present a detailed study of a scotogenic model accommodating dark matter, neutrino masses and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon while being consistent with the existing constraints on flavour violating decays of the leptons. Moreover, this model offers the possibility to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. We determine the viable regions of the model's parameter space in view of dark matter and flavour constraints using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo setup combined with a particular procedure to accommodate neutrino masses and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon at the same time. We also discuss briefly the resulting collider phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Electromagnetic Properties and the Weak Mixing Angle at the LHC Forward Physics Facility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LHC produces an intense beam of highly energetic neutrinos of all three flavors in the forward direction, and the Forward Physics Facility (FPF) has been proposed to house a suite of experiments taking advantage of this opportunity. In this study, we investigate the FPF's potential to probe the neutrino electromagnetic properties, including neutrino millicharge, magnetic moment, and charge radius. We find that, due to the large flux of tau neutrinos at the LHC, the FPF detectors will be able to provide more sensitive constraints on the tau neutrino magnetic moment and millicharge than previous measurements at DONUT, by searching for excess in low recoil energy electron scattering events. We also find that, by precisely measuring the rate of neutral current deep inelastic scattering events, the FPF detectors have the potential to obtain the strongest experimental bounds on the neutrino charge radius for the electron neutrino, and one of the leading bounds for the muon neutrino flavor. The same signature could also be used to measure the weak mixing angle, and we estimate that $\sin^2 \theta_W$ could be measured to about $3\%$ precision at a scale $Q \sim 10$ GeV, shedding new light on the longstanding NuTeV anomaly.</description>

      <title>A New Determination of the (Z,A) Dependence of Coherent Muon-to-Electron Conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Should muon-to-electron conversion in the field of a nucleus be found in the current generation of experiments, the measurement of the atomic number dependence of the process will become an important experimental goal. We present a new treatment of the (Z,A) dependence of coherent muon-to-electron conversion in 236 isotopes. Our approach differs from previous treatments in several ways. Firstly, we include the effect of permanent quadrupole deformation on the charged lepton flavor violating matrix elements, using the method of Barrett moments. This method also enables the addition of muonic X-ray nuclear size and shape determinations of the charge distribution to the electron scattering results used previously. Secondly, we employ a Hartree-Bogoliubov model to calculate neutron-related matrix elements for even-even nuclei. This takes into account the quadrupole deformation of the neutron distributions and the fact that neutrons are, in general, in different shell model orbits than protons. The calculated conversion rates differ from previous calculations, particularly in the region of large permanent quadrupole deformation. Finally, we propose an alternative normalization of the muon-to-electron conversion rated, which related more closely to what a given experiment acturally measures, and better separate lepton physics from nuclear physics effects.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Standard Model Vacuum with Vector-Like Leptons: A Critical Examination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs vacuum is a long-standing issue in particle physics. The SM Higgs quartic coupling parameter is expected to become negative at high scales, potentially generating an unstable vacuum well before reaching the Planck scale. We investigate whether the introduction of vector-like leptons (VLLs) in six distinct gauge anomaly-independent representations can stabilize the SM vacuum without introducing additional scalar fields. By analyzing the mass spectrum and mixing angles of these VLLs with the SM leptons, we identify conditions under which the Higgs potential remains stable. We demonstrate that there exists a set of allowed but narrowed VLL spectra that can indeed stabilize the SM vacuum. We also study the effect of these VLLs on electroweak precision observables, particularly the oblique parameters S and T to ensure fit within global experimental constraints. Finally, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the parameter space allowed by electroweak precision data and the parameter space required for stability, highlighting cases that accommodate both. This study opens up new avenues for understanding the role of vector-like leptons in extending the validity of the Standard Model up to the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>Binding of the three-hadron $DD^{*}K$ system from the lattice effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT), an efficient tool for nuclear ab initio calculations, to solve the asymmetric multihadron systems. We take the $DD^*K$ three-body system as an illustration to demonstrate the capability of the method. Here the two-body chiral interactions between $D$, $D^*$, and $K$ are regulated with a soft lattice regulator and calibrated with the binding energies of the $T_{cc}^+$, $D^{*}_{s0}(2317)$, and $D_{s1}(2460)$ molecular states. We then calculate the three-body binding energy using the NLEFT and analyze the systematic uncertainties due to the finite volume effects, the sliding cutoff, and the leading-order three-body forces. Even when the three-body interaction is repulsive (even as large as the infinite repulsive interaction), the three-body system has a bound state unambiguously with binding energy no larger than the $D_{s1}(2460)D$ threshold. To check the renormalization group invariance of our framework, we extract the first excited state. We find that when the ground state is fixed, the first excited states with various cutoffs coincide with each other when the cubic size goes larger. In addition, the standard angular momentum and parity projection technique is implemented for the quantum numbers of the ground and excited states. We find that both of them are $S$-wave states with quantum number $J^{P}=1^-$. Because the three-body state contains two charm quarks, it is easier to be detected in the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>Relaxation times for disoriented isospin condensates in high energy heavy ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuations between charged and neutral kaons measured by the ALICE Collaboration in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC exceed conventional explanations. Previously it was shown that if the scalar condensate is accompanied by an electrically neutral isospin--1 field then the combination can produce large equilibrium fluctuations where $\langle \bar{u}u\rangle \ne \langle \bar{d}d\rangle$. Hadronizing strange and anti-strange quarks might then strongly fluctuate between charged ($u\bar{s}$ or $s\bar{u}$) and neutral ($d\bar{s}$ or $s\bar{d}$) kaons. Here we estimate the times for the condensates to achieve their equilibrium probability distributions within causal volumes in high energy heavy ion collisions. This is achieved by modeling the temperature dependence of the condensates, mesonic collective excitations, decay rates of the associated fields, and employing the Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations. Within this model, we find that the equilibration times are short compared with the expansion time, making disoriented isospin condensates a viable explanation for the anomalous fluctuations observed at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Solar Neutrinos and the Strongest Oscillation Constraints on Scalar NSI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar non-standard neutrino interactions (sNSI) is a scenario where neutrinos can develop a medium dependent contribution to their mass due to a new scalar mediator. This scenario differs from the commonly discussed vector mediator case in that the oscillation effect scales with density rather than density and neutrino energy. Thus the strongest oscillation constraint comes from solar neutrinos which experience the largest density in a neutrino oscillation experiment. We derive constraints on all the sNSI parameters as well as the absolute neutrino mass scale by combining solar and reactor data and find solar neutrinos to be $&gt;1$ order of magnitude more sensitive to sNSI than terrestrial probes such as long-baseline experiments.</description>

      <title>The cosmology of ultralight scalar dark matter coupled to right-handed neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider ultralight scalar dark matter that couples to right-handed neutrinos. Due to the high density of neutrinos in the early universe, the background neutrino density dominates the dynamics of the scalar field, and qualitatively alters the field's cosmological evolution. This effect has not been included in previous literature, and changes the interpretation of cosmological data and its interplay with laboratory experiments. To illustrate these points a simplified model of a $1+1$ setup with a single scalar field is analyzed.
  We find that: {\it i}) The scalar field experiences an asymmetric potential and its energy density redshifts differently than ordinary matter. {\it ii}) Neutrino mass measurements at the CMB and oscillation experiments performed today complement one another (i.e., they constrain different regions of parameter space). {\it iii}) There exists potentially interesting cosmologies with either $O(1)$ variations in the dark matter density between the CMB and today, or $O(1)$ oscillations of neutrino mass.</description>

Abstract: Theoretical analysis of the interaction between superfluid dark matter and rotating supermassive black holes offers a promising framework for probing quantum effects in ultralight dark matter and its role in galactic structure. We study how black hole rotation influences the state of ultralight bosonic dark matter, focusing on the stability and dynamics of vortex lines. The gravitational effects of both dark matter and the black hole on the physical properties of these vortex lines, including their precession around the black hole, are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Non-diagonal DVCS and transition GPDs: A unified framework for spinless hadron case $\gamma^* \pi \to \gamma \pi \pi$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hadron-to-two-hadron transition generalized parton distributions (GPDs) extend the concept of hadron-to-resonance transition GPDs and provide a unified description of non-diagonal hard exclusive reactions in the generalized Bjorken limit. We present the formalism for the case of spinless hadrons addressing the non-diagonal deeply virtual Compton scattering $\gamma^*\pi\to\gamma\pi\pi$ in terms of $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs, which generalize GPDs for $\pi \to f_0, \, \rho, \, f_2, \, \cdots$ transitions. We work out the basic properties of $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs and establish the soft pion theorems at the $2\pi$ production threshold. We construct the partial wave expansion of $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs in the two-pion decay angles and employ the dispersive approach to constrain $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs in terms of $\pi\pi$-scattering phases with help of the Omn\`{e}s representation. We estimate the $e^-\pi^+ \to e^- \gamma \pi^+ \pi^0$ cross section in the kinematics of the JLab@12 GeV incorporating the isolated $\rho(770)$ resonance state and work out the angular distributions of the cross section, specifying the observables sensitive to the polarization states of the produced $\rho(770)$ resonance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recoil correction appears at $O(\frac{1}{M})$, which turns out to be very essential for the hadronic molecules with heavy flavor. In the past, we always thought that the recoil corrections were unfavorable to the formation of the molecular states, but our research reveals its importance to form the di-hadron bound states. In some cases, we are unable to find the bound states without considering the recoil corrections. Under SU(2) chiral symmetry, we have studied the $D_1 D_1$, $D_1 \bar D_1$, $B_1 B_1$ and $B_1 \bar B_1$ systems in the framework of the one-boson exchange (OBE) model with the treatments of the $S$\--{}$D$ wave mixing effect and the recoil corrections. Our results indicate that both the $D_1 D_1$ system with $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ and $I(J^P)=1(2^+)$ can form the molecular states whether with the recoil corrections or not, while the $D_1 D_1$ system with $I(J^P)=1(0^+)$ fail to form a hadronic molecule without the recoil corrections but it turns out to be a loosely bound state after the inclusion of the recoil corrections. And we have found the deuteron-like states for the $D_1 \bar D_1$, $B_1 B_1$ and $B_1 \bar B_1$ systems, whether considering the recoil corrections or not.</description>

Abstract: We study the decay processes of $B\rightarrow \rho\eta$, $\rho\eta^{\prime}$ in the perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) approach with a few improvements incorporated in it, where the contributions with large momentum transfer are calculated perturbatively, and the contributions with lower energy scale are treated by introducing soft transition form factors. In addition, color-octet contributions are introduced which are essentially long-distance contributions. With reasonable input parameters selected, we find that the theoretical results of the branching ratios and $CP$ violations are all consistent with experimental data. We also predict some unmeasured quantities, which can be tested by experiment in the future.</description>

Abstract: We propose the $\mu^-\to e^-\gamma$ process in a muonic atom as a novel means to investigate charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV). We demonstrate its sensitivity in probing effective CLFV operators associated with both single and double photon fields. In comparison to $\mu^+\to e^+\gamma$ using free positive muon decays at rest, the emitted electron and photon in $\mu^-\to e^-\gamma$ exhibit non-monochromatic spectra, presenting non-trivial case. We derive the decay rate formula and demonstrate that the potential rate of the process is significant enough to motivate exploration in future muon CLFV experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel ansatz for Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), named GSAMA24. This ansatz aims to provide a more accurate and comprehensive description of the internal structure of hadrons by incorporating advanced parameterizations and fitting techniques. We compare the performance of the GSAMA24 ansatz with three established models: the Extended Regge (ER), Modified Gaussian (MG), and M-HS22 ansatz. The GSAMA24 ansatz is designed to address limitations observed in previous models by offering improved flexibility in the ( $t$ )-dependence and skewness parameter $\xi$. Our analysis involves fitting the GSAMA24 ansatz to experimental form factor data and evaluating its predictive power against the ER, MG, and M-HS22 models. The comparison is based on key metrics such as the accuracy of form factor predictions, the consistency with known GPD properties, and the computational efficiency of the fitting process. Results indicate that the GSAMA24 ansatz provides a superior fit to the experimental data, particularly in the high momentum transfer region, where it outperforms the ER and MG models. Additionally, the GSAMA24 ansatz demonstrates better agreement with the theoretical expectations of GPD behavior compared to the M-HS22 model. These findings suggest that the GSAMA24 ansatz is a promising tool for future studies of hadronic structure and could significantly enhance our understanding of the spatial and momentum distributions of quarks and gluons within hadrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) prediction for the \PZ-boson pole $b$-quark forward-backward (FB) asymmetry is: $(A_{FB}^{0,b})_{th} = 0.1030 \pm 0.0002$. The LEP electron-positron collider measured instead $A_{FB}^{0,b} = 0.0992 \pm 0.0016$, value which presents the largest discrepancy with any of the SM predictions as of today. All the $A_{FB}^b$ measurements performed at LEP suffered however of an important statistical uncertainty and of different sources of systematic uncertainties. This study shows that the proposed high-luminosity electron-positron collider FCC-ee, collecting orders of magnitude more data at the \PZ-pole than LEP, will significantly reduce the statistical uncertainties on the measurement of $A_{FB}^{0,b}$, thus allowing us to shed further light on this tension.</description>

      <title>Non-standard cosmological scenarios, Sommerfeld enhancement and asymmetric dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the relic density of asymmetric dark matter with long-range interactions in non-standard cosmological scenarios where the extra cosmic energy is introduced. The Hubble expansion rate is modified in non-standard cosmological models, which affects the relic density of dark matter. If the mass of the dark exchanged gauge boson is less than the mass of dark matter particles multiplied by the dark fine-structure constant, the wave function of the incoming particles of dark matter annihilation would be distorted away from the free plane-wave approximation, yielding the significant enhancements to annihilation cross sections, known as Sommerfeld enhancement. Sommerfeld enhancement results the asymmetric dark matter relic density under abundant, while the enhanced cosmic expansion rate increases the relic density of asymmetric dark matter by letting the decoupling from the thermal equilibrium occurs earlier. However, the mixed effect of modified cosmic expansion and the Sommerfeld enhancement on asymmetric dark matter density evolution becomes quite complicated. We investigated both effects on asymmetric dark matter freeze-out process and current relic abundance, which is significantly different from the standard situation. Further, we calculate the constraint relations of the asymmetric dark matter pertubative annihilation cross section and dark coupling constant with the mass of asymmetric dark matter, the asymmetry factor with the dark coupling constant, when the relic density of asymmetric dark matter falled in the observed region. The upper bounds on the mass of asymmetric dark matter for s-wave and p-wave annihilations are also derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For neutron stars, there exist universal relations insensitive to the equation of states, the so called I-Love-Q relations, which show the connections among the moment of inertia, tidal Love number and quadrupole moment. In this paper, we show that these relations also apply to dark stars, bosonic or fermionic. The relations can be extended to higher ranges of the variables, clarifying the deviations for dark stars in the literature, as those curves all approximate the ones generated by a polytropic equation of state, when taking the low density (pressure) limit. Besides, we find that for equation of states with scaling symmetries, the I-Love-Q curves do not change when adjusting the scaling parameters.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Correlators at Finite Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study finite-coupling effects of QFT on a rigid de Sitter (dS) background taking the $O(N)$ vector model at large $N$ as a solvable example. Extending standard large $N$ techniques to the dS background, we analyze the phase structure and late-time four-point functions. Explicit computations reveal that the spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries is prohibited due to strong IR effects, akin to flat two-dimensional space. Resumming loop diagrams, we compute the late-time four-point functions of vector fields at large $N$, demonstrating that their spectral density is meromorphic in the spectral plane and positive along the principal series. These results offer highly nontrivial checks of unitarity and analyticity for cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay: long range quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We re-introduce, in light of our modern understanding of neutrinos, the concept of ``macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay" (MDBD) for Majorana neutrinos. In this process an antineutrino produced by a nucleus undergoing beta decay, $X\to Y + e^- + \bar \nu_e$, is absorbed as a neutrino by another identical $X$ nucleus via the inverse beta decay reaction, $\nu_e + X \to e^-+Y$. The distinct signature of MDBD is that the total kinetic energy of the two electrons equals twice the endpoint energy of single beta decay. The amplitude for MDBD, a coherent sum over the contribution of different mass states of the intermediate neutrinos, reflects quantum coherence over macroscopic distances, and is a new macroscopic quantum effect. We evaluate the rate of MDBD for a macroscopic sample of ``$X$" material, e.g., tritium, acting both as the source and the target. The accidental background for MDBD originating from two separate single beta decays, which contains two final state neutrinos, can be readily rejected by measuring the energy of the detected two electrons. We discuss the similarities and differences between the MDBD and conventional neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>

      <title>Travelling-wave, Quasi-periodic, and Longulent States of the Galerkin-regularized Hydrodynamic-type Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Travelling-wave, quasi-periodic and ``longulent'' states of the Galerkin-regularized systems preserving finite Fourier modes are exposed. The longulent states are characterized by solitonic structures, called ``longons'', accompanied by disordered components, which is associated to whiskered tori according to the \textit{a-posteriori} Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem. On-torus invariants are introduced for constructing the KAM tori, towards a potential pseudo-integrability theory. Persistence of the longulent states with respect to certain dispersive and dissipative perturbations are also numerically indicated.</description>

      <title>Strange stars admixed with mirror dark matter: confronting observations of XTE J1814-338</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15969v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel framework for explaining the mass and radius relationships of observed neutron stars by considering strange stars (SSs) admixed with mirror dark matter (MDM). We develop a theoretical model that incorporates non-commutative algebra to describe the interactions between ordinary strange quark matter (SQM) and MDM, which are predicted to form compact objects that could explain recent astrophysical data, including observations of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0437-4715, and the central compact object in HESS J1731-347. Notably, we demonstrate that the exotic mass-radius measurement of XTE J1814-338 can be explained by the presence of a mirror SS with an ordinary SQM core. In contrast to other explanations based on boson stars, our SS+MDM model offers a natural explanation for this system. We provide detailed mass-radius comparisons with observational data and discuss future observations that could test the predictions of our model, offering new insights into neutron star structure and the role of dark matter in compact objects.</description>

      <title>Moments of Axial-Vector GPD from Lattice QCD: Quark Helicity, Orbital Angular Momentum, and Spin-Orbit Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the Mellin moments of the twist-2 axial-vector generalized parton distribution (GPD), $\widetilde{H}(x,\xi,t)$, at zero skewness, $\xi$, with multiple values of the momentum transfer, $t$. Our analysis employs the short-distance factorization framework on ratio-scheme renormalized quasi-GPD matrix elements. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass fermions ensemble with clover improvement, a lattice spacing of $a = 0.093$ fm, and a pion mass of $m_\pi = 260$ MeV. We consider both the iso-vector and iso-scalar cases, utilizing next-to-leading-order perturbative matching while omitting the disconnected contributions and gluon mixing in the iso-scalar case. For the first time, we determine the Mellin moments of $\widetilde{H}$ up to the fifth order. From these moments, we discuss the quark helicity and orbital angular momentum contributions to the nucleon spin, as well as the spin-orbit correlations of the quarks. Additionally, we perform a Fourier transform over the momentum transfer, which allows us to explore the spin structure in the impact-parameter space.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of hybrid neutron star EoS constraints within a nonlocal color superconducting quark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a physics-informed Bayesian analysis of equation of state constraints using observational data for masses, radii and tidal deformability of pulsars and a generic class of hybrid neutron star equation of state with color superconducting quark matter on the basis of a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model. The nuclear matter phase is described within a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class and the phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction. We find the region in the two-dimensional parameter space spanned by the vector meson coupling and the scalar diquark coupling, where three conditions are fulfilled: 1) the Maxwell construction can be performed, 2) the maximum mass of the hybrid neutron star is not smaller than 2.0 M$_\odot$ and 3) the onset density of the phase transition is not below the nuclear saturation density $n_0=0.15$ fm$^{-3}$. The result of this study shows that the favorable neutron star equation of state has low onset masses for the occurrence of a color superconducting quark matter core between $0.5-0.7~M_\odot$ and maximum masses in the range $2.15 - 2.22~M_\odot$. In the typical mass range of $1.2 - 2.0~M_\odot$, the radii of these stars are between 11.9 and 12.4 km, almost independent of the mass. In principle, hybrid stars would allow for larger maximum masses than provided by the hadronic reference equation of state.</description>
