      <title>Robust ab initio predictions for dimensionless ratios of E2 and radius observables. II. Estimation of E2 transition strengths by calibration to the charge radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Converged results for E2 observables are notoriously challenging to obtain in ab initio no-core configuration interaction (NCCI) approaches. Matrix elements of the E2 operator are sensitive to the large-distance tails of the nuclear wave function, which converge slowly in an oscillator basis expansion. Similar convergence challenges beset ab initio prediction of the nuclear charge radius. However, we exploit systematic correlations between the calculated E2 and radius observables to yield meaningful predictions for relations among these observables. In particular, we examine ab initio predictions for dimensionless ratios of the form B(E2)/(e^2r^4), for nuclei throughout the p shell. Meaningful predictions for E2 transition strengths may then be made by calibrating to the ground-state charge radius, if experimentally known.</description>

      <title>Order-by-order uncertainties of nucleon-nucleon Wolfenstein amplitudes in chiral effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical invariance principles dictate the most general operator structure that can be present in the nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction. Five independent operators appear in the on-shell NN amplitude together with five corresponding coefficient functions. The usual choice for these coefficient functions is known as the NN Wolfenstein amplitudes. We analyze the order-by-order convergence of each of the five NN Wolfenstein amplitudes predicted by a semi-local coordinate space potential implementation of chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT). We do this at laboratory kinetic energies between 25 and 200 MeV for both neutron-proton and proton-proton scattering. Our analysis uses the Gaussian-Process methods developed by the BUQEYE collaboration to describe the contributions of each $\chi$EFT order, and so yields truncation uncertainties for each Wolfenstein amplitude that are correlated across scattering angles. We combine information on the size of different orders in the EFT to infer the $\chi$EFT breakdown scale for each amplitude, finding, on average, $\Lambda_b$ between 750 and 800 MeV. With this choice of $\Lambda_b$, the EFT truncation uncertainties cover both higher-order results and empirical Wolfenstein amplitudes well for all orders other than the leading order.</description>

      <title>Visualization of quantum interferences in heavy-ion elastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate various interference effects in elastic scattering of the $\alpha + {}^{40}\text{Ca}$ system at $E_{\rm lab}=29$ MeV. To this end, we use an optical potential model and decompose the scattering amplitude into four components, that is, the near-side and the far-side components, each of which is further decomposed into the barrier-wave and the internal-wave components. Each component contributes distinctively to the angular distributions, revealing unique quantum interference patterns. We apply the Fourier transform technique to visualize these interference effects. By analyzing the images at specific scattering angles, we identify the positions and intensities of peaks corresponding to each interference component. This analysis offers insight into structural features of the angular distribution which are not apparent from the differential cross sections alone.</description>

      <title>The $\alpha$ condensate states of atomic nuclei ${}^{12}C$, ${}^{16}O$ and ${}^{20}Ne$ in an analytical solvable model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\alpha$ condensation in the ${}^{12}C$, ${}^{16}O$ and ${}^{20}Ne$ nuclei is investigated within an analytical solvable model. It is found that the calculated ratio of the ground state energies of the Hoyle state of ${}^{12}C$ and the Hoyle-like state of ${}^{16}O$ is consistent with that of the experimental values. Along this clue, the ground state energy of ${}^{20}Ne$ is obtained to be 1MeV approximately, which is far less than the experimental value of 3MeV. Additionally, the root-mean-square radii of these nuclei are also calculated, and all of them lies around 9fm, which is different from the result calculated with the Tohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-Ropke(THSR) wave function. Since the root-mean-square radius is relevant to the ground state energy of the $\alpha$ condensate nucleus, the root-mean-square radii of ${}^{16}O$ and ${}^{20}Ne$ are also calculated with the ground state energies used in the THRS wave function. As a result, the root-mean-square radii of ${}^{16}O$ and ${}^{20}Ne$ reduced to 5fm, and it is similar to the result obtained with the THRS wave function. The calculation result manifests that the root-mean-square radius of $\alpha$ condensate nuclei decreases with the energy increasing.</description>

      <title>Exploring the possible two-proton radioactivity of $^{38,39}$Ti</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-proton (2$p$) radioactivity represents a rare decay mode that has been experimentally observed only in a selected few nuclei. The exploration of 2$p$ emission is crucial for elucidating the structure, mass, and nucleon-nucleon interactions within exotic proton-rich nuclei. $^{39}$Ti has long been postulated as a potential candidate for 2$p$ emission; however, experimental investigations have yet to confirm its 2$p$ decay. To provide more accurate information for further studies, we utilize the Gamow shell model (GSM) and the Gamow coupled channel (GCC) method to analyze the prospective 2$p$ radioactivity of isotopes $^{38,39}$Ti. Our calculations suggest that $^{39}$Ti is indeed a viable candidate for 2$p$ emission. Notably, the estimated partial 2$p$ decay width for $^{39}$Ti, predicted from the three-body GCC method, suggests that its 2$p$ decay could rival its $\beta$ decay in likelihood, although this is highly dependent on the specific 2$p$ decay energy. Additionally, our analysis indicates a propensity for pairing between the valence protons in $^{39}$Ti. A similar investigative approach reveals that $^{38}$Ti exhibits a higher 2$p$ decay energy and a broader decay width than $^{39}$Ti, positioning it as a more promising candidate for 2$p$ decay.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Neutrino Mass Hierarchy from Isotopic Ratios of Supernova Nucleosynthesis Products in Presolar Grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nucleosynthesis in a core-collapse supernova model including newly calculated neutrino-induced reaction rates with both collective and Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) neutrino-flavor oscillations considered. We show that the measurement of a pair of $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B and $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La or $^6$Li/$^7$Li and $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La in presolar grains that are inferred to have originated from core-collapse supernovae could constrain the neutrino mass hierarchy. The new shell-model and the model of quasi-particle random phase approximation in the estimate of three important neutrino-induced reactions, $\nu+^{16}$O, $\nu+^{20}$Ne, and $\nu+^{138}$Ba are applied in our reaction network. The new rates decrease the calculated $^{7}$Li/$^{6}$Li ratio by a factor of five compared with the previous study. More interestingly, these new rates result in a clear separation of the isotopic ratio of $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B between normal and inverted mass hierarchies in the O/Ne, O/C, and C/He layers where $^{138}$La abundance depends strongly on the mass hierarchy. In these layers, the sensitivity of the calculated abundances of $^{10,11}$B and $^{6,7}$Li to the nuclear reaction uncertainties is also tiny. Therefore, we propose that the $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B vs. $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La and $^6$Li/$^7$Li vs. $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La in type X silicon carbide grains sampled material from C/He layer can be used as a new probe to constrain the neutrino mass hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Dispersive analysis of the pion vector form factor without zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform an updated analysis of $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$ cross-section data using a dispersive representation of the pion vector form factor. We show that the available data are compatible with the assumption that the form factor is free of complex zeros and that under this assumption the largest systematic uncertainty in a previous analysis can be eliminated. We investigate both a constrained Omn\`es representation as well as a hybrid phase-modulus representation and we quantify the discrepancies in the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon based on different $e^+e^-$ data sets. We find that the dispersive constraints exacerbate these discrepancies. Together with the assumption of the absence of zeros, the pion charge radius becomes a useful observable to discriminate between the different data sets. This provides an opportunity for future improved lattice-QCD determinations to probe the discrepancies independently of full computations of hadronic vacuum polarization. We also reevaluate the two-pion contribution to Euclidean windows and we observe that systematic discrepancies between the data sets persist even at very long distances.</description>

      <title>Partonic distribution functions and amplitudes using tensor network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculations of the parton distribution function (PDF) and distribution amplitude (DA) are highly relevant to core experimental programs as they provide non-perturbative inputs to inclusive and exclusive processes, respectively. Direct computation of the PDFs and DAs remains challenging because they are non-perturbative quantities defined as light-cone correlators of quark and gluon fields, and are therefore inherently time-dependent. In this work, we propose a uniform quantum strategy based on tensor network simulation techniques to directly extract these hadronic quantities from first principles using the matrix product state of the hadrons in the same setup. We present exemplary numerical calculations with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in 1+1 dimensions and compare with available exact diagonalization and quantum circuit simulation results. Using tensor networks, we evaluate the PDF and DA at various strong couplings in the large-qubit limit, which is consistent with expectations at perturbative and non-relativistic limits.</description>

      <title>Predictions for flow harmonic distributions and flow factorization ratios at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.12792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data obtained at RHIC can be reproduced with relativistic viscous hydrodynamic simulations by adjusting the viscosity and initial conditions but it is difficult to disentangle these quantities. It is therefore important to find orthogonal observables to constrain the initial conditions separately from the viscosity. New observables have been measured at the LHC and shown to be sensitive to initial conditions and less to medium properties, specifically factorization breaking ratios appears to be promising. Here we consider two initial condition models, NeXus and TRENTO. While both models yield similar results for the scaled flow harmonic distributions both at the LHC and RHIC, they lead to quantitatively much more different patterns for the factorization breaking ratios at RHIC than at LHC, due to the shorter lifetime. Additionally, not only final state interactions but also initial free streaming matter in these ratio predictions and differences between these are enhanced at RHIC compared to LHC. Therefore experimental factorization breaking ratios at RHIC top energy (for transverse momentum) would be interesting to get.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger study of baryon-charged QCD matter in heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimessenger studies of heavy-ion collisions, using hadrons and electromagnetic probes, can reveal the properties of the created QCD matter from different perspectives. This study calculates the thermal dilepton invariant mass spectra and thermal photon transverse momentum spectra in Au+Au collisions at low beam energies from the Beam Energy Scan program, using a (3+1)-dimensional multistage hydrodynamic model calibrated by rapidity-dependent hadronic distributions. The effects of thermodynamic rapidity variation, baryon chemical potential, and fluid expansion on the spectra are explored. Methods for extracting temperature from photon and dilepton spectra are examined by comparison with the underlying hydrodynamic temperature. The possibility of combining photon and dilepton spectra to extract radial flow is also investigated. This study provides insights into measuring the thermodynamic properties of the created systems in heavy-ion collisions using multiple messengers through two fundamental interactions within the same framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-order virtual excitations play an important role in microscopic models of nuclear reactions at intermediate energies. However, the factorial growth of their complexity has prevented their consistent inclusion in ab initio many-body calculations. For infinite systems at finite temperature, such drawbacks can be overcome using diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) techniques to resum entire series of Feynman diagrams. We present a DiagMC algorithm that can be applied to self-bound systems with discrete energy levels at zero temperature, and demonstrate its potential for the Richardson model of nuclear pairing. We show that sampling the topological space of diagrams allows the inclusion of high-order excitations that are neglected in state-of-the-art approximations used in nuclear physics and quantum chemistry. We propose that sampling the diagrammatic space can overcome the long-standing gap between our microscopic understanding of structure and reactions in nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Molecular $P_{\psi}$ pentaquarks from light-meson exchange saturation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions for the spectrum of heavy meson-baryon bound states are a fundamental tool for disentangling the nature of the different pentaquark states that have been observed in experimental facilities. Here we explore this spectrum in a phenomenological model that describes the heavy meson-baryon interaction in terms of a contact-range interaction, where the coupling strength is saturated by the exchange of light scalar and vector mesons, i.e. $\sigma$, $\rho$ and $\omega$ exchanges. Saturation determines the couplings modulo an unknown proportionality constant that can be calibrated from a molecular candidate. If we use the $P_{\psi}^N(4312)$ as input, we predict a series of molecular pentaquarks including the $P_{\psi}^N(4440)$ and $P_{\psi}^N(4457)$, the recent $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338)$ and the $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4459)$.</description>

      <title>A multi-band study of pulsar glitches with Fermi-LAT and Parkes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar glitch is a phenomenon characterized by abrupt changes in the spin period over less than a minute. We present a comprehensive analysis of glitches in four gamma-ray pulsars by combining the timing observation data from \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (\textit{Fermi}-LAT) and Parkes 64 m radio telescope. The timing data of five pulsars, namely PSRs J1028$-$5819, J1420$-$6048, J1509$-$5850, J1709$-$4429 (B1706$-$44) and J1718$-$3825, are examined over 14 yr of observations for each. A total of 12 glitches are identified in four pulsars, including a previously unreported glitch. That is, a new small glitch is identified for PSR J1718$-$3825 in MJD $\sim$ 59121(8), with a fractional glitch size of $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim 1.9(2) \times 10^{-9}$. For PSR J1420$-$6048, our investigation confirms the presence of two linear recovery terms during the evolution of $\dot{\nu}$ following glitches 4, 6 and 8. Moreover, an exponential recovery process was identified after glitch 8, with a recovery fraction ($Q$) of $Q = 0.0131(5)$ and a corresponding timescale of $\tau_{\rm d} = 100(6)$ d. Regarding the fourth glitch of PSR J1709$-$4429, our analysis reveals the presence of two exponential recovery terms with degree of recovery and decay time-scales $Q$1 = 0.0104(5), $\tau_{\rm d1}=72(4)$ d and $Q$2 = 0.006(1), $\tau_{\rm d2}=4.2(6)$ d, respectively. For the remaining previously reported glitches, we also refine the glitch epochs and recovery process through precise fitting of the timing data. We discuss how multi-band data of glitches can help better characterize the glitch recoveries and constrain the underlying physics of glitch events. Our findings demonstrate that the accumulation of observational data reveals the rich complexity of the glitch phenomenon, aiding in the search for a well-established interpretation.</description>
