      <title>Towards accurate spin-orbit splittings from relativistic multireference electronic structure theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most nonrelativistic electron correlation methods can be adapted to account for relativistic effects, as long as the relativistic molecular spinor integrals are available, from either a four-, two-, or one-component mean-field calculation. However, relativistic multireference correlation methods remain a relatively unexplored area, with mixed evidence regarding the improvements brought by perturbative treatments. We report, for the first time, the implementation of state-averaged four-component multireference perturbation theories to second and third order based on the driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG). With our methods, named 4c-SA-DSRG-MRPT2 and 3, we find that the dynamical correlation included on top of 4c-CASSCF references can significantly improve the spin-orbit splittings in p-block elements and potential energy surfaces when compared to 4c-CASSCF and 4c-CASPT2 results. We further show that 4c-DSRG-MRPT2 and 3 are applicable to these systems over a wide range of the flow parameter, with systematic improvement from second to third order in terms of both improved error statistics and reduced sensitivity with respect to the flow parameter.</description>

      <title>(H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$ : a zero-field Ru$^{3+}$-based Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis and properties of (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$, which is shown to be a $J_{\text{eff}}=\frac{1}{2}$ system made out of Ru$^{3+}$ moments in a honeycomb geometry. Bulk magnetization, heat capacity, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) rule out the presence of static moments or any spin glass phase down to 500 mK. All techniques suggest a crossover to a liquid-like state below about 40 K. The $^{7}$Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shift data suggest a non-zero $T$-independent spin susceptibility at low $T$. In zero field, $C_m/T$ shows $T^{-1}$ divergence which is consistent with vacancy-induced effects on low-energy excitations of the pristine Kitaev spin liquid. With field, power-law variations in the $^{7}$Li NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T$_{1}$ and magnetic heat capacity $C_{m}$ show quantitatively new scaling behaviors. A two-step entropy release in heat capacity is also observed putatively from $Z_{2}$ flux (low-$T$ step) and itinerant Majorana fermions (high-$T$ step). Based on these findings, we propose that (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$ realizes a Kitaev spin liquid with no evidence of inherent magnetic ordering in zero field unlike $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ where approximately $8$ Tesla field is required to suppress magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Low-rank quantics tensor train representations of Feynman diagrams for multiorbital electron-phonon models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feynman diagrams are an essential tool for simulating strongly correlated electron systems. However, stochastic quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling suffers from the sign problem, e.g., when solving a multiorbital quantum impurity model. Recently, two approaches have been proposed for efficient numerical treatment of Feynman diagrams: Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI) for replacing the stochastic sampling and the Quantics Tensor Train (QTT) representation for compressing space-time dependence. Combining these approaches, we find low-rank structures in weak-coupling Feynman diagrams for a multiorbital electron-phonon model and demonstrate their efficient numerical integrations with exponential resolution in time and exponential convergence of error with respect to computational cost.</description>

      <title>Optical magnetoelectric effect in the polar honeycomb antiferromagnet Fe2Mo3O8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of both time-reversal and spatial inversion symmetry in polar magnets is a prerequisite for the occurrence of optical magnetoelectric effects such as nonreciprocal directional dichroism with the potential for the realization of optical diodes. In particular, antiferromagnetic materials with magnetic excitations in the THz range such as Fe2Mo3O8 are promising candidates for next-generation spintronic applications. In a combined experimental and theoretical effort we investigated the THz excitations of the polar honeycomb antiferromagnet Fe2Mo3O8 in external magnetic fields and their nonreciprocal directional dichroism, together with the temperature dependence of the electronic transitions in the mid- and near-infrared frequency range. Using an advanced single-ion approach for the Fe ions, we are able to describe optical excitations from the THz to the near-infrared frequency range quantitatively and successfully model the observed nonreciprocal directional dichroism in the THz regime.</description>

      <title>SO(5) multicriticality in two-dimensional quantum magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve the nature of the quantum phase transition between a N\'eel antiferromagnet and a valence-bond solid in two-dimensional spin-1/2 magnets. We study a class of $J$-$Q$ models, in which Heisenberg exchange $J$ competes with interactions $Q_n$ formed by products of $n$ singlet projectors on adjacent parallel lattice links. QMC simulations provide unambiguous evidence for first-order transitions, with the discontinuities increasing with $n$. For $n=2$ and $n=3$ models, the first-order signatures are very weak. On intermediate length scales, we extract well-defined scaling dimensions (critical exponents) that are common to the models with small $n$, indicating proximity to a quantum critical point. By combining two $Q$ terms, the transition can be tuned from weak to more strongly first-order. The two coexisting orders on the first-order line scale with a large exponent $\beta \approx 0.85$. This exponent and others are close to bounds for an SO($5$) symmetric CFT with a relevant SO($5$) singlet. We characterize the emergent SO($5$) symmetry by the scaling dimensions of its leading irrelevant perturbations. The large $\beta$ value and a large correlation length exponent, $\nu \approx 1.4$, partially explain why the transition remains near-critical even quite far away from the critical point and in many different models without fine-tuning. In addition, we find that few-spin lattice operators are dominated by the SO($5$) violating field (the traceless symmetric tensor), and interactions involving many spins are required to observe strong effects of the relevant SO($5$) singlet. The exponent that had previously been identified with the divergent correlation length when crossing between the two phases does not have a corresponding CFT operator. We explain this emergent pseudocritical scale by a mechanism relying on a dangerously irrelevant SO($5$) perturbation.</description>

      <title>QSpace - An open-source tensor library for Abelian and non-Abelian symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the documentation for the tensor library QSpace (v4.0), a toolbox to exploit `quantum symmetry spaces' in tensor network states in the quantum many-body context. QSpace permits arbitrary combinations of symmetries including the abelian symmetries $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $U(1)$, as well as all non-abelian symmetries based on the semisimple classical Lie algebras: $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, and $D_n$, or respectively, the special unitary group SU($n$), the odd orthogonal group SO($2n+1$), the symplectic group Sp($2n$), and the even orthogonal group SO($2n$). The code (C++ embedded via the MEX interface into Matlab) is available open source as of QSpace v4.0 at https://bitbucket.org/qspace4u/ under the Apache 2.0 license.
  QSpace is designed as a bottom-up approach for non-abelian symmetries. It starts from the defining representation and the respective Lie algebra. By explicitly computing and tabulating generalized Clebsch-Gordan coefficient tensors, QSpace is versatile in the type of operations that it can perform across all symmetries. At the level of an application, much of the symmetry-related details are hidden within the QSpace C++ core libraries. Hence when developing tensor network algorithms with QSpace, these can be coded (nearly) as if there are no symmetries at all, despite being able to fully exploit general non-abelian symmetries.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using quantum singular value transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering quantum information from a noisy quantum system is one of the central challenges in quantum information science and fundamental physics. The key to this goal is explicitly constructing a decoder. In this paper, we provide two explicit decoding quantum circuits that are both capable of recovering quantum information when a decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. The decoders are constructed by using the fixed-point amplitude amplification algorithm based on the quantum singular value transformation, which significantly extends an approach by Yoshida and Kitaev in a specific noise model to general situations. We also show that the proposed decoding circuits reduce the computational cost compared to a previously known explicit decoder. Our constructions not only show an intriguing intersection between decoders and quantum algorithms but also reveal the power of an algorithmic approach to recovering quantum information.</description>

      <title>GdWN$_3$ is a Nitride Perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitride perovskites $AB$N$_3$ are an emerging and highly under-explored class of materials that are of interest due to their intriguing calculated ferroelectric, optoelectronic, and other functional properties. Incorporating novel $A$-site cations is one strategy to tune and expand such properties; for example, Gd$^{3+}$ is compelling due to its large magnetic moment, potentially leading to multiferroic behavior. However, the theoretically predicted ground state of GdWN$_3$ is a non-perovskite monoclinic structure. Here, we experimentally show that GdWN$_3$ crystallizes in a perovskite structure. High-throughput combinatorial sputtering with activated nitrogen is employed to synthesize thin films of Gd$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$N$_{3-y}$ with low oxygen content within the bulk of the films. Ex-situ annealing crystallizes a polycrystalline perovskite phase in a narrow composition window near $x=1$. LeBail fits of synchrotron grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering data are consistent with a perovskite ground-state structure. New density functional theory calculations that included antiferromagnetic configurations confirm that the ground-state structure of GdWN$_3$ is a distorted $Pnma$ perovskite with antiferromagnetic ordering, in contrast to prior predictions. Initial property measurements find that GdWN$_3$ is paramagnetic down to $T=2$ K with antiferromagnetic correlations and that the absorption onset depends on cation stoichiometry. This work provides an important stepping stone towards the rapid expansion of the emerging family of nitride perovskites and towards our understanding of their potential multiferroic properties.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions and characteristic lengthscales in flat band superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of an unconventional form of high temperature superconductivity in flat band (FB) material does not cease to challenge our understanding of the physics in correlated systems. Recently, it has been argued that the coherence length in FB compounds could be decomposed into a conventional part of BCS type and a geometric contribution which characterises the FB eigenstates, the quantum metric. Here, we propose to address this issue in various FB systems and discuss whether the extracted characteristic lengthscales such as the size of the Cooper pairs obey this conjecture. It is found that the relevant lengthscales are less than one lattice spacing, weakly sensitive to the strength of the electron-electron interaction, and more importantly disconnected from the quantum metric.</description>

      <title>Topological phase diagram of the Haldane model on a Bishamon-kikko--honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological flat bands have gained extensive interest as a platform for exploring the interplay between nontrivial band topology and correlation effects. In recent studies, strongly correlated phenomena originating from a topological flat band were discussed on a periodically 1/6-depleted honeycomb lattice, but the fundamental topological nature associated with this lattice structure remains unexplored. Here we study the band structure and topological phase diagram for the Haldane model on this lattice, which we call the Bishamon-kikko lattice. We also extend our study to the model connecting the Bishamon-kikko and honeycomb lattices. We show that these models exhibit richer topological characteristics compared to the original Haldane model on the honeycomb lattice, such as topological insulating states with higher Chern numbers, metallic states with nontrivial band topology even at commensurate electron fillings, and metal-insulator transitions between them.7 Our findings offer a playground of correlated topological phenomena and stimulate their realization in a variety of two-dimensional systems, such as van der Waals materials, graphene nanostructures, and photonic crystals.</description>

      <title>Disorder-broadened phase boundary with enhanced amorphous superconductivity in pressurized In2Te5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an empirical tool in materials science and engineering, the iconic phase diagram owes its robustness and practicality to the topological characteristics rooted in the celebrated Gibbs phase law (F = C - P + 2). When crossing the phase diagram boundary, the structure transition occurs abruptly, bringing about an instantaneous change in physical properties and limited controllability on the boundaries (F = 1). Here, we expand the sharp phase boundary to an amorphous transition region (F = 2) by partially disrupting the long-range translational symmetry, leading to a sequential crystalline-amorphous-crystalline (CAC) transition in a pressurized In2Te5 single crystal. Through detailed in-situ synchrotron diffraction, we elucidate that the phase transition stems from the rotation of immobile blocks [In2Te2]2+, linked by hinge-like [Te3]2- trimers. Remarkably, within the amorphous region, the amorphous phase demonstrates a notable 25 % increase of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), while the carrier concentration remains relatively constant. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical framework revealing that the unconventional boost in amorphous superconductivity might be attributed to an intensified electron correlation, triggered by a disorder-augmented multifractal behavior. These findings underscore the potential of disorder and prompt further exploration of unforeseen phenomena on the phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Dynamics and Critical Phenomena in the Holographic Landscape of Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes critical exponents in a holographic Weyl semi-metal (WSM) using the $D3/D7$ brane setup. We study the non-linear behavior of the longitudinal current $J$ interacting with an external electric field $E$ at zero and finite temperatures. At zero temperature, we identify a potential quantum phase transition in the $J$-$E$ relationship driven by critical background parameters. At zero temperature, we pinpoint a potential quantum phase transition in the $J$-$E$ relationship, driven by a critical ratio of background parameters. This transition is a unique reconnection phenomenon, emerging from the interplay between WSM-like and ordinary nonlinear conducting behaviors, signaling a quantum phase transition. At nonzero temperature, with dissipation, the system exhibits both first- and second-order phase transitions by varying the electric field and the axial anomaly. We introduce longitudinal conductivity as an order parameter for the current-driven phase transition. Remarkably, our numerical analysis indicates critical exponents in this non-equilibrium phase transition that resemble the mean-field values found in metallic systems. This study sheds light on critical phenomena in non-equilibrium states, offering new insights into the quantum critical behavior of holographic systems and the nonlinear dynamics in WSMs, with broader implications for quantum phase transitions in condensed matter physics and topological materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the lock-in transition of charge-density waves of one-dimensional conductors. Though this phenomenon has been known for decades, there are still discrepancies between the theories and the experiments. We focused on the pioneering study of this phenomenon by McMillan and revisited, in particular, his numerical calculations. We found that the results in the previous study were qualitatively correct, but insufficient precision smeared out the important characteristics. The obtained critical point was in good agreement with the analytical solution with 10-digit precision. Our calculations also unveiled a critical regime of the lock-in transition in which the energy obeys a simple power law. Moreover, the solitons near the lock-in transition (discommensurations) were found to form a perfect lattice with a spacing incommensurate to the pristine lattice. A comparison between our results and the experimental ones suggested a limit of McMillan's theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is sensitive to thermally driven magnetic excitations in magnetic insulators. Vanadium dioxide in its insulating low temperature phase is expected to lack magnetic degrees of freedom, as vanadium atoms are thought to form singlets upon dimerization of the vanadium chains. Instead, we find a paramagnetic SSE response in VO2 films that grows as the temperature decreases below 50 K. The field and temperature dependent SSE voltage is qualitatively consistent with a general model of paramagnetic SSE response and inconsistent with triplet spin transport. Quantitative estimates find a spin Seebeck coefficient comparable in magnitude to that observed in strongly magnetic materials. The microscopic nature of the magnetic excitations in VO2 requires further examination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the influence of disorder and strong correlations on the topology in two dimensional Chern insulators. A mean field calculation in the half-filled Haldane model with extended Hubbard interactions and Anderson disorder shows that disorder favors topology in the interacting case and extends the topological phase to a larger region of the Hubbard parameters. In the absence of a staggered potential, we find a novel disorder-driven topological phase with Chern number C=1, with co-existence of topology with long range spin and charge orders. More conventional topological Anderson insulating phases are also found in the presence of a finite staggered potential.</description>

      <title>Tensile and compressive strain tuning of a Kondo lattice</title>

Abstract: We present electrical resistivity measurements on the prototypical heavy-fermion metal YbRh$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ (YRS) under $a$-axis tensile and compressive strain and focus on the evolution of the resistivity maximum near 136~K that arises from the interplay of the Kondo effect and the crystal electric field (CEF) splitting. While compressive strain reduces $T_{\rm max}$, similar as previously reported for hydrostatic pressure, $T_{\rm max}$ is enhanced up to 145~K for 0.13\% tensile strain. Model calculations for the strain effect on CEF splitting in YRS reveal a negligible shift of the levels. Instead, the enhancement of the resistivity maximum indicates a 20\% increase of the Kondo temperature. This opens the perspective to access the hidden zero-field QCP in pure YRS.</description>

      <title>Discrete Time Crystal Phase of Higher Dimensional Integrable Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the possibility of generating Floquet-time crystals in higher dimensions ($d\geq 2$) through the time-periodic driving of integrable free-fermionic models. The realization leads to rigid time-crystal phases that are ideally resistant to thermalization and decoherence. By utilizing spin-orbit coupling, we are able to realize a robust time-crystal phase that can be detected using novel techniques. Moreover, we discuss the significance of studying the highly persistent subharmonic responses and their implementation in a Kitaev spin liquid, which contributes to our understanding of time translational symmetry breaking and its practical implications.</description>

Abstract: Strong correlations in matter promote a landscape of ground states and associated quantum critical points. For metallic systems, there is increasing recognition that the quantum criticality goes beyond the standard Landau framework and, thus, novel means are needed to characterize the quantum critical fluid. Here we do so by studying the entanglement properties near a quantum critical point of a strongly correlated metal. We calculate the quantum Fisher information of an Anderson/Kondo lattice model across its Kondo destruction quantum critical point. The quantum Fisher information of the spin degree of freedom peaks at the quantum critical point and indicates a strongly entangled ground state. Our results are supported by the quantum Fisher information extracted from inelastic neutron scattering measurements in quantum critical heavy fermion metals. Our work opens a new avenue to advance the understanding of metallic quantum criticality in a broad range of strongly correlated systems, and points to a new regime of quantum matter to realize amplified entanglement.</description>

      <title>Locally controlled arrested thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-time dynamics of quantum systems, typically, but not always, results in a thermal steady state. The microscopic processes that lead to or circumvent this fate are of interest, since everyday experience tells us that not all spatial regions of a system heat up or cool down uniformly. This motivates the question: under what conditions can one slow down or completely arrest thermalization locally? Is it possible to construct realistic Hamiltonians and initial states such that a local region is effectively insulated from the rest, or acts like a barrier between two or more regions? We answer this in the affirmative by outlining the conditions that govern the flow of energy and entropy between subsystems. Using these ideas we provide a representative example for how simple few-body states can be used to engineer a ``thermal switch" between interacting regions.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic kinks and spin-flop transition in Ni$_{2}$InSbO$_6$ from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric multiferroics are key materials for next-generation spintronic devices due to their entangled magnetic and ferroelectric properties. Spiral multiferroics possess ferroelectric polarization and are particularly promising for electric control of magnetism and magnetic control of ferroelectricity. In this work, we uncover long-period incommensurate states characterized by unique multiferroic kinks in corundum nickelate Ni$_{2}$InSbO$_6$, a member of a promising family of polar magnets. Utilizing a 2-orbital $S=1$ model, we derive formulas for Heisenberg and anisotropic magnetic exchanges and magnetically-induced polarization, enabling their calculations from first principles. We use these parameters in Monte Carlo and Landau theory-based calculations to reproduce experimentally observed magnetic structures and polarization dependence on the magnetic field. We predict magnetic phase transitions between flat spiral, conical spiral, canted antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states under increasing magnetic fields. Kinks in the spiral phases repel each other through a Yukawa-like potential arising from exchange of massive magnons. We also find that suitably directed electric fields can be used to stabilize the ferromagnetic and spiral states. The findings open a new pathway to predictive first-principles modelling of multiferroics and will inspire experiments and technological applications based on multiferroic kinks.</description>

      <title>Variational manifolds for ground states and scarred dynamics of blockade-constrained spin models on two and three dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variational manifold of simple tensor network states for the study of a family of constrained models that describe spin-1/2 systems as realized by Rydberg atom arrays. Our manifold permits analytical calculation via perturbative expansion of one- and two-point functions in arbitrary spatial dimensions and allows for efficient computation of the matrix elements required for variational energy minimization and variational time evolution in up to three dimensions. We apply this framework to the PXP model on the hypercubic lattice in 1D, 2D, and 3D, and show that, in each case, it exhibits quantum phase transitions breaking the sub-lattice symmetry in equilibrium, and hosts quantum many body scars out of equilibrium. We demonstrate that our variational ansatz qualitatively captures all these phenomena and predicts key quantities with an accuracy that increases with the dimensionality of the lattice, and conclude that our method can be interpreted as a generalization of mean-field theory to constrained spin models.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Symmetry Preserving Gapped Phases from Coupling Constant Anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we will characterize constraints on the possible IR phases of a given QFT by anomalies in the space of coupling constants. We will give conditions under which a coupling constant anomaly cannot be matched by a continuous family of symmetry preserving gapped phases, in which case the theory is either gapless, or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking or a phase transition. We additionally demonstrate examples of theories with coupling constant anomalies which can be matched by a family of symmetry preserving gapped phases without a phase transition and comment on the interpretation of our results for the spontaneous breaking of "$(-1)$-form global symmetries."</description>

      <title>Preparing matrix product states via fusion: constraints and extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, the efficient preparation of many-body resource states is a task of paramount importance. In this paper we focus on the deterministic preparation of matrix-product states (MPS) in constant depth by utilizing measurements and classical communication to fuse smaller states into larger ones. We place strong constraints on the MPS that can be prepared using this method, which we refer to as MPS fusion. Namely, we establish that it is necessary for the MPS to have a flat entanglement spectrum. Using the recently introduced split-index MPS (SIMPS) representation, we then introduce a family of states that belong to interesting phases of matter protected by non-onsite symmetries and serve as resources for long-range quantum teleportation, but which lie beyond the scope of ordinary MPS fusion. It is shown constructively that these states can be prepared in constant depth using a broader class of measurement-assisted protocols, which we dub SIMPS fusion. Even in cases when MPS fusion is possible, using SIMPS fusion can give rise to significantly reduced resource overhead. Our results therefore simultaneously establish the boundaries of conventional MPS fusion and push the envelope of which states can be prepared using measurement-assisted protocols.</description>
