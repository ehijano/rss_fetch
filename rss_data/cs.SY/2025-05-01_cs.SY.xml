      <title>Climate Science and Control Engineering: Insights, Parallels, and Connections</title>

Abstract: Climate science is the multidisciplinary field that studies the Earth's climate and its evolution. At the very core of climate science are indispensable climate models that predict future climate scenarios, inform policy decisions, and dictate how a country's economy should change in light of the changing climate. Climate models capture a wide range of interacting dynamic processes via extremely complex ordinary and partial differential equations. To model these large-scale complex processes, climate science leverages supercomputers, advanced simulations, and statistical methods to predict future climate. An area of engineering that is rarely studied in climate science is control engineering. Given that climate systems are inherently dynamic, it is intuitive to analyze them within the framework of dynamic system science. This perspective that has been underexplored in the literature. In this manuscript, we provide a tutorial that: (i) introduces the control engineering community to climate dynamics and modeling, including spatiotemporal scales and challenges in climate modeling; (ii) offers a fresh perspective on climate models from a control systems viewpoint; and (iii) explores the relevance and applicability of various advanced graph and network control-based approaches in building a physics-informed framework for learning, control and estimation in climate systems. We also present simple and then more complex climate models, depicting fundamental ideas and processes that are instrumental in building climate change projections. This tutorial also builds parallels and observes connections between various contemporary problems at the forefront of climate science and their control theoretic counterparts. We specifically observe that an abundance of climate science problems can be linguistically reworded and mathematically framed as control theoretic ones.</description>

      <title>Data-driven operator learning for energy-efficient building control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-efficient ventilation control plays a vital role in reducing building energy consumption while ensuring occupant health and comfort. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations offer high-fidelity modeling of airflow for building HVAC design, their high computational cost makes them impractical for practical adoption in real-time building management system. In this work, we present a data-driven framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable energy-efficient building ventilation control. Our method jointly optimizes airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train a neural operator transformer to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow field distributions using high-resolution CFD data. This learned operator enables a gradient-based control framework capable of optimal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, and data-driven control based on regional average CO2 predictions, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method for enabling safe and energy-efficient building management.</description>

      <title>Power Flow Approximations for Multiphase Distribution Networks using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based approaches are increasingly leveraged to manage and coordinate the operation of grid-edge resources in active power distribution networks. Among these, model-based techniques stand out for their superior data efficiency and robustness compared to model-free methods. However, effective model learning requires a learning-based approximator for the underlying power flow model. This study extends existing work by introducing a data-driven power flow method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) to approximate the multiphase power flow model, by mapping net load injections to nodal voltages. Simulation results using the IEEE 123-bus and 8500-node distribution test feeders demonstrate that the trained GP model can reliably predict the nonlinear power flow solutions with minimal training data. We also conduct a comparative analysis of the training efficiency and testing performance of the proposed GP-based power flow approximator against a deep neural network-based approximator, highlighting the advantages of our data-efficient approach. Results over realistic operating conditions show that despite an 85% reduction in the training sample size (corresponding to a 92.8% improvement in training time), GP models produce a 99.9% relative reduction in mean absolute error compared to the baselines of deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Unified Network Modeling for Six Cross-Layer Scenarios in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) can enable global range and seamless coverage in the future network. SAGINs consist of three spatial layer network nodes: 1) satellites on the space layer, 2) aerial vehicles on the aerial layer, and 3) ground devices on the ground layer. Data transmissions in SAGINs include six unique cross-spatial-layer scenarios, i.e., three uplink and three downlink transmissions across three spatial layers. For simplicity, we call them \textit{six cross-layer scenarios}. Considering the diverse cross-layer scenarios, it is crucial to conduct a unified network modeling regarding node coverage and distributions in all scenarios. To achieve this goal, we develop a unified modeling approach of coverage regions for all six cross-layer scenarios. Given a receiver in each scenario, its coverage region on a transmitter-distributed surface is modeled as a spherical dome. Utilizing spherical geometry, the analytical models of the spherical-dome coverage regions are derived and unified for six cross-layer scenarios. We conduct extensive numerical results to examine the coverage models under varying carrier frequencies, receiver elevation angles, and transceivers' altitudes. Based on the coverage model, we develop an algorithm to generate node distributions under spherical coverage regions, which can assist in testing SAGINs before practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Reduced order asymptotic observer of friction in motion control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An asymptotic observer of the motion state variables with nonlinear friction [1] benefits from a robust to the noise state-space representation of the dynamic friction force, including pre-sliding transitions, and implements the reduced order Luenberger observation law with only measurable output displacement. The uniform asymptotic stability and convergence analysis of the proposed observer are elaborated by using the Lyapunov function-based stability criteria by Ignatyev and imposing the parametric constraints on the time dependent eigenvalues to be always negative real. A design procedure for assigning a dominant (thus slowest) real pole of the observer system matrix is proposed. A thorough experimental evaluation is given for the proposed observer-based friction compensation, which is performed for positioning and tracking tasks and compared with an optimally tuned PID feedback control.</description>

      <title>Stability of Open Multi-agent Systems over Dynamic Signed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the bipartite consensus-control problem in open multi-agent systems containing both cooperative and antagonistic interactions. In these systems, new agents can join and new interactions can be formed over time. Moreover, the types of interactions, cooperative or antagonistic, may change. To model these structural changes, we represent the system as a switched system interconnected over a dynamic signed graph. Using the signed edge-based agreement protocol and constructing strict Lyapunov functions for signed edge-Laplacian matrices with multiple zero eigenvalues, we establish global asymptotic stability of the bipartite consensus control. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On phase in scaled graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaled graph has been introduced recently as a nonlinear extension of the classical Nyquist plot for linear time-invariant systems. In this paper, we introduce a modified definition for the scaled graph, termed the signed scaled graph (SSG), in which the phase component is characterized by making use of the Hilbert transform. Whereas the original definition of the scaled graph uses unsigned phase angles, the new definition has signed phase angles which ensures the possibility to differentiate between phase-lead and phase-lag properties in a system. Making such distinction is important from both an analysis and a synthesis perspective, and helps in providing tighter stability estimates of feedback interconnections. We show how the proposed SSG leads to intuitive characterizations of positive real and negative imaginary nonlinear systems, and present various interconnection results. We showcase the effectiveness of our results through several motivating examples.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Neural Control with Desired Approximation: An Integral Lyapunov Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent approximation ability of neural networks plays an essential role in adaptive neural control, where the prerequisite for existence of the compact set is crucial in the control designs. Instead of using practical system state, in this paper, the desired approximation approach is characterized to tackle such a problem, where the desired state signal is required only as the input to the network. An integral Lyapunov function-based adaptive controller is designed, in the sense of the error tracking, where the treatment of the state-dependent input gain is adopted. Theoretical results for the performance analysis of the integral and incremental adaptation algorithms are presented in details. In particular, the boundedness of the variables in the closed-loop is characterized, while the transient performance of the output error is analytically quantified. It is shown that the proposed control schemes assure that the tracking error converges to an adjustable set without any requirement on the knowledge of the region that the practical variables evolve, and remove the requirement for the setting of initial conditions including system states and weight estimates.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Systems and Control Theory for Social Robotics: A Model-Based Behavioral Control Approach to Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social robots (SRs) should autonomously interact with humans, while exhibiting proper social behaviors associated to their role. By contributing to health-care, education, and companionship, SRs will enhance life quality. However, personalization and sustaining user engagement remain a challenge for SRs, due to their limited understanding of human mental states. Accordingly, we leverage a recently introduced mathematical dynamic model of human perception, cognition, and decision-making for SRs. Identifying the parameters of this model and deploying it in behavioral steering system of SRs allows to effectively personalize the responses of SRs to evolving mental states of their users, enhancing long-term engagement and personalization. Our approach uniquely enables autonomous adaptability of SRs by modeling the dynamics of invisible mental states, significantly contributing to the transparency and awareness of SRs. We validated our model-based control system in experiments with 10 participants who interacted with a Nao robot over three chess puzzle sessions, 45 - 90 minutes each. The identified model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.067 (i.e., 1.675% of the maximum possible MSE) in tracking beliefs, goals, and emotions of participants. Compared to a model-free controller that did not track mental states of participants, our approach increased engagement by 16% on average. Post-interaction feedback of participants (provided via dedicated questionnaires) further confirmed the perceived engagement and awareness of the model-driven robot. These results highlight the unique potential of model-based approaches and control theory in advancing human-SR interactions.</description>

      <title>A Protection-Interoperable Fault Ride-Through Control for Grid-Forming Inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differing from synchronous generators (SGs), grid-forming inverter-based resources (GFM-IBRs) exhibit rapid variations in their output impedances during transmission line faults due to the overcurrent limitation. As a result, the source dynamics during the fault period deviate significantly from those under pre-fault conditions. This fundamental difference alters the fault responses of incremental quantities, thereby jeopardizing the reliability of the supervising elements in protective relays that are based on these quantities. To address this challenge, a protection-interoperable fault ride-through (FRT) method for GFM-IBRs is proposed. This method dynamically adjusts power control of GFM-IBRs in response to the changes in output impedance, effectively mitigating variations in source dynamics and thereby preserving the reliability of incremental quantity-based supervising elements. This method also ensures effective overcurrent limitation and transient stability of GFM-IBRs. Controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) and experimental tests validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the transient phenomena that occur in two special cases in the Netherlands: (A) during the energization of a power transformer via a cable feeder and (B) the energization of a power transformer together with an overhead line (OHL). In Case A a 7 km long 150 kV cable and a 150/50 kV transformer are connected and energized at the same time. In Case B a 150/50 kV transformer and a short 50 kV OHL are connected and energized simultaneously. The reason behind this kind of situations is related to space restrictions and cost efficiency.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Line-Impedance Estimation in the Absence of Phasor Measurement Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes and compares experimentally several methods to estimate the series resistance and reactance (i.e., the transversal components of the $\pi$-model of a line) of low-voltage lines in distribution grids. It first shows that if phasor measurements are available and the grid nodal voltages and power injections are known, the problem can be formulated and solved as a conventional load flow with properly adjusted unknowns. To solve this problem, we propose an analytical derivation of the Jacobian matrix. If only RMS values are available, such as from smart meters, integrating information from multiple intervals becomes necessary, ultimately opening to least-squares estimations, widely adopted in the literature. In this context, applying the proposed Jacobian contributes to accelerating the problem resolution of existing algorithms. The methods are compared in terms of estimation performance and convergence by using measurements from an experimental distribution grid interfacing real-world components and with realistic size implemented at the Gridlab at HES-SO Valais.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting of Residential Loads -- A Copula Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the time series of future evolutions of renewable injections and demands is of utmost importance for the operation of power systems. However, the current state of the art is mostly focused on mean-value time series predictions and only very few methods provide probabilistic forecasts. In this paper, we rely on kernel density estimation and vine copulas to construct probabilistic models for individual load profiles of private households. Our approach allows the quantification of variability of individual energy consumption in general and of daily peak loads in particular. We draw upon an Australian distribution grid dataset to illustrate our findings. We generate synthetic loads that follow the distribution of the real data.</description>

      <title>Optimal Dynamic Control of Bounded Jacobian Discrete-Time Systems via Interval Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimal dynamic control framework for bounded Jacobian nonlinear discrete-time (DT) systems with nonlinear observations affected by both state and process noise. Rather than directly stabilizing the uncertain system, we focus on stabilizing an interval observer in a higher dimensional space, whose states bound the true system states. Our nonlinear dynamic control method introduces added flexibility over traditional static and linear approaches, effectively compensating for system nonlinearities and enabling potentially tighter closed-loop intervals. Additionally, we establish a separation principle that allows for the design of observer and control gains. We further derive tractable matrix inequalities to ensure system stability in the closed-loop configuration. The simulation results show that the proposed dynamic control approach significantly outperforms a static counterpart method.</description>

      <title>Green Satellite Networks Using Segment Routing and Software-Defined Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of network performance in software defined networking (SDN)-based low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks, focusing on the Telesat Lightspeed constellation. We propose a green traffic engineering (TE) approach leveraging segment routing IPv6 (SRv6) to enhance energy efficiency. Through simulations, we analyze the impact of SRv6, multi-protocol label switching (MPLS), IPv4, and IPv6 with open shortest path first (OSPF) on key network performance metrics, including peak and average CPU usage, memory consumption, packet delivery rate (PDR), and packet overhead under varying traffic loads. Results show that the proposed green TE approach using SRv6 achieves notable energy efficiency, maintaining lower CPU usage and high PDR compared to traditional protocols. While SRv6 and MPLS introduce slightly higher memory usage and overhead due to their advanced configurations, these trade-offs remain manageable. Our findings highlight SRv6 with green TE as a promising solution for optimizing energy efficiency in LEO satellite networks, contributing to the development of more sustainable and efficient satellite communications.</description>

      <title>A Koopman Operator-based NMPC Framework for Mobile Robot Navigation under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile robot navigation can be challenged by system uncertainty. For example, ground friction may vary abruptly causing slipping, and noisy sensor data can lead to inaccurate feedback control. Traditional model-based methods may be limited when considering such variations, making them fragile to varying types of uncertainty. One way to address this is by leveraging learned prediction models by means of the Koopman operator into nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). This paper describes the formulation of, and provides the solution to, an NMPC problem using a lifted bilinear model that can accurately predict affine input systems with stochastic perturbations. System constraints are defined in the Koopman space, while the optimization problem is solved in the state space to reduce computational complexity. Training data to estimate the Koopman operator for the system are given via randomized control inputs. The output of the developed method enables closed-loop navigation control over environments populated with obstacles. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested through numerical simulations using a wheeled robot with additive stochastic velocity perturbations, Gazebo simulations with a realistic digital twin robot, and physical hardware experiments without knowledge of the true dynamics.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Gaussian Processes for Model Predictive Control of Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a novel linear model predictive control algorithm based on a physics-informed Gaussian Process has been introduced, whose realizations strictly follow a system of underlying linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. The control task is formulated as an inference problem by conditioning the Gaussian process prior on the setpoints and incorporating pointwise soft-constraints as further virtual setpoints. We apply this method to systems of nonlinear differential equations, obtaining a local approximation through the linearization around an equilibrium point. In the case of an asymptotically stable equilibrium point convergence is given through the Bayesian inference schema of the Gaussian Process. Results for this are demonstrated in a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Multi-Goal Dexterous Hand Manipulation using Probabilistic Model-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of learning multi-goal dexterous hand manipulation tasks using model-based Reinforcement Learning. We propose Goal-Conditioned Probabilistic Model Predictive Control (GC-PMPC) by designing probabilistic neural network ensembles to describe the high-dimensional dexterous hand dynamics and introducing an asynchronous MPC policy to meet the control frequency requirements in real-world dexterous hand systems. Extensive evaluations on four simulated Shadow Hand manipulation scenarios with randomly generated goals demonstrate GC-PMPC's superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines. It successfully drives a cable-driven Dexterous hand, DexHand 021 with 12 Active DOFs and 5 tactile sensors, to learn manipulating a cubic die to three goal poses within approximately 80 minutes of interactions, demonstrating exceptional learning efficiency and control performance on a cost-effective dexterous hand platform.</description>

      <title>One Net to Rule Them All: Domain Randomization in Quadcopter Racing Across Different Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-speed quadcopter racing, finding a single controller that works well across different platforms remains challenging. This work presents the first neural network controller for drone racing that generalizes across physically distinct quadcopters. We demonstrate that a single network, trained with domain randomization, can robustly control various types of quadcopters. The network relies solely on the current state to directly compute motor commands. The effectiveness of this generalized controller is validated through real-world tests on two substantially different crafts (3-inch and 5-inch race quadcopters). We further compare the performance of this generalized controller with controllers specifically trained for the 3-inch and 5-inch drone, using their identified model parameters with varying levels of domain randomization (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%). While the generalized controller shows slightly slower speeds compared to the fine-tuned models, it excels in adaptability across different platforms. Our results show that no randomization fails sim-to-real transfer while increasing randomization improves robustness but reduces speed. Despite this trade-off, our findings highlight the potential of domain randomization for generalizing controllers, paving the way for universal AI controllers that can adapt to any platform.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Biased Backpressure Routing and Scheduling to Wireless Multi-hop Networks with Advanced Air-interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backpressure (BP) routing and scheduling is a well-established resource allocation method for wireless multi-hop networks, known for its fully distributed operations and proven maximum queue stability. Recent advances in shortest path-biased BP routing (SP-BP) mitigate shortcomings such as slow startup and random walk, but exclusive link-level commodity selection still suffers from the last-packet problem and bandwidth underutilization. Moreover, classic BP routing implicitly assumes single-input-single-output (SISO) transceivers, which can lead to the same packets being scheduled on multiple outgoing links for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transceivers, causing detouring and looping in MIMO networks. In this paper, we revisit the foundational Lyapunov drift theory underlying BP routing and demonstrate that exclusive commodity selection is unnecessary, and instead propose a Max-Utility link-sharing method. Additionally, we generalize MaxWeight scheduling to MIMO networks by introducing attributed capacity hypergraphs (ACH), an extension of traditional conflict graphs for SISO networks, and by incorporating backlog reassignment into scheduling iterations to prevent redundant packet routing. Numerical evaluations show that our approach substantially mitigates the last-packet problem in state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP-BP under lightweight traffic, and slightly expands the network capacity region for heavier traffic.</description>

      <title>Characterizing AI Agents for Alignment and Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The creation of effective governance mechanisms for AI agents requires a deeper understanding of their core properties and how these properties relate to questions surrounding the deployment and operation of agents in the world. This paper provides a characterization of AI agents that focuses on four dimensions: autonomy, efficacy, goal complexity, and generality. We propose different gradations for each dimension, and argue that each dimension raises unique questions about the design, operation, and governance of these systems. Moreover, we draw upon this framework to construct "agentic profiles" for different kinds of AI agents. These profiles help to illuminate cross-cutting technical and non-technical governance challenges posed by different classes of AI agents, ranging from narrow task-specific assistants to highly autonomous general-purpose systems. By mapping out key axes of variation and continuity, this framework provides developers, policymakers, and members of the public with the opportunity to develop governance approaches that better align with collective societal goals.</description>

      <title>From Discrete to Continuous Binary Best-Response Dynamics: Discrete Fluctuations Almost Surely Vanish with Population Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In binary decision-making, individuals often choose either the rare or the common action. In the framework of evolutionary game theory, the best-response update rule can be used to model this dichotomy. Those who prefer the common action are called \emph{coordinators}, and those who prefer the rare one are called \emph{anticoordinators}. A finite mixed population of the two types may undergo perpetual fluctuations, the characterization of which appears to be challenging. It is particularly unknown whether the fluctuations persist as population size grows. To fill this gap, we approximate the discrete finite population dynamics of coordinators and anticoordinators with the associated mean dynamics in the form of differential inclusions. We show that the family of the state sequences of the discrete dynamics for increasing population sizes forms a generalized stochastic approximation process for the differential inclusion. On the other hand, we show that the differential inclusions always converge to an equilibrium. This implies that the reported perpetual fluctuations in the finite discrete dynamics of coordinators and anticoordinators almost surely vanish with population size. The results encourage to first analyze the often simpler {continuous-time} mean dynamics of the discrete population dynamics as the continuous-time dynamics partly reveal the asymptotic behavior of the discrete dynamics.</description>

      <title>Capacity Credit Evaluation of Generalized Energy Storage Considering Strategic Capacity Withholding and Decision-Dependent Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07338v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel capacity credit evaluation framework to accurately quantify the contribution of generalized energy storage (GES) to resource adequacy, considering both strategic capacity withholding and decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). To this end, we establish a market-oriented risk-averse coordinated dispatch method to capture the cross-market reliable operation of GES. The proposed method is sequentially implemented along with the Monte Carlo simulation process, coordinating the pre-dispatched price arbitrage and capacity withholding in the energy market with adequacy-oriented re-dispatch during capacity market calls. In addition to decision-independent uncertainties in operational states and baseline behavior, we explicitly address the inherent DDU of GES (i.e., the uncertainty of available discharge capacity affected by the incentives and accumulated discomfort) during the re-dispatch stage using the proposed data-driven distributional robust chance-constrained approach. Furthermore, a capacity credit metric called equivalent storage capacity substitution is introduced to quantify the equivalent deterministic storage capacity of uncertain GES. Simulations on the modified IEEE RTS-79 benchmark system with 20 years real-world data from Elia demonstrate that the proposed method yields accurate capacity credit and improved economic performance. We show that the capacity credit of GES increases with more strategic capacity withholding but decreases with more DDU levels. Key factors, such as capacity withholding and DDU structure impacting GES's capacity credit are analyzed with insights into capacity market decision-making.</description>

      <title>Two-Phase Switched Reluctance Motors: Optimal Magnet Placement and Drive System for Torque Density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on designing new motors with high torque density, which is crucial for applications ranging from electric vehicles to robotics. We propose a double-teeth C-core switched reluctance motor with hybrid excitation, integrating permanent magnets and a novel drive technique to enhance motor torque density. We explore three magnet placement configurations to maximize torque. A common challenge with most self-starting methods used in two-phase SRMs is the generation of negative torque, which reduces the motor's torque density. Our adopted self-starting method minimizes negative torque, and we introduce a new drive strategy to control the switching on and off, effectively eliminating negative torque. Additionally, magnetic equivalent circuits are developed for the analytical design and theoretical analysis of all configurations. The SRMs under study are prototyped and tested, and their performances are evaluated in terms of torque-angle characteristics, current, and voltage. Both experimental and simulation results validate the effectiveness of the PM-assisted SRMs in enhancing torque density and efficiency.</description>

      <title>A New 8/14 Two-Phase Switched Reluctance Motor with Improved Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their simple and robust structure, low cost, and simple cooling system, switched reluctance motors (SRMs) face the challenge of low mean torque. A possible solution is to change the structure of SRMs. This article introduces an innovative combination of the number of rotor teeth and stator teeth of a two-phase switch reluctance motor (TPSRM) with eight teeth for the stator and fourteen teeth for the rotor. As a result of its unique design, which has a short path for passing the main flux, it requires less magnetomotive force. This leads to less core and copper loss, resulting in increased efficiency. Each tooth of the stator in a phase develops a positive torque during the rotation of the rotor, which increases the torque and consequently increases the mean torque of the proposed TPSRM. A current hysteresis control (CHC) is simulated by 2D FEM for the proposed 8/14 TPSRM and the conventional 8/12 TPSRM under the same mechanical load on the shaft to get a current hysteresis reference of 15A at the nominal speed of 600 rpm. To verify the novelty and advantages of the suggested TPSRM, it is compared with the conventional 8/12 TPSRM in terms of mean and peak torque, torque density, and core and copper losses were compared. Lastly, the proposed 8/14 TPSRM is shown to have better performance than the conventional 8/12 TPSRM.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we design offset-free nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) for surrogate models based on Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD). The model used for prediction in MPC is augmented with a disturbance term, that is estimated by an observer. If the full information about the equilibrium of the real system is not available, a reference calculator is introduced in the algorithm to compute the MPC state and input references. The control algorithm guarantees offset-free tracking of the controlled output under the assumption that the modeling errors are asymptotically constant. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is showcased with numerical simulations for two popular benchmark systems: the van-der-Pol oscillator and the four-tanks process.</description>

      <title>No-Regret Model Predictive Control with Online Learning of Koopman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a problem of simultaneous system identification and model predictive control of nonlinear systems. Particularly, we provide an algorithm for systems with unknown residual dynamics that can be expressed by Koopman operators. Such residual dynamics can model external disturbances and modeling errors, such as wind and wave disturbances to aerial and marine vehicles, or inaccurate model parameters. The algorithm has finite-time near-optimality guarantees and asymptotically converges to the optimal non-causal controller. Specifically, the algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined herein as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the unknown dynamics will adapt to its states and actions. To this end, we assume the algorithm is given Koopman observable functions such that the unknown dynamics can be approximated by a linear dynamical system. Then, it employs model predictive control based on the current learned model of the unknown residual dynamics. This model is updated online using least squares in a self-supervised manner based on the data collected while controlling the system. We validate our algorithm in physics-based simulations of a cart-pole system aiming to maintain the pole upright despite inaccurate model parameters.</description>

      <title>Topological Graph Simplification Solutions to the Street Intersection Miscount Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00258v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Street intersection counts and densities are ubiquitous measures in transport geography and planning. However, typical street network data and typical street network analysis tools can substantially overcount them. This article explains the three main reasons why this happens and presents solutions to each. It contributes algorithms to automatically simplify spatial graphs of urban street networks -- via edge simplification and node consolidation -- resulting in faster parsimonious models and more accurate network measures like intersection counts and densities, street segment lengths, and node degrees. These algorithms' information compression improves downstream graph analytics' memory and runtime efficiency, boosting analytical tractability without loss of model fidelity. Finally, this article validates these algorithms and empirically assesses intersection count biases worldwide to demonstrate the problem's widespread prevalence. Without consolidation, traditional methods would overestimate the median urban area intersection count by 14\%. However, this bias varies drastically across regions, underscoring these algorithms' importance for consistent comparative empirical analyses.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous System Identification and Model Predictive Control with No Dynamic Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04143v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an algorithm for the simultaneous system identification and model predictive control of nonlinear systems. The algorithm has finite-time near-optimality guarantees and asymptotically converges to the optimal (non-causal) controller. Particularly, the algorithm enjoys sublinear dynamic regret, defined herein as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the unknown disturbances and system dynamics will adapt to its actions. The algorithm is self-supervised and applies to control-affine systems with unknown dynamics and disturbances that can be expressed in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Such spaces can model external disturbances and modeling errors that can even be adaptive to the system's state and control input. For example, they can model wind and wave disturbances to aerial and marine vehicles, or inaccurate model parameters such as inertia of mechanical systems. The algorithm first generates random Fourier features that are used to approximate the unknown dynamics or disturbances. Then, it employs model predictive control based on the current learned model of the unknown dynamics (or disturbances). The model of the unknown dynamics is updated online using least squares based on the data collected while controlling the system. We validate our algorithm in both hardware experiments and physics-based simulations. The simulations include (i) a cart-pole aiming to maintain the pole upright despite inaccurate model parameters, and (ii) a quadrotor aiming to track reference trajectories despite unmodeled aerodynamic drag effects. The hardware experiments include a quadrotor aiming to track a circular trajectory despite unmodeled aerodynamic drag effects, ground effects, and wind disturbances.</description>

      <title>SustainDC: Benchmarking for Sustainable Data Center Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07841v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has driven an exponential increase in computational demand, leading to massive data centers that consume significant amounts of energy and contribute to climate change. This makes sustainable data center control a priority. In this paper, we introduce SustainDC, a set of Python environments for benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for data centers (DC). SustainDC supports custom DC configurations and tasks such as workload scheduling, cooling optimization, and auxiliary battery management, with multiple agents managing these operations while accounting for the effects of each other. We evaluate various MARL algorithms on SustainDC, showing their performance across diverse DC designs, locations, weather conditions, grid carbon intensity, and workload requirements. Our results highlight significant opportunities for improvement of data center operations using MARL algorithms. Given the increasing use of DC due to AI, SustainDC provides a crucial platform for the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms essential for achieving sustainable computing and addressing other heterogeneous real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Testing CPS with Design Assumptions-Based Metamorphic Relations and Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) software is used to enforce desired behaviours on physical systems. To test the interaction between the CPS software and the system's physics, engineers provide traces of desired physical states and observe traces of the actual physical states. CPS requirements describe how closely the actual physical traces should track the desired traces. These requirements are typically defined for specific, simple input traces such as step or ramp sequences, and thus are not applicable to arbitrary inputs. This limits the availability of oracles for CPSs. Our recent work proposes an approach to testing CPS using control-theoretical design assumptions instead of requirements. This approach circumvents the oracle problem by leveraging the control-theoretical guarantees that are provided when the design assumptions are satisfied. To address the test case generation and oracle problems, researchers have proposed metamorphic testing, which is based on the study of relations across tests, i.e., metamorphic relations (MRs). In this work, we define MRs based on the design assumptions and explore combinations of these MRs using genetic programming to generate CPS test cases. This enables the generation of CPS input traces with potentially arbitrary shapes, together with associated expected output traces. We use the deviation from the expected output traces to guide the generation of input traces that falsify the MRs. Our experiment results show that the MR-falsification provides engineers with new information, helping them identify passed and failed test cases. Furthermore, we show that the generation of traces that falsify the MRs is a non-trivial problem, which is successfully addressed by our genetic search.</description>

      <title>Estimation-Aware Trajectory Optimization with Set-Valued Measurement Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, an optimization-based framework for generating estimation-aware trajectories is presented. In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.</description>

      <title>Safety with Agency: Human-Centered Safety Filter with Application to AI-Assisted Motorsports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a human-centered safety filter (HCSF) for shared autonomy that significantly enhances system safety without compromising human agency. Our HCSF is built on a neural safety value function, which we first learn scalably through black-box interactions and then use at deployment to enforce a novel state-action control barrier function (Q-CBF) safety constraint. Since this Q-CBF safety filter does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics for both synthesis and runtime safety monitoring and intervention, our method applies readily to complex, black-box shared autonomy systems. Notably, our HCSF's CBF-based interventions modify the human's actions minimally and smoothly, avoiding the abrupt, last-moment corrections delivered by many conventional safety filters. We validate our approach in a comprehensive in-person user study using Assetto Corsa-a high-fidelity car racing simulator with black-box dynamics-to assess robustness in "driving on the edge" scenarios. We compare both trajectory data and drivers' perceptions of our HCSF assistance against unassisted driving and a conventional safety filter. Experimental results show that 1) compared to having no assistance, our HCSF improves both safety and user satisfaction without compromising human agency or comfort, and 2) relative to a conventional safety filter, our proposed HCSF boosts human agency, comfort, and satisfaction while maintaining robustness.</description>

      <title>Fast Online Adaptive Neural MPC via Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16369v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven model predictive control (MPC) has demonstrated significant potential for improving robot control performance in the presence of model uncertainties. However, existing approaches often require extensive offline data collection and computationally intensive training, limiting their ability to adapt online. To address these challenges, this paper presents a fast online adaptive MPC framework that leverages neural networks integrated with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Our approach focuses on few-shot adaptation of residual dynamics - capturing the discrepancy between nominal and true system behavior - using minimal online data and gradient steps. By embedding these meta-learned residual models into a computationally efficient L4CasADi-based MPC pipeline, the proposed method enables rapid model correction, enhances predictive accuracy, and improves real-time control performance. We validate the framework through simulation studies on a Van der Pol oscillator, a Cart-Pole system, and a 2D quadrotor. Results show significant gains in adaptation speed and prediction accuracy over both nominal MPC and nominal MPC augmented with a freshly initialized neural network, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach for real-time adaptive robot control.</description>

      <title>Robotic Trail Maker Platform for Rehabilitation in Neurological Conditions: Clinical Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Patients with neurological conditions require rehabilitation to restore their motor, visual, and cognitive abilities. To meet the shortage of therapists and reduce their workload, a robotic rehabilitation platform involving the clinical trail making test is proposed. Therapists can create custom trails for each patient and the patient can trace the trails using a robotic device. The platform can track the performance of the patient and use these data to provide dynamic assistance through the robot to the patient interface. Therefore, the proposed platform not only functions as an evaluation platform, but also trains the patient in recovery. The developed platform has been validated at a rehabilitation center, with therapists and patients operating the device. It was found that patients performed poorly while using the platform compared to healthy subjects and that the assistance provided also improved performance amongst patients. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the speed of the patients was significantly enhanced with the robotic assistance. Further, neural networks are trained to classify between patients and healthy subjects and to forecast their movements using the data collected.</description>
