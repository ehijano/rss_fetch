      <title>Invertible cells in $\omega$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study coinductive invertibility of cells in weak $\omega$-categories. We use the inductive presentation of weak $\omega$-categories via an adjunction with the category of computads, and show that invertible cells are closed under all operations of $\omega$-categories. Moreover, we give a simple criterion for invertibility in computads, together with an algorithm computing the data witnessing the invertibility, including the inverse, and the cancellation data.</description>

      <title>Enriched concepts of regular logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on our previous work on enriched universal algebra, we define a notion of enriched language consisting of function and relation symbols whose arities are objects of the base of enrichment. In this context, we construct atomic formulas and define the regular fragment of enriched logic by taking conjunctions and existential quantifications of those. We then characterize enriched categories of models of regular theories as enriched injectivity classes in the enriched category of structures. These notions rely on the choice of a factorization system on the base of enrichment which will be used to interpret relation symbols and existential quantifications.</description>

      <title>The DeMorganization of a locale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2009, Caramello proved that each topos has a largest dense subtopos whose internal logic satisfies De Morgan law (also known as the law of the weak excluded middle). This finding implies that every locale has a largest dense extremally disconnected sublocale, referred to as its DeMorganization. In this paper, we take the first steps in exploring the DeMorganization in the localic context, shedding light on its geometric nature by showing that it is always a fitted sublocale and by providing a concrete description. The main result of the paper is that for any metrizable locale (without isolated points), its DeMorganization coincides with its Booleanization. This, in particular, implies that any extremally disconnected metric locale (without isolated points) must be Boolean, generalizing a well-known result for topological spaces to the localic setting.</description>

      <title>On duoidal $\infty$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.14121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A duoidal category is a category equipped with two monoidal structures in which one is (op)lax monoidal with respect to the other. In this paper we introduce duoidal $\infty$-categories which are counterparts of duoidal categories in the setting of $\infty$-categories. There are three kinds of functors between duoidal $\infty$-categories, which are called bilax, double lax, and double oplax monoidal functors. We make three formulations of $\infty$-categories of duoidal $\infty$-categories according to which functors we take. Furthermore, corresponding to the three kinds of functors, we define bimonoids, double monoids, and double comonoids in duoidal $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <title>Quotients, pure existential completions and arithmetic universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new description of Joyal's arithmetic universes through a characterization of the exact and regular completions of pure existential completions. We show that the regular and exact completions of the pure existential completion of an elementary doctrine $P$ are equivalent to the $\mathsf{reg}/\mathsf{lex}$ and $\mathsf{ex}/\mathsf{lex}$-completions, respectively, of the category of predicates of $P$. This result generalizes a previous one by the first author with F. Pasquali and G. Rosolini about doctrines equipped with Hilbert's $\epsilon$-operators. Thanks to this characterization, each arithmetic universe in the sense of Joyal can be seen as the exact completion of the pure existential completion of the doctrine of predicates of its Skolem theory. In particular, the initial arithmetic universe in the standard category of ZFC-sets turns out to be the completion with exact quotients of the doctrine of recursively enumerable predicates.</description>

      <title>Representing Knowledge and Querying Data using Double-Functorial Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Category theory offers a mathematical foundation for knowledge representation and database systems. Popular existing approaches model a database instance as a functor into the category of sets and functions, or as a 2-functor into the 2-category of sets, relations, and implications. The functional and relational models are unified by double functors into the double category of sets, functions, relations, and implications. In an accessible, example-driven style, we show that the abstract structure of a 'double category of relations' is a flexible and expressive language in which to represent knowledge, and we show how queries on data in the spirit of Codd's relational algebra are captured by double-functorial semantics.</description>

      <title>Transposing cartesian and other structure in double categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cartesian structure possessed by relations, spans, profunctors, and other such morphisms is elegantly expressed by universal properties in double categories. Though cartesian double categories were inspired in part by the older program of cartesian bicategories, the precise relationship between the double-categorical and bicategorical approaches has so far remained mysterious, except in special cases. We provide a formal connection by showing that every double category with iso-strong finite products, and in particular every cartesian equipment, has an underlying cartesian bicategory. To do so, we develop broadly applicable techniques for transposing natural transformations and adjunctions between double categories, extending a line of previous work rooted in the concepts of companions and conjoints.</description>

      <title>Enriched Grothendieck topologies under change of base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of a monoidal adjunction $F \dashv G : \mathcal{U} \leftrightarrows \mathcal{V}$ between locally finitely presentable B\'enabou cosmoi, we examine the behavior of $\mathcal{V}$-Grothendieck topologies on a $\mathcal{V}$-category $\mathcal{C}$, and that of their constituent covering sieves, under the change of enriching category $G_* : \mathcal{V}\text{-Cat} \to \mathcal{U}\text{-Cat}$ induced by $G$. We prove in particular that when $G$ is faithful and conservative, any $\mathcal{V}$-Grothendieck topology on $\mathcal{C}$ corresponds uniquely to a $\mathcal{U}$-Grothendieck topology on $G_*\mathcal{C}$, and that when $G$ is fully faithful, base change commutes with enriched sheafification in the sense of Borceux-Quinteiro.</description>
