      <title>Singular Gauduchon Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1984 Gauduchon conjectured that one can find Gauduchon metrics with prescribed Ricci curvature on all compact complex manifolds. This conjecture was settled by Sz\'ekelyhidi-Tosatti-Weinkove (TW17, TW19, STW17) by the study of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation for $(n-1)$-plurisubharmonic functions with a gradient term. In this paper we study a singular version of this conjecture. We obtain a $C^{0}$-estimate for this problem, without gradient terms, in smoothable hermitian variaties by adapting a recent technique of Guedj-Lu. We also prove the smoothness of solutions on holomorphic K\"ahler families, generalizing TW17.</description>

      <title>On the space of cone geodesics and positive paths of contactomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Often it is possible to equip the space of all cone geodesics of a strongly convex cone structure with the structure of a smooth contact manifold. This generalizes the analogous notions for the space of light rays of a Lorentzian spacetime. After reviewing these constructions on the space of cone geodesics, with a focus on the natural contact structure, we establish a correspondence between positive paths of contactomorphisms in spherical cotangent bundles and certain globally hyperbolic cone structures.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of the null energy condition to variable lower bounds on the timelike Ricci curvature for $C^2$-Lorentzian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The null energy or null convergence condition (NEC) is one of the fundamental assumptions necessary for many celebrated results from Lorentzian Geometry and Mathematical General Relativity. As such there have been several recent efforts to find a good generalization of this condition to the new setting of Lorentzian length spaces or metric measure spacetimes. One important property any such generalization should fulfill is consistency with the classical formulation for a class of spacetimes as large as possible. The purpose of this note is to show that the recent reformulation of the NEC by McCann as variable lower timelike Ricci curvature bounds (arXiv:2304.14341) remains equivalent to the classical NEC not just for smooth but even for $C^2$-metrics, where McCann's original proof needs to be modified.</description>

      <title>Ball-convex bodies and $L_p$ relative surface areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define new surface area measures for ball-convex bodies which we call $L_p$ relative surface areas. We show that those are rigid motion invariant valuations. We establish inequalities for these quantities and prove a monotonicity behavior which leads to a new notion of entropy for ball-convex bodies. We introduce a weighted ball floating body. A derivative of volume of a ball-convex body with a weighted ball floating body provides a geometric interpretation of the $L_p$ relative surface areas.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for geodesic diameter. Part II. Fine connectedness properties of varifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05955v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For varifolds whose first variation is representable by integration, we introduce the notion of indecomposability with respect to locally Lipschitzian real valued functions. Unlike indecomposability, this weaker connectedness property is inherited by varifolds associated with solutions to geometric variational problems phrased in terms of sets, $G$ chains, and immersions; yet it is strong enough for the subsequent deduction of substantial geometric consequences therefrom. Our present study is based on several further concepts for varifolds put forward in this paper: real valued functions of generalised bounded variation thereon, partitions thereof in general, partition thereof along a real valued generalised weakly differentiable function in particular, and local finiteness of decompositions.</description>

      <title>The $\sigma_{2}$-curvature equation on a compact manifold with boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first establish local $C^2$ estimates of solutions to the $\sigma_2$-curvature equation with nonlinear Neumann boundary condition. Then, under assumption that the mean curvature of a background metric is nonnegative on totally non-umbilic boundary, for dimensions three and four there exists a conformal metric having a prescribed positive $\sigma_2$-curvature and a prescribed nonnegative boundary mean curvature. The local estimates play an important role in the blow up analysis for the latter existence result.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we determine all the simply connected non-degenerate CR Lie groups, which are flat with respect to the Cartan connection: in terms of associated Lie algebras, we assert that the only Cartan flat non-degenerate CR Lie algebras are $\mathfrak{su}(2)$, $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$, $\mathfrak{aff}(\mathbb{R}) \oplus \mathbb{R}$, and $\mathfrak{h}_{2m+1}$ with its modifications, where $\mathfrak{aff}(\mathbb{R})$ is the affine Lie algebra of dimension 2 and $\mathfrak{h}_{2m+1}$ is the Heisenberg Lie algebra of dimension $2m+1$. Furthermore, we determine all the (flat and non-flat) non-degenerate CR structures on each of these Lie groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ combinatorial techniques to present an explicit formula for the coefficients in front of Chern classes involving in the Hattori-Stong integrability conditions. We also give an evenness condition for the signature of stably almost-complex manifolds in terms of Chern numbers. As an application, it can be showed that the signature of a $2n$-dimensional stably almost-complex manifold whose possibly nonzero Chern numbers being $c_n$ and $c_ic_{n-i}$ is even, which particularly rules out the existence of such structure on rational projective planes. Some other related results and remarks are also discussed in this article.</description>

      <title>Mean Curvature Flow for Isoparametric Submanifolds in Hyperbolic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean curvature flows of isoparametric submanifolds in Euclidean spaces and spheres have been studied by Liu and Terng. In particular, it was proved that such flows always have ancient solutions. This is also true for mean curvature flows of isoparametric hypersurfaces in hyperbolic spaces by a result of Reis and Tenenblat. In this paper, we study mean curvature flows of isoparametric submanifolds in hyperbolic spaces with arbitrary codimension. In particular, we will show that they always have ancient solutions and study their limiting behaviors.</description>

      <title>Weak metric structures on generalized Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper, we first study more general models, where $F$ has constant rank and is based on weak metric structures (introduced by the first author and R. Wolak), which generalize almost complex and almost contact metric $f$-contact structures. We consider generalized metric connections (i.e., linear connections preserving $G$) with totally skew-symmetric torsion (0,3)-tensor. For rank$(F)=\dim M$ and non-conformal tensor $A^2$, where $A$ is a skew-symmetric (1,1)-tensor adjoint to $F$, we apply weak almost Hermitian structures to fundamental results (by the second author and S. Ivanov) on generalized Riemannian manifolds and prove that the manifold is a weighted product of several nearly K\"ahler manifolds corresponding to eigen-distributions of $A^2$. For rank$(F)&lt;\dim M$ we apply weak $f$-structures and obtain splitting results for generalized Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>On Compact Quasi-Einstein Metrics of Constant Scalar Curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that all compact quasi-Einstein metrics of constant scalar curvature in dimension three are locally homogeneous. We accomplish this by using the equivalence of constant scalar curvature quasi-Einstein metrics $(M,g,X)$ and quasi-Einstein metrics with $X$ Killing in the compact case to make a connection to Sasakian geometry in dimension three. In higher dimensions, there are examples which are non-locally homogeneous with constant scalar curvature. Such examples were constructed by Kunduri-Lucietti as circle bundles over a compact K\"ahler-Einstein base. We then ask when compact quasi-Einstein metrics of constant scalar curvature can be constructed as circle bundles over Einstein metrics, and prove that the base must in fact be K\"ahler-Einstein, assuming a conjecture due to Goldberg. These spaces, in fact, admit one parameter families of quasi-Einstein metrics by considering the canonical variation, which we study further.</description>

      <title>Left invariant complex Finsler metrics on a complex Lie group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a left invariant complex Finsler metric $F$ on a complex Lie group. Using the technique of invariant frames, we prove the following properties for $(G,F)$. First, the metric $F$ must be a complex Berwald metric. Second, its complex spray $\chi=w^i\delta_{z^i}$ on $T^{1,0}G\backslash0$ can be extended to a holomorphic tangent field on $T^{1,0}G$. If we view $\chi$ as a real tangent field on $TG$, it coincides with the canonical bi-invariant spray structure on $G$. Third, we prove that the strongly K\"{a}hler, K\"{a}hler, and weakly K\"{a}hler properties for $F$ are equivalent. More over, $F$ is K\"{a}hler if and only if $G$ has an Abelian Lie algebra. Finally, we prove that the holomorphic sectional curvature vanishes.</description>

      <title>A Complete Characterization of Pythagorean Hodograph Preserving Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We fully characterize the mappings $\Phi$ that send every Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curve to a PH curve. We prove that in any dimension, such mappings are precisely the conformal functions whose dilation is the square of a real rational function. In the planar case, this implies (up to conjugation) that $\partial\Phi/\partial z = \Psi^{2}$, where $\Psi$ is meromorphic and satisfies $\operatorname{Res}(\Psi^{2}) = 0$ at every pole. In higher dimensions, PH preservation forces $\Phi$ to be a conformal map; for $n \ge 3$, Liouville's theorem then implies that any local diffeomorphism with this property is (anti-)M\"obius. These results subsume the previously known ``(scaled) PH-preserving'' constructions of mappings $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ and align with Ueda's conformal viewpoint on isothermal and spherical geometries. At the level of examples, we demonstrate how PH-preserving mappings relate to the construction of rational PH curves and minimal surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the natural analogues of the Brylinksi condition, Strong Lefschetz condition, and $d\delta$-lemma in Symplectic Geometry originally explored by Brylinksi, Mathieu, Yan, and Guillemin in the Symplectic Lie Algebroid case. The equivalence of the three conditions is re-established as a purely algebraic statement along with a primitive notion of the $d\delta$-lemma established by Tseng, Yau, and Ho. We then apply this algebraic theory to the desired geometric setting to show that these analogues hold, and finally provide a few classes of examples.</description>

      <title>Equations of motion for dynamical systems with angular momentum on Finsler geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article aims to derive equations of motion for dynamical systems with angular momentum on Finsler geometries. To this end, we apply Souriau's Principle of General Covariance, which is a geometrical framework to derive diffeomorphism invariant equations of motion. The equations we obtain are the generalization of that of Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) on Finsler geometries, and we give their conserved quantities which turn out to be formally identical to the Riemannian case.
  These equations share the same properties as the MPD equations, and we mention different choices possible for supplementary conditions to close this system of equations. These equations have an additional requirement, which is the choice of what defines the tangent direction of the Finsler manifold, since the velocity and momentum are not parallel in general. After choosing the momentum as the Finsler direction and to define the center of mass, we give the complete equations of motion in 3 spatial dimensions, which we find coincide to previously known equations for Finsler spinoptics, and novel equations in 4 dimensions for massive and massless dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Mass Distribution of Random Holomorphic Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we prove a central limit theorem for the mass distribution of random holomorphic sections associated with a sequence of positive line bundles endowed with $\mathscr{C}^3$ Hermitian metrics over a compact K\"{a}hler manifold. In addition, we show that almost every sequence of such random holomorphic sections exhibits quantum ergodicity in the sense of Zelditch.</description>

      <title>Geodesic nets via eigenvalue optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a connection between geodesic nets and quantum graphs optimising certain functionals from spectral theory. For surfaces, critical metrics for the normalised $k^{\mathrm{th}}$ eigenvalue of the Laplacian give rise to isometric minimal immersions to a unit sphere. In this spirit we obtain geodesic nets from optimal quantum graphs, and obstructions to the existence of critical metrics.</description>
