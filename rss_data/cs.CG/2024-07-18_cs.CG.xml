      <title>Computing the second and third systoles of a combinatorial surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a weighted, undirected graph $G$ cellularly embedded on a topological surface $S$, we describe algorithms to compute the second shortest and third shortest closed walks of $G$ that are homotopically non-trivial in $S$. Our algorithms run in $O(n^2\log n)$ time for the second shortest walk and in $O(n^3)$ time for the third shortest walk. We also show how to reduce the running time for the second shortest homotopically non-trivial closed walk to $O(n\log n)$ when both the genus and the number of boundaries are fixed.
  Our algorithms rely on a careful analysis of the configurations of the first three shortest homotopically non-trivial curves in $S$. As an intermediate step, we also describe how to compute a shortest essential arc between \emph{one} pair of vertices or between \emph{all} pairs of vertices of a given boundary component of $S$ in $O(n^2)$ time or $O(n^3)$ time, respectively.</description>

      <title>On Finding the Closest Zonotope to a Polytope in Hausdorff Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a local theory for the optimization of the Hausdorff distance between a polytope and a zonotope. To do this, we compute explicit local formulae for the Hausdorff function $d(P, -) : Z_n \to \mathbb{R}$, where $P$ is a fixed polytope and $Z_n$ is the space of rank $n$ zonotopes. This local theory is then used to provide an optimization algorithm based on subgradient descent that converges to critical points of $d(P, -)$. We also express the condition of being at a local minimum as a polyhedral feasibility condition.</description>

      <title>Anatomical basis of human sex differences in ECG identified by automated torso-cardiac three-dimensional reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background and Aims: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is routinely used for diagnosis and risk stratification following myocardial infarction (MI), though its interpretation is confounded by anatomical variability and sex differences. Women have a higher incidence of missed MI diagnosis and poorer outcomes following infarction. Sex differences in ECG biomarkers and torso-ventricular anatomy have not been well characterised, largely due to the absence of high-throughput torso reconstruction methods.
  Methods: This work presents quantification of sex differences in ECG versus anatomical biomarkers in healthy and post-MI subjects, enabled by a novel, end-to-end automated pipeline for torso-ventricular anatomical reconstruction from clinically standard cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Personalised 3D torso-ventricular reconstructions were generated for 425 post-MI subjects and 1051 healthy controls from the UK Biobank. Regression models were created relating the extracted torso-ventricular and ECG parameters.
  Results: Half the sex difference in QRS durations is explained by smaller ventricles in women both in healthy ($3.4 \pm 1.3$ms of $6.0 \pm 1.5$ms) and post-MI ($4.5 \pm 1.4$ms of $8.3 \pm 2.5$ms) subjects. Lower baseline STj amplitude in women is also associated with smaller ventricles, and more superior and posterior cardiac position. Post-MI T wave amplitude and R axis deviations are more strongly associated with a more posterior and horizontal cardiac position in women rather than electrophysiology as in men.
  Conclusion: A novel computational pipeline enables the three-dimensional reconstruction of 1476 torso-cardiac geometries of healthy and post-myocardial infarction subjects, quantification of sex and BMI-related differences and association with ECG biomarkers. Any ECG-based tool should be reviewed considering anatomical sex differences to avoid sex-biased outcomes.</description>
