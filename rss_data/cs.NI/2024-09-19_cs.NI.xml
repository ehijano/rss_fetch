      <title>Sustainable Placement with Cost Minimization in Wireless Digital Twin Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology has a high potential to satisfy different requirements of the ever-expanding new applications. Nonetheless, the DT placement in wireless digital twin networks (WDTNs) poses a significant challenge due to the conflict between unpredictable workloads and the limited capacity of edge servers. In other words, each edge server has a risk of overload when handling an excessive number of tasks or services. Overload risks can have detrimental effects on a network's sustainability, yet this aspect is often overlooked in the literature. In this paper, we aim to study the sustainability-aware DT placement problem for WDTNs from a cost minimization perspective. To this end, we formulate the DT placement-driven cost optimization problem as a chance-constrained integer programming problem. For tractability, we transform the original non-deterministic problem into a deterministic integer linear programming (ILP) problem using the sample average approximation (SAA) approach. We prove that the transformed problem remains NP-hard and thus finding a global optimal solution is very difficult. To strike a balance between time efficiency and performance guarantee, we propose an improved local search algorithm for this ILP by identifying high-quality starting states from historical search data and enhancing the search process. Numerical results show a lower cost and higher efficiency of our proposed method compared with the previous schemes.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Robust Mobile Activity Fingerprinting via Over-the-Air Control Channel in 5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 5G has undergone significant changes in its over-the-air control channel architecture compared to legacy networks, aimed at enhancing performance. These changes have unintentionally strengthened the security of control channels, reducing vulnerabilities in radio channels for attackers. However, based on our experimental results, less than 10% of Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) messages could be decoded using sniffers. We demonstrate that even with this limited data, cell scanning and targeted user mobile activity tracking are feasible. This privacy attack exposes the number of active communication channels and reveals the mobile applications and their usage time. We propose an efficient deep learning-based mobile traffic classification method that eliminates the need for manual feature extraction, enabling scalability across various applications while maintaining high performance even in scenarios with data loss. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach using both an open-source testbed and a commercial 5G testbed, demonstrating the feasibility of mobile activity fingerprinting and targeted attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to track mobile activity over-the-air using PDCCH messages.</description>

      <title>Cloudy with a Chance of Anomalies: Dynamic Graph Neural Network for Early Detection of Cloud Services' User Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the security of cloud environments is imperative for sustaining organizational growth and operational efficiency. As the ubiquity of cloud services continues to rise, the inevitability of cyber threats underscores the importance of preemptive detection. This paper introduces a pioneering time-based embedding approach for Cloud Services Graph-based Anomaly Detection (CS-GAD), utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to discern anomalous user behavior during interactions with cloud services. Our method employs a dynamic tripartite graph representation to encapsulate the evolving interactions among cloud services, users, and their activities over time. Leveraging GNN models in each time frame, our approach generates a graph embedding wherein each user is assigned a score based on their historical activity, facilitating the identification of unusual behavior. Results demonstrate a notable reduction in false positive rates (2-9%) compared to prevailing methods, coupled with a commendable true positive rate (100%). The contributions of this work encompass early detection capabilities, a low false positive rate, an innovative tripartite graph representation incorporating action types, the introduction of a new cloud services dataset featuring various user attacks, and an open-source implementation for community collaboration in advancing cloud service security.</description>

      <title>SPARQ: Efficient Entanglement Distribution and Routing in Space-Air-Ground Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a space-air-ground quantum (SPARQ) network is developed as a means for providing a seamless on-demand entanglement distribution. The node mobility in SPARQ poses significant challenges to entanglement routing. Existing quantum routing algorithms focus on stationary ground nodes and utilize link distance as an optimality metric, which is unrealistic for dynamic systems like SPARQ. Moreover, in contrast to the prior art that assumes homogeneous nodes, SPARQ encompasses heterogeneous nodes with different functionalities further complicates the entanglement distribution. To solve the entanglement routing problem, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework is proposed and trained using deep Q-network (DQN) on multiple graphs of SPARQ to account for the network dynamics. Subsequently, an entanglement distribution policy, third-party entanglement distribution (TPED), is proposed to establish entanglement between communication parties. A realistic quantum network simulator is designed for performance evaluation. Simulation results show that the TPED policy improves entanglement fidelity by 3% and reduces memory consumption by 50% compared with benchmark. The results also show that the proposed DQN algorithm improves the number of resolved teleportation requests by 39% compared with shortest path baseline and the entanglement fidelity by 2% compared with an RL algorithm that is based on long short-term memory (LSTM). It also improved entanglement fidelity by 6% and 9% compared with two state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, the entanglement fidelity is improved by 15% compared with DQN trained on a snapshot of SPARQ. Additionally, SPARQ enhances the average entanglement fidelity by 23.5% compared with existing networks spanning only space and ground layers.</description>

      <title>NL-COMM: Demonstrating Gains of Non-Linear Processing in Open-RAN Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-user multiple-input, multiple-output (MU-MIMO) designs can substantially increase wireless systems' achievable throughput and connectivity capabilities. However, existing MU-MIMO deployments typically utilize linear processing techniques that, despite their practical benefits, such as low computational complexity and easy integrability, can leave much of the available throughput and connectivity gains unexploited. They typically require many power-intensive antennas and RF chains to support a smaller number of MIMO streams, even when the transmitted information streams are of low rate. Alternatively, non-linear (NL) processing methods can maximize the capabilities of the MIMO channel. Despite their potential, traditional NL methods are challenged by high computational complexity and processing latency, making them impractical for real-time applications, especially in software-based systems envisioned for emerging Open Radio Access Networks (Open-RAN). Additionally, essential functionalities such as rate adaptation (RA) are currently unavailable for NL systems, limiting their practicality in real-world deployments. In this demo, we present the latest capabilities of our advanced NL processing framework (NL-COMM) in real-time and over-the-air, comparing them side-by-side with conventional linear processing. For the first time, NL-COMM not only meets the practical 5G-NR real-time latency requirements in pure software but also does so within a standard-compliant ecosystem. To achieve this, we significantly extended the NL-COMM algorithmic framework to support the first practical RA for NL processing. The demonstrated gains include enhanced connectivity by supporting four MIMO streams with a single base-station antenna, substantially increased throughput, and the ability to halve the number of base-station antennas without any performance loss to linear approaches.</description>

      <title>Explanation-Guided Fair Federated Learning for Transparent 6G RAN Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future zero-touch artificial intelligence (AI)-driven 6G network automation requires building trust in the AI black boxes via explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), where it is expected that AI faithfulness would be a quantifiable service-level agreement (SLA) metric along with telecommunications key performance indicators (KPIs). This entails exploiting the XAI outputs to generate transparent and unbiased deep neural networks (DNNs). Motivated by closed-loop (CL) automation and explanation-guided learning (EGL), we design an explanation-guided federated learning (EGFL) scheme to ensure trustworthy predictions by exploiting the model explanation emanating from XAI strategies during the training run time via Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence. Specifically, we predict per-slice RAN dropped traffic probability to exemplify the proposed concept while respecting fairness goals formulated in terms of the recall metric which is included as a constraint in the optimization task. Finally, the comprehensiveness score is adopted to measure and validate the faithfulness of the explanations quantitatively. Simulation results show that the proposed EGFL-JS scheme has achieved more than $50\%$ increase in terms of comprehensiveness compared to different baselines from the literature, especially the variant EGFL-KL that is based on the Kullback-Leibler Divergence. It has also improved the recall score with more than $25\%$ relatively to unconstrained-EGFL.</description>

      <title>Towards Bridging the FL Performance-Explainability Trade-Off: A Trustworthy 6G RAN Slicing Use-Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of sixth-generation (6G) networks, where diverse network slices coexist, the adoption of AI-driven zero-touch management and orchestration (MANO) becomes crucial. However, ensuring the trustworthiness of AI black-boxes in real deployments is challenging. Explainable AI (XAI) tools can play a vital role in establishing transparency among the stakeholders in the slicing ecosystem. But there is a trade-off between AI performance and explainability, posing a dilemma for trustworthy 6G network slicing because the stakeholders require both highly performing AI models for efficient resource allocation and explainable decision-making to ensure fairness, accountability, and compliance. To balance this trade off and inspired by the closed loop automation and XAI methodologies, this paper presents a novel explanation-guided in-hoc federated learning (FL) approach where a constrained resource allocation model and an explainer exchange -- in a closed loop (CL) fashion -- soft attributions of the features as well as inference predictions to achieve a transparent 6G network slicing resource management in a RAN-Edge setup under non-independent identically distributed (non-IID) datasets. In particular, we quantitatively validate the faithfulness of the explanations via the so-called attribution-based confidence metric that is included as a constraint to guide the overall training process in the run-time FL optimization task. In this respect, Integrated-Gradient (IG) as well as Input $\times$ Gradient and SHAP are used to generate the attributions for our proposed in-hoc scheme, wherefore simulation results under different methods confirm its success in tackling the performance-explainability trade-off and its superiority over the unconstrained Integrated-Gradient post-hoc FL baseline.</description>

      <title>Evolving Mobile Cloud Gaming with 5G Standalone Network Telemetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile cloud gaming places the simultaneous demands of high capacity and low latency on the wireless network, demands that Private and Metropolitan-Area Standalone 5G networks are poised to meet. However, lacking introspection into the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), cloud gaming servers are ill-poised to cope with the vagaries of the wireless last hop to a mobile client, while 5G network operators run mostly closed networks, limiting their potential for co-design with the wider internet and user applications. This paper presents Telesa, a passive, incrementally-deployable, and independently-deployable Standalone 5G network telemetry system that streams fine-grained RAN capacity, latency, and retransmission information to application servers to enable better millisecond scale, application-level decisions on offered load and bit rate adaptation than end-to-end latency measurements or end-to-end packet losses currently permit. We design, implement, and evaluate a Telesa telemetry-enhanced game streaming platform, demonstrating exact congestion-control that can better adapt game video bitrate while simultaneously controlling end-to-end latency, thus maximizing game quality of experience. Our experimental evaluation on a production 5G Standalone network demonstrates a 178-249% Quality of Experience improvement versus two state-of-the-art cloud gaming applications.</description>

      <title>Toward Explainable Reasoning in 6G: A Proof of Concept Study on Radio Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The move toward artificial intelligence (AI)-native sixth-generation (6G) networks has put more emphasis on the importance of explainability and trustworthiness in network management operations, especially for mission-critical use-cases. Such desired trust transcends traditional post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) methods to using contextual explanations for guiding the learning process in an in-hoc way. This paper proposes a novel graph reinforcement learning (GRL) framework named TANGO which relies on a symbolic subsystem. It consists of a Bayesian-graph neural network (GNN) Explainer, whose outputs, in terms of edge/node importance and uncertainty, are periodically translated to a logical GRL reward function. This adjustment is accomplished through defined symbolic reasoning rules within a Reasoner. Considering a real-world testbed proof-of-concept (PoC), a gNodeB (gNB) radio resource allocation problem is formulated, which aims to minimize under- and over-provisioning of physical resource blocks (PRBs) while penalizing decisions emanating from the uncertain and less important edge-nodes relations. Our findings reveal that the proposed in-hoc explainability solution significantly expedites convergence compared to standard GRL baseline and other benchmarks in the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) domain. The experiment evaluates performance in AI, complexity, energy consumption, robustness, network, scalability, and explainability metrics. Specifically, the results show that TANGO achieves a noteworthy accuracy of 96.39% in terms of optimal PRB allocation in inference phase, outperforming the baseline by 1.22x.</description>

      <title>Centrality-Based Node Feature Augmentation for Robust Network Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12751v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network alignment (NA) is the task of discovering node correspondences across multiple networks. Although NA methods have achieved remarkable success in a myriad of scenarios, their effectiveness is not without additional information such as prior anchor links and/or node features, which may not always be available due to privacy concerns or access restrictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose Grad-Align+, a novel NA method built upon a recent state-of-the-art NA method, the so-called Grad-Align, that gradually discovers a part of node pairs until all node pairs are found. In designing Grad-Align+, we account for how to augment node features in the sense of performing the NA task and how to design our NA method by maximally exploiting the augmented node features. To achieve this goal, Grad-Align+ consists of three key components: 1) centrality-based node feature augmentation (CNFA), 2) graph neural network (GNN)-aided embedding similarity calculation alongside the augmented node features, and 3) gradual NA with similarity calculation using aligned cross-network neighbor-pairs (ACNs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Grad-Align+ exhibits (a) the superiority over benchmark NA methods, (b) empirical validations as well as our theoretical findings to see the effectiveness of CNFA, (c) the influence of each component, (d) the robustness to network noises, and (e) the computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Protocol Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication protocols form the bedrock of our interconnected world, yet vulnerabilities within their implementations pose significant security threats. Recent developments have seen a surge in fuzzing-based research dedicated to uncovering these vulnerabilities within protocol implementations. However, there still lacks a systematic overview of protocol fuzzing for answering the essential questions such as what the unique challenges are, how existing works solve them, etc. To bridge this gap, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of related works from both academia and industry. Our study includes a detailed summary of the specific challenges in protocol fuzzing, and provides a systematic categorization and overview of existing research efforts. Furthermore, we explore and discuss potential future research directions in protocol fuzzing. This survey serves as a foundational guideline for researchers and practitioners in the field.</description>

      <title>Ten Years of ZMap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since ZMap's debut in 2013, networking and security researchers have used the open-source scanner to write hundreds of research papers that study Internet behavior. In addition, ZMap has been adopted by the security industry to build new classes of enterprise security and compliance products. Over the past decade, much of ZMap's behavior -- ranging from its pseudorandom IP generation to its packet construction -- has evolved as we have learned more about how to scan the Internet. In this work, we quantify ZMap's adoption over the ten years since its release, describe its modern behavior (and the measurements that motivated changes), and offer lessons from releasing and maintaining ZMap for future tools.</description>
