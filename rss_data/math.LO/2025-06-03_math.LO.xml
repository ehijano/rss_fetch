      <title>Definable ranks of almost real closed fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the definable rank of an ordered field, ordered abelian group and ordered set, respectively. We study the relation between the definable rank of an ordered field and the definable rank of the value group of its natural valuation. Similarly we compare the definable rank of an ordered abelian group and the value set of its natural valuation. We consider in particular the case of an almost real closed field and give conditions under which the definable ranks on the level of field, of value group and of value set coincide.</description>

      <title>When Bi-interpretability implies Synonymy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two salient notions of sameness of theories are synonymy, also known as definitional equivalence, and bi-interpretability. Of these two definitional equivalence is the strictest notion. In which cases can we infer synonymy from bi-interpretability? We study this question for the case of sequential theories. Our result is as follows. Suppose that two sequential theories are bi-interpretable and that the interpretations involved in the bi-interpretation are one-dimensional and identity preserving. Then, the theories are synonymous.
  The crucial ingredient of our proof is a version of the Schr\"oder-Bernstein theorem under very weak conditions. We think this last result has some independent interest.
  We provide an example to show that this result is optimal. There are two finitely axiomatized sequential theories that are bi-interpretable but not synonymous, where precisely one of the interpretations involved in the bi-interpretation is not identity preserving.</description>

      <title>Coalgebraic proof translations for non-wellfounded proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-wellfounded proof theory results from allowing proofs of infinite height in proof theory. To guarantee that there is no vicious infinite reasoning, it is usual to add a constraint to the possible infinite paths appearing in a proof. Among these conditions, one of the simplest is enforcing that any infinite path goes through the premise of a rule infinitely often. Systems of this kind appear for modal logics with conversely well-founded frame conditions like GL or Grz.
  In this paper, we provide a uniform method to define proof translations for such systems, guaranteeing that the condition on infinite paths is preserved. In addition, as particular instance of our method, we establish cut-elimination for a non-wellfounded system of the logic Grz. Our proof relies only on the categorical definition of corecursion via coalgebras, while an earlier proof by Savateev and Shamkanov uses ultrametric spaces and a corresponding fixed point theorem.</description>

      <title>A Topological Semantics of Dialogue: Nerve Structures and Logical Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a concise, topologically-motivated semantics for finite dialogues by mapping each utterance to an open set in a fixed semantic space, building the corresponding nerve complex of joint satisfiability, and extracting fundamental combinatorial invariants:
  1. The negative nerve, which enumerates all finite collections of utterances whose
  opens have empty intersection, providing a straightforward criterion for merging
  separate transcripts without contradiction.
  2. The global interpretation subspace, the unique minimal open in which all asserted
  utterances hold simultaneously, enabling effective enumeration of all logical
  consequences of the entire dialogue.
  3. A practical demonstration in the Wolfram Language, with algorithms for constructing
  nerves, detecting inconsistencies, and computing the global interpretation, thereby
  illustrating computational feasibility.
  Our framework is grounded in classical duality and topological semantics (Stone duality, Priestley duality, Tarski's semantics, coherence-space methods, Scott domains, topos semantics, and homotopy type theory) while drawing on recent advances in topological data analysis and dialogue-based semantics.</description>

      <title>Divisibility classes of ultrafilters and their patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A divisibility relation on ultrafilters on the set $\mathbb{N}$ of natural numbers is defined as follows: ${\cal F}\hspace{1mm}\widetilde{\mid}\hspace{1mm}{\cal G}$ if and only if every set in $\cal F$ upward closed for divisibility also belongs to $\cal G$. Previously we isolated basic classes: powers of prime ultrafilters, and described the pattern of an ultrafilter, measuring the quantity of members of each basic class dividing a given ultrafilter. In this paper we define a topology on the set of basic classes which will allow us to calculate the pattern of the limit of a $\widetilde{\mid}$-increasing chain of ultrafilters. Using this we characterize which patterns can actually appear as patterns of an ultrafilter. Defining the $=_\sim$-divisibility classes by identifying mutually divisible ultrafilters, in the respective quotient order $(\beta\mathbb{N}/=_\sim,\widetilde{\mid})$ we identify singleton classes and consider their patterns. Finally, we give a sufficient condition for a $=_\sim$-divisibility class to have an immediate predecessor.</description>

      <title>The equivariant model structure on cartesian cubical sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a constructive model of homotopy type theory in a Quillen model category that classically presents the usual homotopy theory of spaces. Our model is based on presheaves over the cartesian cube category, a well-behaved Eilenberg-Zilber category. The key innovation is an additional equivariance condition in the specification of the cubical Kan fibrations, which can be described as the pullback of an interval-based class of uniform fibrations in the category of symmetric sequences of cubical sets. The main technical results in the development of our model have been formalized in a computer proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Faithful Logic Embeddings in HOL -- Deep and Shallow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep and shallow embeddings of non-classical logics in classical higher-order logic have been explored, implemented, and used in various reasoning tools in recent years. This paper presents a method for the simultaneous deployment of deep and shallow embeddings of various degrees in classical higher-order logic. This enables flexible, interactive and automated theorem proving and counterexample finding at meta and object level, as well as automated faithfulness proofs between these logic embeddings. The method is beneficial for logic education, research and application and is illustrated here using a simple propositional modal logic. However, this approach is conceptual in nature and not limited to this simple logic context.</description>

      <title>The algebraic internal groupoid model of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the model structure on the category $\mathbf{Cat}(\mathcal{E})$ of internal categories studied by Everaert, Kieboom and Van der Linden to an algebraic model structure. Moreover, we show that it restricts to the category of internal groupoids. We show that in this case, the algebraic weak factorisation system that consists of the algebraic trivial cofibrations and algebraic fibrations forms a model of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory. Taking $\mathcal{E} = \mathbf{Set}$ and forgetting the algebraic structure, this recovers Hofmann and Streicher's groupoid model of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory. Finally, we are able to provide axioms on a $(2,1)$-category which ensure that it gives an algebraic model of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory. To do this, we give necessary and sufficient axioms on a $2$-category $\mathcal{K}$ such that $\mathcal{K} \simeq \mathbf{Cat}(\mathcal{E})$ in which $\mathcal{E}$ is a locally cartesian closed locos with coequalisers, a result which we believe is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On Big Ramsey degrees of universal $\omega$-edge-labeled hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the big Ramsey degrees of every countable universal $u$-uniform $\omega$-edge-labeled hypergraph are infinite for every $u\geq 2$. Together with a recent result of Braunfeld, Chodounsk\'y, de Rancourt, Hubi\v{c}ka, Kawach, and Kone\v{c}n\'y this finishes full characterisation of unrestricted relational structures with finite big Ramsey degrees.</description>

      <title>Counting big Ramsey degrees of the homogeneous and universal $K_4$-free graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Big Ramsey degrees of Fra\"iss\'e limits of finitely constrained free amalgamation classes in finite binary languages have been recently fully characterised by Balko, Chodounsk\'y, Dobrinen, Hubi\v{c}ka, Kone\v{c}n\'y, Vena, and Zucker. A special case of this characterisation is the universal homogeneous $K_4$-free graph. We give a self-contained and relatively compact presentation of this case and compute the actual big Ramsey degrees of small graphs.</description>
