      <title>Fixed-Priority and EDF Schedules for ROS2 Graphs on Uniprocessor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses limitations of current scheduling methods in the Robot Operating System (ROS)2, focusing on scheduling tasks beyond simple chains and analyzing arbitrary Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). While previous research has focused mostly on chain-based scheduling with ad-hoc response time analyses, we propose a novel approach using the events executor to implement fixed-job-level-priority schedulers for arbitrary ROS2 graphs on uniprocessor systems. We demonstrate that ROS 2 applications can be abstracted as forests of trees, enabling the mapping of ROS 2 applications to traditional real-time DAG task models. Our usage of the events executor requires a special implementation of the events queue and a communication middleware that supports LIFO-ordered message delivery, features not yet standard in ROS2. We show that our implementation generates the same schedules as a conventional fixed-priority DAG task scheduler, in spite of lacking access to the precedence information that usually is required. This further closes the gap between established real-time systems theory and ROS2 scheduling analyses.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy and Controllable Professional Knowledge Utilization in Large Language Models with TEE-GPU Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future improvements in large language model (LLM) services increasingly hinge on access to high-value professional knowledge rather than more generic web data. However, the data providers of this knowledge face a skewed tradeoff between income and risk: they receive little share of downstream value yet retain copyright and privacy liability, making them reluctant to contribute their assets to LLM services. Existing techniques do not offer a trustworthy and controllable way to use professional knowledge, because they keep providers in the dark and combine knowledge parameters with the underlying LLM backbone.
  In this paper, we present PKUS, the Professional Knowledge Utilization System, which treats professional knowledge as a first-class, separable artifact. PKUS keeps the backbone model on GPUs and encodes each provider's contribution as a compact adapter that executes only inside an attested Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). A hardware-rooted lifecycle protocol, adapter pruning, multi-provider aggregation, and split-execution scheduling together make this design practical at serving time. On SST-2, MNLI, and SQuAD with GPT-2 Large and Llama-3.2-1B, PKUS preserves model utility, matching the accuracy and F1 of full fine-tuning and plain LoRA, while achieving the lowest per-request latency with 8.1-11.9x speedup over CPU-only TEE inference and naive CPU-GPU co-execution.</description>
