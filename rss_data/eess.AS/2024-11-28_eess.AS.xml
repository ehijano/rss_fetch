      <title>Disentangled-Transformer: An Explainable End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition Model with Speech Content-Context Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end transformer-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often capture multiple speech traits in their learned representations that are highly entangled, leading to a lack of interpretability. In this study, we propose the explainable Disentangled-Transformer, which disentangles the internal representations into sub-embeddings with explicit content and speaker traits based on varying temporal resolutions. Experimental results show that the proposed Disentangled-Transformer produces a clear speaker identity, separated from the speech content, for speaker diarization while improving ASR performance.</description>

      <title>Speech Separation using Neural Audio Codecs with Embedding Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs have revolutionized audio processing by enabling speech tasks to be performed on highly compressed representations. Recent work has shown that speech separation can be achieved within these compressed domains, offering faster training and reduced inference costs. However, current approaches still rely on waveform-based loss functions, necessitating unnecessary decoding steps during training. We propose a novel embedding loss for neural audio codec-based speech separation that operates directly on compressed audio representations, eliminating the need for decoding during training. To validate our approach, we conduct comprehensive evaluations using both objective metrics and perceptual assessment techniques, including intrusive and non-intrusive methods. Our results demonstrate that embedding loss can be used to train codec-based speech separation models with a 2x improvement in training speed and computational cost while achieving better DNSMOS and STOI performance on the WSJ0-2mix dataset across 3 different pre-trained codecs.</description>

      <title>JPPO: Joint Power and Prompt Optimization for Accelerated Large Language Model Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, leading to their increasing deployment in wireless networks for a wide variety of user services. However, the growing longer prompt setting highlights the crucial issue of computational resource demands and huge communication load. To address this challenge, we propose Joint Power and Prompt Optimization (JPPO), a framework that combines Small Language Model (SLM)-based prompt compression with wireless power allocation optimization. By deploying SLM at user devices for prompt compression and employing Deep Reinforcement Learning for joint optimization of compression ratio and transmission power, JPPO effectively balances service quality with resource efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves high service fidelity and low bit error rates while optimizing power usage in wireless LLM services. The system reduces response time by about 17%, with the improvement varying based on the length of the original prompt.</description>

      <title>SALMONN-omni: A Codec-free LLM for Full-duplex Speech Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-duplex multimodal large language models (LLMs) provide a unified framework for addressing diverse speech understanding and generation tasks, enabling more natural and seamless human-machine conversations. Unlike traditional modularised conversational AI systems, which separate speech recognition, understanding, and text-to-speech generation into distinct components, multimodal LLMs operate as single end-to-end models. This streamlined design eliminates error propagation across components and fully leverages the rich non-verbal information embedded in input speech signals. We introduce SALMONN-omni, a codec-free, full-duplex speech understanding and generation model capable of simultaneously listening to its own generated speech and background sounds while speaking. To support this capability, we propose a novel duplex spoken dialogue framework incorporating a ``thinking'' mechanism that facilitates asynchronous text and speech generation relying on embeddings instead of codecs (quantized speech and audio tokens). Experimental results demonstrate SALMONN-omni's versatility across a broad range of streaming speech tasks, including speech recognition, speech enhancement, and spoken question answering. Additionally, SALMONN-omni excels at managing turn-taking, barge-in, and echo cancellation scenarios, establishing its potential as a robust prototype for full-duplex conversational AI systems. To the best of our knowledge, SALMONN-omni is the first codec-free model of its kind. A full technical report along with model checkpoints will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Towards Improved Objective Perceptual Audio Quality Assessment -- Part 1: A Novel Data-Driven Cognitive Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient audio quality assessment is vital for streamlining audio codec development. Objective assessment tools have been developed over time to algorithmically predict quality ratings from subjective assessments, the gold standard for quality judgment. Many of these tools use perceptual auditory models to extract audio features that are mapped to a basic audio quality score prediction using machine learning algorithms and subjective scores as training data. However, existing tools struggle with generalization in quality prediction, especially when faced with unknown signal and distortion types. This is particularly evident in the presence of signals coded using non-waveform-preserving parametric techniques. Addressing these challenges, this two-part work proposes extensions to the Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ - ITU-R BS.1387-1) recommendation. Part 1 focuses on increasing generalization, while Part 2 targets accurate spatial audio quality measurement in audio coding.
  To enhance prediction generalization, this paper (Part 1) introduces a novel machine learning approach that uses subjective data to model cognitive aspects of audio quality perception. The proposed method models the perceived severity of audible distortions by adaptively weighting different distortion metrics. The weights are determined using an interaction cost function that captures relationships between distortion salience and cognitive effects. Compared to other machine learning methods and established tools, the proposed architecture achieves higher prediction accuracy on large databases of previously unseen subjective quality scores. The perceptually-motivated model offers a more manageable alternative to general-purpose machine learning algorithms, allowing potential extensions and improvements to multi-dimensional quality measurement without complete retraining.</description>

      <title>Wearable intelligent throat enables natural speech in stroke patients with dysarthria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable silent speech systems hold significant potential for restoring communication in patients with speech impairments. However, seamless, coherent speech remains elusive, and clinical efficacy is still unproven. Here, we present an AI-driven intelligent throat (IT) system that integrates throat muscle vibrations and carotid pulse signal sensors with large language model (LLM) processing to enable fluent, emotionally expressive communication. The system utilizes ultrasensitive textile strain sensors to capture high-quality signals from the neck area and supports token-level processing for real-time, continuous speech decoding, enabling seamless, delay-free communication. In tests with five stroke patients with dysarthria, IT's LLM agents intelligently corrected token errors and enriched sentence-level emotional and logical coherence, achieving low error rates (4.2% word error rate, 2.9% sentence error rate) and a 55% increase in user satisfaction. This work establishes a portable, intuitive communication platform for patients with dysarthria with the potential to be applied broadly across different neurological conditions and in multi-language support systems.</description>

      <title>Novel Class Discovery for Open Set Raga Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of Raga classification in Indian Art Music (IAM) is constrained by the limited availability of labeled datasets, resulting in many Ragas being unrepresented during the training of machine learning models. Traditional Raga classification methods rely on supervised learning, and assume that for a test audio to be classified by a Raga classification model, it must have been represented in the training data, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios where novel, unseen Ragas may appear. To address this limitation, we propose a method based on Novel Class Discovery (NCD) to detect and classify previously unseen Ragas. Our approach utilizes a feature extractor trained in a supervised manner to generate embeddings, which are then employed within a contrastive learning framework for self-supervised training, enabling the identification of previously unseen Raga classes. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately detect audio samples corresponding to these novel Ragas, offering a robust solution for utilizing the vast amount of unlabeled music data available online. This approach reduces the need for manual labeling while expanding the repertoire of recognized Ragas, and other music data in Music Information Retrieval (MIR).</description>

      <title>Comparison of Tiny Machine Learning Techniques for Embedded Acoustic Emission Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper compares machine learning approaches with different input data formats for the classification of acoustic emission (AE) signals. AE signals are a promising monitoring technique in many structural health monitoring applications. Machine learning has been demonstrated as an effective data analysis method, classifying different AE signals according to the damage mechanism they represent. These classifications can be performed based on the entire AE waveform or specific features that have been extracted from it. However, it is currently unknown which of these approaches is preferred. With the goal of model deployment on resource-constrained embedded Internet of Things (IoT) systems, this work evaluates and compares both approaches in terms of classification accuracy, memory requirement, processing time, and energy consumption. To accomplish this, features are extracted and carefully selected, neural network models are designed and optimized for each input data scenario, and the models are deployed on a low-power IoT node. The comparative analysis reveals that all models can achieve high classification accuracies of over 99\%, but that embedded feature extraction is computationally expensive. Consequently, models utilizing the raw AE signal as input have the fastest processing speed and thus the lowest energy consumption, which comes at the cost of a larger memory requirement.</description>

      <title>Music2Fail: Transfer Music to Failed Recorder Style</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of music style transfer is to convert a music performance by one instrument into another while keeping the musical contents unchanged. In this paper, we investigate another style transfer scenario called ``failed-music style transfer''. Unlike the usual music style transfer where the content remains the same and only the instrumental characteristics are changed, this scenario seeks to transfer the music from the source instrument to the target instrument which is deliberately performed off-pitch. Our work attempts to transfer normally played music into off-pitch recorder music, which we call ``failed-style recorder'', and study the results of the conversion. To carry out this work, we have also proposed a dataset of failed-style recorders for this task, called ``FR109 Dataset''. Such an experiment explores the music style transfer task in a more expressive setting, as the generated audio should sound like an ``off-pitch recorder'' while maintaining a certain degree of naturalness.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Discrete Representations and Self-Augmented Representations for Multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models have shown exceptional capabilities across various speech-processing tasks. Continuous SSL representations are effective but suffer from high computational and storage demands. On the other hand, discrete SSL representations, although with degraded performance, reduce transmission and storage costs, and improve input sequence efficiency through de-duplication and subword-modeling. To boost the performance of discrete representations for ASR, we introduce a novel fusion mechanism that integrates two discrete representations. The fusion mechanism preserves all the benefits of discrete representation while enhancing the model's performance by integrating complementary information. Additionally, we explore "self-augmented'' discrete representations, which apply transformations to a single continuous SSL representation, eliminating the fusion mechanism's dependency on multiple SSL models and further decreasing its inference costs. Experimental results on benchmarks, including LibriSpeech and ML-SUPERB, indicate up to 19% and 24% relative character error rate improvement compared with the non-fusion baseline, validating the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>MSA-ASR: Efficient Multilingual Speaker Attribution with frozen ASR Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (SA-ASR) aims to transcribe speech while assigning transcripts to the corresponding speakers accurately. Existing methods often rely on complex modular systems or require extensive fine-tuning of joint modules, limiting their adaptability and general efficiency. This paper introduces a novel approach, leveraging a frozen multilingual ASR model to incorporate speaker attribution into the transcriptions, using only standard monolingual ASR datasets. Our method involves training a speaker module to predict speaker embeddings based on weak labels without requiring additional ASR model modifications. Despite being trained exclusively with non-overlapping monolingual data, our approach effectively extracts speaker attributes across diverse multilingual datasets, including those with overlapping speech. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance compared to strong baselines, highlighting the model's robustness and potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>How to Learn a New Language? An Efficient Solution for Self-Supervised Learning Models Unseen Languages Adaption in Low-Resource Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The utilization of speech Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models achieves impressive performance on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, in low-resource language ASR, they encounter the domain mismatch problem between pre-trained and low-resource languages. Typical solutions like fine-tuning the SSL model suffer from high computation costs while using frozen SSL models as feature extractors comes with poor performance. To handle these issues, we extend a conventional efficient fine-tuning scheme based on the adapter. We add an extra intermediate adaptation to warm up the adapter and downstream model initialization. Remarkably, we update only 1-5% of the total model parameters to achieve the adaptation. Experimental results on the ML-SUPERB dataset show that our solution outperforms conventional efficient fine-tuning. It achieves up to a 28% relative improvement in the Character/Phoneme error rate when adapting to unseen languages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems poses a challenge, especially with the need to avoid catastrophic forgetting while maintaining performance on previously learned tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging the machine speech chain framework to enable continual learning in ASR using gradient episodic memory (GEM). By incorporating a text-to-speech (TTS) component within the machine speech chain, we support the replay mechanism essential for GEM, allowing the ASR model to learn new tasks sequentially without significant performance degradation on earlier tasks. Our experiments, conducted on the LJ Speech dataset, demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional fine-tuning and multitask learning approaches, achieving a substantial error rate reduction while maintaining high performance across varying noise conditions. We showed the potential of our semi-supervised machine speech chain approach for effective and efficient continual learning in speech recognition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous or conversational multilingual speech presents many challenges for state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In this work, we present a new technique AMPS that augments a multilingual multimodal ASR system with paraphrase-based supervision for improved conversational ASR in multiple languages, including Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam, Kannada, and Nyanja. We use paraphrases of the reference transcriptions as additional supervision while training the multimodal ASR model and selectively invoke this paraphrase objective for utterances with poor ASR performance. Using AMPS with a state-of-the-art multimodal model SeamlessM4T, we obtain significant relative reductions in word error rates (WERs) of up to 5%. We present detailed analyses of our system using both objective and human evaluation metrics.</description>

Abstract: Autoregressive models are typically applied to sequences of discrete tokens, but recent research indicates that generating sequences of continuous embeddings in an autoregressive manner is also feasible. However, such Continuous Autoregressive Models (CAMs) can suffer from a decline in generation quality over extended sequences due to error accumulation during inference. We introduce a novel method to address this issue by injecting random noise into the input embeddings during training. This procedure makes the model robust against varying error levels at inference. We further reduce error accumulation through an inference procedure that introduces low-level noise. Experiments on musical audio generation show that CAM substantially outperforms existing autoregressive and non-autoregressive approaches while preserving audio quality over extended sequences. This work paves the way for generating continuous embeddings in a purely autoregressive setting, opening new possibilities for real-time and interactive generative applications.</description>

      <title>Multiple Choice Learning for Efficient Speech Separation with Many Speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training speech separation models in the supervised setting raises a permutation problem: finding the best assignation between the model predictions and the ground truth separated signals. This inherently ambiguous task is customarily solved using Permutation Invariant Training (PIT). In this article, we instead consider using the Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) framework, which was originally introduced to tackle ambiguous tasks. We demonstrate experimentally on the popular WSJ0-mix and LibriMix benchmarks that MCL matches the performances of PIT, while being computationally advantageous. This opens the door to a promising research direction, as MCL can be naturally extended to handle a variable number of speakers, or to tackle speech separation in the unsupervised setting.</description>

      <title>Performance Improvement of Language-Queried Audio Source Separation Based on Caption Augmentation From Large Language Models for DCASE Challenge 2024 Task 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a prompt-engineering-based text-augmentation approach applied to a language-queried audio source separation (LASS) task. To enhance the performance of LASS, the proposed approach utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate multiple captions corresponding to each sentence of the training dataset. To this end, we first perform experiments to identify the most effective prompts for caption augmentation with a smaller number of captions. A LASS model trained with these augmented captions demonstrates improved performance on the DCASE 2024 Task 9 validation set compared to that trained without augmentation. This study highlights the effectiveness of LLM-based caption augmentation in advancing language-queried audio source separation.</description>

      <title>Codec Does Matter: Exploring the Semantic Shortcoming of Codec for Audio Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in audio generation have been significantly propelled by the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The existing research on audio LLM has primarily focused on enhancing the architecture and scale of audio language models, as well as leveraging larger datasets, and generally, acoustic codecs, such as EnCodec, are used for audio tokenization. However, these codecs were originally designed for audio compression, which may lead to suboptimal performance in the context of audio LLM. Our research aims to address the shortcomings of current audio LLM codecs, particularly their challenges in maintaining semantic integrity in generated audio. For instance, existing methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text transcriptions, often suffer from content inaccuracies and elevated word error rates (WER) due to semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, resulting in word skipping and errors. To overcome these issues, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach called X-Codec. X-Codec incorporates semantic features from a pre-trained semantic encoder before the Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) stage and introduces a semantic reconstruction loss after RVQ. By enhancing the semantic ability of the codec, X-Codec significantly reduces WER in speech synthesis tasks and extends these benefits to non-speech applications, including music and sound generation. Our experiments in text-to-speech, music continuation, and text-to-sound tasks demonstrate that integrating semantic information substantially improves the overall performance of language models in audio generation. Our code and demo are available (Demo: https://x-codec-audio.github.io Code: https://github.com/zhenye234/xcodec)</description>

      <title>SWIM: Short-Window CNN Integrated with Mamba for EEG-Based Auditory Spatial Attention Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In complex auditory environments, the human auditory system possesses the remarkable ability to focus on a specific speaker while disregarding others. In this study, a new model named SWIM, a short-window convolution neural network (CNN) integrated with Mamba, is proposed for identifying the locus of auditory attention (left or right) from electroencephalography (EEG) signals without relying on speech envelopes. SWIM consists of two parts. The first is a short-window CNN (SW$_\text{CNN}$), which acts as a short-term EEG feature extractor and achieves a final accuracy of 84.9% in the leave-one-speaker-out setup on the widely used KUL dataset. This improvement is due to the use of an improved CNN structure, data augmentation, multitask training, and model combination. The second part, Mamba, is a sequence model first applied to auditory spatial attention decoding to leverage the long-term dependency from previous SW$_\text{CNN}$ time steps. By joint training SW$_\text{CNN}$ and Mamba, the proposed SWIM structure uses both short-term and long-term information and achieves an accuracy of 86.2%, which reduces the classification errors by a relative 31.0% compared to the previous state-of-the-art result. The source code is available at https://github.com/windowso/SWIM-ASAD.</description>

      <title>DCF-DS: Deep Cascade Fusion of Diarization and Separation for Speech Recognition under Realistic Single-Channel Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a single-channel Deep Cascade Fusion of Diarization and Separation (DCF-DS) framework for back-end speech recognition, combining neural speaker diarization (NSD) and speech separation (SS). First, we sequentially integrate the NSD and SS modules within a joint training framework, enabling the separation module to leverage speaker time boundaries from the diarization module effectively. Then, to complement DCF-DS training, we introduce a window-level decoding scheme that allows the DCF-DS framework to handle the sparse data convergence instability (SDCI) problem. We also explore using an NSD system trained on real datasets to provide more accurate speaker boundaries during decoding. Additionally, we incorporate an optional multi-input multi-output speech enhancement module (MIMO-SE) within the DCF-DS framework, which offers further performance gains. Finally, we enhance diarization results by re-clustering DCF-DS outputs, improving ASR accuracy. By incorporating the DCF-DS method, we achieved first place in the realistic single-channel track of the CHiME-8 NOTSOFAR-1 challenge. We also perform the evaluation on the open LibriCSS dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art single-channel speech recognition performance.</description>

      <title>CIF-T: A Novel CIF-based Transducer Architecture for Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14132v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: RNN-T models are widely used in ASR, which rely on the RNN-T loss to achieve length alignment between input audio and target sequence. However, the implementation complexity and the alignment-based optimization target of RNN-T loss lead to computational redundancy and a reduced role for predictor network, respectively. In this paper, we propose a novel model named CIF-Transducer (CIF-T) which incorporates the Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) mechanism with the RNN-T model to achieve efficient alignment. In this way, the RNN-T loss is abandoned, thus bringing a computational reduction and allowing the predictor network a more significant role. We also introduce Funnel-CIF, Context Blocks, Unified Gating and Bilinear Pooling joint network, and auxiliary training strategy to further improve performance. Experiments on the 178-hour AISHELL-1 and 10000-hour WenetSpeech datasets show that CIF-T achieves state-of-the-art results with lower computational overhead compared to RNN-T models.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Laryngoscopic Video Analysis for Assisted Diagnosis of Vocal Fold Paralysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Multimodal Laryngoscopic Video Analyzing System (MLVAS), a novel system that leverages both audio and video data to automatically extract key segments and metrics from raw laryngeal videostroboscopic videos for assisted clinical assessment. The system integrates video-based glottis detection with an audio keyword spotting method to analyze both video and audio data, identifying patient vocalizations and refining video highlights to ensure optimal inspection of vocal fold movements. Additionally, MLVAS features an advanced strobing video extraction module that specifically identifies strobing frames from laryngeal videostroboscopy by analyzing hue, saturation, and value fluctuations. Beyond key segment extraction, MLVAS provides effective metrics for Vocal Fold Paralysis (VFP) detection. It employs a novel two-stage glottis segmentation process using a U-Net for initial segmentation, followed by a diffusion-based refinement to reduce false positives, providing better segmentation masks for downstream tasks. MLVAS estimates the vibration dynamics for both left and right vocal folds from the segmented glottis masks to detect unilateral VFP by measuring the angle deviation with the estimated glottal midline. Comparing the variance between left's and right's dynamics, the system effectively distinguishes between left and right VFP. We conducted several ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each module in the proposed MLVAS. The experimental results on a public segmentation dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed segmentation module. In addition, VFP classification results on a real-world clinic dataset demonstrate MLVAS's ability of providing reliable and objective metrics as well as visualization for assisted clinical diagnosis.</description>

      <title>A Suite for Acoustic Language Model Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech language models have recently demonstrated great potential as universal speech processing systems. Such models have the ability to model the rich acoustic information existing in audio signals, beyond spoken content, such as emotion, background noise, etc. Despite this, evaluation benchmarks which evaluate awareness to a wide range of acoustic aspects, are lacking. To help bridge this gap, we introduce SALMon, a novel evaluation suite encompassing background noise, emotion, speaker identity and room impulse response. The proposed benchmarks both evaluate the consistency of the inspected element and how much it matches the spoken text. We follow a modelling based approach, measuring whether a model gives correct samples higher scores than incorrect ones. This approach makes the benchmark fast to compute even for large models. We evaluated several speech language models on SALMon, thus highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each evaluated method. We make the code and data publicly available at https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/salmon/ .</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Music Separation and Generation Using Multi-Track Latent Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in both music generation and music source separation tasks. Although in early stages, a trend is emerging towards integrating these tasks into a single framework, as both involve generating musically aligned parts and can be seen as facets of the same generative process. In this work, we introduce a latent diffusion-based multi-track generation model capable of both source separation and multi-track music synthesis by learning the joint probability distribution of tracks sharing a musical context. Our model also enables arrangement generation by creating any subset of tracks given the others. We trained our model on the Slakh2100 dataset, compared it with an existing simultaneous generation and separation model, and observed significant improvements across objective metrics for source separation, music, and arrangement generation tasks. Sound examples are available at https://msg-ld.github.io/.</description>

To construct OpenMU-Bench, we leveraged existing datasets and bootstrapped new annotations. OpenMU-Bench also broadens the scope of music understanding by including lyrics understanding and music tool usage. Using OpenMU-Bench, we trained our music understanding model, OpenMU, with extensive ablations, demonstrating that OpenMU outperforms baseline models such as MU-Llama.

      <title>CHORDONOMICON: A Dataset of 666,000 Songs and their Chord Progressions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chord progressions encapsulate important information about music, pertaining to its structure and conveyed emotions. They serve as the backbone of musical composition, and in many cases, they are the sole information required for a musician to play along and follow the music. Despite their importance, chord progressions as a data domain remain underexplored. There is a lack of large-scale datasets suitable for deep learning applications, and limited research exploring chord progressions as an input modality. In this work, we present Chordonomicon, a dataset of over 666,000 songs and their chord progressions, annotated with structural parts, genre, and release date - created by scraping various sources of user-generated progressions and associated metadata. We demonstrate the practical utility of the Chordonomicon dataset for classification and generation tasks, and discuss its potential to provide valuable insights to the research community. Chord progressions are unique in their ability to be represented in multiple formats (e.g. text, graph) and the wealth of information chords convey in given contexts, such as their harmonic function . These characteristics make the Chordonomicon an ideal testbed for exploring advanced machine learning techniques, including transformers, graph machine learning, and hybrid systems that combine knowledge representation and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Inter-linguistic Phonetic Composition (IPC): A Theoretical and Computational Approach to Enhance Second Language Pronunciation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learners of a second language (L2) often unconsciously substitute unfamiliar L2 phonemes with similar phonemes from their native language (L1), even though native speakers of the L2 perceive these sounds as distinct and non-interchangeable. This phonemic substitution leads to deviations from the standard phonological patterns of the L2, creating challenges for learners in acquiring accurate L2 pronunciation. To address this, we propose Inter-linguistic Phonetic Composition (IPC), a novel computational method designed to minimize incorrect phonological transfer by reconstructing L2 phonemes as composite sounds derived from multiple L1 phonemes. Tests with two automatic speech recognition models demonstrated that when L2 speakers produced IPC-generated composite sounds, the recognition rate of target L2 phonemes improved by 20% compared to when their pronunciation was influenced by original phonological transfer patterns. The improvement was observed within a relatively shorter time frame, demonstrating rapid acquisition of the composite sound.</description>
