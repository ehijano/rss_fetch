      <title>Ultracool dwarf Science with MachIne LEarning (USMILE). I. Scalable Tree-Based Models for Photometric Spectral Classification and New Discoveries from LSST Data Preview 1 and Euclid Quick Data Release 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Ultracool dwarf Science with MachIne LEarning (USMILE), a program developing machine-learning tools for the discovery and characterization of ultracool dwarfs. We introduce USMILE Avocado, a spectral classification framework that uses broadband photometry from wide-field surveys -- Rubin Observatory LSST Data Preview 1, VISTA Hemisphere Survey, and CatWISE -- as input features. The framework has two gradient-boosted decision-tree models scalable to the massive data volumes of modern surveys: the classifier, which distinguishes ultracool dwarfs from stellar/extragalactic contaminants, and the regressor, which predicts spectral types. A key strength is its ability to natively handle missing photometric features, whereas earlier machine-learning approaches required complete multi-band detections or relied on imputation, thereby excluding genuine ultracool dwarfs or introducing bias. Trained on an augmented labeled dataset of &gt;2 million sources built from known ultracool dwarfs, reddened early-type stars, and quasars, the models achieve strong performance: the classifier attains an ROC AUC of 0.976 and an F1 score of 0.92, while the regressor yields a mean-squared error of 0.88 subtypes. Applying these models, we carried out the first ultracool dwarf search with LSST DP1, cross-matched against VHS and CatWISE. Crucially, Euclid Quick Data Release 1 provided near-IR spectra for hundreds of candidates, enabling a rare, large-scale external spectroscopic validation. This confirmed 15 M6--L2 discoveries, verified USMILE performance, and clarified regimes where USMILE predictions are most reliable. Building on these insights, we identified 25 additional M6--L9 photometric candidates. These demonstrate the effectiveness of machine-learning methods in the data-rich era of wide-field surveys, highlighting the synergy between LSST and Euclid in expanding the ultracool dwarf census.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star-Main Sequence Collisions Robustly Form Dynamically Stable Thorne-\.Zytkow Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thorne-\.Zytkow Objects (T\.ZOs) are hypothetical hybrid stars with a neutron star at the core of a large, diffuse envelope. (T\.ZOs) may be formed when a newly formed neutron star that is kicked by its supernova collides with its main-sequence companion. Using a moving-mesh hydrodynamics solver integrated into the parallel-code Charm N-body GrAvity solver, we demonstrate that these ``impact scenario'' formation processes robustly form (T\.ZOs) for periastron distances less than one stellar radius. These (T\.ZOs) are dynamically stable and they can serve as initial models for further evolutionary studies.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Future of Gaia Neutron Star-Main Sequence Binaries: From Eccentric Orbits to Millisecond Pulsar-White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the evolution of 21 Gaia neutron star (NS)-main-sequence binaries (orbital period $P_{\mathrm{orb}}\sim200$--$1000$ days, eccentricity $e\gtrsim0.2$) using binary evolution with \texttt{MESA}. We examine eccentric mass transfer and models assuming prior circularization. All systems end as NS-white dwarf (WD) binaries, but transfer modes yield distinct outcomes. Under eccentric transfer, binaries are driven to higher $e$, forming orbits with $e\gtrsim0.6$ and $P_{\rm orb}\sim1000$-$4000$ days. Periastron bursts are brief ($\lesssim10^6$ yr), transfer only a few $\times10^{-2}$ M$_\odot$, and produce mildly recycled pulsars ($P_{\mathrm{spin}}\gtrsim50$ ms) with low-mass He WDs. Artificially circularized transfer gives $P_{\rm orb}\sim200$-$2000$ days, lasts $\sim10^7$ yr, and allows NSs to accrete $\sim0.1$ M$_\odot$, forming fully recycled MSPs ($P_{\mathrm{spin}}\sim$ few-30 ms) with CO WDs. Allowing super-Eddington accretion up to $100\times$ the canonical rate makes even eccentric systems efficient MSP producers, though torque coupling remains uncertain. Using an adaptive, field-dependent magnetic-field decay timescale, we find MSPs stay radio-active over Gyr spans. Gaia systems undergoing stable mass transfer remain wide and fail to match the Galactic MSP-WD population, where most, nearly circular systems have $P_{\rm orb}\lesssim100$ days. Binaries with different mass ratios and initial configurations -- likely leading to unstable mass transfer -- are needed to reproduce the observed MSP-WD distribution.</description>

      <title>One century data of {\tau} CMa: a (2+1)+1 system with a short-period overcontact binary and an eccentric intermediate orbit with probably no apsidal motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {\tau} Canis Majoris (CMa) is an intriguing system that has captured astronomers' attention for more than a century. The two main components Aa and Ab are two evolved O stars on a 350 years orbit. Aa is itself a SB1 with a 155-days period and a 0.3 eccentricity. Since Hipparcos, we know that a 1.28-days period eclipsing binary (EB) is hidden somewhere in Aa or Ab, but nowhere else. Our recent analysis finally disentangles the system. We calculated the visual Aa-Ab orbit from AstraLux imaging. We detected the SB2 nature of Aa based on STIS spectra, the companion of the O star (Aa1) being a B+B binary (Aa2 = Aa2a + Aa2b). Multiple lines of evidence point towards Aa2 being the EB: time delays in the eclipsing orbit detected by TESS, high mass for Aa2 from SB1 from constraints from the orbit of Aa1, and a lack of radial-velocity motion of Ab synchronised with the eclipsing orbit. This remains as a tentative conclusion pending further analysis. We detect secular changes in the SB1 orbit of Aa1 on a baseline longer than a century. At this stage, the effect is most likely caused by the change in velocity of the Aa center of mass due to the Aa-Ab visual orbit. Apsidal motion is most probably not the culprit.</description>

      <title>Production of radioactive $^{22}$Na in core-collapse supernovae: the Ne-E(L) component in presolar grains and its possible consequences on supernova observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presolar graphite grains carry the isotopic signatures of their parent stars. A significant fraction of presolar graphites shows isotopic abundance anomalies relative to solar for elements such as O, Si, Mg and Ca, which are compatible with nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Therefore, they must have condensed from CCSN ejecta before the formation of the Sun. Their most puzzling abundance signature is the $^{22}$Ne-enriched component Ne-E(L), interpreted as the effect of the radioactive decay of $^{22}$Na ($T_{1/2}$ = 2.6 years). Previous works have shown that if H is ingested into the He shell and not fully destroyed before the explosion, the CCSN shock in the He shell material produces large $^{22}$Na amounts. Here we focus on such CCSN models, showing a radioactive $^{26}$Al production compatible with grains measurements, and analyze the conditions of $^{22}$Na nucleosynthesis. In these models, $^{22}$Na is mostly made in the He shell, with a total ejected mass varying between 2.6$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ and 1.9$\times$10$^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$. We show that such $^{22}$Na may already impact the CCSN light curve 500 days after the explosion, and at later stages it can be the main source powering the CCSN light curve for up to a few years before the $^{44}$Ti decay becomes dominant. Based on the CCSN yields above, the 1274.53 keV $\gamma$-ray flux due to $^{22}$Na decay could be observable for years after the first CCSN light is detected, depending on the distance. This makes CCSNe possible sites to detect a $^{22}$Na $\gamma$-ray signature consistently with the Ne-E(L) component found in presolar graphites. Finally, we discuss the potential contribution from the $^{22}$Na decay to the galactic positron annihilation rate.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation for White Dwarf Spectroscopic Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarf spectroscopic characterization is entering a big data era, with the number of spectroscopically characterized white dwarfs expected to grow from $\sim$100,000 to over 300,000 in upcoming years. Traditional methods like least-squares fitting and Markov Chain Monte Carlo have become computationally prohibitive for large-scale analysis, requiring minutes to days per star. Furthermore, these methods impose fundamental limitations on model complexity by requiring explicit likelihood functions, typically restricting them to Gaussian assumptions. We present neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based inference technique that directly approximates posterior distributions through neural networks trained on simulated spectra. Our approach provides accurate parameter inference in milliseconds per star after upfront training costs, enabling statistical tests of the procedure's reliability. We demonstrate NPE's effectiveness on DA, DB, and carbon-atmosphere white dwarfs, validating its calibration with simulation-based calibration and tests of accuracy with random points. Application to SDSS data shows excellent agreement with previous studies, recovering parameters from previous work within 6.8% for effective temperature and 2.1% for surface gravity, on average. We also apply our technique on WD 1153+012, a hot DQ star with a carbon-oxygen-hydrogen atmosphere, using high-resolution spectroscopy. This methodology combines computational efficiency with the flexibility to model complex atmospheres, making it ideal for upcoming surveys. Our approach also integrates spectroscopic and photometric constraints through an iterative procedure, providing comprehensive characterization of white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Distinct barium isotope ratios in CEMP-s and CEMP-rs stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic analysis of ten carbon enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars of type CEMP-s and CEMP-rs and determine their NLTE abundances of Ba and Eu, as well as the fractions of the odd Ba isotopes (F_odd). The Ba abundances inferred from the resonance Ba II 4554 and 4934 A lines depend on the adopted Ba isotope mixture. We perform calculations for different F_odd from 0.1 to 1.0 and determine the corresponding abundances from the Ba II resonance lines in each sample star. In addition, we determine the Ba abundances from the Ba II subordinate lines, which are almost independent of F_odd. We then compare the Ba abundances derived from the subordinate lines with those from the Ba II resonance lines. We found different F_odd values in CEMP-s and CEMP-rs stars. CEMP-s stars exhibit F_odd = 0.05$_{-0.03}^{+0.07}$, 0.17$_{-0.14}^{+0.63}$, 0.19$_{-0.14}^{+0.50}$, and 0.19$_{-0.12}^{+0.33}$. The obtained values agree, within the error bars, with the s-process F_odd = 0.10 and the solar F_odd = 0.18. Although the uncertainties are large, in three of four stars, the possibility of Ba isotopes origin in a pure r-process with F_odd = 0.75 can be excluded. CEMP-rs stars show F_odd = 0.34$_{-0.21}^{+0.55}$, 0.36$_{-0.14}^{+0.23}$, 0.44$_{-0.22}^{+0.43}$, 0.53$_{-0.38}^{+0.47}$, and 0.57$_{-0.31}^{+0.43}$, which are higher compared to those in CEMP-s stars. Although the uncertainties are large, in four of five stars, the possibility of a pure s-process origin for the Ba isotopes can be excluded. The obtained values agree, within the error bars, with the predicted i-process F_odd = 0.6 to 0.8. Our analysis of CEMP-rs stars with [Ba/Eu] &gt; 0 argues that their [Ba/Eu] and F_odd cannot be jointly explained by a mixture of material produced by the r- and s-processes. The obtained results argue that the i-process is responsible for the chemical composition of these CEMP-rs stars.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength spectroscopic observations of a quiescent prominence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on the analysis of the multiwavelength spectroscopic observations of a quiescent prominence. The spectral and geometrical parameters in the prominence were derived and used to constrain the NLTE radiative transfer models. Applying this method with multiwavelength observations provides a good opportunity to reduce the large range of thermodynamic parameters in solar prominences. We used time-slice and optical flow methods in order to derive the plane-of-sky (POS) velocities, and used gravity center and peak position methods on Mg II h&amp;k and H I Ly-alpha profiles to compute the line-of-sight (LOS) velocities. We used the integrated intensities and FWHM values of the H-alpha, Ca II H, and Mg II h&amp;k lines to compare with the NLTE radiative transfer computations. Ionization degree and thickness of the prominence plasma could be further derived. Opposite flows are observed along two strands between prominence barbs. The POS velocity can reach 20 km/s and the largest LOS velocity is &gt; 90 km/s. The derived electron densities range from 6.5e9 cm-3 to 2.7e10 cm-3, and the derived total hydrogen densities range from 7.4e9 cm-3 to 6.6e10 cm-3. The temperature ranges from 7 000 to 14 000 K. The ionization degree of hydrogen is in the range of 0.40 to 0.91. The comparison between averaged and modeled profiles of Mg II and Ly-alpha lines shows that macro-velocities of 15 km/s and 20 km/s are required, respectively. The bulk motions among prominence barbs indicate that the prominence plasma is not confined within magnetic dips but exhibits a large-scale behavior. The presence of high-speed cool plasma flows, along with a wide range of plasma densities and temperatures, suggests that the prominence plasma is far from thermodynamic equilibrium and is inherently dynamic in nature.</description>

      <title>Serendipitous Discovery of a Faint Planetary Nebula in the Massive Young LMC Cluster NGC 1866</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During an integral-field spectroscopic study of stars in the massive young open cluster NGC 1866 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, we serendipitously discovered a faint planetary nebula (PN). We designate it "Ka LMC 1," and find that its location near the cluster center, along with the agreement of its radial velocity with that of the cluster, imply a high probability of membership in NGC 1866. The 200 Myr age of the cluster indicates that the PN's progenitor star had an initial mass of about 3.9 Msun. The integrated spectrum of Ka LMC 1 shows strong emission lines of [N II], consistent with it being a "Type I" nitrogen-rich PN. The nebula exhibits a classical ring morphology, with a diameter of ~6", corresponding to an advanced expansion age of about 18,000 yr. Archival images of NGC 1866 obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope reveal a faint blue central star. Comparison of the star's luminosity with predictions from one set of theoretical post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolutionary tracks for single stars implies an age roughly consistent with the dynamical age of the PN, but the agreement with alternative modern tracks is much poorer. Analysis of the emission-line spectrum suggests considerable dust extinction within the nebula; however the central star possibly suffers little reddening because we may be viewing it nearly pole-on in a bipolar PN. Our accidental discovery was made using data that are not ideal for study of Ka LMC 1; we suggest several avenues of future targeted studies that would provide valuable and nearly unique new information for constraining models of late stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and magnetic evolution of an eruptive C-class solar flare observed with SST/TRIPPEL-SP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares are complex phenomena driven by the release of magnetic energy, but a large energy reservoir is not sufficient to determine their eruptive potential; the magnetic topology and plasma dynamics play a key role. We investigate the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the solar atmosphere during the rise, peak, and decay phases of a C5.1-class flare and filament eruption in active region NOAA 12561 on 2016 July 7, to understand the origin and atmospheric response of this event. High spatial and spectral resolution spectropolarimetric observations of the chromospheric Ca II 8542A line and nearby photospheric lines were obtained with the TRIPPEL-SP spectropolarimeter at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) inversions and non-force-free field (NFFF) magnetic extrapolations, we followed the event's evolution from its precursor to its decay. Before the flare, our analysis reveals a complex, sheared magnetic topology with a high free energy content ($\sim2\times10^{30}$ erg). In this precursor phase, we detected persistent, localized heating (temperature increase of $\sim$2000 K) with strong downflows ($\sim$10-20 km/s) deep in the atmosphere. This heating was co-spatial with a bald-patch region, suggesting that low-altitude magnetic reconnection could destabilize the filament of the region. The flare's rise phase was marked by the filament's eruption, with a total speed larger than $\sim$70 km/s, when combining inversions and plane-of-sky motions. Following the eruption, the free energy decreased by $\sim$30$\%$ as post-flare loops formed, connecting the flare ribbons and channeling the released energy into the lower atmosphere. The flare ribbons exhibited significant heating to $\sim$8500 K and downflows up to $\sim$10 km/s, consistent with energy deposition along reconnected loops.</description>

      <title>Abundance Analysis of Chemically Depleted Post-AGB/Post-RGB Binaries with Faint Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-AGB and post-RGB binaries with stable circumbinary discs provide key insights into late stellar and disc evolution, revealing how binary interactions shape disc structure and stellar surface composition. A defining trait of such systems is the observed underabundance of refractory elements in the stellar photosphere relative to volatile elements -- photospheric chemical depletion -- resulting from the star accreting volatile-rich circumstellar gas. In this study, we investigated the link between photospheric depletion and disc evolution by focusing on post-AGB/post-RGB binaries with low infrared excess (hereafter ``faint disc'' targets). We analysed high-resolution optical spectra from HERMES/Mercator and UVES/VLT for 6 Galactic and 2 LMC targets. Using \texttt{E-iSpec}, we homogeneously derived atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances of 29 elements from carbon to europium, and included NLTE corrections for 15 elements from carbon to barium that we calculated using pySME and pre-computed grids of departure coefficients. All targets exhibit `saturated' depletion patterns, which we characterised using two-piece linear fits defined by three parameters: initial metallicity ([M/H]$_0$), turn-off temperature ($T_{\rm turn-off}$), and depletion scale ($\nabla_{\rm 100 K}$). Among several findings, we highlight the bimodal distribution of $T_{\rm turn-off}$ in faint disc targets, which allows classification into two subgroups analogous to full discs with continuous, optically thick dust ($T_{\rm turn-off}$ &gt; 1 100 K), and transition discs with inner clearing ($T_{\rm turn-off}$ &lt; 1 100 K). Our results imply that faint disc targets likely represent the final stages of disc dissipation, highlighting the diversity of depletion profiles, the complexity of disc-binary interactions, and the need to understand the rarity and evolution of faint disc systems.</description>

      <title>Properties of current sheets in two-dimensional tearing-mediated magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the nonlinear evolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence generates intermittent current sheets. In the solar wind turbulence, current sheets are frequently observed and they are believed to be an important pathway for the turbulence energy to dissipate and heat the plasma. In this study, we perform a comprehensive analysis of current sheets in a high-resolution two-dimensional simulation of balanced, incompressible MHD turbulence. The simulation parameters are selected such that tearing mode instability is triggered and plasmoids are generated throughout the simulation domain. We develop an automated method to identify current sheets and accurately quantify their key parameters including thickness ($a$), length ($L$), and Lundquist number ($S$). Before the triggering of tearing instability, the current sheet lengths are mostly comparable to the energy injection scale. After the tearing mode onsets, smaller current sheets with lower Lundquist numbers are generated. We find that the aspect ratio ($a/L$) of the current sheets scales approximately as $S^{-1/2}$, i.e. the Sweet-Parker scaling. While a power-law scaling between $L$ and $a$ is observed, no clear correlation is found between the upstream magnetic field strength and thickness $a$. Finally, although the turbulence energy shows anisotropy between the directions parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field increment, we do not observe a direct correspondence between the shape of the current sheets and that of the turbulence "eddies." These results suggest that one needs to be cautious when applying the scale-dependent dynamic alignment model to the analysis of current sheets in MHD turbulence.</description>

      <title>The massive binary system WR 20a: light curve analysis in a colliding wind model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article presents the results of the analysis of optical light curves of the massive binary system WR 20a (WN 6ha + WN 6ha). The analysis was performed with the binary system model, extending the standard Roche model for the case when both components of the system have powerful stellar winds. The model takes into account the collision of the winds and the influence of orbital motion on the collision zone. The observational light curves in the BVI filters were taken from previously published papers, in which they were analyzed using the standard Roche model. The main difference between the results of our work and the previous results is that in our model the radii of the components are about 25% smaller. As a consequence, the luminosity of the system in our model decreased by approximately 40%, and the distance to the system by 20%. In addition, the model was able to successfully describe the observed asymmetry of the light curve with respect to the phases of the conjunctions, which is impossible in the standard Roche model. The model light curves were also compared with the observational curves obtained by the TESS satellite and the ASAS-SN project. It was shown that, taking into account recent studies of interstellar extinction in the direction of the young open cluster Westerlund 2, the distance to WR 20a obtained in our calculations is consistent with the hypothesis that WR 20a is a member of the cluster.</description>

      <title>HelioFill: Diffusion-Based Model for EUV Reconstruction of the Solar Farside</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The loss of STEREO-B in 2014 created a persistent blind spot in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) imaging of the solar farside. We present HelioFill, to the authors' knowledge, the first denoising-diffusion inpainting model that restores full-Sun EUV coverage by synthesizing the STEREO-B sector from Earth-side (SDO) and STEREO-A views. Trained on full-Sun maps from 2011-2014 (when SDO+STEREO-A+B provided 360 degrees coverage), HelioFill couples a latent diffusion backbone with domain-specific additions: spectral gating, confidence weighting, and auxiliary regularizers, to produce operationally suitable 304 Angstrom reconstructions. On held-out data, the model preserves the observed hemisphere with mean SSIM 0.871 and mean PSNR 25.56 dB, while reconstructing the masked hemisphere with mean SSIM 0.801 and mean PSNR 17.41 dB and reducing boundary error by approximately 21 percent (Seam L2) compared to a state-of-the-art diffusion inpainting model. The generated maps maintain cross-limb continuity and coronal morphology (loops, active regions, and coronal-hole boundaries), supporting synoptic products and cleaner inner-boundary conditions for coronal/heliospheric models. By filling observational gaps with observationally consistent EUV emission, HelioFill maintains continuity of full-Sun monitoring and complements helioseismic farside detections, illustrating how diffusion models can extend the effective utility of existing solar imaging assets for space-weather operations.</description>

      <title>Using Binary Population Synthesis to Calculate the Yields of Low- and Intermediate-Mass Binary Populations at Low Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are important to chemical evolution at metallicity $Z \sim 0.0001$ ($\text{[Fe/H]} \approx -2.2$) as they contribute significantly to the production of nitrogen, lead, and dust in the early Universe. The contribution of AGB stars to the chemical evolution of the Universe is often quantified using the chemical yields from single AGB stars. Binary evolution challenges our understanding of chemical evolution as binary phenomena such as mergers and mass transfer episodes can significantly alter the stellar evolution pathways and yields. In this work, we use binary population synthesis code binary_c to model populations of low and intermediate-mass ($\sim 0.7-7 \, M_{\rm \odot}$) stars at metallicity $Z = 0.0001$. Our binary star populations predict $\sim 37\%$ fewer thermally-pulsing AGB stars than our single star populations, leading to a $\sim 40\%$ decrease in the amount of ejected C and a $\sim 35-40\%$ reduction in elements synthesised through the slow neutron capture process. The uncertainty introduced by the mass-loss from stellar winds on the AGB makes the impact of binary evolution on the total amount of ejected N uncertain. The total N yield ejected by our binary star populations ranges from a $17\%$ to a $36\%$ decrease compared to our single star populations. However, our binary populations overproduce N by over an order of magnitude during the period $300-700\,$Myr after formation.</description>

      <title>Reconnection-driven Decaying Pulsations Modulated by Slow Magnetoacoustic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decaying pulsations have been simultaneously detected in the low-energy X-rays of solar/stellar flares, which are supposed to be associated with standing slow magnetoacoustic or kink-mode waves. The physical mechanism behind rapidly decaying remains unknown. We present the detection of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) with rapidly decaying in high-energy emissions produced in two major flares on 10 January and 14 May 2024. Using empirical mode decomposition, decaying QPPs are identified in hard X-ray and microwave emissions during the flare impulsive phase, suggesting a process of oscillatory magnetic reconnection. The quasi-periods and decay times are determined by a damped harmonic function, which are approximately 177$\pm$8 s (249$\pm$25 s) and 118$\pm$4 s (124$\pm$5 s), respectively. The restructured X-ray images reveal double footpoints connected by hot flare loops. Their phase speeds are estimated to about 400 km/s and 670 km/s, both below the local sound speed in high-temperature plasmas, indicating the presence of slow-mode waves in hot flare loops. We perform coronal diagnostics based on standing slow-mode waves and derive key physical parameters, including the polytropic index, the thermal ratio, viscous ratio and radiation ratio, which are consistent with previous results. Our observations support that the decaying QPPs are triggered by oscillatory magnetic reconnection that is modulated by standing slow magnetoacoustic waves, with their rapid decay attributable to a co-effect of viscous damping and localized magnetic reconnection rate.</description>

      <title>Origin of Unusual Composition of 3He-Rich Solar Energetic Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine 3He-rich solar energetic particles (SEPs) detected on 2023 October 24-25 by Solar Orbiter at 0.47 au. The measurements revealed that heavy-ion enhancements increase irregularly with mass, peaking at S. C, and especially N, Si, and S, stand out in the enhancement pattern with large abundances. Except for 3He, heavy ion spectra can only be measured below 0.5 MeV/nucleon. At 0.386 MeV/nucleon, the event showed a huge 3He/4He ratio of 75.2+/-33.9, larger than previously observed. Solar Dynamics Observatory extreme ultraviolet data showed a mini filament eruption at the solar source of 3He-rich SEPs that triggered a straight tiny jet. Located at the boundary of a low-latitude coronal hole, the jet base is a bright, small-scale region with a supergranulation scale size. The emission measure provides relatively cold source temperatures of 1.5 to 1.7 MK between the filament eruption and nonthermal type III radio burst onset. The analysis suggests that the emission measure distribution of temperature in the solar source could be a factor that affects the preferential selection of heavy ions for heating or acceleration, thus shaping the observed enhancement pattern. Including previously reported similar events indicates that the eruption of the mini filament is a common feature of events with heavy-ion enhancement not ordered by mass. Surprisingly, sources with weak magnetic fields showed extreme 3He enrichment in these events. Moreover, the energy attained by heavy ions seems to be influenced by the size and form of jets.</description>

      <title>Fine Structures of Tiny Quiet Sun Jets Observed by Solar Orbiter and Big Bear Solar Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first joint high-resolution observations of small-scale EUV jets using Solar Orbiter(SolO)'s Extreme Ultraviolet Imager and High Resolution Imager (HRI) and H$\alpha$ imaging from the Visible Imaging Spectrometer (VIS) installed on the 1.6~m Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). These jets occurred on 2022-10-29 around 19:10 UT in a quiet Sun region and their main axis aligns with the overarching magnetic structure traced by a cluster of spicules. However, they develop a helical morphology, while the H$\alpha$ spicules maintain straight, linear trajectories elsewhere. Alongside the spicules, thin, elongated red- and blue-shifted H$\alpha$ features appear to envelope the EUV jets, which we tentatively call sheath flows. The EUI jet moving upward at speed of ~110 km/s is joined by strong H$\alpha$ red-shift ~20 km/s to form the bidirectional outflows lasting ~2 min. Using AI-assisted differential emission measure (DEM) analysis of SolO's Full Sun Imager (FSI) we derived total energy of the EUV jet as ~$1.9 \times 10^{26}$ erg with 87% in thermal energy and 13% in kinetic energy. The parameters and morphology of this small-scale EUV jet are interpreted based on a thin flux tube model that predicts Alfvenic waves driven by impulsive interchange reconnection localized as narrowly as ~1.6 Mm with magnetic flux of ~$5.4\times 10^{17}$ Mx, belonging to the smallest magnetic features in the quiet Sun. This detection of intricate corona--chromospheric coupling highlights the power of high-resolution imaging in unraveling the mechanisms behind small-scale solar ejections across atmospheric layers.</description>

      <title>Helium-3 Enrichment in Gradual Solar Energetic Particle Events: Evidence for Jet-Supplied Seed Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancements in 3He abundance, a characteristic feature of impulsive solar energetic particle (ISEP) events, are also frequently observed in gradual SEP (GSEP) events. Understanding the origin of this enrichment is crucial for identifying the mechanisms behind SEP generation. We investigate the origin of 3He enrichment in high-energy (25-50 MeV) solar proton events observed by SOHO, selecting events that coincide with &lt;1 MeV/nucleon 3He-rich periods detected by ACE during 1997-2021. The identified 3He enhancements include cases where material from independent impulsive (3He-rich) SEP events is mixed with GSEP proton populations. Two high-energy proton events exhibit elemental composition and solar source characteristics consistent with ISEPs. Extreme-ultraviolet imaging from SDO and STEREO reveals narrow, jet-like eruptions in the parent active regions of about 60% of the remaining events. Notably, the highest 3He/4He ratios occur when coronal jets are present, consistent with fresh, jet-driven injection of suprathermal 3He that is subsequently re-accelerated during the event. Correspondingly, jet-associated events show fewer pre-event (residual) 3He counts, indicating that enrichment in these cases does not primarily come from remnant material. We find a positive correlation between 3He/4He and Fe/O, strongest in jet-associated events, consistent with a common jet-supplied seed population re-accelerated by the CME shock.</description>

      <title>BSN-IV: The First Multiband Light Curve Study of Five W UMa-type Contact Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a detailed investigation of five contact binary systems of the W Ursae Majoris (W UMa) type. Multiband photometric observations were conducted using ground-based telescopes in both the northern and southern hemispheres, yielding new times of minima. O-C diagram analysis reveals that two systems exhibit parabolic trends, indicating a gradual long-term decrease in their orbital periods. The light curves were modeled using version 1.0 of the BSN application, with one system requiring the inclusion of a cool starspot to achieve a satisfactory fit. We examined empirical relationships between orbital period and fundamental parameters, identifying the period-semi-major axis (P-a) relation as the most robust correlation, which was used to estimate absolute parameters. To statistically assess thermal equilibrium, we analyzed temperature differences between components and found that 90% of systems exhibit less than 9.4% contrast. Two target systems with extremely low mass ratios were identified, and their orbital stability was evaluated. Based on the effective temperatures and component masses, two systems were classified as W-subtype and three as A-subtype. The evolutionary status of the binaries was assessed through their locations in mass-radius, mass-luminosity, and other empirical diagrams, and initial component masses as well as total mass loss were also estimated.</description>

      <title>Exploring hydrodynamical stellar tachoclines along stellar evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar tachoclines are thin regions located between the radiative core and the convective envelope of solar-type stars. They are defined as layers where the rotation of the radiative interior transitions to the differential rotation of the convective envelope, generating strong shear and turbulence. As such, understanding the dynamics of the transport and mixing inside stellar tachoclines would shed light on how the dynamical processes of the convection zone might affect the secular transport of the radiative zone. In particular, we investigate how the change of the latitudinal differential rotation in the convection zone with stellar evolution would affect the dynamics of the tachocline. Indeed, as solar-type stars are braked on the Main Sequence, the differential rotation in the convection zone is expected to evolve from a cylindrical rapidly-rotating regime (columns of varying velocities, aligned with the rotation axis) to a conical solar-like regime (with an equatorial acceleration as in the case of the Sun) and finally to a conical anti-solar-like regime (with a polar acceleration). However, stellar evolutionary codes currently only consider at best the solar conical regime to study the dynamics of stellar tachoclines throughout the evolution of stars. We discuss different possibilities to model hydrodynamical tachoclines and we show that Mathis Zahn 2004's formalism is able to treat coherently hydrodynamical stellar tachoclines when taken in the thin layer approximation. We use it to model the differential rotation, meridional circulation, and mixing coefficients inside the tachocline in order to examine the effect of the different rotation regimes on the transport.</description>

      <title>Starspots as the origin of ultrafast drifting radio bursts from an active M dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting coherent radio bursts from nearby M dwarfs provides opportunities for exploring their magnetic activity and interaction with orbiting exoplanets. However, it remains uncertain if the emission is related to flare-like activity similar to the Sun or magnetospheric process akin to magnetized planets. Using observations (1.0 - 1.5 GHz) taken by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, we found a type of millisecond-scale radio bursts with exceptionally high frequency drift rates ($\sim 8\;\rm{GHz\;s^{-1}}$) from an active M dwarf, AD Leo. The ultrafast drift rates point to a source region with a notably low magnetic scale height ($&lt;0.15\; r_\star$, $r_\star$ as the stellar radius), a feature not expected in a commonly assumed dipole-like global field but highly possible in localized strong-field structures, i.e. starspots. Our findings suggest that a concentrated magnetic field above starspots could be responsible for some of the most intense radio bursts from M dwarfs, supporting a solar-like electron acceleration mechanism.</description>

      <title>Stellar characterization, Magnesium Abundances and Chromospheric Activity Analysis of Stars with Confirmed Exoplanets from the K2 mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a homogeneous spectroscopic analysis of confirmed K2 mission exoplanet-hosting stars, comprising 301 targets with high-resolution optical spectra from HIRES and TRES taken from ExoFOP. We derived effective temperatures, surface gravities, and iron and magnesium abundances in LTE by measuring the equivalent widths of Fe I, Fe II, and Mg I lines. Three estimates of stellar masses and radii were obtained via Stefan-Boltzmann and isochrone methods using the codes PARAM and isochrones. These were used to derive exoplanetary radii reaching internal precisions of 2.5%, 2.6%, and 6.6%, respectively, and the radius gap being consistently detected near 1.9 R$_{\oplus}$. We measured chromospheric activity from the Ca II H &amp; K and H$\alpha$ lines. Within the low-activity range ($\log R^{\prime}_{HK} &lt; -4.75$), stellar activity appears to decrease with increasing planetary radius from super-Earths, sub-Neptunes, sub-Saturns, into the Jupiter regime. According to the [Mg/Fe] measurements, most of our K2 planet hosts belong to the Galactic thin disk, but our sample has a population from the thick disk (high-alpha sequence). Most stars show consistent chemo-dynamical behavior. We find that the [Mg/Fe] ratios are indistinguishable between systems containing Large or Small exoplanets, as well as Single- or Multi-exoplanetary systems. Both the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] distributions reveal that stars hosting large planets are more iron- and magnesium-enhanced than those having only small planets, further confirming the link between stellar abundances and exoplanetary size, but no significant differences are found between the Single- versus Multi-exoplanetary systems.</description>

      <title>A modeling perspective on the diversity of red-supergiant stars exploding within circumstellar material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ever faster cadence of untargeted surveys of the sky, the supernova (SN) community will capture in the coming years a growing number of shock breakouts in red-supergiant (RSG) stars. Expecting a high frequency of breakouts within circumstellar material (CSM), we have produced an extended, regular and cubic grid of models covering from low- to high-energy explosions, compact to extended CSM, moderate- to high-density CSM. Here, we document the main results from the radiation-hydrodynamics and nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative-transfer calculations over the first 15d of evolution, including the bolometric and multi-band light curves and the salient features from spectra. As before, CSM interaction is found to boost the UV brightness and shorten the optical rise time if compact. Higher ionization (e.g., as seen with OVI3820A) is obtained for more compact CSM, and is maximum for explosions in a vacuum. CSM interaction also diversifies the spectral evolution as seen in line profile morphology, with electron-scattering broadening dominating during the IIn phase. In the absence of CSM, Doppler broadening dominates immediately after shock breakout and leads to strongly blueshifted emission in lines such as HeII4686A or CIV5805A. This treasury of models will be used to analyze as well as predict future observations of RSG shock breakouts in CSM.</description>

      <title>A search for black holes with metal-poor stellar companions: I. Survey sample selection and single epoch radial velocity follow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) above $30 M_\odot$ are predicted to form from low-metallicity progenitors, but direct detections of such systems in the Milky Way remain scarce. Motivated by the recent discovery of Gaia BH3, a $33 M_\odot$ BH with a very metal-poor giant companion, we conduct a systematic search for additional systems. Approximately 900 candidates are identified with Gaia as having significant deviations from single-star astrometric motion, evidence of RV variability, and low metallicities inferred from Gaia XP spectra. We obtain single epoch high-resolution spectra for over 600 of these sources with Magellan/MIKE and Lick/APF and measure independent RVs with $\approx 1$ km s$^{-1}$ precision. After removing contaminants such as hot stars, pulsators, eclipsing binaries, and hierarchical triples, we identify about 15 promising candidates with large RV amplitudes or offsets from the Gaia reported values. This program establishes a well-characterized sample of BH candidates for detailed orbital modeling once Gaia DR4 epoch astrometry and RVs are released in late 2026; multi-epoch RV follow-up is ongoing. Together, the Gaia and ground-based data will place new constraints on the demographics of BHs with metal-poor companions and test theoretical predictions linking low metallicity to the formation of the most massive stellar remnants.</description>

      <title>Simulating Binary Neutron Star Mergers with Finite-temperature Equations of State: The influences of the slope of the symmetry energy and artificial heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new set of numerical-relativity simulations of merging binary neutron stars, aiming to identify possible observable signatures of the slope of the symmetry energy $L_{\rm sym}$. To achieve this goal, we employ a set of equations of state based on a parameterization of the covariant density functional theory of nuclear matter that allows controlled variations of $L_{\rm sym}$ and the skewness $Q_{\rm sat}$, holding the latter fixed. For a set of our simulations, we identify a steep energy gradient in the equation of state at subsaturation densities, which acts as a source of heating with subsequent stiffening produced by thermal support. Accounting for related structural modifications in the tidal deformability reconciles our results with theoretical expectations. On the other hand, we show that gravitational waves are unlikely to distinguish the role of $L_{\rm sym}$. In contrast to this, we find that the ejecta composition is significantly altered in our simulations, which employ an M1 moment scheme, when $L_{\rm sym}$ is varied. Based on our extracted dynamical ejecta properties, we compute r-process yields and find that they are distinct for the different $L_{\rm sym}$, especially at lower mass numbers $A \lesssim 120$. This suggests that electromagnetic counterparts are more likely to exhibit signatures; however, a direct connection to $L_{\rm sym}$ remains a challenge, given the complex interplay between details of the ejecta properties and the kilonova signal.</description>

      <title>Tracking optical variability and outflows across the accretion states of the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the minute-timescale optical variability and spectroscopic outflow signatures in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during its 2018 outburst and re-brightenings. Minute-cadence, multi-filter optical light curves were obtained with the Las Cumbres Observatory network and the Al Sadeem Observatory (UAE) over 2018-2020, complemented by X-ray data from Swift/BAT, XRT, and MAXI. We also acquired contemporaneous low-resolution optical spectra with the 2.1 m OAN San Pedro Martir and OAGH Cananea telescopes (Mexico) and the 1.5 m G.D. Cassini telescope at Loiano (Italy). The optical fractional rms peaks in the hard state and is dominated by short-timescale flickering that strengthens toward longer wavelengths, suggesting that the variability is jet-driven. In this scenario, inflow fluctuations inject velocity perturbations at the jet base (internal shock model). The variability is quenched in the soft state, with any residual signal likely linked to accretion-flow fluctuations. This behaviour supports the accretion-ejection coupling in black hole binaries and shows that the jet's variability signature extends to optical wavelengths in all hard states. In the faintest hard states, residual optical variability may instead trace cyclo-synchrotron emission from the hot flow. The spectra show double-peaked emission lines and tentative cold-wind signatures during the hard state. Such winds were reported during the main 2018 outburst; here we find evidence of their presence also in later re-brightenings. Their absence in the soft state likely reflects stronger disc ionisation from the higher X-ray flux, suppressing low-ionisation optical features.</description>

      <title>Rapidly rotating hot nuclear and hypernuclear compact stars: integral parameters and universal relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate hot, isentropic compact stars in the limiting cases of static and maximally rotating configurations, focusing on how variations in the symmetry energy of the equation of state derived from covariant density functional theory affect stellar properties. We consider both nucleonic and hyperonic matter with systematically varied symmetry energy slopes, fixed entropies per baryon $s / k_B=1$ and 3, and electron fractions $Y_e=0.1$ and $Y_e=0.4$, representative of conditions in binary neutron star mergers and proto-neutron stars. We compute and analyze mass--radius and moment--of--inertia--mass relations, as well as the dependence of the Keplerian (mass-shedding) frequency on mass, angular momentum, and the ratio of kinetic to gravitational energy. Furthermore, we show that several universal relations between global properties remain valid across both nucleonic and hyperonic equations of state with varying symmetry energy, both in the static and Keplerian limit, and for various combinations of the fixed entropy and electron fraction.</description>

      <title>The metallicity dependence of long-duration gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both theoretical models and observations of collapsar created gamma-ray bursts -- typically long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) -- suggest that these transients cannot occur at high metallicity, likely due to angular momentum losses via stellar winds for potential progenitor stars. However, the precise metallicity threshold (if it is a hard threshold) above which the formation of LGRBs is suppressed is still a topic of discussion. We investigated observed LGRBs and the properties of their host galaxies to constrain this metallicity dependence. In order to compute LGRB rates we modelled the cosmic history of star formation, as a function of host galaxy metallicity and stellar mass, and added a LGRB efficiency function that can include various shapes including abrupt cutoffs and more gradual variations in the GRB yield with metallicity. In contrast to previous work, this model includes scatters in the relations between mass, metallicity, and star formation rate, as well as a scatter in the metallicity distribution inside galaxies. We then varied both the threshold value and shape, and compared it to observed LGRBs and the properties of their host galaxies. In our model a sharp cutoff at an oxygen abundance $Z_{\text{O/H}}=12+\log(\text{O/H})=8.6\pm0.1$ (corresponding to $\sim0.6Z_{\odot}$) provides the best explanation for the observed LGRB data. In contrast, a lower threshold proposed in literature (i.e. at $Z_{\text{O/H}}=8.3$ or $\sim0.3Z_{\odot}$) fits observations poorly. We therefore conclude that, in contrast to most theoretical LGRB models, a relatively high metallicity threshold at near-solar values provides the best match between our model and observed LGRBs.</description>

      <title>Explodability matters: how realistic neutrino-driven explosions change explosive nucleosynthesis yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explosive nucleosynthesis is affected by many uncertainties, particularly regarding assumptions and prescriptions adopted during the evolution of the star. Moreover, simple explosion models are often used in the literature, which can introduce large errors in the assumed explosion energy and mass cut. In this paper, our goal is to analyze the explosion properties and nucleosynthesis of a large range of progenitors from three different stellar evolution codes: FRANEC, KEPLER, and MESA. In particular, we will show the differences between the neutrino-driven explosions simulated in this work with the much simpler bomb and piston models that are typically widely used in the literature. We will then focus on the impact of different explodabilities and different explosion dynamics on the nucleosynthetic yields. We adopt the neutrino-driven core-collapse supernova explosion code GR1D+, i.e. a spherically symmetric model with state-of-the-art microphysics and neutrino transport and a time-dependent mixing-length model for neutrino-driven convection. We carry out explosions up to several seconds after bounce, and then calculate the nucleosynthetic yields with the post-processing code SkyNet. We find that our 1D+ simulations yield explosion energies and remnant masses in agreement with observations of type II-P, IIb, and Ib supernovae, as well as with the most recent 3D simulations of the explosion. We provide a complete set of yields for all the stars simulated, including rotating, low-metallicity, and binary progenitors. Finally, we find that piston and bomb models, compared to more realistic neutrino-driven explosions, can artificially increase the production of Fe-peak elements, whereas the different explodability tends to cause discrepancies in the lighter elements.</description>

      <title>Deuteration of water in protoplanetary discs during luminosity outbursts: model predictions for FU Ori discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminosity outbursts of FU Ori-type objects (FUors) allow us to observe in the gas the molecules that are typically present in the ice in protoplanetary discs. In particular, the fraction of deuterated water, which is usually is mostly frozen in the midplane of a protoplanetary disc, has been measured for the first time in the gas of the disc around a FUor V883 Ori. We test the hypothesis that the observed high HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio in the V883 Ori protoplanetary disc can be explained by luminosity outbursts of different amplitude, including a series of two consecutive outbursts. Using the ANDES astrochemical code, we modelled the distributions of water and deuterated water abundances under the action of luminosity outbursts of different amplitudes (from 400 to 10 000 $L_{\odot}$) and at different stellar luminosities at the pre-outburst stage. We show that the best agreement with the observed HDO/H$_{2}$O profile is obtained for outburst amplitudes of 2 000 and 10 000 $L_{\odot}$, while the observed bolometric luminosity of V883 Ori does not exceed 400 $L_{\odot}$. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy, including the presence of past luminosity outbursts, the age of the star, and the influence of additional heating mechanisms in the midplane of the protoplanetary disc. We also consider how the high observed $\rm HDO/H_{2}O$ ratio may be related to the evolution of the chemical composition of the ice in the protoplanetary disc and the chemical processes activated under outburst conditions.</description>

      <title>Unbound Tails and Compressed Heads: A JCMT Study of the SFO 38 Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SFO 38, located in the Cepheus molecular cloud within the northern part of the HII region IC 1396, is shaped by intense ultraviolet radiation from the nearby O6.5V-type star HD 206267 and represents a classic example of a bright-rimmed cloud (BRC) undergoing radiatively driven implosion (RDI). While previous studies have examined the southern globule using CS and 13CO (1-0), we present a refined analysis using high-resolution JCMT-HARP observations in the 12CO, 13CO, and C18O (J = 3-2) lines, deriving key physical parameters along with virial mass and turbulence properties of the southern head. We also perform the first detailed investigation of the northeastern and northwestern tails, determining their morphological dimensions and internal conditions, including excitation temperature, column density, mass, and volume density. Spectral and stability analyses reveal that the tail regions are gravitationally unbound and dynamically expanding, explaining the lack of active star formation. Our results further shed light on the evolutionary fate of these structures, assessing whether they may accumulate sufficient material to become future sites of star formation or remain quiescent. Overall, this work highlights the dual role of RDI in this BRC: while it triggers star formation in the dense head, it simultaneously disperses and dynamically reshapes the extended tails.</description>

      <title>Resolving star spots on WASP-85 A using high-resolution transit spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar surface inhomogeneities such as spots and faculae introduce Doppler variations that challenge exoplanet detection via the radial velocity method. While their impact on disc-integrated spectra is well established, detailed studies of the underlying local line profiles have so far been limited to the Sun. We present an observational campaign targeting the active star WASP-85 A during transits of its hot Jupiter companion. The transits span two stellar rotation periods, allowing us to probe the evolution of active regions. From ground-based photometry we identify seven active regions, six containing dark spots. Using simultaneous ESPRESSO transit spectroscopy, we spatially resolve these regions on the stellar surface by using the planet as a probe. We detect significant bisector shape changes, line broadening, and net redshifts during spot occultations, with velocity shifts of 108-333 m/s (mean uncertainty 50 m/s). The observed broadening is consistent with the Zeeman effect, implying magnetic field strengths (Stokes $I$) $B$ = 2.7-4.4 kG (mean uncertainty 0.6 kG), comparable to solar umbrae. Combined with our photometric spot model, this yields lower limits to the disc-integrated field $Bf = 16 \pm 3$ G and $61 \pm 9$ G for the two hemispheres probed -- at least three times higher than Sun-as-a-star values. We also measure centre-to-limb variations in FWHM, line depth, equivalent width, and convective blueshift, which broadly agree with solar observations and 3D MHD models. This work demonstrates a new way to characterise the surfaces of exoplanet host stars, paving the way for future analyses incorporating synthetic line profiles from 3D MHD simulations.</description>

      <title>Photoionization Modeling of Planetary Nebulae in the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present the results of photoionization modeling for 124 planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Galactic bulge. Utilizing the {\scshape cloudy} code, we derived the effective temperatures (T$_{eff}$) of the central stars, with a peak distribution around $\sim$ 100,000 K, and luminosities clustering around $\sim$ 3,000 L$\odot$. The inner radii of the ionized regions range from 0.003 to 0.31 pc, with nebula diameters varying from 1.8" to 34", averaging 7\% larger than the observed visible diameters. Elemental abundances for Helium, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Neon, Sulphur, Chlorine and Argon relative to hydrogen derived from the models show consistency within 0.5 dex, with notable variations in Sulphur, Nitrogen, and Chlorine. The study also compares elemental abundances from photoionization models with previous observations, showing overall good agreement, particularly for Cl/H, but notable discrepancies in He/H and S/H ratios. The models' goodness of fit, quantified by $\chi^{2}$ values, varies widely, with higher values linked to discrepancies in WISE photometric data. The evolutionary tracks of the central stars from H-R diagrams suggest progenitor masses ranging from 0.8 to 4.2 $M_\odot$ and progenitor final masses between 0.53 and 0.87 $M_\odot$, indicating significant mass loss during evolution. These PNe have post-AGB ages ranging from 150 to 20,000 years, consistent with the Galactic PNe distribution. Most of the PNe are in an intermediate evolutionary stage with larger nebular sizes. Our results provide the most comprehensive photoionization modeling to date, with key implications for central stars of PNe, gas, and dust.</description>

      <title>Ionization Rate of Interstellar Neutral Helium from New Horizons/SWAP Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar neutral (ISN) atoms enable studies of the physical conditions in the local interstellar medium surrounding the heliosphere. ISN helium, which is the most abundant species at 1 au, is directly observed by space missions, such as Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). However, some of these atoms are ionized by solar ultraviolet radiation before reaching 1 au, producing pickup ions (PUIs). A recent analysis of IBEX data suggests that the helium photoionization rates predicted by models are underestimated by up to 40%. The Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument on board New Horizons enables the study of PUIs giving complementary insight into the other side of the ionization process. Our goal is to verify this increased helium ionization by determining the ionization rate of ISN helium in the heliosphere based on the SWAP observations of helium PUIs. For this purpose, we analyze SWAP data collected between 2012 and 2022, at distances 22 to 54 au from the Sun. We develop a new method for fitting model distribution functions to the observational data using the maximum likelihood method. Our approach accounts for the spacecraft's rotation and the SWAP response function, which depends on both energy and inflow direction. We estimate SWAP's efficiency for helium relative to that for hydrogen and determine the ISN helium ionization rate. We find that the photoionization rate obtained from the SWAP observations is 43% larger than the rates predicted by models, confirming the IBEX results.</description>

      <title>Extending the [C/N]-Age Calibration: Using Globular Clusters to Explore Older and Metal-Poor Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the coming years, detailed chemical abundances from large-scale high-resolution spectroscopic surveys will become available for vast numbers of stars across the Milky Way. Previous work has suggested that abundance ratios from these spectra can allow us to estimate ages from a large number of stars. These data will be leveraged to calibrate chemical clocks to age-date field stars, as reliable stellar ages remain elusive. In this work, we extended our empirical relationship between stellar age and their carbon-to-nitrogen ([C/N]) abundance ratio for evolved stars to older and more metal-poor stars by combining the original open cluster calibration sample and four globular clusters: 47 Tuc, M 71, M 4, and M 5. With this extension, [C/N] can be used as a chemical clock for evolved field stars to investigate not only regions within the metal rich disk, but also more metal-poor regions of our Galaxy. We have established the [C/N]-age relationship for APOGEE DR17 red giant stars, that have experienced the first dredge up but have not yet undergone any extra-mixing, in clusters usable for ages between $8.62 \leq \log(Age[{\rm yr}]) \leq 10.13$ and for metallicites of $-1.2\leq[Fe/H]\leq+0.3$. This relationship can be uniformly applied to these stars within the APOGEE DR17 sample. This measured [C/N]-age APOGEE DR17 relationship is also shown to be consistent with stellar ages derived from asterosiesmic results of APOKASC and APO-K2.</description>

      <title>A High-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey of Directly Imaged Companion Hosts: II. Diversity in C/O Ratios among Host Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The era of JWST has enabled measurements of abundances of elements such as C, O, and even Na, S, K, and Fe in planetary atmospheres to very high precisions ($\sim$0.1 dex). Accurate inference of planet formation using these elemental abundances require the corresponding abundance measurements for the host star. We present the second set of results from our high-resolution spectroscopic survey of directly imaged companion host stars, measuring abundances of 16 elements (including C, O, Na, Mg, Si, S, K and Fe) for five directly imaged companion host stars. Using both the spectral fitting and the equivalent width methods, we find solar C/O ratios for HR 2562 (0.58 $\pm$ 0.09), AB Pic (0.50 $\pm$ 0.14), and YSES 1 (0.45 $\pm$ 0.05), and sub-solar C/O ratios for PZ Tel (0.28 $\pm$ 0.05) and $\beta$ Pic (0.22 $\pm$ 0.06). The $4\sigma$ sub-solar C/O detections for PZ Tel and $\beta$ Pic highlight the importance of accurate stellar C/O estimates for constraining planet formation. Subsequently, we combine our abundances with those from our previous work to measure population-level average elemental abundances. We find super-solar carbon and oxygen for this stellar population, indicating that the protoplanetary disks around these stars were potentially rich in volatiles. We compare stellar C/O to those of their companions, revealing super-stellar C/O for several objects that suggest planet-like formation mechanisms. We also compare the C/O of our directly imaged companion host star population with other planet host stars using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, which indicates insufficient evidence to differentiate between the various stellar populations</description>

      <title>Metal-poor single Wolf-Rayet stars: The interplay of optically thick winds and rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) hosts 12 known Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, seven of which are apparently single. Their formation is a challenge for current stellar evolution models because line-driven winds are generally assumed to be quenched at a metallicity of Z &lt; 0.004. Here, we present a set of mesa models of single stars with zero-age main sequence masses of 20 - 80 Msun considering different initial rotation speeds ({\Omega} = 0 - 0.7 {\Omega}_c), metallicities (Z = 0.002 - 0.0045), and wind mass-loss models (optically thin and thick winds). We show that if we account for optically thick winds, fast rotating ({\Omega} = 0.6 {\Omega}_c) single metal-poor O-type stars (with M &gt; 20 Msun) shed their envelope and become WR stars even at the low metallicity of the SMC. The luminosity, effective temperature, evolutionary timescale, surface abundance, and rotational velocity of our simulated WR stars are compatible to the WRs observed in the SMC. We speculate that this scenario can also alleviate the excess of giant stars across the Humphreys-Davidson limit. Our results have key implications for black hole masses, (pair instability) supernova explosions, and other observable signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to identify the cluster members, estimate cluster properties, study the dynamical state of the clusters as a function of mass, trace the existence of dynamical effects in massive stars, and check for spatial patterns of members in young clusters. We studied 14 young open clusters located within 1 kpc using the data from Gaia DR3 with the membership estimated using the GMM method. The cluster parameters such as age, distance, metallicity, and extinction were estimated by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the CMDs. These clusters are found to have ages between 6-90 Myr, located between 334-910 pc, covering a mass range, of 0.13 to 13.77 solar mass. In five of these clusters, stars from F to M spectral type show increasing velocity dispersion, a signature for dynamical relaxation. We detect high proper motion for B and A-type stars, possible walkaway stars in the other five clusters, Alessi Teutsch 5, ASCC 16, ASCC 21, IC 2395, and NGC 6405. We demonstrate the existence of mass-dependent velocity dispersion in young clusters suggestive of dynamical relaxation. The typical range of transverse velocity dispersion is found to be 0.40 - 0.70 km/s for young clusters.</description>

      <title>The SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Radio Survey. II. Radio Emission from High-Luminosity Protostars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present centimeter continuum observations of seven high luminosity massive protostars and their surrounding sources in regions with multiple targets, as part of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. With data from the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we analyze the spectral index, morphology and multiplicity of the detected radio sources. The high-sensitivity, high-resolution observations allow us to resolve many sources; 65$\%$ of the reported sources are resolved at least within the synthesized beam. We report thirteen new detections and two previously known detections that we observed for the first time in radio frequencies. We use the observations to build radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to calculate spectral indices. With radio morphologies and the spectral indices, we give assessments on the nature of the sources, highlighting six sources that display a radio jet-like morphology and a spectral index consistent with ionized jets. Combining with the SOMA Radio I sample, we present the radio - bolometric luminosity relation, especially probing the regime from $L_{\rm bol}\sim 10^4$ to $10^6\:L_\odot$. Here we find a steep rise in radio luminosity, which is expected by models that transition from shock ionization to photoionization.</description>

      <title>Polarization from Rapidly Rotating Massive Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar rotation has long been recognized as important to the evolution of stars, by virtue of the chemical mixing it can induce and how it interacts with binary mass transfer. Binary interaction and rapid rotation are both common in massive stars and involve processes of angular momentum distribution and transport. An important question is how this angular momentum transport leads to the creation of two important classes of rapidly rotating massive stars, Be stars defined by disklike emission lines, and Bn stars defined by rotationally broadened absorption lines. A related question is what limits this rotation places on how conservative the mass transfer can be. Central to addressing these issues is knowledge of how close to rotational break-up stars can get before they produce a disk. Here we calculate diagnostics of this rotational criticality using the continuum polarization arising from a combination of rotational stellar distortion (i.e., oblateness) and redistribution of stellar flux (i.e., gravity darkening), and compare polarizations produced in the von Zeipel approximation with the approach of Espinosa Lara &amp; Rieutord (ELR). Both produce similar photospheric polarizations that rise significantly in the far ultraviolet (FUV) for B stars, with a stronger signal in the von Zeipel case. For early main-sequence and subgiant stars, it reaches a maximum of ~1% at 140 nm for stars rotating at 98% of critical, when seen edge-on. Rotational rates above 80% critical result in polarizations of several tenths of a percent, at high inclination. These predicted stable signal strengths indicate that determinations of near-critical rotations in B stars could be achieved with future spectropolarimetric instrumentation that can reach deep into the FUV, such as CASSTOR, the Polstar mission concept, or the POLLUX detector design.</description>

      <title>Radiation pressure and equation of state are important in the envelope unbinding process in common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In common envelope evolution, the ultimate unbinding of the envelope during the plunge-in phase involves complex and poorly understood physical processes that may give rise to luminous red novae. In this work, we investigate the roles of radiation and gas pressures in envelope unbinding. We perform a parameter space survey using a one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic model that is solved by {\tt Guangqi} to study the impact of key parameters on the mass unbound fraction and resulting light curves. The parameters include the radiation to gas energy ratio $\mathcal{E}/e_{\text{g}}\in[0.2,3.2]$, speed of the ejecta, ranging from 70\% to 85\% of the escape velocity, and equation of state (EoS). For comparison, we also perform simulations with pure hydrodynamic or no radiation pressure effect conditions. Our simulations demonstrate that the radiation pressure is crucial for the envelope unbinding. Specifically, the radiation pressure may dominate in a high opacity and high luminosity layer just below the recombination front, where it can accelerate the sub-escape material to escape velocities. A realistic EoS further enhances the pressure gradient, especially during the early phase of ejection at small radii, promoting additional envelope ejection. Both $\mathcal{E}/e_{\text{g}}$ and EoS significantly alter light curve shapes, and provide observable diagnostics for these processes. We show that the relative energy error of all the simulations is no more than 1.4\%, and all the simulations are close to convergence.</description>

      <title>Rare Find: Discovery and chemo-dynamical properties of two s-process enhanced RR Lyrae stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the serendipitous discovery of two RR Lyrae stars exhibiting significant s-process element enrichment, a rare class previously represented solely by TY Gruis. Our goal is to characterise these objects chemically and dynamically, exploring their origins and evolutionary histories. Using high-resolution spectroscopy from HERMES@AAT and UVES@VLT, we derived detailed chemical abundances of key s-process elements, carbon along with $\alpha$-elements. We also employed Gaia DR3 astrometric data to analyse their kinematics, orbital properties, and classify their Galactic population membership. We compared observational results with theoretical asymptotic giant branch nucleosynthesis models to interpret their enrichment patterns. Both stars exhibit clear signatures of s-process enrichment, with significant overabundances in second-peak elements such as Ba and La compared to first-peak Y and Zr. Comparison with AGB nucleosynthesis models suggests their progenitors experienced pollution of s-process-rich material, consistent with early binary interactions. However, notable discrepancies in dilution factors highlight the need for more refined low-metallicity asymptotic giant branch (AGB) models. We also explore and discuss alternative scenarios, including sub-luminous post-AGB-like evolution or double episodes of mass transfer. Our findings confirm the existence of s-process-enhanced RR Lyrae stars and demonstrate the importance of combining chemical and dynamical diagnostics to unveil their complex evolutionary pathways. Future detailed binary evolution modelling and long-term orbital monitoring are essential to resolve their formation scenarios and assess the role of binarity in the evolution of pulsating variables.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Hubble and matter density parameters with and without modelling the CMB anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00804v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider constraints on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$ from: (i) the age of the Universe based on old stars and stellar populations in the Galactic disc and halo (Cimatti &amp; Moresco 2023); (ii) the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum, which tells us the cosmological horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality (Philcox et al. 2022); and (iii) the shape of the expansion history from supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with no absolute calibration of either, a technique known as uncalibrated cosmic standards (UCS; Lin, Chen, &amp; Mack 2021). A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, &amp; Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$. Given the difficulties with solutions in the early universe, we argue that the most promising alternative to a local void is a modification to the expansion history at late times, perhaps due to a changing dark energy density.</description>

      <title>Scintillation Properties of PSR B1133+16 Measured with Very Long Baseline Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scintillation of pulsars reveals small-scale structure of the interstellar medium.
  A powerful technique for characterizing the scintillating structures (screens) combines analysis of scintillation arcs and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).
  We present the results of a VLBI analysis of the scintillation arcs of PSR B1133+16 from simultaneous observations with Arecibo, VLA, Jodrell Bank, Effelsberg, and Westerbork.
  Three arcs appear in the data set, all of which appear consistent with being the result of very anisotropic scattering screens.
  We are able to measure their orientations on the sky, down to uncertainties of $5\arcdeg$ for the two stronger screens, and measure distances, of $140\pm30$, $180\pm20$, and $250\pm30{\rm\,pc}$, consistent with, but substantially more precise than what was inferred previously from annual modulation patterns in the scintillation.
  Comparing with the differential dust extinction with distance in this direction, the two nearer screens appear associated with the wall of the Local Bubble.</description>

      <title>Fluorescent Fe K line emission of gamma Cas stars II. Predictions for magnetic interactions and white-dwarf accretion scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: About 12 percent of the early-type Be stars, so-called gamma Cas stars, exhibit an unusually hard and bright thermal X-ray emission that could result from accretion onto a white dwarf companion or from magnetic interactions between the Be star and its decretion disk. Exploring the full power of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of gamma Cas stars requires comparison of observations of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines near 6.4 keV with synthetic profiles of this line complex computed in the framework of the magnetic interaction and the accreting WD scenarios. For the latter, we further distinguish between accretion onto a non-magnetic and a magnetic WD. Our models account for different reservoirs of reprocessing material: the Be circumstellar decretion disk, the Be photosphere, an accretion disk around the WD companion, a magnetically channelled accretion flow and the WD photosphere. We find considerably different line properties for the different scenarios. For a non-magnetic accreting WD, the global Fe Kalpha complex is extremely broad, reaching a full width of 140 eV, whilst it is ~ 40 eV for the magnetic star-disk interaction and the magnetic accreting WD cases. In the magnetic star-disk interaction, the line centroid follows the orbital motion of the Be star, whereas it moves along with the WD in the case of an accreting WD. For gamma Cas, given the 15 times larger amplitude of the WD orbital motion, the shift in position for an accreting WD should be easily detectable with high-resolution spectrographs such as Resolve on XRISM, but remains essentially undetectable for the magnetic star-disk interaction. Upcoming high-resolution spectroscopy of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines in the X-ray spectra of gamma Cas stars will thus allow to distinguish between the competing scenarios.</description>
