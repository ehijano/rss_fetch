      <title>Lower bounds and integrality gaps in simplicial decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a finite pure simplicial $d$-complex, with oriented facets $\{F_i\}$, which is boundaryless in the sense that $\sum\partial F_i=0$. We call such a $\mathcal{K}$ an \textit{admissible $d$-complex}. Given an admissible $d$-complex, one can ask for the smallest collection $\{T_i\}$ of oriented $(d+1)$-simplices on the vertices of $\mathcal{K}$ which decomposes $\mathcal{K}$ in the sense that $\sum \partial T_i = \mathcal{K}$. Let the minimum size of such a collection be $V_\mathbb{Z}(\mathcal{K})$, and let $V_\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal{K})$ be the relaxed analog where fractional $(d+1)$-simplices may be used. We explain how these quantities may be computed via integer and linear programming, and show how lower bounds may be obtained by exploiting LP-duality. We then prove that $V_\mathbb{Q}$ and $V_\mathbb{Z}$ are both additive under disjoint union and connected sum along a $d$-simplex. The remainder of the paper explores integrality gaps between $V_\mathbb{Z}$ and $V_\mathbb{Q}$ in dimension 1, where we share what we believe is the simplest admissible complex with an integrality gap; and in dimension 2, where we collect some results on integrality gaps for triangulations of the 2-sphere for a companion paper with Zili Wang and Peter Doyle.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Word Embeddings: Recognizing Language Phylogenies through Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Word embeddings represent language vocabularies as clouds of $d$-dimensional points. We investigate how information is conveyed by the general shape of these clouds, outside of representing the semantic meaning of each token. Specifically, we use the notion of persistent homology from topological data analysis (TDA) to measure the distances between language pairs from the shape of their unlabeled embeddings. We use these distance matrices to construct language phylogenetic trees over 81 Indo-European languages. Careful evaluation shows that our reconstructed trees exhibit strong similarities to the reference tree.</description>

      <title>Generalized positive scalar curvature on spin$^c$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,L)$ be a non-spin spin$^c$ manifold. Fix a Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ and a connection $A$ on $L$, and let $D_L$ be the associated spin$^c$ Dirac operator. Let $R^{tw}_{g,A}:=R_g + 2ic(\Omega)$ be the twisted scalar curvature (which takes values in the endomorphims of the spinor bundle), where $R_g$ is the scalar curvature of $g$ and $2ic(\Omega)$ comes from the curvature $2$-form $\Omega$ of the connection $A$. Then the Lichnerowicz-Schr\"odinger formula for the square of the Dirac operator takes the form $D_L^2 =\nabla^*\nabla+\frac{1}{4}R^{tw}_{g,A}$. In a previous work we proved that a closed non-spin simply-connected spin$^c$-manifold $(M,L)$ of dimension $n\geq 5$ admits a pair $(g,A)$ such that $R^{tw}_{g,A}&gt;0$ if and only if the index $\alpha^c(M,L):=\text{ind}\, D_L$ vanishes in $K_n$. In this paper we introduce a scalar-valued generalized scalar curvature $R^{gen}_{g,A}:=R_g - 2|\Omega|_{op}$, where $|\Omega|_{op}$ is the pointwise operator norm of Clifford multiplication $c(\Omega)$, acting on spinors. We show that the positivity condition on the operator $R^{tw}_{g,A}$ is equivalent to the positivity of the scalar function $R^{gen}_{g,A}$. We prove a corresponding trichotomy theorem concerning the curvature $R^{gen}_{g,A}$, and study its implications. We also show that the space $\mathcal{R}^{gen+}(M,L)$ of pairs $(g,A)$ with $R^{gen}_{g,A}&gt;0$ has non-trivial topology, and address a conjecture about non-triviality of the ``index difference'' map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This informal note collects key results and open problems on the (co)homology of the Deligne-Mumford moduli spaces of real marked rational curves. The open problems are both of topological nature, aiming to investigate the (co)homology of these spaces further, and of algebraic nature, aiming to describe the structure of the homology of these spaces in operad-like terms.</description>

      <title>Extraction of Singular Patterns from a Vector Field via Persistent Path Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extraction of singular patterns is a fundamental problem in theoretical and practical domains due to the ability of such patterns to detect the intrinsic characteristics of vector fields. In this study, we propose an approach for extracting singular patterns from discrete planar vector fields. Our method involves converting the planar discrete vector field into a specialized digraph and computing its one-dimensional persistent path homology. By analyzing the persistence diagram, we can determine the location of singularity and segment a region of the singular pattern, which is referred to as a singular polygon. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in analyzing the centers and impact areas of tropical cyclones.</description>

      <title>The Grothendieck Construction for $\infty$-Categories Fibered over Categorical Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to treat families of $\infty$-categories fibered in categorical patterns (e.g., $\infty$-operads and monoidal $\infty$-categories) in terms of fibrations by relativizing the Grothendieck construction. As applications, we construct an analog of the universal cocartesian fibration and explain how to compute limits and colimits of $\infty$-categories fibered in categorical patterns.</description>

      <title>On the path homology of Cayley digraphs and covering digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15683v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of covering digraphs, similar to the theory of covering spaces. By applying this theory to Cayley digraphs, we build a "bridge" between GLMY-theory and group homology theory, which helps to reduce path homology calculations to group homology computations. We show some cases where this approach allows us to fully express path homology in terms of group homology. To illustrate this method, we provide a path homology computation for the Cayley digraph of the additive group of rational numbers with a generating set consisting of inverses to factorials. The main tool in our work is a filtered simplicial set associated with a digraph, which we call the filtered nerve of a digraph.</description>

      <title>Explicit Acyclic Models and (Co)Chain Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exploit a uniform recursive procedure using preferred contractions of targets $C_*$ to construct morphisms $B_* \to C_*$ between chain complexes in a wide variety of situations. Examples include classical Alexander-Whitney and Eilenberg-Zilber maps, chain maps related to homology and cohomology operations, operad structure maps for various chain complex operads, and chain maps that define morphisms between operads. The procedure includes functorial chain maps $F_*(X_i) \to K_*(X_i)$, using models for generators of the domain and contractions of $K_*$ applied to these models. Various uniqueness theorems characterize the chain maps produced by our procedures. We give unified extended treatments of the operads known as the Barratt-Eccles operad and the surjection operads. In a subsequent paper we plan to use the results and methods of this paper to establish properties of the Steenrod algebra of mod p cohomology operations at the cochain level. Classical treatments of Steenrod operations used less explicit acyclic model methods to deduce properties of operations at the cohomology level. Our paper is comprehensive and includes many examples and specific results of a somewhat technical nature. But the main point is that a rather easily described explicit procedure clarifies aspects of chain maps defined only up to homotopy that were important in the development of cohomology operations roughly seventy years ago, as well as complicated chain maps related to operad structure maps and operad morphisms developed in a rather ad hoc manner roughly twenty five years ago. Sections 0, 1, and 2 constitute an overview and summary of the paper.</description>

Abstract: We develop Weiss's manifold calculus in the setting of $\infty$-categories, where we allow the target $\infty$-category to be any $\infty$-category with small limits. We will establish the connection between polynomial functors, Kan extensions, and Weiss sheaves, and will classify homogeneous functors. We will also generalize Weiss and Boavida de Brito's theorem to functors taking values in arbitrary $\infty$-categories with small limits.</description>

      <title>Topological actions of Temperley-Lieb algebras and Representation Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.09636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Temperley-Lieb algebras $\textrm{TL}_n(\delta)$ at $\delta = 1$. Since $\delta = 1$, we can consider the multiplicative monoid structure and ask how this monoid acts on topological spaces. Given a monoid action on a topological space, we get an algebra action on each homology group. The main theorem of this paper explicitly deduces the representation structure of the homology groups in terms of a natural filtration associated with our $\textrm{TL}_n$-space. As a corollary of this result, we are able to study stability phenomena. There is a natural way to define representation stability in the context of $\textrm{TL}_n(1)$, and the presence of filtrations enables us to define a notion of topological stability. We are able to deduce that a filtration-stable sequence of $\textrm{TL}_n$-spaces results in representation-stable sequence of homology groups. This can be thought of as the analogue of the statement that the homology of configuration spaces forms a finitely generated $\textrm{FI}$-module.</description>

      <title>Detection of Small Holes by the Scale-Invariant Robust Density-Aware Distance (RDAD) Filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel topological-data-analytical (TDA) method is proposed to distinguish, from noise, small holes surrounded by high-density regions of a probability density function. The proposed method is robust against additive noise and outliers. Traditional TDA tools, like those based on the distance filtration, often struggle to distinguish small features from noise, because both have short persistences. An alternative filtration, called the Robust Density-Aware Distance (RDAD) filtration, is proposed to prolong the persistences of small holes of high-density regions. This is achieved by weighting the distance function by the density in the sense of Bell et al. The concept of distance-to-measure is incorporated to enhance stability and mitigate noise. The persistence-prolonging property and robustness of the proposed filtration are rigorously established, and numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the proposed filtration's utility in identifying small holes.</description>

      <title>634 vertex-transitive and more than $10^{103}$ non-vertex-transitive 27-vertex triangulations of manifolds like the octonionic projective plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08507v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1987 Brehm and K\"uhnel showed that any combinatorial $d$-manifold with less than $3d/2+3$ vertices is PL homeomorphic to the sphere and any combinatorial $d$-manifold with exactly $3d/2+3$ vertices is PL homeomorphic to either the sphere or a manifold like a projective plane in the sense of Eells and Kuiper. The latter possibility may occur for $d\in\{2,4,8,16\}$ only. There exist a unique $6$-vertex triangulation of $\mathbb{RP}^2$, a unique $9$-vertex triangulation of $\mathbb{CP}^2$, and at least three $15$-vertex triangulations of $\mathbb{HP}^2$. However, until now, the question of whether there exists a $27$-vertex triangulation of a manifold like the octonionic projective plane has remained open. We solve this problem by constructing a lot of examples of such triangulations. Namely, we construct $634$ vertex-transitive $27$-vertex combinatorial $16$-manifolds like the octonionic projective plane. Four of them have symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_3^3\rtimes \mathrm{C}_{13}$ of order $351$, and the other $630$ have symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_3^3$ of order $27$. Further, we construct more than $10^{103}$ non-vertex-transitive $27$-vertex combinatorial $16$-manifolds like the octonionic projective plane. Most of them have trivial symmetry group, but there are also symmetry groups $\mathrm{C}_3$, $\mathrm{C}_3^2$, and $\mathrm{C}_{13}$. We conjecture that all the triangulations constructed are PL homeomorphic to the octonionic projective plane $\mathbb{OP}^2$. Nevertheless, we have no proof of this fact so far.</description>
