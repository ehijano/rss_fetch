      <title>Focus Correction in MR thermography for Precise Targeting in Focused Ultrasound Thalamotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To adjust the location of the ablation focus by correcting the spatial discrepancy induced by temperature changes between the target coordinate and the hotspot as seen in MR thermography.
  Methods: A two-step correction procedure was used to account for the chemical and k-space shifts. The first step corrected the spatial shift pixel by pixel using the field map around the focus. The second step calculated the temperature-induced TE variation map to compensate for the center location offset of the focus.
  Results: The approximately 1mm shift caused by chemical shift and k-space center offset was adjusted using the field map and TE error map. The mean temperature error was reduced to -0.05{\deg}C, as opposed to -0.11{\deg}C obtained using only a chemical shift correction.
  Conclusion: Correcting for the spatial shifts of hotspots caused by field gradients and k-space shifts in temperature changes can ensure precise targeting in FUS thalamotomy.</description>

      <title>Rapid, High-resolution and Distortion-free $R_{2}^{*}$ Mapping of Fetal Brain using Multi-echo Radial FLASH and Model-based Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a rapid, high-resolution and distortion-free quantitative $R_{2}^{*}$ mapping technique for fetal brain at 3 T.
  Methods: A 2D multi-echo radial FLASH sequence with blip gradients is adapted for fetal brain data acquisition during maternal free breathing at 3 T. A calibrationless model-based reconstruction with sparsity constraints is developed to jointly estimate water, fat, $R_{2}^{*}$ and $B_{0}$ field maps directly from the acquired k-space data. Validations have been performed on numerical and NIST phantoms and five fetal subjects ranging from 27 weeks to 36 weeks gestation age.
  Results: Both numerical and experimental phantom studies confirm good accuracy and precision of the proposed method. In fetal studies, both the parallel imaging compressed sensing (PICS) technique with a Graph Cut algorithm and the model-based approach proved effective for parameter quantification, with the latter providing enhanced image details. Compared to commonly used multi-echo EPI approaches, the proposed radial technique shows improved spatial resolution (1.1 $\times$ 1.1 $\times$ 3 mm$^{3}$ vs. 2-3 $\times$ 2-3 $\times$ 3 mm$^{3}$) and reduced distortion. Quantitative $R_{2}^{*}$ results confirm good agreement between the two acquisition strategies. Additionally, high-resolution, distortion-free $R_{2}^{*}$-weighted images can be synthesized, offering complementary information to HASTE.
  Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of radial acquisition for motion-robust quantitative $R_{2}^{*}$ mapping of the fetal brain. This proposed multi-echo radial FLASH, combined with calibrationless model-based reconstruction, achieves accurate, distortion-free fetal brain $R_{2}^{*}$ mapping at a nominal resolution of $1.1 \times 1.1 \times 3$ mm$^{3}$ within 2 seconds.</description>

      <title>Mie scattering due to tissue structures in the terahertz regime: Experimental and Monte Carlo verification using diffused polarimetric imaging in highly attenuating tissue phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significance: Changes in the structure of tissue occur in many disease processes, such as the boundaries of cancerous tumors and burn injuries. Spectroscopic and polarimetric alterations of terahertz light caused by Mie scattering patterns has the potential to be a diagnostic marker.
  Aim: We present an analysis of Monte Carlo simulation of Mie scattering of polarized terahertz light from cancerous tumor budding, compare the simulation to experimental results obtained in phantom models, and present an analysis of a polarization-sensitive terahertz scan of an ex vivo porcine burn injury.
  Approach: Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we modeled the changes in diffuse intensity and degree of polarization of broadband off-specular terahertz light due to scattering particles in highly attenuating tissue. We extracted the Mueller matrix of the tissue using this model and analyzed the Lu-Chipman product decomposition matrices. We compared this model to experimental data from four phantoms consisting of polypropylene particles of varying sizes embedded in gelatin. Finally, we induced a full-thickness burn injury in ex vivo porcine skin samples and compared experimental data from burned and healthy regions of the tissue.
  Results: Simulation revealed contrast in the Stokes vectors and Mueller Matrix elements for varying scattering particle sizes. Experimental phantom results showed contrast between different sizes of scattering particles in degree of polarization and diffuse intensity in agreement with Monte Carlo simulation results. Finally, we demonstrated a similar diffused imaging signal contrast between burned and healthy regions of ex vivo porcine skin.
  Conclusion: Polarimetric terahertz imaging has the potential to detect structural changes due to biological disease processes.</description>

      <title>First experimental test of a coded-mask gamma camera for proton therapy monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective. The objective of the presented study was to evaluate the feasibility of a coded-mask (CM) gamma camera for real-time range verification in proton therapy, addressing the need for a precise and efficient method of treatment monitoring.
  Approach. A CM gamma camera prototype was tested in clinical conditions. The setup incorporated a scintillator-based detection system and a structured tungsten collimator. The experiment consisted of the irradiation of PMMA phantom with proton beams of energies ranging from 70.51 to 108.15 MeV. Experimental data were benchmarked against Monte Carlo simulations. The distal falloff position was determined for both experimental data and simulations.
  Main results. The tested CM camera achieved a statistical precision of distal falloff position determination of 1.7 mm for $10^8$ protons, which is consistent with simulation predictions, despite hardware limitations such as non-functional detector pixels. Simulations indicated that a fully operational setup would further improve the performance of the detector. The system demonstrated rate capability sufficient for clinical proton beam intensities and maintained performance without significant dead time.
  Significance. This study validates the potential of the CM gamma camera for real-time proton therapy monitoring. The technology promises to enhance treatment accuracy and patient safety, offering a competitive alternative to existing approaches such as single-slit and multi-slit systems.</description>

      <title>Incomplete Data Multi-Source Static Computed Tomography Reconstruction with Diffusion Priors and Implicit Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dose of X-ray radiation and the scanning time are crucial factors in computed tomography (CT) for clinical applications. In this work, we introduce a multi-source static CT imaging system designed to rapidly acquire sparse view and limited angle data in CT imaging, addressing these critical factors. This linear imaging inverse problem is solved by a conditional generation process within the denoising diffusion image reconstruction framework. The noisy volume data sample generated by the reverse time diffusion process is projected onto the affine set to ensure its consistency to the measured data. To enhance the quality of the reconstruction, the 3D phantom's orthogonal space projector is parameterized implicitly by a neural network. Then, a self-supervised learning algorithm is adopted to optimize the implicit neural representation. Through this multistage conditional generation process, we obtain a new approximate posterior sampling strategy for MSCT volume reconstruction. Numerical experiments are implemented with various imaging settings to verify the effectiveness of our methods for incomplete data MSCT volume reconstruction.</description>

      <title>D-HAT: a Diatom-inspired structure for a Helmet concept Against Trauma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary objective of helmet design continues to be the prevention of traumatic brain injuries. Yet, achieving an optimal user experience, including aspects such as fit, thermal comfort, breathability, waterproofing, and reusability, is increasingly significant. Thus, designing helmets with multifunctional performance represents the latest technological frontier for safety devices. This study draws inspiration from the morphology of Coscinodiscus species diatoms to develop a biomimetic material replicating their cellular structure and multifunctionality. Unlike its biological counterpart, the synthetic material is engineered as the inner liner for multi impact helmets, suited for urban sports and micro mobility applications. The architecture of the material is modeled using computer aided design tools, and its energy absorption capabilities are analyzed through finite element modeling and quasi static compression tests on 3D printed elastomeric samples. Performance optimization is achieved through a parametric approach. The results demonstrate that the material exhibits energy absorption comparable to cellular materials like honeycombs, while offering lightweight properties, breathability, and resistance to atmospheric agents. This biomimetic design marks a significant advancement in high performance safety equipment.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Deep Learning-based Scatter Correction for Total-body PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Long-axial field-of-view (LAFOV) positron emission tomography (PET) systems allow higher sensitivity, with an increased number of detected lines of response induced by a larger angle of acceptance. However this extend angle increase the number of multiple scatters and the scatter contribution within oblique planes. As scattering affects both quality and quantification of the reconstructed image, it is crucial to correct this effect with more accurate methods than the state-of-the-art single scatter simulation (SSS) that can reach its limits with such an extended field-of-view (FOV). In this work, which is an extension of our previous assessment of deep learning-based scatter estimation (DLSE) carried out on a conventional PET system, we aim to evaluate the DLSE method performance on LAFOV total-body PET.
  Approach: The proposed DLSE method based on an convolutional neural network (CNN) U-Net architecture uses emission and attenuation sinograms to estimate scatter sinogram. The network was trained from Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations of XCAT phantoms [18F]-FDG PET acquisitions using a Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra scanner model, with multiple morphologies and dose distributions. We firstly evaluated the method performance on simulated data in both sinogram and image domain by comparing it to the MC ground truth and SSS scatter sinograms. We then tested the method on 7 [18F]-FDG and 7 [18F]-PSMA clinical datasets, and compare it to SSS estimations.
  Results: DLSE showed superior accuracy on phantom data, greater robustness to patient size and dose variations compared to SSS, and better lesion contrast recovery. It also yielded promising clinical results, improving lesion contrasts in [18 F]-FDG datasets and performing consistently with [18F]-PSMA datasets despite no training with [18F]-PSMA.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound Lung Aeration Map via Physics-Aware Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lung ultrasound is a growing modality in clinics for diagnosing and monitoring acute and chronic lung diseases due to its low cost and accessibility. Lung ultrasound works by emitting diagnostic pulses, receiving pressure waves and converting them into radio frequency (RF) data, which are then processed into B-mode images with beamformers for radiologists to interpret. However, unlike conventional ultrasound for soft tissue anatomical imaging, lung ultrasound interpretation is complicated by complex reverberations from the pleural interface caused by the inability of ultrasound to penetrate air. The indirect B-mode images make interpretation highly dependent on reader expertise, requiring years of training, which limits its widespread use despite its potential for high accuracy in skilled hands.
  To address these challenges and democratize ultrasound lung imaging as a reliable diagnostic tool, we propose LUNA, an AI model that directly reconstructs lung aeration maps from RF data, bypassing the need for traditional beamformers and indirect interpretation of B-mode images. LUNA uses a Fourier neural operator, which processes RF data efficiently in Fourier space, enabling accurate reconstruction of lung aeration maps. LUNA offers a quantitative, reader-independent alternative to traditional semi-quantitative lung ultrasound scoring methods. The development of LUNA involves synthetic and real data: We simulate synthetic data with an experimentally validated approach and scan ex vivo swine lungs as real data. Trained on abundant simulated data and fine-tuned with a small amount of real-world data, LUNA achieves robust performance, demonstrated by an aeration estimation error of 9% in ex-vivo lung scans. We demonstrate the potential of reconstructing lung aeration maps from RF data, providing a foundation for improving lung ultrasound reproducibility and diagnostic utility.</description>

      <title>High-Sensitivity Imaging and Modeling of Ultra-Weak Photon Emission in Plants Under Stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-weak photon emission (UPE) is a noninvasive diagnostic tool that effectively reflects the function and health status of plant cells. However, current UPE measurement techniques are limited by resolution and sensitivity, particularly when monitoring different plant species and stress types. This study analyzes the delayed luminescence (DL) properties of Hydrocotyle vulgaris, Arabidopsis leaves, and Ginkgo leaves under both stress and control conditions using an independently developed UPE imaging system. The results showed a significant increase in initial DL intensity and an accelerated oxidative metabolic rate under mechanical injury and oxidative stress. DL decay characteristics were significantly correlated with the plant's physiological state, with stress conditions exhibiting decay curves that closely matched theoretical models. These findings confirm the established correlation between DL and plant stress responses. The high-resolution, low-noise imaging system significantly improves the accuracy of plant physiological state monitoring and provides new insights into the potential of optical signals for non-chemical communication research and agricultural applications. This technology has great potential for monitoring plant growth, assessing environmental stress, and supporting precision agriculture.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Collimator-Detector Response Compensation in High Energy SPECT using 1D Convolutions and Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling of the collimator-detector response (CDR) in SPECT reconstruction enables improved resolution and accuracy, and is thus important for quantitative imaging applications such as dosimetry. The implementation of CDR modeling, however, can become a computational bottleneck when there are substantial components of septal penetration and scatter in the acquired data, since a direct convolution-based approach requires large 2D kernels. This work proposes a 1D convolution and rotation-based CDR model that reduces reconstruction times but maintains consistency with models that employ 2D convolutions. To enable open-source development and use of these models in image reconstruction, we release a SPECTPSFToolbox repository for the PyTomography project on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Design, Construction, and Test of Compact, Distributed-Charge, X-Band Accelerator Systems that Enable Image-Guided, VHEE FLASH Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design and optimization of laser-Compton x-ray systems based on compact distributed charge accelerator structures can enable micron-scale imaging of disease and the concomitant production of beams of Very High Energy Electrons (VHEEs) capable of producing FLASH-relevant dose rates. The physics of laser-Compton x-ray scattering ensures that the scattered x-rays follow exactly the trajectory of the incident electrons, thus providing a route to image-guided, VHEE FLASH radiotherapy. The keys to a compact architecture capable of producing both laser-Compton x-rays and VHEEs are the use of X-band RF accelerator structures which have been demonstrated to operate with over 100 MeV/m acceleration gradients. The operation of these structures in a distributed charge mode in which each radiofrequency (RF) cycle of the drive RF pulse is filled with a low-charge, high-brightness electron bunch is enabled by the illumination of a high-brightness photogun with a train of UV laser pulses synchronized to the frequency of the underlying accelerator system. The UV pulse trains are created by a patented pulse synthesis approach which utilizes the RF clock of the accelerator to phase and amplitude modulate a narrow band continuous wave (CW) seed laser. In this way it is possible to produce up to 10 $\mu$A of average beam current from the accelerator. Such high current from a compact accelerator enables production of sufficient x-rays via laser-Compton scattering for clinical imaging and does so from a machine of "clinical" footprint. At the same time, the production of 1000 or greater individual micro-bunches per RF pulse enables &gt; 10 nC of charge to be produced in a macrobunch of &lt; 100 ns. The design, construction, and test of the 100-MeV class prototype system in Irvine, CA is also presented.</description>
