      <title>An Introductory Survey of Recursions in the Computation of Resistance Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an introduction and expository account of a beautiful, current, and active application of recursions to the computation of resistance distance. Resistance distance, also referred to as effective resistance, is a well-known graph metric that arises naturally by considering a graph as an electrical circuit; heuristically resistance distance measures both the number of paths between two vertices in a graph and the cost of each path. This topic finds applications in a rich array of fields including social, biological, ecological, and transportation networks, chemistry, graph theory, numerical linear algebra, and engineering. A variety of methods are used in the field to determine resistance distance including recursive, mathematical, and graphical techniques. Sequences familiar to the readers of the Fibonacci Quarterly such as the Fibonacci and Lucas sequences appear quite often in results in the literature. Twenty five to forty years ago there were a handful of papers on resistance that appeared in the Fibonacci Quarterly and the Proceedings and recently papers on the subject have appeared again. It is hoped that this introductory expository account will interest readers of the Quarterly to renew interest in this current and active field.</description>

      <title>Mathematical reflections on modified fractional counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make precise what is meant by stating that modified fractional counting (MFC) lies between full counting and complete-normalized fractional counting by proving that for individuals, the MFC-values are weighted geometric averages of these two extremes. There are two essentially different ways to consider the production of institutes in multi-institutional articles, namely participation and actual number of contributions. Starting from an idea published by Sivertsen, Rousseau and Zhang in 2019 we present three formulae for measuring the production of institutes in multi-institutional articles. It is shown that the one proposed by Sivertsen, Rousseau and Zhang is situated between the two other ways. Less obvious properties of MFC are proven using the majorization order.</description>

      <title>Journey of Lars Ahlfors' Fields Medal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the story of the first Fields Medal awarded to Lars Ahlfors. It was smuggled out of Finland in 1944 during World War Two, and returned to Helsinki in 2004. It's based on an interview with Ahlfors' second daughter Vanessa Gruen, and existing publications.</description>

      <title>Descriptions of Cantor Sets: A Set-Theoretic Survey and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey synthesizes the principal descriptive set-theoretic perspectives on deterministic Cantor sets on the real line and charts directions for future study. After recounting their historical genesis and compiling an up-to-date taxonomy, we review the Borel hierarchy and four hierarchically ordered representations-general, nested, iterated-function-system (IFS), and q-ary expansion-presented from the most general to the most specific set-theoretic description of deterministic Cantor sets. We then present explicit and recursive descriptions for two thin families of measure-zero Cantor sets and an augmented "tick" family of positive measure, respectively, showing that the classical middle-third set lies in the intersection of all three families of after-mentioned Cantor sets. The survey closes by isolating several open problems in four directions, aiming to provide mathematicians with a coherent platform for further descriptive set-theoretic investigations into Cantor-type sets on the real line.</description>

      <title>From Euler to AI: Unifying Formulas for Mathematical Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The constant $\pi$ has fascinated scholars throughout the centuries, inspiring numerous formulas for its evaluation, such as infinite sums and continued fractions. Despite their individual significance, many of the underlying connections among formulas remain unknown, missing unifying theories that could unveil deeper understanding. The absence of a unifying theory reflects a broader challenge across math and science: knowledge is typically accumulated through isolated discoveries, while deeper connections often remain hidden. In this work, we present an automated framework for the unification of mathematical formulas. Our system combines large language models (LLMs) for systematic formula harvesting, an LLM-code feedback loop for validation, and a novel symbolic algorithm for clustering and eventual unification. We demonstrate this methodology on the hallmark case of $\pi$, an ideal testing ground for symbolic unification. Applying this approach to 455,050 arXiv papers, we validate 407 distinct formulas for $\pi$ and prove relations between 381 (94%) of them, of which 188 (46%) can be derived from a single mathematical object$\unicode{x2014}$linking canonical formulas by Euler, Gauss, Brouncker, and newer ones from algorithmic discoveries by the Ramanujan Machine. Our method generalizes to other constants, including $e$, $\zeta(3)$, and Catalan's constant, demonstrating the potential of AI-assisted mathematics to uncover hidden structures and unify knowledge across domains.</description>
