      <title>On-chip twisted hollow-core light cages: enhancing planar photonics with 3D nanoprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted optical fibers are a promising platform for manipulating circularly polarized light and orbital angular momentum beams for applications such as nonlinear frequency conversion, optical communication, or chiral sensing. However, integration into chip-scale technology is challenging because twisted fibers are incompatible with planar photonics and the achieved twist rates are limited. Here, we address these challenges by introducing the concept of 3D-nanoprinted on-chip twisted hollow-core light cages. We show theoretically and experimentally that geometrical twisting of light cages forces the fundamental core mode of a given handedness to couple with selected higher-order core modes, resulting in strong circular dichroism (CD). These chiral resonances result from the angular momentum harmonics of the fundamental mode, allowing us to predict their spectral locations and the occurrence of circular birefringence. Twisted light cages enable very high twist rates and CD, exceeding those of twisted hollow-core fibers by more than two orders of magnitude (twist period: 90 $\mu$m, CD: 0.8 dB/mm). Moreover, the unique cage design provides lateral access to the central core region, enabling future applications in chiral spectroscopy. Therefore, the presented concept opens a path for translating twisted fiber research to on-chip technology, resulting in a new platform for integrated chiral photonics.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Laser-Fabricated Fluoride Glass Waveguides with Exceptionally High Refractive Index Change for Mid-Infrared Integrated Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study reports the successful fabrication of high-positive refractive index change waveguides, exceeding 0.02 in fluoride glasses, marking a significant advancement in integrated optical components for visible to mid-infrared applications. This research overcomes longstanding challenges in direct-write photonics and therefore enables the realization of true 3D geometries in optical elements, access to novel visible lasing wavelengths typically suppressed in high phonon hosts, and the miniaturization of mid-infrared optical devices. The investigation into the waveguides' origin attributes the exceptionally high index change to material densification driven by the migration of specific elements, mainly barium, within the glass composition. These waveguides, characterized by low insertion losses, and highly customizable V-numbers evidenced by multimode operation at 3.5 um, offers substantial potential for chip laser technology and the creation of advanced optical devices for sensing and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Ultra-wideband integrated microwave photonic multi-parameter measurement system on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on microwave signal measurement techniques is risen, driven by the expanding urgent demands of wireless communication, global positioning systems, remote sensing and 6G networks. In stark contrast with traditional electronic-based realization, the implementations of microwave signal measurement systems based on integrated compact photonic chip have exhibited distinct advantages in high operation bandwidth, light weight, and strong immunity to electromagnetic interference. However, although numerous integrated microwave photonic signal measurement systems have been reported, measurement bandwidth of the majority of them is still below 30 GHz due to the bandwidth limitation of electro-optical modulators (EOMs). Furthermore, previous studies often are more focused on the measurement of one single parameter (typically the frequency) of microwave signals, which has hindered their practical application in complex situations. Here, an integrated photonic microwave multi-parameter measurement system composed of microwave frequency measurement module and microwave phase amplitude measurement module based on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform is reported. Utilizing this system, not only the ultra-high bandwidth (up to 60GHz) of microwave frequency, phase and amplitude measurement with low root-mean-squares errors (450MHz, 3.43{\deg} and 1.64% of the measurement for frequency, phase and amplitude, respectively), but also the time-domain reconstruction of sinusoidal microwave signals is achieved. This demonstration further broadens the application of integrated TFLN photonic devices in microwave signal measurement technology to address the bandwidth bottleneck of the ever-growing microwave networks in the future information society.</description>

      <title>Low-loss twist-tunable in-plane anisotropic polaritonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials supporting phonon polaritons (PhPs) - light coupled to lattice vibrations - have gathered significant interest because of their intrinsic anisotropy and low losses. In particular, $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ supports PhPs with in-plane anisotropic propagation, which has been exploited to tune the optical response of twisted bilayers and trilayers. Additionally, various studies have explored the realization of polaritonic crystals (PCs) - lattices with periods comparable to the polariton wavelength -. PCs consisting of hole arrays etched in $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ slabs exhibit Bragg resonances dependent on the angle between the crystallographic axes and the lattice vectors. However, such PC concept, with a fixed orientation and size of its geometrical parameters, constrains practical applications and introduces additional scattering losses due to invasive fabrication processes. Here we demonstrate a novel PC concept that overcomes these limitations, enabling low-loss optical tuning. It comprises a rotatable pristine $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ layer located on a periodic hole array fabricated in a metallic layer. Our design prevents degradation of the $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ optical properties caused by fabrication, preserving its intrinsic low-loss and in-plane anisotropic propagation of PhPs. The resulting PC exhibits rotation of the Bloch modes, which is experimentally visualized by scanning near-field microscopy. In addition, we experimentally determine the polaritons momentum and reconstruct their band structure. These results pave the way for mechanically tunable nanooptical components based on polaritons for potential lasing, sensing, or energy harvesting applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Timetronics with Photonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic driving of systems of particles can create crystalline structures in time. Such systems can be used to study solid-state physics phenomena in the time domain. In addition, it is possible to engineer the wave-number band structure of optical systems and to realize photonic time crystals by periodic temporal modulation of the material properties of the electromagnetic wave propagation medium. We introduce here a versatile averaged-permittivity approach which empowers emulating various condensed matter phases in the time dimension in a traveling wave resonator. This is achieved by utilizing temporal modulation of permittivity within a small segment of the resonator and the spatial shape of the segment. The required frequency and depth of the modulation are experimentally achievable, opening a pathway for research into the practical realisation of crystalline structures in time utilising microwave and optical systems.</description>

      <title>Mapping the nanoscale optical topological textures with a fiber-integrated plasmonic probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically protected quasiparticles in optics have received increasing research attention recently, as they provide novel degree of freedom to manipulate light-matter interactions and exhibiting excellent potential in nanometrology and ultrafast vector imaging. However, the characterization of the full three-dimensional vectorial structures of the topological texures at the nanoscale has remained a challenge. Here, we propose a novel probe based on the fiber taper-silver nanowire waveguide structure to achieve super-resolution mapping of the topological textures. Based on the mode selection rules, the three-dimensional decomposed electric fields in both the far-field and near-field are directly collected and reconstructed without postprocessing algorithms, clearly visualizing the topological texures formed in free space and evanescent waves respectively. The fiber-integrated probe is further demonstrated to be robust and broadband. This approach holds promise for the characterization of more sophisticated topology in optical field, which may allow for advance applications in optical information processing and data storage.</description>

      <title>All-optical Fourier neural network using partially coherent light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical neural networks present distinct advantages over traditional electrical counterparts, such as accelerated data processing and reduced energy consumption. While coherent light is conventionally employed in optical neural networks, our study proposes harnessing spatially incoherent light in all-optical Fourier neural networks. Contrary to numerical predictions of declining target recognition accuracy with increased incoherence, our experimental results demonstrate a surprising outcome: improved accuracy with incoherent light. We attribute this unexpected enhancement to spatially incoherent light's ability to alleviate experimental errors like diffraction rings, laser speckle, and edge effects. Our controlled experiments introduced spatial incoherence by passing monochromatic light through a spatial light modulator featuring a dynamically changing random phase array. These findings underscore partially coherent light's potential to optimize optical neural networks, delivering dependable and efficient solutions for applications demanding consistent accuracy and robustness across diverse conditions.</description>

      <title>Ultrashort laser-induced nuclear reactions: initiating decay of helium nuclei and subsequent fusion reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method to construct particle accelerators targeting light atoms and nuclei using high-power femtosecond laser pulses. Initially, we confine light atoms within the laser pulse envelope due to longitudinal polarization forces, allowing them to acquire kinetic energies of several GeV. Subsequently, an external electric field separates the nuclei at the cathode, concentrating helium nuclei in a small area. The kinetic energy of the 1.88 GeV impacts, exceeding the alpha particle binding energy (28 MeV) by two orders of magnitude, induces powerful gamma radiation and neutron emission from decay processes. This experiment marks a demonstration of a laser-induced decay method for helium nuclei for the first time. Moreover, helium isotopes or deuterium nuclei trapped on the cathode show significantly reduced Coulomb repulsion, enabling subsequent nuclear fusion reactions and substantial nuclear energy release.</description>

      <title>Comment on Room-temperature spontaneous superradiance from single diamond nanocrystals [Nat. Commun. 8, 1205 (2017)]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper by C. Bradac et al. [Nat. Commun. 8, 1205 (2017)] discusses room-temperature superradiance from NV color centers in diamonds. It presents a new model intended to reflect experimental characteristics of this phenomenon. To validate the model, the authors provide experimental results that are subsequently compared with numerical calculations derived from the scheme. Motivated by our own experiments with the fluorescence of similar NV samples, we attempted to create a theoretical model to accurately describe experimental systems. Initially, we aimed to incorporate the numerical equations from Bradac et al.'s paper's supplement into our own theoretical framework. However, we encountered numerous issues resulting in non-physical results such as negative photon counts or non-zero asymptotic fluorescence intensity. We identified these inconsistencies and proposed amendments to rectify them. We have developed our own framework by correctly reinterpreting the terms of the master equation. The resulting formulas produce physically meaningful results consistent with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Logarithmically complex rigorous Fourier space solution to the 1D grating diffraction problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rigorous solution of the grating diffraction problem is a fundamental step in many scientific fields and industrial applications ranging from the study of the fundamental properties of metasurfaces to the simulation of lithography masks. Fourier space methods, such as the Fourier Modal Method, are established tools for the analysis of the electromagnetic properties of periodic structures, but are too computationally demanding to be directly applied to large and multiscale optical structures. This work focuses on pushing the limits of rigorous computations of periodic electromagnetic structures by adapting a powerful tensor compression technique called the tensor train decomposition. We have found that the millions and billions of numbers produced by standard discretization schemes are inherently excessive for storing the information about diffraction problems required for computations with a given accuracy, and we show that a logarithmically growing amount of information is sufficient for reliable rigorous solution of the Maxwell's equations on an example of large period multiscale 1D grating structures.</description>

      <title>THz Second and Third Harmonic Generation in PdCoO$_2$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz high harmonic generation (THz HHG) is a common property of nonlinear systems. Recently it has been used to investigate fundamental principles that govern transport and nonlinear dynamics in novel quantum materials like graphene, Dirac semimetals or high-temperature superconductors. Here, we report on the observation of exceptionally large THz second harmonic and third harmonic generation in thin films of the highly conducting delafossite PdCoO$_2$ down to low temperatures. The growth of this material on offcut substrate allows for a significant enhancement of the third harmonic intensity compared to ordinary $c$-axis grown thin films. Furthermore, it appears to be a necessity for the observation of THz second harmonic generation. We model the temperature dependence of the third harmonic generation by means of Boltzmann transport theory and provide an explanation for the second harmonic generation by comparing the system to the electric field induced second harmonic generation. The present investigation thus provides an important contribution to the ongoing discussion of low temperature origins of THz HHG and might serve as a new platform for THz high harmonic applications.</description>

      <title>Two-plasmon decay instability and 3/2 harmonic generation in inhomogeneous magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-plasmon decay instability emerges as the parametric decay of laser beams into two plasma waves which is expected for hohlraum in inertial confinement fusion. The behavior of this instability in magnetized plasma is investigated in the present study where the thermal effects are considered. The study demonstrates that the applying of a dc magnetic field significantly increases the rate at which the instability develops, while the increase of electron temperature has the opposite effect. The generation of 3/2 harmonic, which results from the beating of the incident laser and plasma wave, is also studied in the present study. The intensity of this harmonic, which appears in the spectrum as a sideband derived analytically, indicates that an increase in the dc magnetic field increases the intensity of this sideband.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce different chiro-optical structures composed of single, dimer, or trimer arrangements of plasmonic nanoantennae that can actively modulate the chiral transmission of light through the application of an external magnetic field. Specifically, we explore monomers, dimers, and trimers of trapezoidal nanoantennae, as well as trimer configurations of triangular nanoantennae, using Au nanoparticles as the plasmonic elements. To enable active magnetic control over the chiro-optical response in these chiral plasmonic systems, a single Ni nanoparticle is incorporated as the active magneto-plasmonic element. Our findings confirm the chirality of all proposed structures and demonstrate the feasibility of magnetically manipulating the chiro-optical response within these configurations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Pair Generation in Nonlinear Metasurfaces with Mixed and Pure Photon Polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are highly effective at manipulating classical light in the linear regime; however, effectively controlling the polarization of non-classical light generated from nonlinear resonant metasurfaces remains a challenge. Here, we present a solution by achieving polarization engineering of frequency-nondegenerate biphotons emitted via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in GaAs metasurfaces, where quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) resonances were utilized for boosting the biphoton generation. By performing a comprehensive polarization tomography, we demonstrate that the polarization of the emitted photons directly reflects the qBIC mode's far-field properties. Furthermore, we show that both the type of qBIC mode and the symmetry of the meta-atoms can be tailored to control each single-photon polarization state, and that the subsequent two-photon polarization states are nearly separable, offering potential applications in the heralded generation of single photons with adjustable polarization. This work provides a significant step towards utilizing metasurfaces to not only generate quantum light but also engineer their polarization, a critical aspect for future quantum technologies.</description>
