      <title>Autonomous Underground Freight Transport Systems -- The Future of Urban Logistics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a concept for an autonomous underground freight transport system for Hanover, Germany. To evaluate the resulting system changes in overall traffic flows from an environmental perspective, we carried out an agent-based traffic simulation with MATSim. Our simulations indicate comparatively low impacts on network-wide traffic volumes. Local CO2 emissions, on the other hand, could be reduced by up to 32 %. In total, the shuttle system can replace more than 18 % of the vehicles in use with conventional combustion engines. Thus, an autonomous underground freight transportation system can contribute to environmentally friendly and economical transportation of urban goods on the condition of cooperative use of the system.</description>

      <title>Cultural evolution in populations of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research in cultural evolution aims at providing causal explanations for the change of culture over time. Over the past decades, this field has generated an important body of knowledge, using experimental, historical, and computational methods. While computational models have been very successful at generating testable hypotheses about the effects of several factors, such as population structure or transmission biases, some phenomena have so far been more complex to capture using agent-based and formal models. This is in particular the case for the effect of the transformations of social information induced by evolved cognitive mechanisms. We here propose that leveraging the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior may be fruitful to address this gap. On top of being an useful approximation of human cultural dynamics, multi-agents models featuring generative agents are also important to study for their own sake. Indeed, as artificial agents are bound to participate more and more to the evolution of culture, it is crucial to better understand the dynamics of machine-generated cultural evolution. We here present a framework for simulating cultural evolution in populations of LLMs, allowing the manipulation of variables known to be important in cultural evolution, such as network structure, personality, and the way social information is aggregated and transformed. The software we developed for conducting these simulations is open-source and features an intuitive user-interface, which we hope will help to build bridges between the fields of cultural evolution and generative artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Beyond Joint Demonstrations: Personalized Expert Guidance for Efficient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms face the challenge of efficient exploration due to the exponential increase in the size of the joint state-action space. While demonstration-guided learning has proven beneficial in single-agent settings, its direct applicability to MARL is hindered by the practical difficulty of obtaining joint expert demonstrations. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of personalized expert demonstrations, tailored for each individual agent or, more broadly, each individual type of agent within a heterogeneous team. These demonstrations solely pertain to single-agent behaviors and how each agent can achieve personal goals without encompassing any cooperative elements, thus naively imitating them will not achieve cooperation due to potential conflicts. To this end, we propose an approach that selectively utilizes personalized expert demonstrations as guidance and allows agents to learn to cooperate, namely personalized expert-guided MARL (PegMARL). This algorithm utilizes two discriminators: the first provides incentives based on the alignment of policy behavior with demonstrations, and the second regulates incentives based on whether the behavior leads to the desired objective. We evaluate PegMARL using personalized demonstrations in both discrete and continuous environments. The results demonstrate that PegMARL learns near-optimal policies even when provided with suboptimal demonstrations, and outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in solving coordinated tasks. We also showcase PegMARL's capability to leverage joint demonstrations in the StarCraft scenario and converge effectively even with demonstrations from non-co-trained policies.</description>

      <title>Federated Deep Q-Learning and 5G load balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in cellular network technology, base station (BS) load balancing remains a persistent problem. Although centralized resource allocation methods can address the load balancing problem, it still remains an NP-hard problem. In this research, we study how federated deep Q learning can be used to inform each user equipment (UE) of the each BS's load conditions. Federated deep Q learning's load balancing enables intelligent UEs to independently select the best BS while also limiting the amount of private information exposed to the network.
  In this study, we propose and analyze a federated deep Q learning load balancing system, which is implemented using the Open-RAN xAPP framework and the near-Real Time Radio Interface Controller (near-RT RIC). Our simulation results indicate that compared to the maximum Signal-To-Noise-Ratio (MAX-SINR) method currently used by UEs, our proposed deep Q learning model can consistently provide better High average UE quality of service</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Optimization Using Adaptive Distributed Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) environment is known to be dynamic and distributed, where participants (vehicle users, operators, etc.) have multiple, changing and possibly conflicting objectives. Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are commonly applied to optimize ITS applications such as resource management and offloading, most RL algorithms focus on single objectives. In many situations, converting a multi-objective problem into a single-objective one is impossible, intractable or insufficient, making such RL algorithms inapplicable. We propose a multi-objective, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm with high learning efficiency and low computational requirements, which automatically triggers adaptive few-shot learning in a dynamic, distributed and noisy environment with sparse and delayed reward. We test our algorithm in an ITS environment with edge cloud computing. Empirical results show that the algorithm is quick to adapt to new environments and performs better in all individual and system metrics compared to the state-of-the-art benchmark. Our algorithm also addresses various practical concerns with its modularized and asynchronous online training method. In addition to the cloud simulation, we test our algorithm on a single-board computer and show that it can make inference in 6 milliseconds.</description>

      <title>Safe Road-Crossing by Autonomous Wheelchairs: a Novel Dataset and its Experimental Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe road-crossing by self-driving vehicles is a crucial problem to address in smart-cities. In this paper, we introduce a multi-sensor fusion approach to support road-crossing decisions in a system composed by an autonomous wheelchair and a flying drone featuring a robust sensory system made of diverse and redundant components. To that aim, we designed an analytical danger function based on explainable physical conditions evaluated by single sensors, including those using machine learning and artificial vision. As a proof-of-concept, we provide an experimental evaluation in a laboratory environment, showing the advantages of using multiple sensors, which can improve decision accuracy and effectively support safety assessment. We made the dataset available to the scientific community for further experimentation. The work has been developed in the context of an European project named REXASI-PRO, which aims to develop trustworthy artificial intelligence for social navigation of people with reduced mobility.</description>

      <title>Trust AI Regulation? Discerning users are vital to build trust and effective AI regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is general agreement that some form of regulation is necessary both for AI creators to be incentivised to develop trustworthy systems, and for users to actually trust those systems. But there is much debate about what form these regulations should take and how they should be implemented. Most work in this area has been qualitative, and has not been able to make formal predictions. Here, we propose that evolutionary game theory can be used to quantitatively model the dilemmas faced by users, AI creators, and regulators, and provide insights into the possible effects of different regulatory regimes. We show that creating trustworthy AI and user trust requires regulators to be incentivised to regulate effectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of two mechanisms that can achieve this. The first is where governments can recognise and reward regulators that do a good job. In that case, if the AI system is not too risky for users then some level of trustworthy development and user trust evolves. We then consider an alternative solution, where users can condition their trust decision on the effectiveness of the regulators. This leads to effective regulation, and consequently the development of trustworthy AI and user trust, provided that the cost of implementing regulations is not too high. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the effect of different regulatory regimes from an evolutionary game theoretic perspective.</description>

      <title>A Universal In-Place Reconfiguration Algorithm for Sliding Cube-Shaped Robots in a Quadratic Number of Moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0802.3414</link>
      <description>arXiv:0802.3414v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the modular robot reconfiguration problem, we are given $n$ cube-shaped modules (or robots) as well as two configurations, i.e., placements of the $n$ modules so that their union is face-connected. The goal is to find a sequence of moves that reconfigures the modules from one configuration to the other using "sliding moves," in which a module slides over the face or edge of a neighboring module, maintaining connectivity of the configuration at all times.
  For many years it has been known that certain module configurations in this model require at least $\Omega(n^2)$ moves to reconfigure between them. In this paper, we introduce the first universal reconfiguration algorithm -- i.e., we show that any $n$-module configuration can reconfigure itself into any specified $n$-module configuration using just sliding moves. Our algorithm achieves reconfiguration in $O(n^2)$ moves, making it asymptotically tight. We also present a variation that reconfigures in-place, it ensures that throughout the reconfiguration process, all modules, except for one, will be contained in the union of the bounding boxes of the start and end configuration.</description>

      <title>Approximating Nash Equilibria in Normal-Form Games via Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the first loss function for approximate Nash equilibria of normal-form games that is amenable to unbiased Monte Carlo estimation. This construction allows us to deploy standard non-convex stochastic optimization techniques for approximating Nash equilibria, resulting in novel algorithms with provable guarantees. We complement our theoretical analysis with experiments demonstrating that stochastic gradient descent can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Transforming Competition into Collaboration: The Revolutionary Role of Multi-Agent Systems and Language Models in Modern Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores the dynamic influence of computational entities based on multi-agent systems theory (SMA) combined with large language models (LLM), which are characterized by their ability to simulate complex human interactions, as a possibility to revolutionize human user interaction from the use of specialized artificial agents to support everything from operational organizational processes to strategic decision making based on applied knowledge and human orchestration. Previous investigations reveal that there are limitations, particularly in the autonomous approach of artificial agents, especially when dealing with new challenges and pragmatic tasks such as inducing logical reasoning and problem solving. It is also considered that traditional techniques, such as the stimulation of chains of thoughts, require explicit human guidance. In our approach we employ agents developed from large language models (LLM), each with distinct prototyping that considers behavioral elements, driven by strategies that stimulate the generation of knowledge based on the use case proposed in the scenario (role-play) business, using a discussion approach between agents (guided conversation). We demonstrate the potential of developing agents useful for organizational strategies, based on multi-agent system theories (SMA) and innovative uses based on large language models (LLM based), offering a differentiated and adaptable experiment to different applications, complexities, domains, and capabilities from LLM.</description>
