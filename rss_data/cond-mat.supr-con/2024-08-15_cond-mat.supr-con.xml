      <title>Evidence of P-wave Pairing in K2Cr3As3 Superconductors from Phase-sensitive Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: P-wave superconductors hold immense promise for both fundamental physics and practical applications due to their unusual pairing symmetry and potential topological superconductivity. However, the exploration of the p-wave superconductors has proved to be a complex endeavor. Not only are they rare in nature but also the identification of p-wave superconductors has been an arduous task in history. For example, phase-sensitive measurement, an experimental technique which can provide conclusive evidence for unconventional pairing, has not been implemented successfully to identify p-wave superconductors. Here, we study a recently discovered family of superconductors, A2Cr3As3 (A = K, Rb, Cs), which were proposed theoretically to be a candidate of p-wave superconductors. We fabricate superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) on exfoliated K2Cr3As3, and perform the phase-sensitive measurement. We observe that such SQUIDs exhibit a pronounced second-order harmonic component sin(2{\phi}) in the current-phase relation, suggesting the admixture of 0- and {\pi}-phase. By carefully examining the magnetic field dependence of the oscillation patterns of critical current and Shapiro steps under microwave irradiation, we reveal a crossover from 0- to {\pi}-dominating phase state and conclude that the existence of the {\pi}-phase is in favor of the p-wave pairing symmetry in K2Cr3As3.</description>

      <title>Ternary superhydrides under pressure of Anderson's theorem: Near-record superconductivity in (La,Sc)H$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lanthanum-hydrogen system and its derivatives remain among the most promising for achieving room-temperature superconductivity. In this study, we examined the formation of ternary lanthanum-scandium superhydrides at pressures up to 220 GPa. The primary product of the LaSc alloy's reaction with hydrogen is newly discovered cubic (La,Sc)H$_{12}$, demonstrating clear superconducting transition in all six channels of the van der Pauw scheme below 244-248 K. In this compound with an unusually large unit cell volume, virtually no magnetoresistance was observed in fields up to 68 Tesla. Synthesized samples of (La,Sc)H$_{12}$ demonstrate pronounced superconducting diode and SQUID-like effects at a record high temperature of 226 K. Furthermore, our analysis revealed the formation of lower hexagonal polyhydrides (La,Sc)H$_{6-7}$, which could potentially account for the anomaly in electrical resistance observed near 274 K. This anomalous behavior may be of a superconducting nature, since low-temperature diffraction studies indicate the absence of corresponding structural phase transitions in La-Sc polyhydrides.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Correlations and Pairing Tendencies of the Hybrid Stacking Nickelate Superlattice La$_7$Ni$_5$O$_{17}$ (La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$) under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent rapid progress in high-$T_c$ nickelate superconductors, we comprehensively study the physical properties of the alternating bilayer trilayer stacking nickelate La$_7$Ni$_5$O$_{17}$. The high-symmetry phase of this material, without the tilting of oxygen octahedra, is not stable at ambient conditions but becomes stable under high pressure, where a small hole pocket $\gamma_0$, composed of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states in the trilayer sublattice, appears. This pocket was identified in our previous work for trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ as important to develop superconductivity. Moreover, using random-phase approximation calculations, we find a leading $s^\pm$ pairing state for the high-symmetry phase under pressure with similar pairing strength as that obtained previously for the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ compound, suggesting a similar or higher superconducting transition temperature $T_c$. In addition, we find that the dominant magnetic fluctuations in the system driving this pairing state have antiferromagnetic structure both in-plane and between the planes of the top and bottom trilayer and bilayer sublattices, while the middle trilayer is magnetically decoupled.</description>

      <title>First-principles exploration of the pressure dependent physical properties of Sn4Au: a superconducting topological semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principles investigation within the density functional theory is utilized to explore the physical properties of a superconducting topological semimetal Sn4Au under pressure within the range of 0-5 GPa. According to the computed elastic moduli, the compound under study is classified as ductile and applied pressure enhances the ductility. The compound has very high level of dry lubricity and machinability index. All the anisotropy factors demonstrate an elastically anisotropic nature. The electronic properties are investigated in view of the electronic band structure and density of states. The band structure reveals the topological semimetallic feature of Sn4Au while the density of states at the Fermi level decreases gradually with increasing pressure. Both ionic and covalent bondings are observed in Sn4Au. Optical parameters of Sn4Au are investigated at different pressures. The characteristic peaks in reflectivity, refractive index and photoconductivity exhibit a shift towards higher energy with increasing pressure for all polarizations of the electric field vector. The absorption coefficient and reflectivity spectra designate Sn4Au as a suitable system for optoelectronic applications. Moreover, the pressure dependent shifts in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, the changes in the Debye temperature, and pressure induced variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.</description>

      <title>A method for reconstructing the self-energy from the spectral function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question about the nature of quantum materials such as High-T$_c$ systems remain open to date -- it is unclear whether they are (some variety of) Fermi liquids, or (some variety of) non Fermi liquids. A direct avenue to determine their nature is to study the (imaginary part of the) self-energy at low energies. Here we present a method to extract this low $\omega$ self-energy from experimentally derived spectral functions. The method seems suited for implementation with high quality angle resolved photoemission data. It is based on a helpful Theorem proposed here, which assures us that the method has minimal (or vanishing) error at the lowest energies. We provide numerical examples showing that a few popular model systems yield distinguishably different low energy self-energies.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a condensate with finite-energy Cooper pairing in hybrid exciton/superconductor systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study theoretically a setup consisting of excitons formed in two valleys, with proximity-induced Cooper pairing, different in the conduction and valence bands. Due to the combination of a Coulomb interaction with superconducting proximity effects, Cooper pairing between electrons from conduction and valence bands from different valleys is formed. This finite-energy intervalley Cooper pairing has both even- and odd-frequency contributions. We show that there is a phase transition into the formation of a robust macroscopic condensate of such Cooper pairs and present characteristics of the corresponding Higgs modes.</description>

Abstract: Among known materials, hydride superconductors have the highest critical temperatures and are very promising as a basis for electronic sensors. Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), due to its unique sensitivity to magnetic fields, is the most important application of superconductors in microelectronics. In this work, we describe a direct current SQUID made of lanthanum-cerium superhydride (La, Ce)H$_{10}$ at a pressure of 148 GPa, with an operating temperature of 179 K and a bias current of about 2 mA. When placing (La, Ce)H$_{10}$ in a modulated magnetic field (0.1-0.005 Hz, 5 G), we observed the generation of higher harmonics up to 18${\nu}$$_0$ and a periodic dependence of the sample resistance on the magnetic flux density R ${\propto}$ sin(${\pi}$${\Phi}$/${\Phi}$$_0$). We demonstrate that the (La, Ce)H$_{10}$ SQUID with a size of about 6 ${\mu}$m, operates in the mode of low thermal fluctuations and can be used to detect magnetic fields below 0.1 G. Our findings pave the road to more advanced applications of the Josephson effect and SQUIDs made of hydride superconductors.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure, self-doping, and superconducting instability in the alternating single-layer trilayer stacking nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently proposed alternating single-layer trilayer stacking structure for the nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we comprehensively study this system using {\it ab initio} and random-phase approximation techniques. Our analysis unveils similarities between this novel La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ structure and other Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate superconductors, such as a similar charge-transfer gap value and orbital-selective behavior of the $e_g$ orbitals. However, different from other Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate superconductors, we do not observe any obvious reconstruction of the Fermi surface from ambient conditions (Cmmm phase) to high pressures (P4/mmm phase). Pressure primarily increases the bandwidths of the Ni $e_g$ bands, suggesting an enhancement of the itinerant properties of those $e_g$ states. Furthermore, the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital also has a layer-selective behavior because the antibonding-bonding-nonbonding splitting can only be obtained in the trilayer. In addition, we observe a "self-doping" effect from the trilayer to the single-layer sublattices and this effect will be enhanced by overall electron doping. Moreover, we find a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state that is restricted to the single-layer. Because the effective coupling between the single layers is very weak -- due to the non-superconducting trilayer in between -- this suggests that the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in this structure should be much lower than in the bilayer structure.</description>

      <title>Disorder-dependent superconducting pairing symmetry in doped graphene</title>

Abstract: Disorder and doping have profound effects on the intrinsic physical mechanisms of superconductivity. In this paper, we employed the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method to investigate the symmetry-allowed superconducting orders on the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice within the Hubbard model, using doped graphene as the carrier, focusing their response to bond disorder. Specifically, we calculated the pairing susceptibility and effective pairing interactions for the $d+id$ wave and extended $s$-wave pairings for different electron densities and disorder strengths. Our calculations show that at high electron densities, increased disorder strength may lead to a transform from $d+id$ wave dominance to extended $s$ wave dominance. However, at lower electron densities, neither of the two superconducting pairings appears under larger disorder strength. Our calculations may contribute to a further understanding of the superconducting behavior in doped materials affected by disorder.</description>

      <title>Superconducting thin films of (Cu,C)Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{9+\delta}$ with zero resistance transition temperature close to 100 K</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High superconducting transition temperature is favorable for the applications of superconductors. Some cuprate superconductors have the transition temperatures above 100 K, such as the Hg- or Tl-based 1223 and 1234 phases, but many of them contain the toxic elements, like Hg and Tl. Meanwhile, the high anisotropy makes the vortices easy to move, thus the irreversibility magnetic field is very low in the liquid nitrogen temperature region. Here we report the successful synthesis of superconducting thin films (Cu,C)Ba$_{2}$Ca$_{2}$Cu$_3$O$_{9+\delta}$ with the zero-resistance transition temperature reaching 99.7 K. The film shows a very good crystallinity with (00l) orientation. The superconducting transitions are rather sharp as revealed by both resistivity and magnetization measurements. Temperature dependent resistivity has been measured under different magnetic fields along c-axis and ab-plane, and the irreversibility lines have been achieved. The resistivity was also measured at different temperatures with the magnetic field rotated in the ac-plane, and the data can be nicely scaled by using the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau model, yielding a temperature dependent anisotropy which varies from 17 at 110 K to 4 at 77 K. We also measured the magnetization-hysteresis-loops and calculated the critical current density through the Bean critical state model. The critical current density at 77 K is about 6$\times$10$^5$ A/cm$^2$ (zero field), thus the film may be a good candidate for the applications of superconducting cables or the high frequency superconducting filters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conventional circuit diagrams and graph-based circuit theory are used for the phase-independent circuits such as resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuits and semiconductor transistor circuits, rather than for the phase-dependent circuits such as Josephson junction circuits and quantum-phase-slip (QPS) junction circuits. To unify the analyses for both phase-independent and phase-dependent electric circuits, we develop an electromagnetic-field-based circuit theory and invent the electric-charge-flow (ECF) and the magnetic-flux-flow (MFF) diagrams to derive the general circuit equations and visualizes the dynamics of circuit devices for all kinds of electric circuits. ECF and MFF diagrams enable electric circuits to be described like the molecules composed of two kinds of atoms; they are new languages for circuit design and analysis, promising for machine-learning.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a metallic room-temperature d-wave altermagnet KV2Se2O</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, altermagnetism is a recently discovered unconventional magnetic phase characterized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-split band structures in materials with zero net magnetization. This distinct magnetic phase not only enriches the understanding of fundamental physical concepts but also has profound impacts on condense-matter physics research and practical device applications. Spin-polarized band structures have been recently observed in semiconductors MnTe and MnTe2 with vanishing net magnetization, confirming the existence of this unconventional magnetic order. Metallic altermagnets have unique advantages for exploring novel physical phenomena related to low-energy quasiparticle excitations and for applications in spintronics as electrical conductivity in metals allows the direct manipulation of spin current through electric field. Here, through comprehensive characterization and analysis of the magnetic and electronic structures of KV2Se2O, we have unambiguously demonstrated a metallic room-temperature altermaget with d-wave spin-momentum locking. The highly anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces and the spin-density-wave order emerging in the altermagnetic phase make it an extraordinary platform for designing high-performance spintronic devices and studying many-body effects coupled with the unconventional magnetism.</description>

      <title>$^{19}$F NMR and defect spins in vacuum-annealed LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report results of magnetization and $^{19}$F NMR measurements in the normal state of as-grown LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$. The magnetization is dominated by a temperature-independent diamagnetic component and a field- and temperature-dependent paramagnetic contribution $M_\mu(H,T)$ from a $\sim$1000~ppm concentration of local moments, an order of magnitude higher than can be accounted for by measured rare-earth impurity concentrations. $M_\mu(H,T)$ can be fit by the Brillouin function $B_J(x)$ or, perhaps more realistically, a two-level $\tanh(x)$ model for magnetic Bi $6p$ ions in defect crystal fields. Both fits require a phenomenological Curie-Weiss argument $x = \mu_\mathrm{eff}H/(T + T_W)$, $T_W \approx 1.7$ K. There is no evidence for magnetic order down to 2 K, and the origin of $T_W$ is not clear. $^{19}$F frequency shifts, linewidths, and spin-lattice relaxation rates are consistent with purely dipolar $^{19}$F/defect-spin interactions. The defect-spin correlation time $\tau_c(T)$ obtained from $^{19}$F spin-lattice relaxation rates obeys the Korringa relation $\tau_cT = \text{const.}$, indicating the relaxation is dominated by conduction-band fluctuations.</description>
