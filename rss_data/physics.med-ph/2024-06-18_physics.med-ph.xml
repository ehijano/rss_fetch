      <title>Influence of the flow split ratio on the position of the main atrial vortex: implications for stasis on the left atrial appendage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Despite recent advances made in recent years with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques applied to blood flow within the left atrium (LA), the relationship between atrial geometry, flow patterns, and blood stasis within the left atrial appendage (LAA) is still elusive. A better understanding of this relationship would have important clinical implications, as these thrombi originating in the LAA are a common cause of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
  Aim: The main objective of this study was to identify representative atrial flow patterns depending on the atrial geometry, how they are affected by varying the flow split ratio and some common atrial modeling assumptions, and their incidence on LAA blood stasis.
  Methods: To this end, three recent techniques were applied to 9 patient-specific CFD models of patients with AF: a kinematic atrial model to isolate the influence of wall motion due to AF, a projection on a universal LAA coordinate system, and quantification of stagnant volume.
  Results: Three representative atrial flow patterns were identified, depending on the relative position of the main atrial vortex. The work also illustrated how atrial flow patterns are highly affected by variations in the flow split ratio, inducing the formation of a larger stagnant volume. Since the flow-split ratio is determined by the patient's body-side position, we suggest that the most frequent lying position adopted while sleeping may have implications for the risk of stroke in the medium and long term for a certain patient.</description>

      <title>Upright to supine image registration and contour propagation for thoracic patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A renewed interest in upright therapy is currently driven by the availability of upright positioning and imaging systems. Aside from reduced cost, upright positioning possibly provides clinical advantages. The comparison between upright and supine particle therapy treatments can be biased through multiple variables, such as differences in the target contouring on the two CTs. We present a method for upright and supine CT registration and structures propagation, and the investigation of an AI-based contouring tool for upright images. Six paired 4DCTs from Proton Therapy Collaboration Group registry were available from the Northwestern Medicine Proton Centre. Deformable image registration (DIR) is challenged by the different patient anatomy between postures, causing artefacts in the warped images. To achieve high quality contour propagation, we propose the construction of a region of interest covering the ribcage volume to overcome this problem. As no target contour ground truth was available, the registration quality analysis (QA) was performed on lung structures, for which dice score coefficient (DSC) and average Hausdorff distance (AHD) is reported. The TotalSegmentator tool, trained on supine dataset, was applied on upright images, verified against lung structures and used as additional comparison for contour propagation. The TotalSegmentator QA results in a maximum AHD of 2mm and a minimum DSC of 0.94. An average AHD of 1.5mm and 1.6mm, and an average DSC of 0.95 and 0.94 were obtained comparing the propagated volumes to manually contoured and AI structures, respectively. All AHD values are smaller than the CT slice distances. The developed framework allows for target propagation between upright and supine images, defining the first step to compare upright and supine therapy of thoracic patients and enabling the application of image fusion techniques in the upright therapy field.</description>

      <title>Dosimetric comparison of the BNCT treatment planning performances when using a nnU-NET to automatically segment Glioblastoma Multiforme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a preliminary evaluation of the use of the convolutional neural network nnU-NET to automatically contour the volume of Glioblastoma Multiforme in medical images of patients. The goal is to assist the preparation of the Treatment Planning of patients who undergo Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). BNCT is a binary form of radiotherapy based on the selective loading of a suitable 10-boron concentration into the tumour and on subsequent low-energy neutron irradiation. The selectivity of the therapeutic effect is based on the capacity of the boron drug to target preferentially cancer cells, thus triggering the neutron capture only in the tumour and depositing there a lethal dose. Even if the tailoring of the beam to the tumour volume is less crucial for BNCT than for other radiation therapies, a proper delimitation of the tumour volume is needed to assess a safe and effective dosimetry. In clinical application the contour must be manually decided by the physician, however, a tool to automatically define important structures such as the Gross Tumour Volume (GTV) and the Organs At Risk (OAR) would be beneficial to enable medical physicists assessing preliminary positioning and simulated dosimetry before the approval or possible changes introduced by the radiotherapist. Moreover, an initial contouring may speed up the work of the physician. The nnU-NET was trained and tested and its performance was evaluated through different parameters such as the Dice Coefficient. To assess a more meaningful evaluation for BNCT, for the first time, this work analyzed the difference of the clinical dosimetry in 16 patients using the manual and the automatic contoured images.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Network Estimation of Material Properties in Soft Tissue Nonlinear Biomechanical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of biophysical models for clinical applications is rapidly advancing in the research community, thanks to their predictive nature and their ability to assist the interpretation of clinical data. However, high-resolution and accurate multi-physics computational models are computationally expensive and their personalisation involves fine calibration of a large number of parameters, which may be space-dependent, challenging their clinical translation. In this work, we propose a new approach which relies on the combination of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with three-dimensional soft tissue nonlinear biomechanical models, capable of reconstructing displacement fields and estimating heterogeneous patient-specific biophysical properties. The proposed learning algorithm encodes information from a limited amount of displacement and, in some cases, strain data, that can be routinely acquired in the clinical setting, and combines it with the physics of the problem, represented by a mathematical model based on partial differential equations, to regularise the problem and improve its convergence properties. Several benchmarks are presented to show the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method and its great potential to enable the robust and effective identification of patient-specific, heterogeneous physical properties, s.a. tissue stiffness properties. In particular, we demonstrate the capability of the PINN to detect the presence, location and severity of scar tissue, which is beneficial to develop personalised simulation models for disease diagnosis, especially for cardiac applications.</description>
