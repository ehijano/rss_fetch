      <title>A deep-learning algorithm to disentangle self-interacting dark matter and AGN feedback models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different models of dark matter can alter the distribution of mass in galaxy clusters in a variety of ways. However, so can uncertain astrophysical feedback mechanisms. Here we present a Machine Learning method that ''learns'' how the impact of dark matter self-interactions differs from that of astrophysical feedback in order to break this degeneracy and make inferences on dark matter. We train a Convolutional Neural Network on images of galaxy clusters from hydro-dynamic simulations. In the idealised case our algorithm is 80% accurate at identifying if a galaxy cluster harbours collisionless dark matter, dark matter with ${\sigma}_{\rm DM}/m = 0.1$cm$^2/$g or with ${\sigma}_{DM}/m = 1$cm$^2$/g. Whilst we find adding X-ray emissivity maps does not improve the performance in differentiating collisional dark matter, it does improve the ability to disentangle different models of astrophysical feedback. We include noise to resemble data expected from Euclid and Chandra and find our model has a statistical error of &lt; 0.01cm$^2$/g and that our algorithm is insensitive to shape measurement bias and photometric redshift errors. This method represents a new way to analyse data from upcoming telescopes that is an order of magnitude more precise and many orders faster, enabling us to explore the dark matter parameter space like never before.</description>

      <title>A note on the error analysis of data-driven closure models for large eddy simulations of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a mathematical formulation for error propagation in flow trajectory prediction using data-driven turbulence closure modeling. Under the assumption that the predicted state of a large eddy simulation prediction must be close to that of a subsampled direct numerical simulation, we retrieve an upper bound for the prediction error when utilizing a data-driven closure model. We also demonstrate that this error is significantly affected by the time step size and the Jacobian which play a role in amplifying the initial one-step error made by using the closure. Our analysis also shows that the error propagates exponentially with rollout time and the upper bound of the system Jacobian which is itself influenced by the Jacobian of the closure formulation. These findings could enable the development of new regularization techniques for ML models based on the identified error-bound terms, improving their robustness and reducing error propagation.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided Full Waveform Inversion using Encoder-Solver Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is an inverse problem for estimating the wave velocity distribution in a given domain, based on observed data on the boundaries. The inversion is computationally demanding because we are required to solve multiple forward problems, either in time or frequency domains, to simulate data that are then iteratively fitted to the observed data. We consider FWI in the frequency domain, where the Helmholtz equation is used as a forward model, and its repeated solution is the main computational bottleneck of the inversion process. To ease this cost, we integrate a learning process of an encoder-solver preconditioner that is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The encoder-solver is trained to effectively precondition the discretized Helmholtz operator given velocity medium parameters. Then, by re-training the CNN between the iterations of the optimization process, the encoder-solver is adapted to the iteratively evolving velocity medium as part of the inversion. Without retraining, the performance of the solver deteriorates as the medium changes. Using our light retraining procedures, we obtain the forward simulations effectively throughout the process. We demonstrate our approach to solving FWI problems using 2D geophysical models with high-frequency data.</description>

      <title>Correlation effects in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene: An auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) presents a fascinating platform for investigating the effects of electron interactions in topological flat bands. The Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM) model provides a simplified quantitative description of the flat bands. Introducing long-range Coulomb interactions leads to an interacting BM (IBM) Hamiltonian, a momentum-space continuum description which offers a very natural starting point for many-body studies of MATBG. Accurate and reliable many-body computations in the IBM model are challenging, however, and have been limited mostly to special fillings, or smaller lattice sizes. We employ state-of-the-art auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method to study the IBM model, which constrains the sign problem to enable accurate treatment of large system sizes. We determine ground-state properties and quantify errors compared to mean-field theory calculations. Our calculations identify correlated metal states and their competition with the insulating Kramers inter-valley coherent state at both half-filling and charge neutrality. Additionally, we investigate one- and three-quarter fillings, and examine the effect of many-body corrections beyond single Slater determinant solutions. We discuss the effect that details of the IBM Hamiltonian have on the results, including different forms of double-counting corrections, and the need to establish and precisely specify many-body Hamiltonians to allow more direct and quantitative comparisons with experiments in MATBG.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the strain-induced softening behaviour in hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Usually, the strain-induced softening behaviour observed in the differential modulus $K(T,\gamma)$ of hydrogels has been attributed to the breakage of internal structures of the network, such as the cross-links that bind together the polymer chains. Here we consider a stress-strain relationship that we have recently derived from a coarse-grained model to demonstrate that no rupture of the network is needed for rubber-like gels to present such behaviour. In particular, we show that, in some cases, the decreasing of $K(T,\gamma)$ as a function of the strain $\gamma$ is closely related to the energy-related contribution to the elastic modulus that has been experimentally observed, e.g., for tetra-PEG hydrogels. Thus, our results suggest that, instead of the breakage of structures, the softening behaviour can be also related to the effective interaction between the chains in the network and their neighbouring solvent molecules. Comparison to experimental data determined for several hydrogels is included to illustrate that behaviour and to validate our approach.</description>

      <title>Untangling Climate's Complexity: Methodological Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we review the interdisciplinary techniques (borrowed from physics, mathematics, statistics, machine-learning, etc.) and methodological framework that we have used to understand climate systems, which serve as examples of "complex systems". We believe that this would offer valuable insights to comprehend the complexity of climate variability and pave the way for drafting policies for action against climate change, etc. Our basic aim is to analyse time-series data structures across diverse climate parameters, extract Fourier-transformed features to recognize and model the trends/seasonalities in the climate variables using standard methods like detrended residual series analyses, correlation structures among climate parameters, Granger causal models, and other statistical machine-learning techniques. We cite and briefly explain two case studies: (i) the relationship between the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) and specific climate variables including Sea Surface Temperature (SST), El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), uncovering temporal shifts in correlations between SPI and these variables, and reveal complex patterns that drive drought and wet climate conditions in South-West Australia; (ii) the complex interactions of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, with SST and sea ice extent (SIE), potentially arising from positive feedback loops.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Generalization of the Perdew-Zunger Self-Interaction Correction: a Way Out of Multiple Minima and Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Perdew-Zunger (PZ) self-interaction correction (SIC) is an established tool to correct unphysical behavior in density functional approximations. Yet, PZ-SIC is well-known to sometimes break molecular symmetries. An example of this is the benzene molecule, for which PZ-SIC predicts a symmetry-broken electron density and molecular geometry, since the method does not describe the two possible Kekul\'e structures on an even footing, leading to local minima [Lehtola et al, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016, 12, 3195]. PZ-SIC is often implemented with Fermi-L\"owdin orbitals (FLOs), yielding the FLO-SIC method, which likewise has issues with symmetry breaking and local minima [Trepte et al, J. Chem. Phys. 2021, 155, 224109].
  In this work, we propose a generalization of PZ-SIC - the ensemble PZ-SIC (E-PZ-SIC) method - which shares the asymptotic computational scaling of PZ-SIC (albeit with an additional prefactor). E-PZ-SIC is straightforwardly applicable to various molecules, merely requiring one to average the self-interaction correction over all possible Kekul\'e structures, in line with chemical intuition. We showcase the implementation of E-PZ-SIC with FLOs, as the resulting E-FLO-SIC method is easy to realize on top of an existing implementation of FLO-SIC. We show that E-FLO-SIC indeed eliminates symmetry breaking, reproducing a symmetric electron density and molecular geometry for benzene. The ensemble approach suggested herein could also be employed within locally scaled variants of PZ-SIC and their FLO-SIC versions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have been widely employed as effective tools in addressing various engineering challenges in recent years, particularly for the challenging task of microstructure-informed materials modeling. This work provides a comprehensive review of the current machine learning-assisted and data-driven advancements in this field, including microstructure characterization and reconstruction, multiscale simulation, correlations among process, microstructure, and properties, as well as microstructure optimization and inverse design. It outlines the achievements of existing research through best practices and suggests potential avenues for future investigations. Moreover, it prepares the readers with educative instructions of basic knowledge and an overview on machine learning, microstructure descriptors and machine learning-assisted material modeling, lowering the interdisciplinary hurdles. It should help to stimulate and attract more research attention to the rapidly growing field of machine learning-based modeling and design of microstructured materials.</description>

      <title>Learning About Structural Errors in Models of Complex Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems are notoriously difficult to model because some degrees of freedom (e.g., small scales) may be computationally unresolvable or are incompletely understood, yet they are dynamically important. For example, the small scales of cloud dynamics and droplet formation are crucial for controlling climate, yet are unresolvable in global climate models. Semi-empirical closure models for the effects of unresolved degrees of freedom often exist and encode important domain-specific knowledge. Building on such closure models and correcting them through learning the structural errors can be an effective way of fusing data with domain knowledge. Here we describe a general approach, principles, and algorithms for learning about structural errors. Key to our approach is to include structural error models inside the models of complex systems, for example, in closure models for unresolved scales. The structural errors then map, usually nonlinearly, to observable data. As a result, however, mismatches between model output and data are only indirectly informative about structural errors, due to a lack of labeled pairs of inputs and outputs of structural error models. Additionally, derivatives of the model may not exist or be readily available. We discuss how structural error models can be learned from indirect data with derivative-free Kalman inversion algorithms and variants, how sparsity constraints enforce a "do no harm" principle, and various ways of modeling structural errors. We also discuss the merits of using non-local and/or stochastic error models. In addition, we demonstrate how data assimilation techniques can assist the learning about structural errors in non-ergodic systems. The concepts and algorithms are illustrated in two numerical examples based on the Lorenz-96 system and a human glucose-insulin model.</description>

      <title>Operator Learning Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general framework for quantum many-body simulations called the operator learning renormalization group (OLRG). Inspired by machine learning perspectives, OLRG is a generalization of Wilson's numerical renormalization group and White's density matrix renormalization group, which recursively builds a simulatable system to approximate a target system of the same number of sites via operator maps. OLRG uses a loss function to minimize the error of a target property directly by learning the operator map in lieu of a state ansatz. This loss function is designed by a scaling consistency condition that also provides a provable bound for real-time evolution. We implement two versions of the operator maps for classical and quantum simulations. The former, which we call the Operator Matrix Map, can be implemented via neural networks on classical computers. The latter, which we call the Hamiltonian Expression Map, generates device pulse sequences to leverage the capabilities of quantum computing hardware. We illustrate the performance of both maps for calculating time-dependent quantities in the quantum Ising model Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>On the Definition of Velocity in Discrete-Time, Stochastic Langevin Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically develop beneficial and practical velocity measures for accurate and efficient statistical simulations of the Langevin equation with direct applications to computational statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics sampling. Recognizing that the existing velocity measures for the most statistically accurate discrete-time Verlet-type algorithms are inconsistent with the simulated configurational coordinate, we seek to create and analyze new velocity companions that both improve existing methods as well as offer practical options for implementation in existing computer codes. The work is based on the set of GJ methods that, of all methods, for all time steps within the stability criteria correctly reproduces the most basic statistical features of a Langevin system; namely correct Boltzmann distribution for harmonic potentials and correct transport in the form of drift and diffusion for linear potentials. Several new accompanying velocities exhibiting correct drift are identified, and we expand on an earlier conclusion that only half-step velocities can exhibit correct, time-step independent Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. Specific practical and efficient algorithms are given in familiar forms, and these are used to numerically validate the analytically derived expectations.</description>
