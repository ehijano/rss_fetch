      <title>Magnetic properties of the spiral spin liquid and surrounding phases in the square lattice XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral spin liquids possess a subextensively degenerate ground-state manifold, represented by a continuum of energy minima in reciprocal space. Since a small change of the spiral state wavevector requires a global change of the spin configuration in real space, it is a priori unclear how such systems can fluctuate within the degenerate ground state manifold. Only recently it was proposed that momentum vortices are responsible for the liquidity of the spiral phase and that these systems are closely related to an emergent rank-2 U(1) gauge theory [H. Yan and J. Reuther, Phys. Rev. Research 4, 023175 (2022)]. As a consequence of this gauge structure, four-fold pinch-point singularities were found in a generalized spin correlator. In this article, we use classical Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics calculations to embed the previously studied spiral spin liquid into a broader phase diagram of the square lattice XY model. We find a multitude of unusual phases and phase transitions surrounding the spiral spin liquid such as an effective four-state Potts transition into a colinear double-striped phase resulting from the spontaneous breaking of two coupled $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. Since this phase is stabilized by entropic effects selecting the momenta away from the spiral manifold, it undergoes a re-entrance phenomenon at low temperatures into a nematic spiral phase. We also observe a region of parameters where the phase transition into the spiral spin liquid does not break any symmetries and where the critical exponents do not match those of standard universality classes. We study the importance of momentum vortices in driving this phase transition and discuss the possibility of a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of momentum vortices. Finally, we explore the regime where the rank-2 U(1) gauge theory is valid by investigating the four-fold pinch point singularities across the phase diagram</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic state with large magnetic moments realized in epitaxially strained Sr3Ru2O7 films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technical advancement of oxide molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has opened new avenues for studying various quantum transport phenomena in correlated transition-metal oxides, as exemplified by the exotic superconductivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and quantum oscillations of SrRuO$_3$. On the other hand, film research of another Ruddlesden-Popper strontium ruthenate Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ which exhibits a unique quantum phase related to metamagnetism in bulk systems did not progress well. Here we report the fabrication of high-quality Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ thin films by oxide MBE and the observation of a strain-induced ferromagnetic ground state. The change in magnetic exchange coupling evaluated by first-principles calculations indicates a systematic relation between the compression of the $c$-axis length and induced ferromagnetism. Giant epitaxial strain in high-quality films will be a key to a comprehensive understanding of the magnetism in Ruddlesden-Popper strontium ruthenates Sr$_{n+1}$Ru$_n$O$_{3n+1}$, which sensitively depends on the ratio of in-plane to out-of-plane Ru-Ru distances.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Nanoelectromechanical Coupling at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface hosts a plethora of gate-tunable electronic phases. Gating of LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces are usually assumed to occur electrostatically. However, increasing evidence suggests that non-local interactions can influence and, in some cases, dominate the coupling between applied gate voltages and electronic properties. Here, we sketch quasi-1D ballistic electron waveguides at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface as a probe to understand how gate tunability varies as a function of spatial separation. Gate tunability measurements reveal the scaling law to be at odds with the pure electrostatic coupling observed in traditional semiconductor systems. The non-Coulombic gating at the interface is attributed to the existence of a long-range nanoelectromechanical coupling between the gate and electron waveguide, mediated by the ferroelastic domains in SrTiO$_3$. The long-range interactions at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface add unexpected richness and complexity to this correlated electron system.</description>

      <title>Chiral spin textures driven by emergent spin-orbit interaction: a numerical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore numerically the intricate interplay between Berry phases in both real and momentum spaces within itinerant magnets. This interplay manifests as an emergent spin-orbit coupling, where charge carriers occupying a Berry-curved band generate an orbital magnetization, inducing a pseudo-magnetic field originating in chiral spin textures. Using density-matrix-renormalization-group techniques, we demonstrate that switching on a band Berry curvature in a metallic ferromagnetic phase results in chiral magnetic textures. Furthermore, employing a two-leg strip geometry, we establish a connection between charge and spin chirality, further supporting this emergent spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>Octupolar edge state in an $e_g$ orbital system on a square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tight-binding model for $e_g$ orbitals on a square lattice is investigated. We consider only the nearest-neighbor hopping and the model is characterized by two hopping parameters, $t_1$ and $t_2$. There are Dirac points in the electronic band structure and the type of the Dirac points (type-I or type-II) depends on the ratio $t_2/t_1$. For the case of the type-I Dirac points, edge states appear for a lattice with edges perpendicular to the $[11]$ direction. The edge states at a certain momentum along the edges have octupole moments with opposite signs between the right and left edges. Thus, these edge states can be called helical octupolar edge states. This study bridges the research fields of topological phenomena and multipole physics.</description>

      <title>Charge density wave without long-range structural modulation in canted antiferromagnetic kagome FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly correlated electron systems with a kagome lattice can host abundant exotic quantum states such as superconductivity and spin/charge density waves (CDW) due to the complicated interactions between different degrees of freedoms in the framework of a unique two-dimensional geometrically frustrated lattice structure. Recently, successive orders of A-type antiferromagnetism (AFM), $2\times2\times2$ CDW and canted double-cone AFM have been manifested upon cooling in magnetic kagome FeGe. However, the mechanism of the CDW order and its interaction with magnetism are presently enigmatic at best. Here we investigate the evolution of CDW order with temperature across the spin canting transition in FeGe by single-crystal x-ray diffraction. Refinements of its modulated structure are presented using the superspace approach. Interestingly, the superlattice reflections originating from CDW-induced long-range structural modulation become extremely weak after the system enters the canted AFM while a $2\times2$ CDW in the $ab$ plane persists as a long-range order demonstrated by strong electronic modulation in the d$I$/d$V$ map of scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We discovered a novel CDW order without long-range structural modulation in FeGe probably because of the competition between CDW and canted AFM in determining the underlying crystal structure. In addition, occupational modulations of Ge1 atoms located in the kagome plane and displacive modulations of all the atoms were extracted from the refinements, confirming the existence of Ge atom dimerization along the $c$ axis as the major distortion and indicating a dynamic transformation between different CDW domains.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous charge-ordered state in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that a weakly spontaneous charge-ordered insulating state probably exists in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene which can account for experimentally observed non-monotonic behavior of resistance as a function of the gated field, namely, the gap closes and reopens at a critical gated field. The underlying physics is demonstrated by a simple model on a corresponding lattice that contains the nearest intralayer and interlayer hoppings, electric field, and staggered potential between different sublattices. Combining density functional theory calculations with model analyses, we argue that the interlayer van der Waals interactions cooperating with ripples may be responsible for the staggered potential which induces a charge-ordered insulating state in the absence of the electric field.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal superfluidlike topological spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study superfluidlike spin transport facilitated by thermal diffusion of magnetic domain walls, where the positive and negative chiralities of domain walls act as opposite topological charges. The topological charge conservation leads to algebraic decay of the topological current, allowing for the transport of spin over extended distances. We demonstrate that the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can lead to nonreciprocity in topological flow. In one scenario, the nonreciprocity arises due to diode-like behavior where the nucleation of domain walls is governed by thermal activation for one direction of spin current and by viscous injection for the other direction of spin current. We confirm our predictions by micromagnetic simulations of domain walls in TmIG nanowire.</description>

      <title>Building up quantum spacetimes with BCFT Legos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is it possible to read off the quantum gravity dual of a CFT directly from its operator algebra? In this essay, we present a step-by-step recipe synthesizing results and techniques from conformal bootstrap, topological symmetries, tensor networks, a novel symmetry-preserving real-space renormalization algorithm devised originally in lattice models, and the asymptotics of quantum $6j$ symbols, thereby providing an answer in the affirmative. Quantum 2D Liouville theory serves as a simple and explicit example, illustrating how the quantum gravitational path integral can be built up from local pieces of BCFT correlation functions, which we call the ``BCFT Legos''. The constructive map between gravity and CFT naturally and explicitly bridges local geometrical data, algebraic structures, and quantum entanglement, as envisaged by the $\it{It \, from \, Qubit}$ motto.</description>

      <title>Inversion and Tunability of Van Hove Singularities in $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, and Cs) kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand the alkali-metal-dependent material properties of recently discovered $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, and Cs), we conducted a detailed electronic structure analysis based on first-principles density functional theory calculations. Contrary to the case of $A$ = K and Rb, the energetic positions of the low-lying Van Hove singularities are reversed in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, and the characteristic higher-order Van Hove point gets closer to the Fermi level. We found that this notable difference can be attributed to the chemical effect, apart from structural differences. Due to their different orbital compositions, Van Hove points show qualitatively different responses to the structure changes. A previously unnoticed highest lying point can be lowered, locating close to or even below the other ones in response to a reasonable range of bi- and uni-axial strain. Our results can be useful in better understanding the material-dependent features reported in this family and in realizing experimental control of exotic quantum phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering a spin-up and a spin-down fermion in a generic tight-binding lattice with a multi-site basis, here we study the two-body problem using a multiband extended-Hubbard model with arbitrary but finite-ranged hopping and interaction parameters. We derive a linear eigenvalue problem for the entire two-body spectrum, alongside a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for the bound states in the form of a self-consistency equation. Our results are based on an exact variational approach and their versatility offers practical applications in a broad range of lattice geometries. As an illustration, we apply them to the linear-chain model and demonstrate that the resultant spin singlet and triplet bound states are in perfect agreement with the existing literature.</description>

Abstract: Multichannel Kondo lattice models are examples of strongly correlated electronic systems that exhibit non-Fermi-liquid behavior due to the presence of a continuous channel symmetry. Mean-field analyses have predicted that these systems undergo channel symmetry breaking at low temperature. We use the dynamical large-$N$ technique to study temporal and spatial fluctuations of the multichannel Kondo model on a honeycomb lattice and find that this prediction is not generally true. Rather, we find a 2+1D conformally invariant fixed point, governed by critical exponents that are found numerically. When we break time-reversal symmetry by adding a Haldane mass to the conduction electrons, three phases, separated by continuous transitions, are discernible: one characterized by dynamic mass generation and spontaneous breaking of the channel symmetry, one where topological defects restore channel symmetry but preserve the gap, and one with a Kondo-coupled chiral spin liquid. We argue that the last phase is a fractional Chern insulator with anyonic excitations.</description>

Abstract: Over the past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) has attracted broad attention across the condensed matter, quantum field theory, and high-energy physics communities, as it is expected to offer a new paradigm in theory, experiment, and numerical simulations that goes beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework of symmetry breaking and phase transitions. However, the nature of DQCP has been controversial. For instance, in the square-lattice spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ model, believed to realize the DQCP between N\'eel and valence bond solid states, conflicting results, such as first-order versus continuous transition, and critical exponents incompatible with conformal bootstrap bounds, have been reported. The enigma of DQCP is exemplified in its anomalous logarithmic subleading contribution in its entanglement entropy (EE), which was discussed in recent studies. In the current work, we demonstrate that similar anomalous logarithmic behavior persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. We systematically study the quantum EE of square-lattice SU($N$) DQCP spin models. Based on large-scale quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE, we show that for a series of $N$ smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists in the EE, which implies that the previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when $N\ge N_c$ with a finite $N_c$ that we evaluate to lie between $7$ and $8$, the DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory with $N$ complex components.</description>

      <title>Entropic sampling in frustrated magnets: role of self-intersecting spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frustrated magnets typically possess a large space of classical ground states. If this degeneracy is not protected by symmetry, thermal fluctuations may `select' certain states via order-by-disorder. In this article, we examine a precursor effect where all ground states are sampled, but with different weights. Geometry plays a key role in determining the weight distribution and its behaviour. We demonstrate this with two examples -- both clusters with four spins coupled by XY interactions. In the first, the classical ground states form a smooth space. In the second, they form a self-intersecting non-manifold space. Ground state sampling is very different in these two cases. We first consider the microcanonical ensemble picture, where fluctuations conserve energy. Phase space arguments suggest that the first model exhibits energy-independent probabilities. The second shows a dramatic energy-dependence with relative probability increasing as $\epsilon^{-1/2}$, where $\epsilon$ is the energy of the system. We simulate low-energy dynamics in both models, confirming the expected behaviour. We next consider the canonical ensemble, where the first model produces temperature-independent probabilities. In the second, relative probability rises sharply as $T^{-1/2}$, where $T$ is the temperature. Our results bring out a classical analogue of order-by-singularity, a mechanism that has been recently proposed in the context of quantum spin clusters. The sampling of classical orders is qualitatively different in systems with self-intersecting ground state spaces. It grows at low energies and becomes singular as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ (microcanonical ensemble) or $T\rightarrow 0$ (canonical ensemble). We discuss relevance for disordered phases in macroscopic magnets, particularly for spiral liquids.</description>

      <title>Attractive Haldane bilayers for trapping non-Abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interplay between intrinsic topological order and superconductivity in a two-component Haldane bilayer, where the two layers are coupled by an attractive force. We obtain the phase diagram of the model with exact diagonalization in finite-size, and develop arguments to assess the stability of the observed phases in the thermodynamic limit. Our main result is that a finite critical attraction strength is needed to pair fermions forming a fractional topological order. This behavior can be harnessed to create clean interfaces between a fractional topological insulator and a superconductor by gating, wherein non-Abelian parafermionic modes are trapped. We discuss realization of such interfaces in the bulk of double bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides by inhomogenous electrostatic gating, which should mitigate the spurious effects of disorder and crystalline defects present on physical edges.</description>

      <title>Bridging the small and large in twisted transition metal dicalcogenide homobilayers: a tight binding model capturing orbital interference and topology across a wide range of twist angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many of the important phases observed in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers are driven by short-range interactions, which should be captured by a local tight binding description since no Wannier obstruction exists for these systems. Yet, published theoretical descriptions have been mutually inconsistent, with honeycomb lattice tight binding models adopted for some twist angles, triangular lattice models adopted for others, and with tight binding models forsaken in favor of band projected continuum models in many numerical simulations. Here, we derive and study a minimal model containing both honeycomb orbitals and a triangular site that represents the band physics across a wide range of twist angles. The model provides a natural basis to study the interplay of interaction and topology in these heterostructures. It elucidates from generic features of the bilayer the sequence of Chern numbers occurring as twist angle is varied, and the microscopic origin of the magic angle at which flat-band physics occurs. At integer filling, the model successfully captures the Chern ferromagnetic and van-Hove driven antiferromagnetic insulators experimentally observed for small and large angles, respectively, and allows a straightforward calculation of the magneto-electric properties of the system.</description>

      <title>Infinite Grassmann Time-Evolving Matrix Product Operator Method in the Steady State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for quantum impurity problems, which directly works in the steady state. The method embraces the well-established infinite matrix product state algorithms with the recently developed GTEMPO method, and benefits from both sides: it obtains numerically exact real-time Green's functions without sampling noises and bath discretization error, it is applicable for any temperature without the sign problem, its computational cost is independent of the transient dynamics and does not scale with the number of baths. We benchmark the method on the finite-temperature equilibrium Green's function in the noninteracting limit against exact solutions and in the single-orbital Anderson impurity model against GTEMPO calculations. We also study the zero-temperature non-equilibrium steady state of an impurity coupled to two baths with a voltage bias, obtaining consistent particle currents with existing calculations. The method is ideal for studying steady-state quantum transport, and can be readily used as an efficient real-time impurity solver in the dynamical mean field theory and its non-equilibrium extension.</description>

      <title>Candidate Phases for SU(2) Adjoint QCD$_4$ with Two Flavors from $\mathcal{N}=2$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:1806.09592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study four-dimensional adjoint QCD with gauge group SU(2) and two Weyl fermion flavors, which has an $SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry. The infrared behavior of this theory is not firmly established. We explore candidate infrared phases by embedding adjoint QCD into $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory deformed by a supersymmetry-breaking scalar mass M that preserves all global symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies. This includes 't Hooft anomalies that are only visible when the theory is placed on manifolds that do not admit a spin structure. The consistency of this procedure is guaranteed by a nonabelian spin-charge relation involving the $SU(2)_R$ symmetry that is familiar from topologically twisted $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories. Since every vacuum on the Coulomb branch of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory necessarily matches all 't Hooft anomalies, we can generate candidate phases for adjoint QCD by deforming the theories in these vacua while preserving all symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies. One such deformation is the supersymmetry-breaking scalar mass M itself, which can be reliably analyzed when M is small. In this regime it gives rise to an exotic Coulomb phase without chiral symmetry breaking. By contrast, the theory near the monopole and dyon points can be deformed to realize a candidate phase with monopole-induced confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. The low-energy theory consists of two copies of a $\mathbb{CP}^1$ sigma model, which we analyze in detail. Certain topological couplings that are likely to be present in this $\mathbb{CP}^1$ model turn the confining solitonic string of the model into a topological insulator. We also examine the behavior of various candidate phases under fermion mass deformations. We speculate on the possible large-M behavior of the deformed $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory and conjecture that the $\mathbb{CP}^1$ phase eventually becomes dominant.</description>

      <title>Parisi's hypercube, Fock-space frustration and near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_1$ holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.18182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a model of Parisi where a single particle hops on an infinite-dimensional hypercube, under the influence of a uniform but disordered magnetic flux. We reinterpret the hypercube as the Fock-space graph of a many-body Hamiltonian and the flux as a frustration of the return amplitudes in Fock space. We will identify the set of observables that have the same correlation functions as the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DS-SYK) model, and hence the hypercube model is an equally good quantum model for near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_{1}$ (NAdS$_2$/NCFT$_1$) holography. Unlike the SYK model, the hypercube Hamiltonian is not $p$ local. Instead, the SYK model can be understood as a Fock-space model with similar frustrations. Hence we propose this type of Fock-space frustration as the broader characterization for NAdS$_2$/NCFT$_1$ microscopics, which encompasses the hypercube and the DS-SYK models as two specific examples. We then speculate on the possible origin of such frustrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey recent developments in a novel kind of generalized global symmetry, the non-invertible symmetry, in diverse spacetime dimensions. We start with several different but related constructions of the non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality symmetry in the Ising model, and conclude with a new interpretation for the neutral pion decay and other applications. These notes are based on lectures given at the TASI 2023 summer school "Aspects of Symmetry."</description>

      <title>Mechanical stability of homogeneous holographic solids under finite shear strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the linear stability of holographic homogeneous solids (HHS) at finite temperature and in presence of a background shear strain by means of a large scale quasi-normal mode analysis which extends beyond the hydrodynamic limit. We find that mechanical instability can arise either as a result of a complex speed of sound -- gradient instability -- or of a negative diffusion constant. Surprisingly, the simplest HHS models are linearly stable for arbitrarily large values of the background strain. For more complex HHS, the onset of the diffusive instability always precedes that of the gradient instability, which becomes the dominant destabilizing process only above a critical value of the background shear strain. Finally, we observe that the critical strains for the two instabilities approach each other at low temperatures. We conclude by presenting a phase diagram for HHS as a function of temperature and background shear strain which shows interesting similarities with the physics of superfluids in presence of background superfluid velocity.</description>

      <title>Chiral magnetic waves in strongly coupled Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Propagating chiral magnetic waves (CMW) are expected to exist in chiral plasmas due to the interplay between the chiral magnetic and chiral separation effects induced by the presence of a chiral anomaly. Unfortunately, it was pointed out that, because of the effects of electric conductivity and dissipation, CMW are overdamped and therefore their signatures are unlikely to be seen in heavy-ion collision experiments and in the quark gluon plasma. Nonetheless, the chiral anomaly plays a fundamental role in Weyl semimetals and their anomalous transport properties as well. Hence, CMW could be potentially observed in topological semimetals using table-top experiments. By using a holographic model for strongly coupled Weyl semimetals, we investigate in detail the nature of CMW in presence of Coulomb interactions and axial charge relaxation and estimate whether, and in which regimes, CMW could be observed as underdamped collective excitations in topological materials.</description>
