      <title>Enhancing Anti-Money Laundering Efforts with Network-Based Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global banking system has faced increasing challenges in combating money laundering, necessitating advanced methods for detecting suspicious transactions. Anti-money laundering (or AML) approaches have often relied on predefined thresholds and machine learning algorithms using flagged transaction data, which are limited by the availability and accuracy of existing datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm that leverages network analysis to detect potential money laundering activities within large-scale transaction data. Utilizing an anonymized transactional dataset from Co\"operatieve Rabobank U.A., our method combines community detection via the Louvain algorithm and small cycle detection to identify suspicious transaction patterns below the regulatory reporting thresholds. Our approach successfully identifies cycles of transactions that may indicate layering steps in money laundering, providing a valuable tool for financial institutions to enhance their AML efforts. The results suggest the efficacy of our algorithm in pinpointing potentially illicit activities that evade current detection methods.</description>

      <title>A dataset of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Tweets about the Russo-Ukrainian war</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) refers to intelligence efforts based on freely available data. It has become a frequent topic of conversation on social media, where private users or networks can share their findings. Such data is highly valuable in conflicts, both for gaining a new understanding of the situation as well as for tracking the spread of misinformation. In this paper, we present a method for collecting such data as well as a novel OSINT dataset for the Russo-Ukrainian war drawn from Twitter between January 2022 and July 2023. It is based on an initial search of users posting OSINT and a subsequent snowballing approach to detect more. The final dataset contains almost 2 million Tweets posted by 1040 users. We also provide some first analyses and experiments on the data, and make suggestions for its future usage.</description>

      <title>LATEX-GCL: Large Language Models (LLMs)-Based Data Augmentation for Text-Attributed Graph Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a potent paradigm for self-supervised graph learning that has attracted attention across various application scenarios. However, GCL for learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) has yet to be explored. Because conventional augmentation techniques like feature embedding masking cannot directly process textual attributes on TAGs. A naive strategy for applying GCL to TAGs is to encode the textual attributes into feature embeddings via a language model and then feed the embeddings into the following GCL module for processing. Such a strategy faces three key challenges: I) failure to avoid information loss, II) semantic loss during the text encoding phase, and III) implicit augmentation constraints that lead to uncontrollable and incomprehensible results. In this paper, we propose a novel GCL framework named LATEX-GCL to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce textual augmentations and LLMs' powerful natural language processing (NLP) abilities to address the three limitations aforementioned to pave the way for applying GCL to TAG tasks. Extensive experiments on four high-quality TAG datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed LATEX-GCL method. The source codes and datasets are released to ease the reproducibility, which can be accessed via this link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LATEX-GCL-0712.</description>

      <title>Polaris: Sampling from the Multigraph Configuration Model with Prescribed Color Assortativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Polaris, a network null model for colored multi-graphs that preserves the Joint Color Matrix. Polaris is specifically designed for studying network polarization, where vertices belong to a side in a debate or a partisan group, represented by a vertex color, and relations have different strengths, represented by an integer-valued edge multiplicity. The key feature of Polaris is preserving the Joint Color Matrix (JCM) of the multigraph, which specifies the number of edges connecting vertices of any two given colors. The JCM is the basic property that determines color assortativity, a fundamental aspect in studying homophily and segregation in polarized networks. By using Polaris, network scientists can test whether a phenomenon is entirely explained by the JCM of the observed network or whether other phenomena might be at play. Technically, our null model is an extension of the configuration model: an ensemble of colored multigraphs characterized by the same degree sequence and the same JCM. To sample from this ensemble, we develop a suite of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, collectively named Polaris-*. It includes Polaris-B, an adaptation of a generic Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and Polaris-C, a faster, specialized algorithm with higher acceptance probabilities. This new null model and the associated algorithms provide a more nuanced toolset for examining polarization in social networks, thus enabling statistically sound conclusions.</description>

      <title>Healthcare system resilience and adaptability to pandemic disruptions in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding healthcare system resilience has become paramount, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which imposed unprecedented burdens on healthcare services and severely impacted public health. Resilience is defined as the system's ability to absorb, recover from, and adapt to disruptions; however, despite extensive studies on this subject, we still lack empirical evidence and mathematical tools to quantify its adaptability (the ability of the system to adjust to and learn from disruptions). By analyzing millions of patients' electronic medical records across US states, we find that the COVID-19 pandemic caused two successive waves of disruptions within the healthcare systems, enabling natural experiment analysis of the adaptive capacity for each system to adapt to past disruptions. We generalize the quantification framework and find that the US healthcare systems exhibit substantial adaptability but only a moderate level of resilience. When considering system responses across racial groups, Black and Hispanic groups were more severely impacted by pandemic disruptions than White and Asian groups. Physician abundance is the key characteristic for determining healthcare system resilience. Our results offer vital guidance in designing resilient and sustainable healthcare systems to prepare for future waves of disruptions akin to COVID-19 pandemics.</description>

      <title>FastEnsemble: A new scalable ensemble clustering method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many community detection algorithms are stochastic in nature, and their output can vary based on different input parameters and random seeds. Consensus clustering methods, such as FastConsensus and ECG, combine clusterings from multiple runs of the same clustering algorithm, in order to improve stability and accuracy. In this study we present a new consensus clustering method, FastEnsemble, and show that it provides advantages over both FastConsensus and ECG. Furthermore, FastEnsemble is designed for use with any clustering method, and we show results using \ourmethod with Leiden optimizing modularity or the Constant Potts model. FastEnsemble is available in Github at https://github.com/ytabatabaee/fast-ensemble</description>

      <title>Enhancing Trustworthiness and Minimising Bias Issues in Leveraging Social Media Data for Disaster Management Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disaster events often unfold rapidly, necessitating a swift and effective response. Developing action plans, resource allocation, and resolution of help requests in disaster scenarios is time-consuming and complex since disaster-relevant information is often uncertain. Leveraging real-time data can significantly deal with data uncertainty and enhance disaster response efforts. To deal with real-time data uncertainty, social media appeared as an alternative effective source of real-time data as there has been extensive use of social media during and after the disasters. However, it also brings forth challenges regarding trustworthiness and bias in these data. To fully leverage social media data for disaster management, it becomes crucial to mitigate biases that may arise due to specific disaster types or regional contexts. Additionally, the presence of misinformation within social media data raises concerns about the reliability of data sources, potentially impeding actionable insights and leading to improper resource utilization. To overcome these challenges, our research aimed to investigate how to ensure trustworthiness and address biases in social media data. We aim to investigate and identify the factors that can be used to enhance trustworthiness and minimize bias to make an efficient and scalable disaster management system utilizing real-time social media posts, identify disaster-related keywords, and assess the severity of the disaster. By doing so, the integration of real-time social data can improve the speed and accuracy of disaster management systems</description>

      <title>Deduction of the Bromilow's time-cost model from the fractal nature of activity networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1969 Bromilow observed that the time $T$ to execute a construction project follows a power law scaling with the project cost $C$, $T\sim C^B$ [Bromilow 1969]. While the Bromilow's time-cost model has been extensively tested using data for different countries and project types, there is no theoretical explanation for the algebraic scaling. Here I mathematically deduce the Bromilow's time-cost model from the fractal nature of activity networks. The Bromislow's exponent is $B=1-\alpha$, where $1-\alpha$ is the scaling exponent between the number of activities in the critical path $L$ and the number of activities $N$, $L\sim N^{1-\alpha}$ with $0\leq\alpha&lt;1$ [Vazquez et al 2023]. I provide empirical data showing that projects with low serial/parallel (SP)% have lower $B$ values than those with higher SP%. I conclude that the Bromilow's time-cost model is a law of activity networks, the Bromilow's exponent is a network property and forecasting project duration from cost should be limited to projects with high SP%.</description>

      <title>LLMs hallucinate graphs too: a structural perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that LLMs do hallucinate, that is, they return incorrect information as facts. In this paper, we introduce the possibility to study these hallucinations under a structured form: graphs. Hallucinations in this context are incorrect outputs when prompted for well known graphs from the literature (e.g. Karate club, Les Mis\'erables, graph atlas). These hallucinated graphs have the advantage of being much richer than the factual accuracy -- or not -- of a fact; this paper thus argues that such rich hallucinations can be used to characterize the outputs of LLMs. Our first contribution observes the diversity of topological hallucinations from major modern LLMs. Our second contribution is the proposal of a metric for the amplitude of such hallucinations: the Graph Atlas Distance, that is the average graph edit distance from several graphs in the graph atlas set. We compare this metric to the Hallucination Leaderboard, a hallucination rank that leverages 10,000 times more prompts to obtain its ranking.</description>

      <title>Social MediARverse Investigating Users Social Media Content Sharing and Consuming Intentions with Location-Based AR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) is evolving to become the next frontier in social media, merging physical and virtual reality into a living metaverse, a Social MediARverse. With this transition, we must understand how different contexts (public, semi-public, and private) affect user engagement with AR content. We address this gap in current research by conducting an online survey with 110 participants, showcasing 36 AR videos, and polling them about the content's fit and appropriateness. Specifically, we manipulated these three spaces, two forms of dynamism (dynamic vs. static), and two dimensionalities (2D vs. 3D). Our findings reveal that dynamic AR content is generally more favorably received than static content. Additionally, users find sharing and engaging with AR content in private settings more comfortable than in others. By this, the study offers valuable insights for designing and implementing future Social MediARverses and guides industry and academia on content visualization and contextual considerations.</description>

      <title>GSpect: Spectral Filtering for Cross-Scale Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying structures in common forms the basis for networked systems design and optimization. However, real structures represented by graphs are often of varying sizes, leading to the low accuracy of traditional graph classification methods. These graphs are called cross-scale graphs. To overcome this limitation, in this study, we propose GSpect, an advanced spectral graph filtering model for cross-scale graph classification tasks. Compared with other methods, we use graph wavelet neural networks for the convolution layer of the model, which aggregates multi-scale messages to generate graph representations. We design a spectral-pooling layer which aggregates nodes to one node to reduce the cross-scale graphs to the same size. We collect and construct the cross-scale benchmark data set, MSG (Multi Scale Graphs). Experiments reveal that, on open data sets, GSpect improves the performance of classification accuracy by 1.62% on average, and for a maximum of 3.33% on PROTEINS. On MSG, GSpect improves the performance of classification accuracy by 15.55% on average. GSpect fills the gap in cross-scale graph classification studies and has potential to provide assistance in application research like diagnosis of brain disease by predicting the brain network's label and developing new drugs with molecular structures learned from their counterparts in other systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Faster Graph Partitioning via Pre-training and Inductive Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph partitioning (GP) is a classic problem that divides the node set of a graph into densely-connected blocks. Following the IEEE HPEC Graph Challenge and recent advances in pre-training techniques (e.g., large-language models), we propose PR-GPT (Pre-trained &amp; Refined Graph ParTitioning) based on a novel pre-training &amp; refinement paradigm. We first conduct the offline pre-training of a deep graph learning (DGL) model on small synthetic graphs with various topology properties. By using the inductive inference of DGL, one can directly generalize the pre-trained model (with frozen model parameters) to large graphs and derive feasible GP results. We also use the derived partition as a good initialization of an efficient GP method (e.g., InfoMap) to further refine the quality of partitioning. In this setting, the online generalization and refinement of PR-GPT can not only benefit from the transfer ability regarding quality but also ensure high inference efficiency without re-training. Based on a mechanism of reducing the scale of a graph to be processed by the refinement method, PR-GPT also has the potential to support streaming GP. Experiments on the Graph Challenge benchmark demonstrate that PR-GPT can ensure faster GP on large-scale graphs without significant quality degradation, compared with running a refinement method from scratch. We will make our code public at https://github.com/KuroginQin/PRGPT.</description>

      <title>When Heterophily Meets Heterogeneous Graphs: Latent Graphs Guided Unsupervised Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised heterogeneous graph representation learning (UHGRL) has gained increasing attention due to its significance in handling practical graphs without labels. However, heterophily has been largely ignored, despite its ubiquitous presence in real-world heterogeneous graphs. In this paper, we define semantic heterophily and propose an innovative framework called Latent Graphs Guided Unsupervised Representation Learning (LatGRL) to handle this problem. First, we develop a similarity mining method that couples global structures and attributes, enabling the construction of fine-grained homophilic and heterophilic latent graphs to guide the representation learning. Moreover, we propose an adaptive dual-frequency semantic fusion mechanism to address the problem of node-level semantic heterophily. To cope with the massive scale of real-world data, we further design a scalable implementation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework. The source code and datasets have been made available at https://github.com/zxlearningdeep/LatGRL.</description>

      <title>Random matrix ensemble for the covariance matrix of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with heterogeneous temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a random matrix model for the stationary covariance of multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with heterogeneous temperatures, where the covariance is constrained by the Sylvester-Lyapunov equation. Using the replica method, we compute the spectral density of the equal-time covariance matrix characterizing the stationary states, demonstrating that this model undergoes a transition between stable and unstable states. In the stable regime, the spectral density has a finite and positive support, whereas negative eigenvalues emerge in the unstable regime. We determine the critical line separating these regimes and show that the spectral density exhibits a power-law tail at marginal stability, with an exponent independent of the temperature distribution. Additionally, we compute the spectral density of the lagged covariance matrix characterizing the stationary states of linear transformations of the original dynamical variables. Our random-matrix model is potentially interesting to understand the spectral properties of empirical correlation matrices appearing in the study of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Epidemic paradox induced by awareness driven network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stationary epidemic processes in scale-free networks with local awareness behavior adopted by only susceptible, only infected, or all nodes. We find that while the epidemic size in the susceptible-aware and the all-aware scenarios scales linearly with the network size, the scaling becomes sublinear in the infected-aware scenario, suggesting that fewer aware nodes may reduce the epidemic size more effectively. We explain this paradox via numerical and theoretical analysis, and highlight the role of influential nodes and their disassortativity to raise awareness in epidemic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cascades towards noise-induced transitions on networks revealed using information flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14016v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex networks, from neuronal assemblies to social systems, can exhibit abrupt, system-wide transitions without external forcing. These endogenously generated ``noise-induced transitions'' emerge from the intricate interplay between network structure and local dynamics, yet their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Our study unveils two critical roles that nodes play in catalyzing these transitions within dynamical networks governed by the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. We introduce the concept of ``initiator nodes'', which absorb and propagate short-lived fluctuations, temporarily destabilizing their neighbors. This process initiates a domino effect, where the stability of a node inversely correlates with the number of destabilized neighbors required to tip it. As the system approaches a tipping point, we identify ``stabilizer nodes'' that encode the system's long-term memory, ultimately reversing the domino effect and settling the network into a new stable attractor. Through targeted interventions, we demonstrate how these roles can be manipulated to either promote or inhibit systemic transitions. Our findings provide a novel framework for understanding and potentially controlling endogenously generated metastable behavior in complex networks. This approach opens new avenues for predicting and managing critical transitions in diverse fields, from neuroscience to social dynamics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Predicting Scientific Impact Through Diffusion, Conformity, and Contribution Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09262v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scientific impact of academic papers is influenced by intricate factors such as dynamic popularity and inherent contribution. Existing models typically rely on static graphs for citation count estimation, failing to differentiate among its sources. In contrast, we propose distinguishing effects derived from various factors and predicting citation increments as estimated potential impacts within the dynamic context. In this research, we introduce a novel model, DPPDCC, which Disentangles the Potential impacts of Papers into Diffusion, Conformity, and Contribution values. It encodes temporal and structural features within dynamic heterogeneous graphs derived from the citation networks and applies various auxiliary tasks for disentanglement. By emphasizing comparative and co-cited/citing information and aggregating snapshots evolutionarily, DPPDCC captures knowledge flow within the citation network. Afterwards, popularity is outlined by contrasting augmented graphs to extract the essence of citation diffusion and predicting citation accumulation bins for quantitative conformity modeling. Orthogonal constraints ensure distinct modeling of each perspective, preserving the contribution value. To gauge generalization across publication times and replicate the realistic dynamic context, we partition data based on specific time points and retain all samples without strict filtering. Extensive experiments on three datasets validate DPPDCC's superiority over baselines for papers published previously, freshly, and immediately, with further analyses confirming its robustness. Our codes and supplementary materials can be found at https://github.com/ECNU-Text-Computing/DPPDCC.</description>

      <title>An embedding-based distance for temporal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are commonly used to represent time-resolved relations between entities in many natural and artificial systems. Many techniques were devised to investigate the evolution of temporal graphs by comparing their state at different time points. However, quantifying the similarity between temporal graphs as a whole is an open problem. Here, we use embeddings based on time-respecting random walks to introduce a new notion of distance between temporal graphs. This distance is well-defined for pairs of temporal graphs with different numbers of nodes and different time spans. We study the case of a matched pair of graphs, when a known relation exists between their nodes, and the case of unmatched graphs, when such a relation is unavailable and the graphs may be of different sizes. We use empirical and synthetic temporal network data to show that the distance we introduce discriminates graphs with different topological and temporal properties. We provide an efficient implementation of the distance computation suitable for large-scale temporal graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new algorithm to approximate the percolation centrality of every node in a graph. Such a centrality measure quantifies the importance of the vertices in a network during a contagious process. In this paper, we present a randomized approximation algorithm that can compute probabilistically guaranteed high-quality percolation centrality estimates, generalizing techniques used by Pellegrina and Vandin (TKDD 2024) for the betweenness centrality. The estimation obtained by our algorithm is within $\varepsilon$ of the value with probability at least $1-\delta$, for fixed constants $\varepsilon,\delta \in (0,1)$. We our theoretical results with an extensive experimental analysis on several real-world networks and provide empirical evidence that our algorithm improves the current state of the art in speed, and sample size while maintaining high accuracy of the percolation centrality estimates.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Online Toxicity During the 2022 Mpox Outbreak: A Computational Analysis of Topical and Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Online toxicity, encompassing behaviors such as harassment, bullying, hate speech, and the dissemination of misinformation, has become a pressing social concern in the digital age. The 2022 Mpox outbreak, initially termed "Monkeypox" but subsequently renamed to mitigate associated stigmas and societal concerns, serves as a poignant backdrop to this issue. Objective: In this research, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the toxic online discourse surrounding the 2022 Mpox outbreak. Our objective is to dissect its origins, characterize its nature and content, trace its dissemination patterns, and assess its broader societal implications, with the goal of providing insights that can inform strategies to mitigate such toxicity in future crises. Methods: We collected more than 1.6 million unique tweets and analyzed them from five dimensions, including context, extent, content, speaker, and intent. Utilizing BERT-based topic modeling and social network community clustering, we delineated the toxic dynamics on Twitter. Results: We identified five high-level topic categories in the toxic online discourse on Twitter, including disease (46.6%), health policy and healthcare (19.3%), homophobia (23.9%), politics (6.0%), and racism (4.1%). Through the toxicity diffusion networks of mentions, retweets, and the top users, we found that retweets of toxic content were widespread, while influential users rarely engaged with or countered this toxicity through retweets. Conclusions: By tracking topical dynamics, we can track the changing popularity of toxic content online, providing a better understanding of societal challenges. Network dynamics spotlight key social media influencers and their intents, indicating that addressing these central figures in toxic discourse can enhance crisis communication and inform policy-making.</description>

      <title>Efficient Heterogeneous Graph Learning via Random Projection</title>

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are powerful tools for deep learning on heterogeneous graphs. Typical HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Recent pre-computation-based HGNNs use one-time message passing to transform a heterogeneous graph into regular-shaped tensors, enabling efficient mini-batch training. Existing pre-computation-based HGNNs can be mainly categorized into two styles, which differ in how much information loss is allowed and efficiency. We propose a hybrid pre-computation-based HGNN, named Random Projection Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (RpHGNN), which combines the benefits of one style's efficiency with the low information loss of the other style. To achieve efficiency, the main framework of RpHGNN consists of propagate-then-update iterations, where we introduce a Random Projection Squashing step to ensure that complexity increases only linearly. To achieve low information loss, we introduce a Relation-wise Neighbor Collection component with an Even-odd Propagation Scheme, which aims to collect information from neighbors in a finer-grained way. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on seven small and large benchmark datasets while also being 230% faster compared to the most effective baseline. Surprisingly, our approach not only surpasses pre-processing-based baselines but also outperforms end-to-end methods.</description>

      <title>Network Structure Governs Drosophila Brain Functionality</title>

Abstract: How intelligence emerges from living beings has been a fundamental question in neuroscience. However, it remains largely unanswered due to the complex neuronal dynamics and intricate connections between neurons in real neural systems. To address this challenge, we leveraged the largest available adult Drosophila connectome data set, and constructed a comprehensive computational framework based on simplified neuronal activation mechanisms to simulate the observed activation behavior within the connectome. The results revealed that even with rudimentary neuronal activation mechanisms, models grounded in real neural network structures can generate activation patterns strikingly similar to those observed in the actual brain. A significant discovery was the consistency of activation patterns across various neuronal dynamic models. This consistency, achieved with the same network structure, underscores the pivotal role of network topology in neural information processing. These results challenge the prevailing view that solely relies on neuron count or complex individual neuron dynamics. Further analysis demonstrated a near-complete separation of the visual and olfactory systems at the network level. Moreover, we found that the network distance, rather than spatial distance, is the primary determinant of activation patterns. Additionally, our experiments revealed that a reconnect rate of at least 0.1% was sufficient to disrupt the previously observed activation patterns. We also observed synergistic effects between the brain hemispheres: Even with unilateral input stimuli, visual-related neurons in both hemispheres were activated, highlighting the importance of interhemispheric communication. These findings emphasize the crucial role of network structure in neural activation and offer novel insights into the fundamental principles governing brain functionality.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Graph Transformers Across Diverse Graphs and Tasks via Pre-Training on Industrial-Scale Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph pre-training has been concentrated on graph-level on small graphs (e.g., molecular graphs) or learning node representations on a fixed graph. Extending graph pre-trained models to web-scale graphs with billions of nodes in industrial scenarios, while avoiding negative transfer across graphs or tasks, remains a challenge. We aim to develop a general graph pre-trained model with inductive ability that can make predictions for unseen new nodes and even new graphs. In this work, we introduce a scalable transformer-based graph pre-training framework called PGT (Pre-trained Graph Transformer). Specifically, we design a flexible and scalable graph transformer as the backbone network. Meanwhile, based on the masked autoencoder architecture, we design two pre-training tasks: one for reconstructing node features and the other one for reconstructing local structures. Unlike the original autoencoder architecture where the pre-trained decoder is discarded, we propose a novel strategy that utilizes the decoder for feature augmentation. We have deployed our framework on Tencent's online game data. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our framework can perform pre-training on real-world web-scale graphs with over 540 million nodes and 12 billion edges and generalizes effectively to unseen new graphs with different downstream tasks. We further conduct experiments on the publicly available ogbn-papers100M dataset, which consists of 111 million nodes and 1.6 billion edges. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on both industrial datasets and public datasets, while also enjoying scalability and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conspiracy theories, particularly those focused on anti-vaccine narratives and the promotion of off-label medications such as MMS and CDS, have proliferated on Telegram, including in Brazil, finding fertile ground among communities that share esoteric beliefs and distrust towards scientific institutions. In this context, this study seeks to answer how Brazilian conspiracy theory communities on Telegram are characterized and articulated concerning anti-vaccine themes and off-label medications? It is important to highlight that this study is part of a series of seven studies aimed at understanding and characterizing Brazilian conspiracy theory communities on Telegram. This series of seven studies is openly and originally available on the arXiv of Cornell University, applying a mirrored method across all studies, changing only the thematic object of analysis and providing replicable research, including proprietary and original codes developed, contributing to the culture of free and open-source software. Regarding the main findings of this study, it was observed: Themes such as the New World Order and Apocalypse and Survivalism act as significant gateways to anti-vaccine narratives, connecting them to theories of global control; Globalism and New World Order stand out as the main communities receiving invitations from anti-vaccine communities; Occultism and Esotericism emerge as the largest sources of invitations to off-label medication communities, creating a strong connection between esoteric beliefs and the promotion of non-scientific treatments; Anti-vaccine narratives experienced a 290% increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, evidencing a growing interconnectedness with other conspiracy theories; The overlap of themes between anti-vaccine and other conspiracy theories creates an interdependent disinformation network, where different narratives mutually reinforce each other.</description>

Abstract: Conspiracy theories related to climate change denial and anti-science have found fertile ground on Telegram, particularly among Brazilian communities that distrust scientific institutions and oppose global environmental policies. This study seeks to answer the research question: how are Brazilian conspiracy theory communities on climate change and anti-science themes characterized and articulated on Telegram? It is worth noting that this study is part of a series of seven studies aimed at understanding and characterizing Brazilian conspiracy theory communities on Telegram. This series of studies is openly and originally available on arXiv from Cornell University, applying a mirrored method across all seven studies, changing only the thematic focus of analysis, and providing replicable investigation methods, including custom-developed and proprietary codes, contributing to the culture of open-source software. Regarding the main findings of this study, the following observations were made: Climate change denial and anti-science communities interact synergistically, creating a complex network that mutually reinforces disinformation narratives; Apocalyptic themes, such as Apocalypse and Survivalism, act as gateways to climate denial, with 5,057 links directed to these communities; Anti-science communities function as gatekeepers, distributing links evenly to theories such as the New World Order and Globalism, among others; During the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-science discussions experienced a significant peak, driven by vaccine disinformation; The intersection between anti-science narratives and esoteric beliefs reinforces the idea of a supposed alternative truth that challenges science; Since 2022, discussions on climate change have evolved to align with global domination theories; Additionally, the UN's 2030 Agenda is portrayed as part of a global conspiracy.</description>
