      <title>Differentiable Stellar Atmospheres with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Kurucz-a1, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that emulates 1D stellar atmosphere models under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), addressing a critical bottleneck in differentiable stellar spectroscopy. By incorporating hydrostatic equilibrium as a physical constraint during training, Kurucz-a1 creates a differentiable atmospheric structure solver that maintains physical consistency while achieving computational efficiency. Kurucz-a1 can achieve superior hydrostatic equilibrium and more consistent with the solar observed spectra compared to ATLAS-12 itself, demonstrating the advantages of modern optimization techniques. Combined with modern differentiable radiative transfer codes, this approach enables data-driven optimization of universal physical parameters across diverse stellar populations-a capability essential for next-generation stellar astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Optical detection of the X-ray flash in the very fast nova V1674 Her: Optical contribution of the irradiated accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V1674 Her is one of the fastest and brightest novae, characterized by dense optical photometry in the pre-maximum phase, a rise from $g=17$ to 7 mag, in one-fourth of a day. We present a composite theoretical $V$ light curve model of its early rising phase starting from a quiescent brightness of $g=19.2$ mag. Our light curve model consists of a hot and bright white dwarf (WD) and irradiated accretion disk and companion star. We found that the earliest optical detection of ASAS-SN $g$ band brightness of $g=17.0$ at $t=0.014$ day from the onset of thermonuclear runaway can be explained with the irradiated accretion disk and companion star in the X-ray flash phase of a $1.35 ~M_\odot$ WD. This is the first detection in optical of an X-ray flash phase of a nova. Optically thick winds emerge from the WD photosphere at $t=0.04$ day, and optical flux is dominated by free-free emission from optically-thin ejecta just outside the WD photosphere. Our free-free emission model $V$ light curve reasonably reproduces the dense $g$ light curve of Evryscope that spans from $g=14.8$ (at 0.078 day) to $g=7.1$ (at 0.279 day), including a sudden change of slope in the $g$ light curve from slow to rapid rise at $g=14.3$ on day $0.1$. There is no indication of shocking power during the rising phase from $g=14.8$ to 7.1.</description>

      <title>Heat Transport and Dissipation in 2.5D Rotating Internally Heated and Cooled Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of astrophysical convection, such as mixing length theory, typically assume that the heat transport is independent of microphysical diffusivities. Such 'diffusion-free' behaviour is, however, not observed in numerical simulations employing standard fixed-flux or fixed-temperature boundary conditions, except possibly in extreme parameter regimes that are computationally expensive to achieve. Recent numerical and experimental work has suggested that internally heated and cooled convection can exhibit diffusion-free scalings in more numerically accessible regimes. Here, we present direct numerical simulations of 2.5D Cartesian rotating thermal convection driven by an internal heating and cooling function. The use of distributed heating and cooling functions alleviates sharp thermal boundary layers that would otherwise be present, allowing the flows to be simulated with modest computational resources. We show that for high Rossby numbers this set-up recovers mixing length theory scalings for the heat transport. The velocity amplitudes, in contrast, are observed to display diffusion-limited scalings. By comparing against boundary driven rotating convection, we show that internally heated cases have a larger fraction of their thermal dissipation occuring in the bulk of the fluid. We suggest this is connected to the increased convective efficiency observed in these cases. Our results indicate that 2.5D internally heated convection can be used as a computationally inexpensive test-bed to investigate some aspects of diffusion-free heat transport.</description>

      <title>Eclipse timing variations in 7 post-common envelope binaries: an update on recent circumbinary models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipsing, short-period post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs) have been studied for several decades by eclipse timing variations (ETVs) which have been interpreted as being caused by circumbinary bodies. In this paper we report 355 new observations of 7 PECBs (HS0705+6700, NN Ser, NSVS 07826147, NSVS 14256825, NY Vir, QS Vir and RR Cae) and examine how the recent proposed models of these systems compare with our new observations. We find that none of the 18 recent models fit accurately with our data. We review alternative mechanisms of the ETVs, including magnetic effects, but conclude that they do not predict our results. Although we cannot exclude the presence of circumbinary bodies a combination of several mechanisms may be required to explain the observed ETVs.</description>

      <title>IRAS 22272+5435 (V354 Lac): Multicolor Photometry of a Variable Carbon-rich post-AGB Star and a Dust Formation Episode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new UBV photometric observations (2009-2024) of the carbon-rich post-AGB star IRAS 22272+5435 (V354 Lac), combined with our data spanning over 30 years (1991-2024). The star shows pulsations with two closely spaced periods, 127 and 132 d, which cause brightness variations of variable amplitude. We also detect low-amplitude oscillations with a 661-day period, of uncertain origin. Color analysis reveals both temperature variations during pulsations and spectral anomalies. For the first time, we analyze long-term JHKLM photometry (1994-2024), showing increased KLM-band brightness from 1996 to 2004 - likely due to dust emission following a sudden mass ejection. The absence of strong optical variability suggests either a large angle between the ejection direction and the line of sight or a low optical depth of the ejected material. We discuss possible mechanisms and observational signatures of this dust-formation event.</description>

      <title>Giants, Supergiants and Hypergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing the stars in our night sky tells us that giant, supergiant and hypergiant stars hold an unique importance in the understanding of stellar populations. Theoretical stellar models predict a rich tapestry of evolved stars. These evolved stars result in supernova explosions for massive stars and the shedding of the outer layers of low- and intermediate-mass stars to form white dwarf stars. Stars on these pathways provide elemental and kinematic feedback that shapes their host galaxies and synthesize the elements that we observe in the Universe today. Observational surveys in the Milky Way and the Local Group of galaxies shape our physical understanding of stellar evolution. Hypergiant stars represent stellar evolution at the extremes, displaying evidence of intense stellar winds combined with luminosities and radii that are unrivalled. Supergiant stars are used as elemental beacons in distant galaxies, and supergiants that cross the Cepheid variable instability strip can be used as rulers to measure the scale of our Universe. The overwhelming majority of stars in the Milky Way will become giant stars. Giants are hundreds of times larger and thousands of times more luminous than the Sun, which makes them excellent tracers of stellar structure. In this chapter, I describe the observational and theoretical manifestations of stellar evolution at various stages and masses. I highlight evolutionary connections between evolved products and comment on their eventual endpoints.</description>

      <title>Dating N loud AGNs at high redshift: GS3073 as a snapshot of wCen like evolution of a nuclear star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address two major questions raised by recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of the young Universe, namely: 1) what are the seed initial masses, and how rapidly have supermassive black holes (BHs) with masses of 1e6-1e8Msun grown in active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosted by very young galaxies? 2) What are the plausible explanations for the super solar abundances of nitrogen in a fraction of young galaxies at high redshift, both with and without evidence of a massive central black hole? We focus mainly on the system GS3073. This system shows an exceptionally large log(N/O)=+0.42(+0.13/-0.10) in the gas close to the AGN. We show here that this abundance is consistent with the composition of gas ejected from massive asymptotic giant branch stars. Moreover, this system shows chemical properties matching those expected at a specific point of the evolution of the abundances in the extreme populations of the former nuclear star cluster wCentauri (wCen). This analogy, along with the N/O, C/O and Fe/O abundances in GS3073, lead to an estimate of an age range of 270-440 Myr for this object, much smaller than the redshift (z=5.5) age of about 1 Gyr. We also adopt the same criteria to estimate an age for GNz11. These two determinations constrain the BH mass versus age relation: accretion on the BH must proceed at intermittent superEddington rates in the first phases, and at a much lower rate after the first half gigayear of life of the Universe. The intermittency of accretion is also a fundamental requirement to allow the formation of the extreme (N rich, O depleted, He rich) populations today observed in wCen for a large range of metallicities.</description>

      <title>Supernovae from stellar mergers and accretors of binary mass transfer: Implications for Type IIP, 1987A-like and interacting supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As most massive stars are born in binary and other multiple-star systems, many are expected to exchange mass with a companion star or merge with it during their lives. This means that most supernovae (SNe) are from such binary products. Here, we focus on hydrogen-rich Type II SNe from accretors of binary mass transfer and stellar mergers. We compute various SN properties such as the explosion energies, nickel yields, and neutron star (NS) kick velocities, but also consider NS masses. We find tight correlations between these parameters and, e.g., the central specific entropy and core compactness. However, there is no obvious relation between these explosion properties and the evolutionary history of the pre-SN stars. We find linear relations between the nickel mass and the SN explosion energy and the NS remnant mass. We further group our models into progenitors of SNe IIP, SN 1987A-like and interacting SNe, predict their SN and SN-progenitor properties and compare to observations. Accretors of binary mass transfer and stellar mergers naturally produce SNe IIP with long plateau durations from progenitors with relatively small CO-cores but large envelope masses (c.f. SN 2015ba). Our models give rise to tight relations between the plateau luminosity and the nickel mass as well as the SN ejecta velocity as inferred observationally for SNe IIP. We speculate that cool/red supergiants at $\log\,L/L_\odot\,{\geq}\,5.5$ encounter enhanced mass loss due to envelope instabilities and could then explode in interacting SNe IIn. The rate of such SNe from our models seems compatible with observations. Some of our binary models explode as $10^6\,L_\odot$ blue supergiants that may have encountered enhanced and/or eruptive mass loss shortly before their SNe and could thus help understand interacting SNe such as SN 1961V and SN 2005gl but also superluminous Type II SNe such as SN 2010jl.

      <title>Wakes from Companion Interactions in Type Ia Supernovae Nebular Emission Line Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermonuclear supernovae (SNe) are the result of the nuclear transformation of carbon/oxygen (C/O) white dwarfs (WDs) to the radioactive element $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and intermediate mass elements (IMEs) like Ca, Ar, etc. Most progenitor scenarios involve a companion star which donates matter to the exploding white dwarf, implying a fundamental prediction: the formation of a wake in the explosive ejecta as it runs into and moves past the companion star. This wake leaves an indelible imprint on the ejecta's density, velocity, and composition structure that remains fixed as the ejecta reaches homologous expansion. We simulate the interaction of the ejecta and Roche-lobe filling donor in a double degenerate double detonation Type Ia progenitor scenario and explore the detectability of this imprint in late-time nebular phase spectroscopy of Type Ia SNe under the assumption of local heating ($t &gt; 200$ days). At these times, the velocity profiles of forbidden emission lines reflect the velocity distribution of all of the ejecta and the critical electron density for that forbidden line. We explicitly calculate line shapes for the [Co III] $11.89 \mu\mathrm{m}$ line that traces the initial $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ distribution and the [Ar III] $8.99 \mu\mathrm{m}$ line, which traces a typical intermediate mass element. We predict the viewing angle dependence of the line shape, present a tool to quickly calculate optically thin line shapes for various 3D density-velocity profiles and discuss JWST observations.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Analysis of the Milky Way Warp Based on Classical Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids (CCs) are important probes for the large-scale warp structure of the Milky Way. Using Gaia DR3 CCs, we establish an optimal time-dependent warp model, where the warp height increases with radius following a power-law, the line of nodes (LONs) exhibit linear twisting with radius, following a leading spiral pattern, and the LONs undergo prograde evolution over time. Structurally, we identify significant warp features in the $5-9$ kpc region of the Galactic disk, where the warp model performs better than the flat model. Beyond 15 kpc, the model with the second Fourier term does not fit the observations well, whereas the model with twisted LONs better matches the data. Kinematically, we derived expressions for the vertical velocities using direct differentiation and then calculated the precession rates for each CC. Our results intuitively indicate a nearly uniform and low warp precession rate of $\omega = 4.86 \pm (0.88)_{stat} \pm (2.14)_{sys}$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ beyond 12.5 kpc, in agreement with classical kinematic estimates. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet comprehensive time-dependent warp model, $Z_{w}(t) = 0.00019R^{3.08}\sin(\phi - (3.87R-41.79 + 4.86t))$, which provides a unified framework for describing both the geometric and kinematic evolution of the Galactic warp. We analyzed the impact of the adopted solar vertical velocity on the inferred warp precession rate and confirmed the reliability of the measured precession rate. In addition, we found that extinction treatment affects the warp amplitude in the inner disk, while its influence on the outer disk warp structure and the precession rate is negligible.</description>

      <title>Does HESS J1731-347 have a thick crust ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relativistic mean-field model with a crossing term of isovector-scalar and isoscalar mesons, the Cracow crossing terms (CCT) model, has previously been shown to be capable of explaining the light and compact object HESS J1731-347. Here, the model is supplemented with a correct treatment of the phase transition. Applying the thermodynamically consistent Gibbs conditions shows that a mixed-phase system occurs in the core of the neutron star over a wide range of densities, extending up to the neutron star crust, leading to an intriguing stellar structure with a thick and massive crust.</description>

      <title>Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V: Pioneering Panoptic Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V (SDSS-V) is pioneering panoptic spectroscopy: it is the first all-sky, multi-epoch, optical-to-infrared spectroscopic survey. SDSS-V is mapping the sky with multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) at telescopes in both hemispheres (the 2.5-m Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory and the 100-inch du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory), where 500 zonal robotic fiber positioners feed light from a wide-field focal plane to an optical (R$\sim 2000$, 500 fibers) and a near-infrared (R$\sim 22,000$, 300 fibers) spectrograph. In addition to these MOS capabilities, the survey is pioneering ultra wide-field ($\sim$ 4000~deg$^2$) integral field spectroscopy enabled by a new dedicated facility (LVM-I) at Las Campanas Observatory, where an integral field spectrograph (IFS) with 1801 lenslet-coupled fibers arranged in a 0.5 degree diameter hexagon feeds multiple R$\sim$4000 optical spectrographs that cover 3600-9800 angstroms. SDSS-V's hardware and multi-year survey strategy are designed to decode the chemo-dynamical history of the Milky Way Galaxy and tackle fundamental open issues in stellar physics in its Milky Way Mapper program, trace the growth physics of supermassive black holes in its Black Hole Mapper program, and understand the self-regulation mechanisms and the chemical enrichment of galactic ecosystems at the energy-injection scale in its Local Volume Mapper program. The survey is well-timed to multiply the scientific output from major all-sky space missions. The SDSS-V MOS programs began robotic operations in 2021; IFS observations began in 2023 with the completion of the LVM-I facility. SDSS-V builds upon decades of heritage of SDSS's pioneering advances in data analysis, collaboration spirit, infrastructure, and product deliverables in astronomy.</description>

      <title>The Nineteenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey</title>

Abstract: Mapping the local and distant Universe is key to our understanding of it. For decades, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has made a concerted effort to map millions of celestial objects to constrain the physical processes that govern our Universe. The most recent and fifth generation of SDSS (SDSS-V) is organized into three scientific ``mappers". Milky Way Mapper (MWM) that aims to chart the various components of the Milky Way and constrain its formation and assembly, Black Hole Mapper (BHM), which focuses on understanding supermassive black holes in distant galaxies across the Universe, and Local Volume Mapper (LVM), which uses integral field spectroscopy to map the ionized interstellar medium in the local group. This paper describes and outlines the scope and content for the nineteenth data release (DR19) of SDSS and the most substantial to date in SDSS-V. DR19 is the first to contain data from all three mappers. Additionally, we also describe nine value added catalogs (VACs) that enhance the science that can be conducted with the SDSS-V data. Finally, we discuss how to access SDSS DR19 and provide illustrative examples and tutorials.</description>

      <title>Flaring Stars in a Non-targeted mm-wave Survey with SPT-3G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a flare star catalog from four years of non-targeted millimeter-wave survey data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The data were taken with the SPT-3G camera and cover a 1500-square-degree region of the sky from $20^{h}40^{m}0^{s}$ to $3^{h}20^{m}0^{s}$ in right ascension and $-42^{\circ}$ to $-70^{\circ}$ in declination. This region was observed on a nearly daily cadence from 2019-2022 and chosen to avoid the plane of the galaxy. A short-duration transient search of this survey yields 111 flaring events from 66 stars, increasing the number of both flaring events and detected flare stars by an order of magnitude from the previous SPT-3G data release. We provide cross-matching to Gaia DR3, as well as matches to X-ray point sources found in the second ROSAT all-sky survey. We have detected flaring stars across the main sequence, from early-type A stars to M dwarfs, as well as a large population of evolved stars. These stars are mostly nearby, spanning 10 to 1000 parsecs in distance. Most of the flare spectral indices are constant or gently rising as a function of frequency at 95/150/220 GHz. The timescale of these events can range from minutes to hours, and the peak $\nu L_{\nu}$ luminosities range from $10^{27}$ to $10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the SPT-3G frequency bands.</description>

      <title>Observational Parameters of Blue Large-amplitude Pulsators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are a recently discovered class of short-period pulsating variable stars. In this work, we present new information on these stars based on photometric and spectroscopic data obtained for known and new objects detected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. BLAPs are evolved objects with pulsation periods in the range of 3-75 minutes, stretching between subdwarf B-type stars and upper main-sequence stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. In general, BLAPs are single-mode stars pulsating in the fundamental radial mode. Their phase-folded light curves are typically sawtooth-shaped, but many longer-period objects exhibit an additional bump. The long-term OGLE observations show that the period change rates of BLAPs are usually of the order of $10^{-7}$ yr$^{-1}$ and in a quarter of the sample are negative. The spectroscopic data indicate that the BLAPs form a homogeneous group in the period, surface gravity, and effective temperature spaces. However, we observe a split into two groups in terms of helium-to-hydrogen content. The atmospheres of the He-enriched BLAPs are more abundant in metals (about 5 times) than the atmosphere of the Sun. We discover that BLAPs obey a period--gravity relationship and we use the distance to OGLE-BLAP-009 to derive a period--luminosity relation. Most of the stars observed in the OGLE Galactic bulge fields seem to reside in the bulge, while the remaining objects likely are in the foreground Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>A Unified Phenomenology of Ion Heating in Low-$\beta$ Plasmas: Test-Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that stochastic and quasi-linear ion heating, often viewed as distinct processes in low-$\beta$ collisionless plasmas, are the far limits of a continuum controlled by nonlinear broadening of turbulent fluctuations, and thus by the normalized cross helicity.} We propose a simple empirical formula that captures both regimes, generalizing that commonly used to describe stochastic heating. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as seen in the solar wind. \revchange{Our results provide a unified framework for understanding ion heating processes across diverse astrophysical environments from black-hole accretion disks to the solar corona, also providing a compact and versatile subgrid model for larger-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the detection of low-energy M dwarf flares: Wavelet-based denoising of CHEOPS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar flares are powerful bursts of electromagnetic radiation triggered by magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere of stars, occurring frequently and intensely on active M dwarfs. While missions like TESS and Kepler have studied regular and super-flares, their detection of flares with energies below $10^{30}$ erg remains incomplete. Extending flare studies to include these low-energy events could enhance flare formation models and provide insight into their impacts on exoplanetary atmospheres. This study investigates CHEOPS's capacity to detect low-energy flares in M dwarf light curves. Using its high photometric precision and observing cadence, along with a tailored wavelet-based denoising algorithm, we aim to improve detection completeness and refine flare statistics for low-energy events. We conducted a flare injection and recovery to optimise denoising parameters, applied it to CHEOPS light curves to maximise detection rates, and used a flare breakdown algorithm to analyse complex structures. We recovered 291 flares with energies ranging from $3.7\times10^{26}$ to $8.9\times10^{30}$ erg across 62 M dwarfs, with $\sim$42% exhibiting complex, multi-peaked structures. The denoising improved flare recovery by $\sim$35%, although it marginally extended the lower boundary of detectable energies. For the full sample, the power-law index $\alpha$ was $1.99\pm0.10$, but a log-normal distribution fitted better, suggesting multiple possible flare formation scenarios. While CHEOPS's observing mode is not ideal for large-scale surveys, it captures weaker flares than TESS or Kepler, expanding the observed energy range. Wavelet-based denoising enhances low-energy event recovery, enabling exploration of the micro-flaring regime. Expanding low-energy flare observations could refine flare generation models and improve the understanding of their role in star-planet interactions.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Magneto-Convection on Short Period Cataclysmic Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many of the current problems related to the evolution of cataclysmic variables revolve around the magnetic nature of the main sequence secondary. It is known that magnetic fields alter the structure of low mass stars. In particular, they inhibit convection, leading to inflated radii. Here we present a simple model to demonstrate the impact of magneto-convection on the evolution of short period cataclysmic variables. We find that the inclusion of magneto-convection leads to larger secondaries, longer orbital periods and smaller mass-loss rates. When including magnetic effects, the minimum orbital period is increased by 14 minutes, indicating that this could help alleviate the period minimum problem in cataclysmic variable evolution. We also examine the effect of the white dwarf mass on the minimum period. While increasing the white dwarf mass does increase the minimum period, it is not substantial. Therefore it is unlikely that the period minimum problem can be solved with a larger white dwarf mass or with mass growth of white dwarf.</description>

      <title>SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper (MWM): ASPCAP Stellar Parameters and Abundances in SDSS-V Data Release 19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to describe the science verification of Milky Way Mapper (MWM) APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP) data products published in Data Release 19 (DR19) of the fifth phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V). We compare MWM ASPCAP atmospheric parameters T$_{\rm eff}$, log g, 24 abundances of 21 elements (carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen have multiple sources for deriving their abundance values) and their uncertainties determined from Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) spectrograph spectra with those of the literature and evaluate their accuracy and precision. We also test the zero-point calibration of the v$_{\rm rad}$ derived by the APOGEE Data Reduction Pipeline. This data release contains ASPCAP parameters for 964,989 stars, including all APOGEE-2 targets expanded with new observations of 336,511 stars from the Apache Point Observatory observed until 4 July 2023. Overall, the new T$_{\rm eff}$ values show excellent agreement with the IRFM scale, while the surface gravities exhibit slight systematic offsets compared to asteroseisimic gravities. The estimated precision of T$_{\rm eff}$ is between 50 and 70 K for giants and 70$-$100 K for dwarfs, while surface gravities are measured with a precision of 0.07$-$0.09 dex for giants. We achieve an estimated precision of 0.02$-$0.04 dex for multiple elements, including metallicity, $\alpha$, Mg, and Si, while the precision of at least 10 elements is better than 0.1 dex.</description>

Abstract: We present deep $K_s$-band imaging of the extreme T subdwarf CWISE J221706.28$-$145437.6. Using the new photometry, we construct its spectral energy distribution and find this object exhibits exceptionally strong collision-induced absorption in the $H$ and $K$ bands. The comparison with the nearest benchmark extreme T subdwarf WISEA J181006.18$-$101000.5 suggests the object would be cooler and more metal-poor than the benchmark.</description>

Although empirical, its extensive use since its inception to describe polarization induced by interstellar dust has elevated the relation to the status of an indisputable "law", serving as the benchmark for validating interstellar dust grain models. We revisit the effects of the 3D structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) on the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization. We use analytical models to show how the wavelength dependence of both the polarization fraction and direction is affected by the presence of multiple clouds along the line of sight (LOS), accounting for recent developments in dust distribution modelling and utilizing an expanded archive of stellar polarization measurements. We highlight concrete examples of stars whose polarization profiles are severely affected by LOS variations of the dust grain and magnetic field properties, and we provide a recipe to accurately fit multiple cloud Serkowski models to such cases. We present, for the first time, compelling observational evidence that the 3D structure of the magnetized ISM often results to the violation of the Serkowski relation. We show that 3D effects impact interstellar cloud parameters derived from Serkowski fits. In particular, the dust size distribution in single - cloud sightlines may differ from analyses that ignore 3D effects, with important implications for dust modelling in the Galaxy. Our results suggest that multiband stellar polarization measurements offer an independent probe of the LOS variations of the magnetic field, constituting a valuable new tool for the 3D cartography of the ISM. We caution that, unless 3D effects are explicitly accounted for, a poor fit to the Serkowski relation does not, by itself, constitute conclusive evidence that a star is intrinsically polarized.</description>

Abstract: Fermi-LAT observations revealed that each GeV phase-folded light-curve (aka. phaseogram) of the Crab, Geminga, Dragonfly and Vela pulsars consists of two pulses (P1 &amp; P2) and a "Bridge" between them. There is clearly a "bump" at the Bridge phase of Vela's pulse profiles, that could also be regarded as the third pulse (P3). Differently, the Crab's, Geminga's &amp; Dragonfly's Bridges relatively resemble a "valley floor". Despite such an apparent difference, it is interesting to investigate whether their Bridge emissions are still within the same general picture as Vela's. Assuming the north-south symmetry, we would expect the fourth component (Bridge2/P4) to exist as well. However, such a hypothetical Bridge2/P4 is not intuitively identified on $\gamma$-ray phaseograms of the Crab, Geminga, Dragonfly and Vela pulsars. It is also intriguing to hint at the rationale for the non-discovery of Bridge2/P4. Our prototypical toy model is free of assumptions on emission regions or radiation mechanisms. Instead, it assumes a north-south symmetric geometry and one circularly symmetric beam per hemisphere, while taking into account Doppler shifts (the most innovative element), time delays and energy-dependent beam shapes. Tentative compatibility of our fitting results with wind models is reported. Notably, for the Crab pulsar, we found a preliminary qualitative correlation between our model predictions and the IXPE results on X-ray polarisation. The softer $\gamma$-ray pulsation of the Geminga pulsar is found to span over its full phase. Prompted by systematic evaluations, we outline some potential improvements for our toy model.</description>

      <title>ASASSN-24fw: Candidate circumplanetary disk occultation of a main-sequence star</title>

Abstract: Dusty disks around planets in outer reaches of exo-planetary systems can be detected as long-lasting occultations, provided the observer is close to the planet's orbital plane. Here we report follow-up observations of ASASSN-24fw (Gaia 07:05:18.97+06:12:19.4), a 4-magnitude dimming event of a main-sequence star which lasted 8.5 months. Using optical spectroscopy with KOSMOS (APO), MagE (Magellan) and GHOST (Gemini-S), we find strong Na I D absorption indicating that the occulter is gas rich. We detect multiple low-ionization metal emission lines with velocity dispersion &lt;10 km/s blue-shifted by 27 km/s with respect to the system, which likely originate in the occulter, as well as blue-shifted and broad (200 km/s) Halpha line, which likely originates in the inner circumstellar disk. We confirm the previously reported occultations in 1981 and 1937 seen in historic data, yielding a semi-major axis of the occulter's orbital motion around the star of 14 AU. Assuming that the occulter is a circumplanetary disk filling 30-100% of the Hill radius, we derive the planet's mass of 0.5-19 MJupiter and a circumplanetary disk mass of 1% of the mass of the Moon. Given the age of the star (&gt;2 Gyr), the disk is unlikely to be a survivor of the planet formation stage and is more likely to be a result of a planetary collision. If Na D absorption and metal emission lines originate in the circumplanetary disk, the observations presented here are the first discovery of a planet-driven wind or of circumsecondary disk rotation.</description>
