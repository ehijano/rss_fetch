      <title>The $r$-matrix structure on the moduli space of framed Higgs pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the space of matrices with rational (trigonometric/elliptic) entries there is a well-known Lie-Poisson $r$-matrix structure. The known $r$-matrices are defined on the Riemann sphere (rational), the cylinder (trigonometric), or the torus (elliptic). We extend the formalism to the case of a Riemann surface $\mathcal C$ of higher genus $g$: we consider the moduli space of framed vector bundles of rank $n$ and degree $ng$, where the framing consists in a choice of basis of $n$ independent holomorphic sections chosen to trivialize the fiber at a given point $\infty\in \mathcal C$. The co-tangent space is known to be identified with the set of Higgs fields, i.e., one-forms on $\mathcal C$ with values in the endomorphisms of the vector bundle, with an additional simple pole at $\infty$. The natural symplectic structure on the co-tangent bundle of the moduli space induces a Poisson structure on the Higgs fields. The result is then an explicit $r$--matrix that generalizes the known ones. A detailed discussion of the elliptic case with comparison to the literature is also provided.</description>

      <title>Blowup relations and $q$-Painlev\'e VI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and study blowup relations obeyed by the partition functions of $5d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ (quiver) SYM theories with $SU(2)$ gauge group and four flavours. By analyzing the Weyl group action on the sets of blowup relations, we identify the integer parameters of a blowup relation with the weights of a corresponding Lie algebra. We also explain how this action of the Weyl group follows from the Weyl group symmetry of the partition function. Finally, we use these relations to derive bilinear relations on the $q$-Painlev\'e VI tau functions.</description>

      <title>More solutions to the decoration transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate new solutions to the decoration transformation in terms of various special functions, including the hyperbolic gamma function, the basic hypergeometric function, and the Euler gamma function. These solutions to the symmetry transformation are important to decorate Ising-like integrable lattice spin models obtained via the gauge/YBE correspondence. The integral identities represented as the solution of the decoration transformation are derived from the three-dimensional partition functions and superconformal index for the dual supersymmetric gauge theories.</description>

      <title>On enumeration of $l$-hypermaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $l$-hypermaps, $l\ge2$, which generalize (dual of) ribbon graphs ($l=2$ case), are interesting enumerative objects. In this paper, based on a theorem of Carlet--van de Leur--Posthuma--Shadrin and the matrix-resolvent method, we derive an explicit formula for $k$-point generating series of enumeration of $l$-hypermaps, which generalizes the one obtained in [30] for the $l=2$ case. We also generalize a theorem of Dubrovin [29].</description>

      <title>The direct linearization scheme with the Lam\'e function: The KP equation and reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper starts from establishing an elliptic direct linearization (DL) scheme for the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation. The scheme consists of an integral equation (involving the Lam\'e function) and a formula for elliptic soliton solutions, which can be confirmed by checking Lax pair. Based on analysis of real-valuedness of the Weierstrass functions, we are able to construct a Marchenko equation for elliptic solitons. A mechanism to obtain nonsingular real solutions from this elliptic DL scheme is formulated. By utilizing elliptic $N$th roots of unity and reductions, the elliptic DL schemes, Marchenko equations and nonsingular real solutions are studied for the Korteweg-de Vries equation and Boussinesq equation. Illustrations of the obtained solutions show solitons and their interactions on a periodic background.</description>

      <title>Closed real plane curves of hyperelliptic solutions of focusing gauged modified KdV equation of genus $g$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real part of the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation defined over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ is reduced to the focusing gauged MKdV (FGMKdV) equation. In this paper, we construct the real hyperelliptic solutions of FGMKdV equation in terms of data of the hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ and demonstrate the closed hyperelliptic plane curves of genus $g=5$ whose curvature obeys the FGMKdV equation by extending the previous results of genus three (Matsutani, {\it{J. Geom. Phys}} {\bf{215}} (2025) 105540). These are a generalization of Euler's elasticae.</description>

      <title>Two sequences of fully-nonlinear evolution equations and their symmetry properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the complete Lie point symmetry algebras of two sequences of odd-order evolution equations. This includes equations that are fully-nonlinear, i.e. nonlinear in the highest derivative. Two of the equations in the sequences have recently been identified as symmetry-integrable, namely a 3rd-order equation and a 5th-order equation [Open Communications in Nonlinear Mathematical Physics, Special Issue in honour of George W Bluman, ocnmp:15938, 1--15, 2025]. These two examples provided the motivation for the current study. The Lie-B\"acklund symmetries and the consequent symmetry-integrability of the equations in the sequences are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Efficient Eigenstate Preparation in an Integrable Model with Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the preparation of all the eigenstates of spin chains using quantum circuits. It is known that generic eigenstates of free-fermionic spin chains can be prepared with circuits whose depth grows only polynomially with the length of the chain and the number of particles. We show that the polynomial growth is also achievable for selected interacting models where the interaction between the particles is sufficiently simple. Our working example is the folded XXZ model, an integrable spin chain that exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation. We present the explicit quantum circuits that prepare arbitrary eigenstates of this model on an open chain efficiently. We perform error-mitigated noisy simulations with circuits of up to 13 qubits and different connectivities between qubits, achieving a relative error below 5%. As a byproduct, we extend a recent reformulation of the Bethe ansatz as a quantum circuit from closed to open boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>The Manakov-Zakharov-Ward model as an integrable decoupling limit of the membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel decoupling limit of the membrane is proposed, leading to the $(1+2)$-dimensional classically integrable model originally introduced by Manakov, Zakharov, and Ward. This limit is the large-wrapping regime of a membrane propagating toy background of the form $\mathbb{R}_t \times T^2 \times G$ subject to scaling limit, where $G$ is a Lie group and the geometry is supported by a four-form flux. Such toy backgrounds can arise from consistent eleven-dimensional supergravity solutions, exemplified by the uplift of the pure NSNS AdS$_3 \times$ S$^3 \times$ T$^4$ background. The scaling limit can be interpreted as non- or hyper-relativistic limit.</description>
