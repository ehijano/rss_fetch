      <title>Micromechanical characterisation of osteoarthritic subchondral bone by micropillar compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifaceted joint disease which poses significant socioeconomic burdens and remains a significant clinical challenge. Evidence suggests that structural and mechanical changes in subchondral bone influence the pathogenesis and development of OA, leading to diminished bone quality and cartilage degeneration. While changes in microstructure and tissue scale elastic properties are well reported, the tissue yield response of subchondral bone in OA and their correlation with compositional changes have not been investigated. Here, we performed quasistatic micropillar compression and nanoindentation within the subchondral bone plate and trabeculae of hydrated non-diseased (ND) and OA affected specimens retrieved from the distal tibia in vivo. The micropillars, extracted by laser ablation, exhibited a taper angle which mandated the use of an in silico micropillar compression routine to back-calculate elastic modulus and strength of the bone tissue that comprised each micropillar. Elastic modulus remained unchanged between ND and OA subchondral bone, whereas strength increased from 46.0 MPa to 57.3 MPa in OA subchondral trabecular bone but not in the bone plate. Micropillar matched Raman spectroscopy and quantitative backscattered electron imaging revealed mineralisation is the underlying determinant of elastic modulus and strength at the microscale. By combining micromechanical and tissue compositional analyses, we investigated how the mechanical properties are related and how these properties are affected in subchondral bone by OA. Our results may be of value in the development and optimisation of interventions used to alleviate the socioeconomic burdens associated with this debilitating joint disease.</description>

      <title>Measuring multi-site pulse transit time with an AI-enabled mmWave radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulse Transit Time (PTT) is a measure of arterial stiffness and a physiological marker associated with cardiovascular function, with an inverse relationship to diastolic blood pressure (DBP). We present the first AI-enabled mmWave system for contactless multi-site PTT measurement using a single radar. By leveraging radar beamforming and deep learning algorithms our system simultaneously measures PTT and estimates diastolic blood pressure at multiple sites. The system was evaluated across three physiological pathways - heart-to-radial artery, heart-to-carotid artery, and mastoid area-to-radial artery -- achieving correlation coefficients of 0.73-0.89 compared to contact-based reference sensors for measuring PTT. Furthermore, the system demonstrated correlation coefficients of 0.90-0.92 for estimating DBP, and achieved a mean error of -1.00-0.62 mmHg and standard deviation of 4.97-5.70 mmHg, meeting the FDA's AAMI guidelines for non-invasive blood pressure monitors. These results suggest that our proposed system has the potential to provide a non-invasive measure of cardiovascular health across multiple regions of the body.</description>

      <title>Applying voxel-based analysis to oropharyngeal cancer proton therapy patients: a correlation study on radiation-induced acute dysphagia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Voxel-based analysis (VBA) is an analytic approach to evaluate correlations between local dose and the development of different toxicities. DVHs are used for toxicity prediction as well. Compared with DVH, no contours are required for VBA technique and results tell specific voxels that may be related to the toxicity instead of the whole contoured area. The VBA has been used on different cancer sites and for different toxicities. Most of these studies included patients treated with photon, all published studies were based on planned dose and VBA tools used were developed in house. In our study, patient cohort were treated with proton, our VBA tool was developed based on RayStation and doses fed to the VBA tool were delivered doses with constant and two variable RBE models.</description>

      <title>Quantification of dual-state 5-ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence: Methodology and validation in tissue-mimicking phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantification of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence in human brain tumours has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in neuro-oncology, but represents a formidable imaging challenge. Protoporphyrin is a biological molecule which interacts with the tissue micro-environment to form two photochemical states in glioma. Each exhibits markedly different quantum efficiencies, with distinct but overlapping emission spectra that also overlap with tissue autofluorescence. Fluorescence emission is known to be distorted by the intrinsic optical properties of tissue, coupled with marked intra-tumoural heterogeneity as a hallmark of glioma tumours. Existing quantitative fluorescence systems are developed and validated using simplified phantoms that do not simultaneously mimic the complex interactions between fluorophores and tissue optical properties or micro-environment. Consequently, existing systems risk introducing systematic errors into PpIX quantification when used in tissue. In this work, we introduce a novel pipeline for quantification of PpIX in glioma, which robustly differentiates both emission states from background autofluorescence without reliance on a priori spectral information, and accounts for variations in their quantum efficiency. Unmixed PpIX emission forms are then corrected for wavelength-dependent optical distortions and weighted for accurate quantification. Significantly, this pipeline is developed and validated using novel tissue-mimicking phantoms replicating the optical properties of glioma tissues and photochemical variability of PpIX fluorescence in glioma. Our workflow achieves strong correlation with ground-truth PpIX concentrations (R2 = 0.918+-0.002), demonstrating its potential for robust, quantitative PpIX fluorescence imaging in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Concussion and head acceleration exposure in elite rugby union and American football: Interpreting indicative trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elite-level American football and rugby union are two high-contact sports with growing clinical and legal concerns over player safety. A comparison of current indicative trends in concussion and head acceleration events (HAEs) in elite-level American football and rugby union was undertaken. Rugby union players have a greater number of professional playing years and matches available in a season than their American football counterparts. Rugby union players have a greater number of concussions reported per match and a higher proportion of concussions occurring during training sessions, based on National Football League (NFL) and Rugby Football Union (RFU) injury reports. Preliminary findings indicate that rugby union forwards experience a higher incidence of HAEs per player match over lower and higher magnitude thresholds, than American football defensive players. Taken collectively, current evidence indicates a trend toward greater reported exposure in elite-level rugby union across several key metrics. These patterns highlight the need for independent, transparent, and scientifically rigorous research to better understand concussion and HAE biomechanics and to support the development of effective mitigation strategies in contact sport.</description>

      <title>What is Implementation Science; and Why It Matters for Bridging the Artificial Intelligence Innovation-to-Application Gap in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical Imaging (MI) is well recognized. Yet despite promising reports in research settings, many AI tools fail to achieve clinical adoption in practice. In fact, more generally, there is a documented 17-year average delay between evidence generation and implementation of a technology1. Implementation science (IS) may provide a practical, evidence-based framework to bridge the gap between AI development and real-world clinical imaging use that helps shorten this lag through systematic frameworks, strategies, and hybrid research designs. We outline challenges specific to AI adoption in MI workflows, including infrastructural, educational, and cultural barriers. We highlight the complementary roles of effectiveness research and implementation research, emphasizing hybrid study designs and the role of integrated KT (iKT), stakeholder engagement, and equity-focused co-creation in designing sustainable and generalizable solutions. We discuss integration of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) frameworks in MI towards usable AI. Adopting IS is not only a methodological advancement; it is a strategic imperative for accelerating translation of innovation into improved patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Spherical Radiomics - A Novel Approach to Glioblastoma Radiogenomic Analysis of Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and validate a novel spherical radiomics framework for predicting key molecular biomarkers using multiparametric MRI. Conventional Cartesian radiomics extract tumor features on orthogonal grids, which do not fully capture the tumor's radial growth patterns and can be insensitive to evolving molecular signatures. In this study, we analyzed GBM radiomic features on concentric 2D shells, which were then mapped onto 2D planes for radiomics analysis. Radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics from four different regions in GBM. Feature selection was performed using ANOVA F-statistics. Classification was conducted with multiple machine-learning models. Model interpretability was evaluated through SHAP analysis, clustering analysis, feature significance profiling, and comparison between radiomic patterns and underlying biological processes. Spherical radiomics consistently outperformed conventional 2D and 3D Cartesian radiomics across all prediction tasks. The best framework reached an AUC of 0.85 for MGMT, 0.80 for EGFR, 0.80 for PTEN, and 0.83 for survival prediction. GLCM-derived features were identified as the most informative predictors. Radial transition analysis using the Mann-Whitney U-test demonstrates that transition slopes between T1-weighted contrast-enhancing and T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesion regions, as well as between T2 intense lesion and a 2 cm peritumoral expansion region, are significantly associated with biomarker status. Furthermore, the observed radiomic changes along the radial direction closely reflected known biological characteristics. Radiomic features extracted on the spherical surfaces at varying radial distances to the GBM tumor centroid are better correlated with important tumor molecular markers and patient survival than the conventional Cartesian analysis.</description>
