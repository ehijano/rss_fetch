      <title>Smoothing $L^\infty$ Riemannian metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature outside of a singular set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any $L^\infty$ Riemannian metric $g$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is smooth with nonnegative scalar curvature away from a singular set of finite $(n-\alpha)$-dimensional Minkowski content, for some $\alpha&gt;2$, admits an approximation by smooth Riemannian metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature, provided that $g$ is sufficiently close in $L^\infty$ to the Euclidean metric. The approximation is given by time slices of the Ricci-DeTurck flow, which converge locally in $C^\infty$ to $g$ away from the singular set.</description>

      <title>Limit behavior of the twisted conical K\"ahler-Ricci flow with change in the cone angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the limit behavior of the conical K\"ahler-Ricci flow as its cone angle tends to zero. More precisely, we prove that as the cone angle tends to zero, the conical K\"ahler-Ricci flow converges to a unique K\"ahler-Ricci flow, which is smooth outside the divisor and admits cusp singularity along the divisor.</description>

      <title>Stability of the generalized Lagrangian mean curvature flow in cotangent bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the stability of the generalized Lagrangian mean curvature flow of graph case in the cotangent bundle, which is first defined by Smoczyk-Tsui-Wang. By new estimates of derivatives along the flow, we weaken the initial condition and remove the positive curvature condition in Smoczyk-Tsui-Wang's work. More precisely, we prove that if the graph induced by a closed $1$-form is a special Lagrangian submanifold in the cotangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold, then the generalized Lagrangian mean curvature flow is stable near it.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Stability of Minimal Lagrangians in K\"ahler-Einstein Manifolds of Non-Positive Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that minimal Lagrangians in K\"ahler--Einstein manifolds of non-positive scalar curvature are linearly stable under Hamiltonian deformations. We prove that they are also stable under the Lagrangian mean curvature flow, and therefore establish the equivalence between linear stability and dynamical stability.
  Specifically, if one starts the mean curvature flow with a Lagrangian which is $C^1$-close and Hamiltonian isotopic to a minimal Lagrangian, the flow exists smoothly for all time, and converges to that minimal Lagrangian. Due to the work of Neves [Ann. of Math. 2013], this cannot be true for $C^0$-closeness.</description>

      <title>Prescribed mean curvature flow for noncompact hypersurfaces in Lorentz manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by previous study on mean curvature flow and prescribed mean curvature flow on spatially compact space or asymptotically flat spacetime, in this work we will find sufficient conditions for the short time existence of prescribed mean curvature flow on a Lorentz manifold with a smooth time function starting from a complete noncompact spacelike hypersurface. Long time existence and convergence will also be discussed. Results will be applied to study some prescribed mean curvature flows inside the future of the origin in the Minkowski spacetime. Examples of spacetime related to the existence and convergence results near the future null infinity of the Schwarzschild spacetime are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: In present article, we consider a $L^2$-orthogonal decomposition of the second fundamental form of a closed spacelike hypersurface in a Lorentzian spacetime and its applications to the study of some algebraic-differential properties of the general relativistic vacuum constraint equations. For the study we will use the well-known Ahlfors Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Isotopies of complete minimal surfaces of finite total curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a Riemann surface biholomorphic to an affine algebraic curve. We show that the inclusion of the space $\Re \mathrm{NC}_*(M,\mathbb{C}^n)$ of real parts of nonflat proper algebraic null immersions $M\to\mathbb{C}^n$, $n\ge 3$, into the space $\mathrm{CMI}_*(M,\mathbb{R}^n)$ of complete nonflat conformal minimal immersions $M\to\mathbb{R}^n$ of finite total curvature is a weak homotopy equivalence. We also show that the $(1,0)$-differential $\partial$, mapping $\mathrm{CMI}_*(M,\mathbb{R}^n)$ or $\Re \mathrm{NC}_*(M,\mathbb{C}^n)$ to the space $\mathscr{A}^1(M,\mathbf{A})$ of algebraic $1$-forms on $M$ with values in the punctured null quadric $\mathbf{A} \subset \mathbb{C}^n\setminus\{0\}$, is a weak homotopy equivalence. Analogous results are obtained for proper algebraic immersions $M\to\mathbb{C}^n$, $n\ge 2$, directed by a flexible or algebraically elliptic punctured cone in $\mathbb{C}^n\setminus\{0\}$.</description>

      <title>Lewy curves in para-CR geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a class of curves, referred to as Lewy curves, in para-CR geometry, following H. Lewy's original definition in CR geometry. We give a characterization of path geometries defined by para-CR Lewy curves. In dimension 3 our characterization is given by a set of necessary and sufficient conditions which, with the exception of one condition, are easily computationally verifiable. Furthermore, we show that Lewy curves of a para-CR 3-manifold coincide with chains of some (para-)CR 3-manifold if and only if it is flat. Subsequently, it follows that Lewy curves determine the para-CR structure up to the sign of the almost para-complex structure. In higher dimensions we show that para-CR Lewy curves define a path geometry if and only if the para-CR structure is flat, in which case chains and Lewy curves coincide.</description>

      <title>A Heterotic K\"ahler Gravity and the Distance Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformations of the heterotic superpotential give rise to a topological holomorphic theory with similarities to both Kodaira-Spencer gravity and holomorphic Chern-Simons theory. Although the action is cubic, it is only quadratic in the complex structure deformations (the Beltrami differential). Treated separately, for large fluxes, or alternatively at large distances in the background complex structure moduli space, these fields can be integrated out to obtain a new field theory in the remaining fields, which describe the complexified hermitian and gauge degrees of freedom. We investigate properties of this new holomorphic theory, and in particular connections to the swampland distance conjecture in the context of heterotic string theory. In the process, we define a new type of symplectic cohomology theory, where the background complex structure Beltrami differential plays the role of the symplectic form.</description>

      <title>Uniform estimates for a family of Poisson problems: `rounding up the corners'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove \emph{uniform solvability estimates} for certain families of elliptic problems posed in a family of domains that converge to another domain. We provide uniform estimates both in weighted and in usual Sobolev spaces. When the limit domain is a \emph{polygon}, our results amount to ``rounding up'' the corners of the limit domain. The technique of proof is based on a suitable conformal modification of the metric, which makes the union of the domains a manifold with boundary and relative bounded geometry.</description>

      <title>Expected Lipschitz-Killing curvatures for spin random fields and other non-isotropic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherical spin random fields are used to model the Cosmic Microwave Background polarization, the study of which is at the heart of modern Cosmology and will be the subject of the LITEBIRD mission, in the 2030s. Its scope is to collect datas to test the theoretical predictions of the Cosmic Inflation model. In particular, the Minkowski functionals, or the Lipschitz-Killing curvatures, of excursion sets can be used to detect deviations from Gaussianity and anisotropies of random fields, being fine descriptors of their geometry and topology.
  In this paper we give an explicit, non-asymptotic, formula for the expectation of the Lipshitz-Killing curvatures of the excursion set of the real part of an arbitrary left-invariant Gaussian spin spherical random field, seen as a field on $SO(3)$. Our findings are coherent with the asymptotic ones presented in Carr\'on Duque, J. et al. "Minkowski Functionals in $SO(3)$ for the spin-2 CMB polarisation field", Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (2024). We also give explicit expressions for the Adler-Taylor metric, and its curvature. We obtain such result as an application of a general formula that applies to any nondegenerate Gaussian random field defined on an arbitrary three dimensional compact Riemannian manifold. The novelty is that the Lipschitz-Killing curvatures are computed with respect to an arbitrary metric, possibly different than the Adler-Taylor metric of the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.05704v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we prove that a certain class of {\it smooth} Sasakian manifolds admits lifts to 4-dimensional quasi-Einstein shearfree spacetimes of Petrov type II or D. This is related to an analogous result by Hill, Lewandowski and Nurowski \cite{HLN} for general {\it real-analytic} CR manifolds. In particular, this holds for all tubular CR manifolds. Furthermore, we show that any Sasakian manifold with underlying K\"ahler-Einstein manifold with non-zero Einstein constant has a lift to a shearfree Einstein metric of Petrov type II or D.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Singer conjecture for extended graph manifolds and pure complex-hyperbolic higher graph manifolds with residually finite fundamental groups. In real dimension three, where a result of Hempel ensures that the fundamental group is always residually finite, we then provide a Price type inequality proof of a well-known result of Lott and Lueck. Finally, we give several classes of higher graph manifolds which do indeed have residually finite fundamental groups.</description>

      <title>Boundary rigidity, and non-rigidity, of projective structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the property of boundary rigidity for the projective structures associated to torsion-free affine connections on connected analytic manifolds with boundary. We show that these structures are generically boundary rigid, meaning that any automorphism of a generic projective structure that restricts to the identity on the boundary must itself be the identity. However, and in contrast with what happens for example for conformal structures, we show that there exist projective structures which are not boundary rigid. We characterise these non-rigid structures by the vanishing of a certain local projective invariant of the boundary.</description>

      <title>Complete complex Finsler metrics and uniform equivalence of the Kobayashi metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, first of all, according to Lu's and Zhang's works about the curvature of the Bergman metric on a bounded domain and the properties of the squeezing functions, we obtain that Bergman curvature of the Bergman metric on a bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain with $C^2$-boundary or bounded convex domain is bounded. Secondly, by the property of curvature symmetry on a K\"ahler manifold, we have the property: if holomorphic sectional curvature of a K\"ahler manifold is bounded, we can deduce that its sectional curvature is bounded. After that, applying to the Schwarz lemma from a complete K\"ahler manifold into a complex Finsler manifold, we get that a bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain with $C^2$-boundary or bounded convex domain admit complete strongly pseudoconvex complex Finsler metrics such that their holomorphic sectional curvature is bounded from above by a negative constant. Finally, by the Schwarz lemma from a complete K\"ahler manifold into a complex Finsler manifold, we prove the uniform equivalences of the Kobayashi metric and Carath\'eodory metric on a bounded strongly convex domain with smoothly boundary.</description>

Abstract: We reduce Yang-Mills equations for $SO^+(p,q)$, $Spin^+(p,q)$ and $SU(n)$ bundles, with constant and isotropic metrics, by developing the concept of $SO^+(p,q)$-equivariance. This allows us to model the electroweak interaction and $SO^+(p,q)$ bundles with a non-linear second order differential equation as well as the weak and strong interaction with a non-linear wave equation.</description>
