      <title>The SHMS 11 GeV/c Spectrometer in Hall C at Jefferson Lab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Super High Momentum Spectrometer (SHMS) has been built for Hall C at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab). With a momentum capability reaching 11 GeV/c, the SHMS provides measurements of charged particles produced in electron-scattering experiments using the maximum available beam energy from the upgraded Jefferson Lab accelerator. The SHMS is an ion-optics magnetic spectrometer comprised of a series of new superconducting magnets which transport charged particles through an array of triggering, tracking, and particle-identification detectors that measure momentum, energy, angle and position in order to allow kinematic reconstruction of the events back to their origin at the scattering target. The detector system is protected from background radiation by a sophisticated shielding enclosure. The entire spectrometer is mounted on a rotating support structure which permits measurements to be taken with a large acceptance over laboratory scattering angles from 5.5 to 40 degrees, thus allowing a wide range of low cross-section experiments to be conducted. These experiments complement and extend the previous Hall C research program to higher energies.</description>

      <title>Methodology For the Evaluation of Critical Components of the Scatterable Radiation Monitor Under Radiation Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the persisting challenges associated with the peaceful use of the atom is monitoring the subsequent radiation. For example, nuclear power plants need environmental monitoring to ensure public trust. While this may be conducted by the frequent monitoring of low-cost thermoluminescent dosimeters placed in concentric rings around the plant, there have been several solutions for a modernized real-time digital alternative to the TLD. The Scatterable Radiation Monitoring device is an STM32 microprocessor-based design aiming at the wireless transmission of environmental radiation data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES) is a novel technique for the precise measurement of relativistic electron energy. This technique is being employed by the Project~8 collaboration for measuring a high-precision tritium beta decay spectrum to perform a frequency-based measurement of the neutrino mass. In this work, we describe the Project 8 Phase II apparatus, used for the detection of the CRES signal from the conversion electrons of $\mathrm{^{83m}Kr}$ and the first CRES measurement of the beta-decay spectrum of molecular tritium.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Backgrounds in Solid-State Phonon and Charge Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state phonon and charge detectors probe the scattering of weakly interacting particles, such as dark matter and neutrinos, through their low recoil thresholds. Recent advancements have pushed sensitivity to eV-scale energy depositions, uncovering previously-unseen low-energy excess backgrounds. While some arise from known processes such as thermal radiation, luminescence, and stress, others remain unexplained. This review examines these backgrounds, their possible origins, and parallels to low-energy effects in solids. Their understanding is essential for interpreting particle interactions at and below the eV-scale.</description>

      <title>Advanced muon-spin spectroscopy with high lateral resolution using Si-pixel detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon-spin spectroscopy at continuous sources has stagnated at a stopped muons rate of ~40 kHz for the last few decades. The major limiting factor is the requirement of a single muon in the sample during the typical 10 {\mu}s data gate window. To overcome this limit and to be able to perform muon-spin relaxation ({\mu}SR) measurements on millimeter-sized samples, one can use vertex reconstruction methods to construct {\mu}SR spectra. This is now possible thanks to the availability of very thin monolithic Si-pixel chips, which offer minimal particle scattering and high count rate. Here we present results from a Si-pixel based spectrometer that utilizes vertex reconstruction schemes for the incoming muons and emitted positrons. With this spectrometer we were able to obtain a first vertex reconstructed {\mu}SR (VR-{\mu}SR) spectrum. The unique capabilities and benefits of such a spectrometer are discussed.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of the impact of radiation defects on the electrical performance of 4H-SiC PIN detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon Carbide (SiC) demonstrates significant potential for high-energy particle detection in complex radiation environments due to its exceptional radiation resistance, excellent environmental adaptability, and fast response time. Compared to silicon (Si) detectors, SiC detectors exhibit distinct radiation resistance characteristics depending on the type of radiation exposure. Here, the mechanism of the impact of 80MeV proton irradiation on the electrical performance of 4H-SiC PIN devices is reported.Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) and Time-Resolved Photoluminescence (TRPL) were utilized to analyze the defect characteristics and minority carrier lifetime of 4H-SiC detectors before and after irradiation, respectively. A Deep-Level Compensation Model (DLCM) was established using open source TCAD simulation tools RAdiation SEmiconductoR (RASER) to investigate mechanism responsible for the decrease in leakage current with rising radiation intensity, as well as the constant-capacitance behavior exhibited under proton irradiation up to $7.8\times10^{14} n_{eq}/cm^2$. The establishment of the physical model opens the door for the study of the influence mechanism of irradiation defects on SiC particle detectors.</description>

      <title>PMT calibration for the JSNS2-II far detector with an embedded LED system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JSNS2-II (the second phase of JSNS2, J-PARC Sterile Neutrino Search at J-PARC Spallation Neutron Source) is an experiment aimed at searching for sterile neutrinos. This experiment has entered its second phase, employing two liquid scintillator detectors located at near and far positions from the neutrino source. Recently, the far detector of the experiment has been completed and is currently in the calibration phase. This paper presents a detailed description of the calibration process utilizing the LED system. The LED system of the far detector uses two Ultra-Violet (UV) LEDs, which are effective in calibrating all of PMTs at once. The UV light is converted into the visible light wavelengths inside liquid scintillator via the wavelength shifters, providing pseudo-isotropic light. The properties of all functioning Photo-Multiplier-Tubes (PMTs) to detect the neutrino events in the far detector, such as gain, its dependence of supplied High Voltage (HV), and Peak-to-Valley (PV) were calibrated. To achieve a good energy resolution for physics events, up to 10% of the relative gain adjustment is required for all functioning PMTs. This will be achieved using the measured HV curves and the LED calibration. The Peak-to-Valley (PV) ratio values are the similar to those from the production company, which distinguish the single photo-electron signal from the pedestal. Additionally, the precision of PMT signal timing is measured to be 2.1 ns, meeting the event reconstruction requirement of 10 ns.</description>

      <title>The Ladder and Readout Cables of Intermediate Silicon Strip Detector for sPHENIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new silicon-strip-type detector was developed for precise charged-particle tracking in the central rapidity region of heavy ion collisions. A new detector and collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory is sPHENIX, which is a major upgrade of the PHENIX detector. The intermediate tracker (INTT) is part of the advanced tracking system of the sPHENIX detector complex together with a CMOS monolithic-active-pixel-sensor based silicon-pixel vertex detector, a time-projection chamber, and a micromegas-based detector. The INTT detector is barrel shaped and comprises 56 silicon ladders. Two different types of strip sensors of 78~$\mu m$ pitch and 320~$\mu m$ thick are mounted on each half of a silicon ladder. Each strip sensor is segmented into 8$\times$2 and 5$\times$2 blocks with lengths of 16 and 20 mm. Strips are read out with a silicon strip-readout (FPHX) chip. In order to transmit massive data from the FPHX to the down stream readout electronics card (ROC), a series of long and high speed readout cables were developed. This document focuses on the silicon ladder, the readout cables, and the ROC of the INTT. The radiation hardness is studied for some parts of the INTT devices in the last part of this document, since the INTT employed some materials from the technology frontier of the industry whose radiation hardness is not necessarily well known.</description>

      <title>A low-background setup for in-situ X-ray total scattering combined with fast scanning calorimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09183v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a setup combining fast scanning calorimetry with X-ray total scattering at a synchrotron beamline, allowing for \emph{in-situ} characterizations of the nano-scale structure of samples during and after temperature scans. The setup features a portable vacuum chamber giving high signal-to-background ratio even on amorphous samples, which enables the observation of detailed structural changes between different sample states. We show three use cases, including one which leverages the high cooling rate of 10$^4$\,K/s achievable by this setup. Our demonstration opens the door to various applications in materials science where it is important to understand the interplay between structure and thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: This contribution introduces a novel test system developed to evaluate the signal transmission quality in high-speed data links for the 2026 Inner Tracker (ITk) upgrade of the ATLAS experiment. Using an FPGA-based data acquisition (DAQ) framework, the setup can run simultaneous Bit Error Rate (BER) tests for up to 64 channels and generate virtual eye diagrams, for qualifying the $\sim$26k electrical links at the ATLAS ITk data rate of 1.28Gb/s.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of convolutional neural networks in programmable logic, for applications in fast online event selection at hadron colliders is studied. In particular, an approach based on full event images for classification is studied, including hardware-aware optimisation of the network architecture, and evaluation of physics performance using simulated data. A range of network models are identified that can be implemented within resources of current FPGAs, as well as the stringent latency requirements of HL-LHC trigger systems. A candidate model that can be implemented in the CMS L1 trigger for HL-LHC was shown to be capable of excellent signal/background discrimination, although the performance depends strongly on the degree of pile-up mitigation possible prior to image generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calibration of the CR39 and Makrofol Nuclear Track Detectors of the MoEDAL experiment at the CERN-LHC was performed by exposing stacks of detector foils to heavy ion beams with energies ranging from 340 MeV/nucleon to 150 GeV/nucleon. After chemical etching, the base areas and lengths of etch-pit cones were measured using automatic and manual optical microscopes. The response of the detectors, as measured by the ratio of the track-etching rate over the bulk-etching rate, was determined over a range extending from their threshold at Z/$\beta\sim7$ and $\sim50$ for CR39 and Makrofol, respectively, up to Z/$\beta\sim92$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present measurements in the context of a survey of southern hemisphere binary and multiple stellar systems observed with the Zorro Speckle dual diffraction-limited optical imaging camera on the 8.1m Gemini-South telescope carried out between 2019 and 2023. The overall motivation of our survey, as well as some initial results of these observations, are outlined to demonstrate the capabilities - and limitations - of Zorro. We report on the astrometric characterization of the instrument in terms of the precision and accuracy of our measurements and provide details of our custom-made data reduction pipeline. For targets with separations smaller than 0.4 arcsec, an overall precision of 1 mas in the radial and tangential directions is obtained, while the uncertainty in position angle is 0.2 deg. Relative astrometry and contrast brightness in the two Zorro filters at 562 and 832 nm are reported for 70 pairs on 64 distinct systems (six are triples). Eleven new binaries are found, mostly of small separations (down to 15 mas), and large brightness contrast (up to Delta m=6 in the red channel). Our results indicate that the Zorro instrument, when properly calibrated, delivers excellent quality data for visual binary studies of tight and/or faint companions.</description>

      <title>Distribution and Moments of a Normalized Dissimilarity Ratio for two Correlated Gamma Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two random variables $X$ and $Y$ following correlated Gamma distributions, characterized by identical scale and shape parameters and a linear correlation coefficient $\rho$. Our focus is on the parameter: \[
  D(X,Y) = \frac{|X - Y|}{X + Y}, \] which appears in applied contexts such as dynamic speckle imaging, where it is known as the \textit{Fujii index}. In this work, we derive a closed-form expression for the probability density function of $D(X,Y)$ as well as analytical formulas for its moments of order $k$. Our derivation starts by representing $X$ and $Y$ as two correlated exponential random variables, obtained from the squared magnitudes of circular complex Gaussian variables. By considering the sum of $k$ independent exponential variables, we then derive the joint density of $(X,Y)$ when $X$ and $Y$ are two correlated Gamma variables. Through appropriate varable transformations, we obtain the theoretical distribution of $D(X,Y)$ and evaluate its moments analytically. These theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations, with particular attention to two specific cases: zero correlation and unit shape parameter.</description>

      <title>Atomic and Molecular Nitrogen Ions at the Dayside Magnetopause During the 2024 Mother's Day Storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ion measurements made with the Hot Plasma Composition Analyzers of the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS-HPCAs) during the Mother's Day Storm (Gannon Storm) of 10-13 May 2024 yield the first observations of atomic and molecular nitrogen ions in the Earth's dayside outer magnetosphere. A population of ions identified as doubly charged nitrogen and oxygen was also measured. These observations were made within a highly compressed magnetosphere at a geocentric distance of ~6 Earth Radii during the early recovery phase of the storm. From the ion composition measurements and accompanying magnetic field data, we determine the reconnection rate at the magnetopause; we compare this result to a model reconnection rate that assumes the presence of only atomic oxygen and hydrogen. The heavy ion-laden-mass density in the magnetosphere was greater than the shocked solar wind mass density in the magnetosheath. Despite these conditions, magnetic reconnection still occurred at the magnetopause.</description>

      <title>Stark-modulated Rydberg dissipative time crystals at room-temperature applied to sub-kHz electric-field sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium Rydberg gases exhibit emergent many-body phases due to mode competition. Sustained limit cycle oscillations (OSC) emerge when driven by B-fields at room-temperature, forming robust Rydberg dissipative time crystals (DTC). These driven-dissipative Rydberg DTC have recently been shown to develop an effective transition centered at the OSC frequency (-10dB bandwidth of ~1.7kHz, centered at 9.8kHz). Weak RF signals injected within this emergent transition perturb and emerge on the OSC spectrum, from which sensitive and high-resolution sensing of E-fields (~1.6-2.3 uVcm-1Hz-1/2) near the OSC frequencies can be achieved. In this article, it is demonstrated that DC and AC Stark fields in the sub-kHz regime can be used effectively to shift (DC) or modulate (AC) the OSC frequency of Rydberg DTC at room-temperature. The AC-Stark driven modulation of the OSC is shown as an effective technique to sense weak AC E-fields in the sub-kHz regime. With a modest setup, a sensitivity of ~7.8 uVcm-1Hz-1/2 for AC signals at 300Hz (~8.7x improvement over state-of-art Rydberg atom techniques), and high-resolution detection to as low as sub-Hz is demonstrated. This approach enables the development of ultra-compact, extremely low-frequency E-field detectors for applications in remote sensing, communications, navigation, and bio-medical technologies.</description>

      <title>A novel layered reconstruction framework for longitudinal segmented electromagnetic calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In future high-energy physics experiments, the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) will operate in exceptionally high-luminosity. An ECAL featuring layered readout in the longitudinal direction and precise time-stamped information offers a multi-dimensional view, enriching our comprehension of the showering process of electromagnetic particles in high-luminosity environments. And it is taken as the baseline design for several new experiments, including the planned upgrades of the current running experiments. Reconstructing and matching the multi-dimensional information across different layers poses new challenges in utilizing layered data effectively. This work introduces a novel layered reconstruction framework for the ECAL with a layered readout information structure and develops the layered clustering algorithm. It expands the concept of clusters from planes to multiple layers. Additionally, this work presents the corresponding layered cluster correction methods, investigates the transverse shower profile, which is utilized for overlapping clusters splitting, and develops the layered merged $\pi^0$ reconstruction algorithm based on this framework. By incorporating energy and time information in 3-dimension, this framework provides a suitable software platform for the preliminary research of longitudinal segmented ECAL and new perspectives in physics analysis.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic Systems in the Muon $g-2$ experiment at Fermilab</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The muon anomalous magnetic moment, $a_\mu=\frac{g-2}{2}$, is a low-energy observable which can be both measured and computed to high precision, making it a sensitive test of the Standard Model and a probe for new physics. This anomaly was measured with a precision of $0.20$~parts per million (ppm) by the Fermilab's Muon g-2 (E989) experiment. The final goal of the E989 experiment is to reach a precision of $0.14$~ppm. The experiment is based on the measurement of the muon spin anomalous precession frequency, $\omega_a$, based on the arrival time distribution of high-energy decay positrons observed by 24 electromagnetic calorimeters, placed around the inner circumference of a $14$~m diameter storage ring, and on the precise knowledge of the storage ring magnetic field and of the beam time and space distribution. Achieving this level of precision requires strict control over systematics, which is ensured through several diagnostic devices. At the accelerator level, these devices monitor the quality of the injected beam (e.g., verifying that it has the correct momentum), while at the detector level, they track both the magnetic field and the gain of the calorimeters. In this work the devices and techniques used by the E989 experiment will be presented.</description>

      <title>Imaging neutron radiation-induced defects in single-crystal chemical vapor deposition diamond at the atomic level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamond's exceptional properties make it highly suited for applications in challenging radiation environments. Understanding radiation-induced damage in diamond is crucial for enabling its practical applications and advancing materials science. However, direct imaging of radiation-induced crystal defects at the atomic scale remains rare due to diamond's compact lattice structure. Here, we report the atomic-level characterization of crystal defects induced by high-flux fast neutron radiation (up to $3 \times10^{17}$ n/$cm^2$) in single-crystal chemical vapor deposition diamonds. Through Raman spectroscopy, the phase transition from carbon $sp^3$ to $sp^2$ hybridization was identified, primarily associated with the formation of dumbbell-shaped interstitial defects. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy and aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, we observed a clustering trend in defect distribution, where $sp^2$ rich clusters manifested as dislocation structures with a density up to $10^{14}$ $cm^{-2}$. Lomer-Cottrell junctions were identified, offering a possible explanation for defect cluster formation. Radiation-induced point defects were found to be dispersed throughout the diamond lattice, highlighting the widespread nature of primary defect formation. Vacancy defects, along with $\langle 111 \rangle$ and $\langle 100 \rangle$ oriented dumbbell-shaped interstitial defects induced by high-dose neutron irradiation, were directly imaged, providing microscopic structural evidence that complements spectroscopic studies of point defects. Dynamical simulations combined with an adiabatic recombination-based damage model provided insights into the correlation between irradiation dose and resulting crystal damage. These findings advance our understanding of neutron-induced damage mechanisms in diamond and contribute to the development of radiation-resistant diamond materials.</description>

Abstract: LabOSat-01 is a payload designed to perform characterization experiments on electronic devices in hostile environments. Both Commercial-Off-The-Shelf components and custom nano and micro devices were studied in the last decade with this platform. The Total Ionizing Dose (TID) received by small satellites in Low Earth Orbit was measured with LabOSat-01 using p-MOSFET COTS and the results are presented in this work. Measurements were performed on two satellite missions, each totalling 1100 days, launched three years apart. Dosimeters were integrated in different satellite positions, with different shielding, and the measured TID after 1100 days ranged from 5 Gy to 19 Gy.</description>

      <title>FANSIC: a Fast ANalog SiPM Integrated Circuit for the readout of large silicon photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon photo-multipliers (SiPM) have been replacing traditional photomultiplier tubes in most light sensing applications. However, when large detection surface coverage is needed, photomultipliers (PMTs) are still the preferred choice. The main reasons are the sensor thermal noise and the duration of the fast component of its signal, both increasing with the sensor surface. In this work we propose an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), called Fast ANalog SiPM Integrated Circuit (FANSIC), for the readout of large SiPMs addressing these limitations. The ASIC has an active summation stage, which allows to divide a large detection surface into smaller ones offering faster response both in single ended and differential outputs. The high input bandwidth allows to reach full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) signals or the order of 3--5 ns which limits the impact of internal and external uncorrelated noise. The results of the first implementation of FANSIC, designed in CMOS 65 nm technology, is described in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A calorimetric detector for minimally disruptive measurements of atomic hydrogen beams is described. The calorimeter measures heat released by the recombination of hydrogen atoms into molecules on a thin wire. As a demonstration, the angular distribution of a beam with a peak intensity of $\approx 10^{16} \,{\rm{atoms}}/{(\rm{cm}^2 \rm{s})}$ is measured by translating the wire across the beam. The data agree well with an analytic model of the beam from the thermal hydrogen atom source. Using the beam shape model, the relative intensity of the beam can be determined to 5% precision or better at any angle.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Light Confinement of LiquidO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-based detectors have been widely used in fundamental research and industry since their inception in the 1930s. The energy particles deposit in these detectors is converted to optical signals via the Cherenkov and scintillation mechanisms that are then propagated through transparent media to photosensors placed typically on the detector's periphery, sometimes up to tens of metres away. LiquidO is a new technique pioneering the use of opaque media to stochastically confine light around each energy deposition while collecting it with an array of fibres that thread the medium. This approach preserves topological event information otherwise lost in the conventional approach, enabling real-time imaging down to the MeV scale. Our article demonstrates LiquidO's imaging principle with a ten-litre prototype, revealing successful light confinement of 90% of the detected light within a 5 cm radius sphere, using a custom opaque scintillator with a scattering length on the order of a few millimetres. These high-resolution imaging capabilities unlock opportunities in fundamental physics research and applications beyond. The absolute amount of light detected is also studied, including possible data-driven extrapolations to LiquidO-based detectors beyond prototyping limitations. Additionally, LiquidO's timing capabilities are explored through its ability to distinguish Cherenkov light from a slow scintillator.</description>
