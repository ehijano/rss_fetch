      <title>Unbinned inclusive cross-section measurements with machine-learned systematic uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel methodology for addressing systematic uncertainties in unbinned inclusive cross-section measurements and related collider-based inference problems. Our approach incorporates known analytic dependencies on parameters of interest, including signal strengths and nuisance parameters. When these dependencies are unknown, as is frequently the case for systematic uncertainties, dedicated neural network parametrizations provide an approximation that is trained on simulated data. The resulting machine-learned surrogate captures the complete parameter dependence of the likelihood ratio, providing a near-optimal test statistic. As a case study, we perform a first-principles inclusive cross-section measurement of $\textrm{H}\rightarrow\tau\tau$ in the single-lepton channel, utilizing simulated data from the FAIR Universe Higgs Uncertainty Challenge. Results in Asimov data, from large-scale toy studies, and using the Fisher information demonstrate significant improvements over traditional binned methods. Our computer code ``Guaranteed Optimal Log-Likelihood-based Unbinned Method'' (GOLLUM) for machine-learning and inference is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Data-driven pressure field prediction for ships in regular sea states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Merchant shipping is responsible for more than 90% of the global trade and has a significant environmental impact, accounting for over 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, fuel-saving measures are becoming increasingly important in reducing the ecological footprint and increasing the fuel efficiency of maritime transport. Routing optimization systems, which require a rapid prediction of ambient-dependent fuel consumption, represent an essential pillar here, e.g. to reduce added resistances due to seaways and/or wind. The paper aims to predict the added resistance due to seaways. In contrast to conventional methods the goal is achieved by surrogate modeling of the entire pressure fields. To this end, an online/offline-procedure is applied to an exemplarily free-floating container vessel. The online approach to be trained consists of two building blocks, namely a convolutional autoencoder (CAE)-based order reduction step and a neural network-based (NN) regression step that links the reduced space of the autoencoder with three control parameters that describe the sea state (wave height/steepness, encounter angle and wave length). Training data is obtained from time-averaged values for simulating instantaneous ship motion and pressure fields. During the offline phase, the combined CAE/NN is trained to capture the time-averaged pressure fields for a variety of sea-state conditions. During ship operation (online phase), the surrogate model predicts the three-dimensional pressure fields in response to sea state conditions, projects the pressure fields onto the ship hull, and integrates the corresponding resistances to guide the route. The evaluation of the method shows promising results for the different building blocks and the concept could therefore represent an attractive approach for cost-effective surrogate modeling of complex multiphase flow fields.</description>

      <title>Robust Method for Confidence Interval Estimation in Outlier-Prone Datasets: Application to Molecular and Biophysical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating confidence intervals in small or noisy datasets is a challenge in biomolecular research when data contain outliers or high variability. We introduce a robust method combining a hybrid bootstrap procedure with Steiner's most frequent value (MFV) approach to estimate confidence intervals without removing outliers or altering the dataset. The MFV identifies the most representative value while minimizing information loss, ideal for limited or non-Gaussian samples. To demonstrate robustness, we apply the MFV-hybrid parametric bootstrapping (MFV-HPB) framework to the fast-neutron activation cross-section of the 109Ag(n,2n)108mAg reaction, a nuclear physics dataset with large uncertainties and evaluation difficulties. Repeated resampling and uncertainty-based simulations yield a robust MFV of 709 mb with a 68.27% confidence interval of [691, 744] mb, illustrating the method's interpretability in complex scenarios. Although the example is from nuclear science, similar issues arise in enzymatic kinetics, molecular assays, and biomarker studies. The MFV-HPB framework offers a generalizable approach for extracting central estimates and confidence intervals in small or noisy datasets, with resilience to outliers, minimal distributional assumptions, and suitability for small samples-making it valuable in molecular medicine, bioengineering, and biophysics.</description>
