      <title>Comparative Analysis of Multi-Omics Integration Using Advanced Graph Neural Networks for Cancer Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-omics data is increasingly being utilized to advance computational methods for cancer classification. However, multi-omics data integration poses significant challenges due to the high dimensionality, data complexity, and distinct characteristics of various omics types. This study addresses these challenges and evaluates three graph neural network architectures for multi-omics (MO) integration based on graph-convolutional networks (GCN), graph-attention networks (GAT), and graph-transformer networks (GTN) for classifying 31 cancer types and normal tissues. To address the high-dimensionality of multi-omics data, we employed LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression for feature selection, leading to the creation of LASSO-MOGCN, LASSO-MOGAT, and LASSO-MOTGN models. Graph structures for the networks were constructed using gene correlation matrices and protein-protein interaction networks for multi-omics integration of messenger-RNA, micro-RNA, and DNA methylation data. Such data integration enables the networks to dynamically focus on important relationships between biological entities, improving both model performance and interpretability. Among the models, LASSO-MOGAT with a correlation-based graph structure achieved state-of-the-art accuracy (95.9%) and outperformed the LASSO-MOGCN and LASSO-MOTGN models in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. Our findings demonstrate that integrating multi-omics data in graph-based architectures enhances cancer classification performance by uncovering distinct molecular patterns that contribute to a better understanding of cancer biology and potential biomarkers for disease progression.</description>

      <title>Annotation of protein-coding genes in 49 diatom genomes from the Bacillariophyta clade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diatoms, a major group of microalgae, play a critical role in global carbon cycling and primary production. Despite their ecological significance, comprehensive genomic resources for diatoms are limited. To address this, we have annotated previously unannotated genome assemblies of 49 diatom species. Genome assemblies were obtained from NCBI Datasets and processed for repeat elements using RepeatModeler2 and RepeatMasker. For gene prediction, BRAKER2 was employed in the absence of transcriptomic data, while BRAKER3 was utilized when transcriptome short read data were available from the Sequence Read Archive. The quality of genome assemblies and predicted protein sets was evaluated using BUSCO, ensuring high-quality genomic resources. Functional annotation was performed using EnTAP, providing insights into the biological roles of the predicted proteins. Our study enhances the genomic toolkit available for diatoms, facilitating future research in diatom biology, ecology, and evolution.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Alphabet: Deep Signal Embedding for Enhanced DNA Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of DNA storage employs strands of DNA bases (A/T/C/G) as a storage medium for digital information to enable massive density and durability. The DNA storage pipeline includes: (1) encoding the raw data into sequences of DNA bases; (2) synthesizing the sequences as DNA \textit{strands} that are stored over time as an unordered set; (3) sequencing the DNA strands to generate DNA \textit{reads}; and (4) deducing the original data. The DNA synthesis and sequencing stages each generate several independent error-prone duplicates of each strand which are then utilized in the final stage to reconstruct the best estimate for the original strand. Specifically, the reads are first \textit{clustered} into groups likely originating from the same strand (based on their similarity to each other), and then each group approximates the strand that led to the reads of that group. This work improves the DNA clustering stage by embedding it as part of the DNA sequencing. Traditional DNA storage solutions begin after the DNA sequencing process generates discrete DNA reads (A/T/C/G), yet we identify that there is untapped potential in using the raw signals generated by the Nanopore DNA sequencing machine before they are discretized into bases, a process known as \textit{basecalling}, which is done using a deep neural network. We propose a deep neural network that clusters these signals directly, demonstrating superior accuracy, and reduced computation times compared to current approaches that cluster after basecalling.</description>

      <title>A mechanistically interpretable neural network for regulatory genomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks excel in mapping genomic DNA sequences to associated readouts (e.g., protein-DNA binding). Beyond prediction, the goal of these networks is to reveal to scientists the underlying motifs (and their syntax) which drive genome regulation. Traditional methods that extract motifs from convolutional filters suffer from the uninterpretable dispersion of information across filters and layers. Other methods which rely on importance scores can be unstable and unreliable. Instead, we designed a novel mechanistically interpretable architecture for regulatory genomics, where motifs and their syntax are directly encoded and readable from the learned weights and activations. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence of our architecture's full expressivity, while still being highly interpretable. Through several experiments, we show that our architecture excels in de novo motif discovery and motif instance calling, is robust to variable sequence contexts, and enables fully interpretable generation of novel functional sequences.</description>

      <title>The Mitochondrial Genome of Cathaya argyrophylla Reaches 18.99 Mb: Analysis of Super-Large Mitochondrial Genomes in Pinaceae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitochondrial genomes in the Pinaceae family are notable for their large size and structural complexity. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the mitochondrial genome of Cathaya argyrophylla, an endangered and endemic Pinaceae species, uncovering a genome size of 18.99 Mb, meaning the largest mitochondrial genome reported to date. To investigate the mechanisms behind this exceptional size, we conducted comparative analyses with other Pinaceae species possessing both large and small mitochondrial genomes, as well as with other gymnosperms. We focused on repeat sequences, transposable element activity, RNA editing events, chloroplast-derived sequence transfers (mtpts), and sequence homology with nuclear genomes. Our findings indicate that while Cathaya argyrophylla and other extremely large Pinaceae mitochondrial genomes contain substantial amounts of repeat sequences and show increased activity of LINEs and LTR retrotransposons, these factors alone do not fully account for the genome expansion. Notably, we observed a significant incorporation of chloroplast-derived sequences in Cathaya argyrophylla and other large mitochondrial genomes, suggesting that extensive plastid-to-mitochondrial DNA transfer may play a crucial role in genome enlargement. Additionally, large mitochondrial genomes exhibited distinct patterns of RNA editing and limited similarity with nuclear genomes compared to smaller genomes. These results suggest that the massive mitochondrial genomes in Pinaceae are likely the result of multiple contributing factors, including repeat sequences, transposon activity, and extensive plastid sequence incorporation. Our study enhances the understanding of mitochondrial genome evolution in plants and provides valuable genetic information for the conservation and study of Cathaya argyrophylla.</description>
