      <title>Identifying Long Radio Transients with Accompanying X-Ray Emission as Disk-Jet Precessing Black Holes: The Case of ASKAP J1832-0911</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: In this work we investigate whether the 2 min bursts every 44 min from ASKAP J1832-0911 can be explained by Lense-Thirring precession of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) accretion disk launching a Blandford-Znajek jet, as an alternative to magnetar or white-dwarf models. Methods: We derive the Lense-Thirring period $ P_{\rm LT}=\frac{\pi G M}{a c^3}r^3 $ and solve $P_{\rm LT}=44$ min for black-hole mass M and dimensionless radius $r=R/R_g$. We estimate the equipartition field B at r, compute the Blandford-Znajek power $P_{\rm BZ}$, and the power expected from a gap at the black hole magnetosphere, and compare the resulting jet luminosity to the observed radio and X-ray fluxes at $D\approx4.5$ kpc. We also evaluate expected high-frequency variability and the angular size for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations. Results: For $a\sim0.3\!-\!0.9$, an IMBH with $M\sim10^3\!-\!10^5\,M_\odot$ yields $r\sim10\!-\!40\,R_g$ and $P_{\rm LT}=44$ min. Equipartition gives $B\sim10^5$ G at r, leading to $P_{\rm BZ}\sim10^{35\!-\!39}$ erg ${\rm s^{-1}}$. With radiative efficiency $\epsilon_j\sim10^{-2}\!-\!10^{-1}$, the predicted $L_{\rm jet}\sim10^{34\!-\!36}$ erg ${\rm s^{-1}}$ matches the observed $F_X\sim10^{-12}$ erg ${\rm cm^{-2}}$ ${\rm s^{-1}}$ and radio flux, variability on $\lesssim100$ s could be a smoking gun of this model. Conclusions:The IMBH precessing-jet model simultaneously explains the periodicity, energetics, and duty cycle of ASKAP J1832-0911. Only high-time-resolution X-ray timing (to check $\sim$s pulsations) and multi-frequency radio polarimetry can definitively distinguish it from magnetar or white-dwarf scenarios.</description>

      <title>Detection of positron in-flight annihilation from the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the annihilation of positrons towards the Galactic centre was established more than 50 years ago through the detection of a 511 keV gamma-ray line, the origin of the positrons remains unknown. The gamma-ray line should be accompanied by continuum emission from positron in-flight annihilation, which has not until now been detected. We aim to detect positron in-flight annihilation emission as it provides information on the kinetic energy of the positrons that is key in determining the origin of Galactic positrons. We analysed archival data obtained by the COMPTEL instrument on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory satellite to search for positron in-flight annihilation emission at MeV energies. Our analysis revealed extended MeV emission towards the bulge of the Galaxy, which we attribute to in-flight annihilation of positrons produced with kinetic energies of $\sim2$ MeV. The observed spectrum suggests that positrons are produced quasi mono-energetically, which could occur by the annihilation of dark matter particles with masses of $\sim3$ MeV or through bulk motion in the jet of the microquasar 1E 1740.7-2942. We furthermore detected a point-like MeV emission component towards the Galactic centre that is the plausible low-energy counterpart of the Fermi/LAT source 4FGL J1745.6-2859. The broad band spectrum of the source may be explained by the injection of pair plasma from the supermassive black hole Sgr A* into the interstellar medium, which would also explain the point-like 511 keV line emission component that was discovered by INTEGRAL/SPI at the Galactic centre. The observed positron in-flight annihilation spectrum towards the Galactic bulge excludes $\beta^+$ decays from radioactivities as well as any mechanism producing highly relativistic positrons as origin of the Galactic bulge positrons.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional equation of state extension of quark matter in Fermi-liquid theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cold, dense matter equation of state (EoS) determines crucial global properties of neutron stars (NSs), including the mass, radius and tidal deformability. However, a one-dimensional (1D), cold, and $\beta$-equilibrated EoS is insufficient to fully describe the interactions or capture the dynamical processes of dense matter as realized in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers or core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), where thermal and out-of-equilibrium effects play important roles. We develop a method to self-consistently extend a 1D cold and $\beta$-equilibrated EoS of quark matter to a full three-dimensional (3D) version, accounting for density, temperature, and electron fraction dependencies, within the framework of Fermi-liquid theory (FLT), incorporating both thermal and out-of-equilibrium contributions. We compare our FLT-extended EoS with the original bag model and find that our approach successfully reproduces the contributions of thermal and compositional dependencies of the 3D EoS. Furthermore, we construct a 3D EoS with a first-order phase transition (PT) by matching our 3D FLT-extended quark matter EoS to the hadronic DD2 EoS under Maxwell construction, and test it through the GRHD simulations of the TOV-star and CCSN explosion. Both simulations produce consistent results with previous studies, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our 3D EoS construction with PT.</description>

      <title>Binary Neutron Star Mergers as Potential Sources for Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays and High-Energy Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the most energetic cosmic rays, exceeding 100 EeV, may primarily consist of $r$-process nuclei. This highlights binary neutron star mergers and collapsars as promising sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Building on these insights, we examine the conditions that facilitate the efficient production of UHE $r$-process nuclei during the prompt radiation (PR), extended emission (EE), and plateau emission phases of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) following neutron star mergers. Our study reveals that jets associated with the PR phase, characterized by typical bulk Lorentz factors ($\gtrsim 400-500$), dissipation radii, and magnetic field strengths, can accelerate $r$-process nuclei to energies $\gtrsim 100$ EeV while preserving them during propagation within the source. Additionally, we investigate the production of HE neutrinos from photomeson and hadronic interactions, as well as from the $\beta$ decay of accelerated $r$-process nuclei. We find that the HE neutrino fluxes from sGRBs, mainly produced via photomeson interactions, are significantly limited to preserve the accelerated heavy nuclei, leading to lower fluxes than the predictions without allowing for contributions to UHECRs. Our results suggest that sGRBs may potentially contribute to UHECRs during the PR phase and to HE neutrinos during the EE phase$-$a scenario that can be tested by future neutrino observatories.</description>

      <title>Dark matter signatures in cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes an 11-year cosmic ray dataset of positrons and antiprotons for planetary dependencies related to gravitationally focused dark matter streams. By projecting event timestamps onto planetary heliocentric longitudes, structured flux modulations are found. The results resemble previously reported planetary relationships in solar and terrestrial observables. This supports the possibility that streaming dark matter particles are focused toward Earth by solar system bodies, including the Moon. The findings suggest further searches using other cosmic ray channels, including existing very high-energy gamma ray data.</description>

      <title>Dim cores of radio-bright AGN jets: VLBI and Gaia astrometry pinpoint different parsec-scale features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometry with the very long baseline radio interferometry (VLBI) allows us to determine the position of a point close to the brightest compact detail of the source at milliarcsecond scales. For most active galactic nuclei (AGNs), this compact detail is the opaque core of the radio jet. Rare cases of sources whose brightest detail is not the core but a prominent jet feature parsecs away from the core have been reported, but such sources remained elusive. In this work, we use a novel method for a systematic search of these sources. We scrutinize the AGNs for which the offset between their coordinates determined with VLBI and Gaia is statistically significant and coincides with the vector between two dominant features in their VLBI images, using publicly available archival multi-frequency data. We find 35 sources whose VLBI coordinates are associated with a bright component of their jet separated by several to tens of mas from the radio core. Their Gaia coordinates, in turn, correspond to the jet origin and are close to the radio jet core. The previously published jet directions of most of them must be reversed. These sources exhibit atypically low brightness temperatures of the radio cores, down to 10^9 K in the host galaxy frame, and, at the same time, extreme brightness of the dominating jet components. We argue that these bright components are standing shock fronts and discuss possible physical reasons for the low core brightness, such as ineffective particle heating, atypical absorption, or differential Doppler boosting.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Anti-Correlation between Photon Index and Flux of the Crab using RXTE and NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the recently reported anti-correlation between X-ray flux and photon index ($\Gamma$) in the Crab Nebula, using archival RXTE/PCA (3 - 50 keV), RXTE/HEXTE (20 - 100 keV), and NuSTAR (3 - 78 keV) observations. Spectra were extracted in soft (3 - 10 keV) and hard bands (10 - 50 keV, 10 - 78 keV, 20 - 100 keV) and fitted with an absorbed power-law model. Across all instruments and energy ranges, we confirm the existence of a persistent negative correlation -- harder spectra at higher flux levels. The correlation is stronger in the hard bands compared to the soft bands. This is consistent with synchrotron emission modulated by magnetic field variations in the pulsar wind nebula.</description>

      <title>Peering into the heart of darkness with VLBA : Radio Quiet AGN in the JWST North Ecliptic Pole Time-Domain Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present initial results from the 4.8 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) survey of the JWST North Ecliptic Pole Time-Domain Field (TDF). From 106 radio sources found in the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations in the TDF, we detected 12 sources (11% detection rate) at 3.3 $\mu$Jy rms sensitivity and 4 mas resolution. Most detections exhibit pc-scale emission (less than 40 pc) with high VLBA/VLA flux density ratios and brightness temperatures exceeding 10$^5$ K, confirming non-thermal AGN activity. Spectral indices ($&gt;$ -0.5) correlate with higher VLBA/VLA flux ratios, consistent with synchrotron emission from AGN coronae or jets. In the majority of our sources star formation contributes less than 50% of the total VLBA radio emission, with a few cases where the emission is almost entirely AGN-driven. Although the radio emission from radio quiet AGN is thought to be primarily driven by star formation, our VLBA observations confirm that there is also often a contribution at various levels from black hole driven AGN. Eight VLBA detections have JWST/NIRCam counterparts, predominantly early-type, bulge-dominated galaxies, which we use to get an estimate of the redshift and star formation rate (SFR). WISE colors indicate that VLBA detections are either AGN or intermediate-disk-dominated systems, while VLBA non-detections correspond to extended, star-forming galaxies. We compare SFRs derived from previous SCUBA-2 850 $\mu$m observations with new JWST-based estimates, and discuss the observed discrepancies, highlighting JWST's improved capability to disentangle AGN activity from star formation.</description>

      <title>Co-evolution of cosmic ray energy spectra, composition, and anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of cosmic rays remains an unresolved fundamental problem in astrophysics. The synergy of multiple observational probes, including the energy spectra, the mass composition, and anisotropy is a viable way to jointly uncover this mystery. In this work, we propose that the energy-dependent of those observables in a wide energy range, from $O(10)$ GeV to ultrahigh energies of $10^{11}$ GeV, share quite a few correlated features, indicating a strong co-evolution which could be a consequence of the underlying origin of different source populations. We decipher these structures with a four-component model, i.e., the ensemble of Galactic sources, a local source close to the solar system, and the ensemble of two extra-galactic source populations. In this scenario, the $O(10^2)$ GV hardening and $O(10)$ TV bump is due to the contribution of the local source, the knee is due to the maximum acceleration energy of protons by the Galactic source population, the second knee is due to the maximum acceleration energy of iron nuclei by Galactic sources, the dip feature between the two knees is due to the appearance of the extra-galactic component, the ankle comes from the transition from one extra-galactic component to the other, and the spectral suppression at the highest energies arises from the acceleration limit of the second extra-galactic component. The transition from Galactic to extra-galactic origin of cosmic rays occurs around $O(10^8)$ GeV, which is smaller than the ankle energy.</description>

      <title>Discovery of diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the vicinity of G213.0-0.6: Supernova remnant versus massive star-forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission in the vicinity of G213.0-0.6, which is debated as a supernova remnant (SNR) or an ionized hydrogen (H$_{\rm{II}}$) region. Using 16-yr Pass 8 data from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we found three extended sources with different photon spectra in this region, which will label as SrcA, SrcB and SrcC. Among them, the $\gamma$-ray source SrcA with a log-parabola spectrum is spatially coincident with a star-forming region and several OB stars. The power-law spectra source SrcB is spatially coincident with a SNR radio shell. SrcC with a harder power-law photon spectrum is located outside of the radio shell structure. All of them are spatially coincident with a dense molecular cloud (MC) in the velocity range of 35 - 54 km s$^{-1}$. In this scenario, SrcB can be interpreted as the GeV counterpart of the SNR, and its $\gamma$-ray emission originates from the shock-cloud interaction. SrcA and SrcC originate from the escaped CRs illuminating nearby MC. For SrcA, another possibility is that the $\gamma$-ray emission originates from a young stellar cluster (YSC) associated with a star-forming region (SFR), however, the supporting evidence remains insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.</description>

      <title>Inferring Neutron Star Nuclear Properties from Gravitational-Wave and Gamma-Ray Burst Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of long gamma-ray bursts accompanied by kilonova emission prompted interest in understanding their progenitors. If these long-duration bursts arise from neutron star mergers, similar to short gamma-ray bursts, it raises the question of which physical properties govern burst duration. The mass of the merger stands out as a key factor, strongly influencing the lifetime of the merger remnant, which in turn determines the burst duration: lighter mergers that form long-lived remnants produce short bursts, whereas more massive mergers result in short-lived remnants that collapse into black holes, powering longer bursts. In this paper, we compare merger rates from gravitational-wave observations of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with the rates of kilonova-associated long and short gamma-ray bursts, to identify a characteristic total neutron star mass that separates the two burst classes at $1.36^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ (median and 68\% confidence interval) times of the neutron star Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff mass. This result suggests that massive neutron stars could survive an extended period after merger. Our findings are robust against substantial observational uncertainties and model assumptions. Moreover, we uncover correlations among various characteristic masses tied to dense nuclear matter, introducing a novel and independent approach to constrain neutron star nuclear properties through separated and combined gravitational-wave and gamma-ray burst observations.</description>

      <title>Infrared observations reveal the reprocessing envelope in the tidal disruption event AT 2019azh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are expected to release much of their energy in the far-ultraviolet (UV), which we do not observe directly. However, infrared (IR) observations can observe re-radiation of the optical/UV emission from dust, and if this dust is observed in the process of sublimation, we can infer the un-observed UV radiated energy. TDEs have also been predicted to show spectra shallower than a blackbody in the IR, but this has not yet been observed. We present near/mid-IR observations of the TDE AT 2019azh spanning from -3 d before peak until &gt;1750 d after. We evaluate these observations for consistency with dust emission or direct emission from the TDE. We fit the IR data with a modified blackbody associated with dust emission. The UV+optical+IR data are compared with simulated spectra produced from general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of super-Eddington accretion. We model the data at later times (&gt; 200 d) as an IR echo. The IR data at the maximum light can not be self-consistently fit with dust emission. Instead, the data can be better fit with a reprocessing model, with the IR excess arising due to the absorption opacity being dominated by free-free processes in the dense reprocessing envelope. We infer a large viewing angle of $\sim$60$^{\circ}$, consistent with previously reported X-ray observations, and a tidally disrupted star with mass &gt; 2 M$_{\odot}$. The IR emission at later times is consistent with cool dust emission. We model these data as an IR echo and find that the dust is distant (0.65 pc), and clumpy, with a low covering factor. We show that TDEs can have an IR excess not arising from dust and that IR observations at early times can constrain the viewing angle for the TDE in the unified model. Near-IR observations are therefore essential to distinguish between hot dust and a non-thermal IR excess.</description>

      <title>Towards a TeV blazar sequence and its physical interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars, a highly energetic subclass of jetted active galactic nuclei, show a broad band spectral energy distribution (SED) with two bumps, resulting from non-thermal jet emission. In 1998, an anticorrelation between the SED luminosity and the peaks frequency was found, later confirmed in 2017, called the blazar sequence. Its origin is still unclear. This work is part of a broader effort aiming at giving a physical interpretation to the blazar sequence, by modeling the sources emission in a Synchrotron Self Compton framework, concentrating only on TeV-detected blazars of BL Lac type. Unlike the original sequence, sources were binned by synchrotron peak frequency. The SED of one representative source is modeled for each bin, using data from average activity state to ensure consistency. Here, we focus on the study of one of the selected representative sources, PKS 2155-304, a high-energy-peaked BL Lac, showing the performed data selection and preliminary modeling results.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Detection with the IceTop Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IceTop is the cosmic-ray detector located on the surface of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole, consisting of 81 pairs of ice-Cherenkov tanks. The rise in the energy threshold of air-shower measurements in IceTop due to accumulating snow emphasized the need for the next generation of IceCube surface detectors. For this purpose, the Surface Array Enhancement (SAE) is set to comprise elevated scintillator panels and radio antennas controlled by hybrid DAQ systems. The detectors of the SAE are also expected to extend to the planned IceCube-Gen2 Surface Array. An initial study with a prototype station is already conducted. We briefly review the SAE and the deployment as well as the calibration status of the upcoming stations of the planned array of 32 stations. The focus of this contribution is on the radio detection of extensive air showers. A preliminary estimation of the position of the shower maximum ($X_\mathrm{max}$), that is sensitive to the primary mass, with data from the 3 antennas of the prototype station was carried out. An extension of the method from previous analyses is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for MeV-GeV Pulsar Wind Nebulae without Gamma-ray Detected Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are being identified in the TeV band by ground-based Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes such that they constitute the dominant source class of Galactic TeV emitters. However, MeV-GeV PWN counterparts are still largely lacking. To date, only a dozen PWNe are identified by the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) in the MeV-GeV band. Most PWNe are located along the Galactic plane embedded within the prominent, diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission, which makes these sources difficult to disentangle from the bright diffuse background. We present a systematic search for gamma-ray counterparts to known PWNe in the 300MeV-2TeV energy band using the Fermi-LAT. We target locations of previously identified PWNe that lack detected Fermi-LAT pulsars to minimize associated pulsar contamination. The sample includes 6 previously identified Fermi-LAT PWNe and 8 Fermi-LAT sources associated with PWNe. We report the analysis of 58 regions of interest and classify detected sources as either a likely PWN or a candidate PWN counterpart based on their morphological and spectral characteristics across the broadband spectrum. There are 9 unidentified Fermi-LAT sources that we consider as likely PWN counterparts, which, if confirmed to be PWNe, would greatly increase the PWN population detected by the Fermi-LAT from 12 to 21. The remaining Fermi-LAT detected sources are considered weaker PWN candidates. A second approach in the systematic search for gamma-ray emitting PWNe will involve studying the off-pulse phases of Fermi-LAT pulsars for the presence of an obscured PWN and will be reported in a subsequent paper.</description>

      <title>TeV spectral bump of cosmic-ray protons and helium nuclei: the role of nearby supernova remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of nearby discrete cosmic-ray sources can lead to many interesting effects on the observed properties of cosmic rays. Recent measurements of cosmic rays with the CALET and the DAMPE experiments have revealed a bump-like new feature in the proton and helium spectra in the energy range of ~ (1-100) TeV/nucleon. The origin of the feature is not clearly understood. In this paper, considering an improved and more detailed analysis than previous works, and using an updated age and distance estimates of nearby supernova remnants along with an energy-dependent escape process for cosmic rays from the remnants, we show that the spectral bump can be explained by the contribution of cosmic rays from the nearby supernova remnants, in particular, the Vela remnant. We also show that the contribution from the nearby remnants agrees well with the observed spectra of the heavier cosmic-ray elements from carbon to iron as well as with the measured all-particle cosmic-ray spectrum beyond the knee region when combined with a background flux of cosmic rays originating from distant supernova remnants.</description>

      <title>An Ejection Event Captured by VLBI During the Outburst of Swift J1727.8$-$1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed a newly-discovered Galactic black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network (EVN) at 5 GHz. The observation was conducted immediately following a radio quenching event detected by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The visibility amplitude evolution over time reveals a large-amplitude radio flare and is consistent with an ejection event. The data can be interpreted either as a stationary component (i.e., the radio core) and a moving blob, or as two blobs moving away from the core symmetrically in opposite directions. The initial angular separation speed of the two components was estimated to 30 mas d^{-1}. We respectively fitted a single circular Gaussian model component to each of 14 sliced visibility datasets. For the case of including only European baselines, during the final hour of the EVN observation, the fitted sizes exhibited linear expansion, indicating that the measured sizes were dominated by the angular separation of the two components. The 6-h EVN observation took place in a rising phase of an even larger 4-day-long radio flare, implying that the ejection events were quite frequent and therefore continuous radio monitoring is necessary to correctly estimate the power of the transient jet. Combined with X-ray monitoring data, the radio quenching and subsequent flares/ejections were likely driven by instabilities in the inner hot accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of machine learning techniques for feature selection and classification of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin, exhibiting a wide range of physical and observational properties. Distinguishing between repeating and non-repeating FRBs remains a key challenge in understanding their nature. In this work, we apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify FRBs based on both primary observables from the CHIME catalog and physically motivated derived features. We evaluate three hybrid pipelines combining dimensionality reduction with clustering: PCA + k-means, t-SNE + HDBSCAN, and t-SNE + Spectral Clustering. To identify optimal hyperparameters, we implement a comprehensive grid search using a custom scoring function that prioritizes recall while penalizing excessive cluster fragmentation and noise. Feature relevance is assessed using principal component loadings, mutual information with the known repeater label, and permutation-based F\textsubscript{2} score sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that the derived features including redshift, luminosity, and spectral properties, such as the spectral index and the spectral running, significantly enhance the classification performance. Finally, we identify a set of FRBs currently labeled as non-repeaters that consistently cluster with known repeaters across all methods, highlighting promising candidates for future follow-up observations and reinforcing the utility of unsupervised approaches in FRB population studies.</description>

      <title>Testing the Lense-Thirring Precession Origin of the QPO in Swift J1727.8$-$1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectral and timing analysis of the newly discovered black hole transient Swift J1727.8$-$1613, based on broadband (2$-$150 keV) observations from $Insight$-HXMT during its 2023 outburst. We use the flexible, energy-conserving SSsed model to model both the outer disc and inner, complex Comptonisation, using the expected disc emissivity to constrain the inner disc radius, $r_{cor}$. This decreases from 45 $R_{\rm g}$ to 9 $R_{\rm g}$ duing the transition from the hard to hard intermediate and then soft intermediate state. We plot $r_{cor}$ versus the centroid frequency of the strong quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs; $\nu_{\rm c}$) seen in these data to test the inner hot flow Lense-Thirring (LT) precession model. The overall slope of the observed trend is in strong agreement with the predictions of LT precession, despite the complexities of accretion behavior, though there is an offset in absolute value which may indicate that the system parameters are still not well determined. The inner radius of the hot flow is consistent with a constant value throughout most of the outburst, indicating that changes in the jet (e.g. the discrete ejections) do not strongly affect the radiated power. Either the jet kinetic power is not a large fraction of the accretion power or the jet is instead mostly powered by the spin energy of the black hole.</description>

      <title>X-ray emission signatures of galactic feedback in the hot circumgalactic medium: predictions from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Little is currently known about the physical properties of the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding massive galaxies. Next-generation X-ray observatories will enable detailed studies of the hot CGM in emission. To support these future efforts, we make predictions of the X-ray emission from the hot CGM using a sample of 28 $\sim$Milky Way-mass disk galaxies at $z=0$ from seven cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suites incorporating a wide range of galactic feedback prescriptions. The X-ray surface brightness (XSB) morphology of the hot CGM varies significantly across simulations. XSB-enhanced outflows and bubble-like structures are predicted in many galaxies simulated with AGN feedback and in some stellar-feedback-only galaxies, while other galaxies exhibit more isotropic XSB distributions at varying brightnesses. Galaxies simulated without cosmic ray physics exhibit radial XSB profiles with similar shapes ($\propto r^{-3}$ within $20-200$ kpc), with scatter about this slope likely due to underlying feedback physics. The hot CGM kinematics also differ substantially: velocity maps reveal signatures of bulk CGM rotation and high-velocity biconical outflows, particularly in simulations incorporating AGN feedback. Some stellar-feedback-only models also generate similar AGN-like outflows, which we postulate is due to centrally-concentrated star formation. Simulations featuring AGN feedback frequently produce extended temperature enhancements in large-scale galactic outflows, while simulations incorporating cosmic ray physics predict the coolest CGM due to pressure support being provided by cosmic rays rather than hot CGM. Individually-resolved X-ray emission lines further distinguish hot CGM phases, with lower-energy lines (e.g., O VII) largely tracing volume-filling gas, and higher-energy lines (e.g., Fe XVII) highlighting high-velocity feedback-driven outflows.</description>

      <title>Modeling Relative Peak Times of Gravitational Wave Harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers is essential for extracting their rich physics. A key detail for understanding the physics of mergers is predicting the precise time when the amplitude of the gravitational wave strain peaks, which can differ significantly among the different harmonic modes. We propose two semi-analytical methods to predict these differences using the same three inputs from Numerical Relativity (NR): the remnant mass and spin and the instantaneous frequency of each mode at its peak amplitude. The first method uses the frequency evolution predicted by the Backwards-One-Body model, while the second models the motion of an equatorial timelike geodesic in the remnant black hole spacetime. We compare our models to the SXS waveform catalog for quasi-circular, non-precessing systems and find excellent agreement for $l = |m|$ modes up to $l=8$, with mean and median differences from NR below 1$M$ in nearly all cases across the parameter space. We compare our results to the differences predicted by leading Effective-One-Body and NR surrogate waveform models and find that in cases corresponding to the largest timing differences, our models can provide significant increases in accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves provide a unique opportunity to test general relativity in the strong-field regime, enabling the extraction of key physical parameters from observational data. Traditional likelihood-based inference methods, while robust, become computationally expensive in high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as when incorporating multiple ringdown modes or beyond Kerr deviations. In this paper, we explore the implementation of a conditional variational autoencoder-based machine-learning framework for accelerated ringdown parameter estimation. As a first application, we use the neural network to infer the remnant properties of a final black hole under the Kerr hypothesis. We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm with simulated ringdown waveforms consistent with advanced LIGO sensitivity and compare with Bayesian analysis results. We further extend the framework beyond the Kerr paradigm by incorporating deviations predicted in braneworld gravity.</description>

      <title>New Determination of the $^{14}$C(n, $\gamma$)$^{15}$C Reaction Rate and Its Astrophysical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel experiment to investigate the spectroscopic factor of the $^{15}$C ground state for the first time using single-neutron $removal$ transfer reactions on $^{15}$C. Two consistent spectroscopic factors were derived from the (p, d) and (d, t) reactions, which were subsequently used to deduce the $^{14}$C(n, $\gamma$)$^{15}$C reaction cross section and the corresponding stellar reaction rate. A typical cross section of (3.89 $\pm$ 0.76) $\mu$b is determined at $E_\mathrm{_{c.m.}}$ = 23.3 keV. At the temperature range of 0.01-4 GK, our new reaction rate is 2.4-3.7 times higher than that of the first direct measurement and 20\%-25\% lower than that of the most recent direct measurement, respectively. Moreover, it is interesting that we can associate a long-standing nuclear structure issue, i.e., the so-called ``quenching'' effect, with this astrophysically relevant reaction. Finally, motivated by astrophysical interests of this reaction decades ago, implications of our new rate on several astrophysical problems are evaluated using state-of-the-art theoretical models. Our calculations demonstrate that the abundances of $^{14}$N and $^{15}$N can be enhanced in the inner regions of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, though with minimal impact on the chemical compositions of the interstellar medium. In the inhomogeneous Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the updated reaction rate can lead to a $\sim 20\%$ variation in the final yields of $^{15}$N in neutron rich regions. For the $r$-process in the core-collapse supernovae, a slight difference of $\sim 0.2\%$ in the final abundances of heavy elements with $A &gt; 90$ can be found by using our new rate.</description>

      <title>On accretion in the polar V379 Vir</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on optical and infrared survey data spanning $\approx 20$ years of observations, the long-term variability of the polar V379 Vir with a brown dwarf secondary has been studied. By modeling the spectral energy distribution, we constrain the white dwarf's mass to $M_1 = 0.61 \pm 0.05~M_{\odot}$ and its effective temperature to $T_{eff} = 10930 \pm 350~K$. Near-infrared photometry yields a donor radius of $R_2 = 0.095 \pm 0.018 R_{\odot}$ and temperature $T_{eff} = 1600 \pm 180 K$. Modeling of the cyclotron emission from the accretion spot, detected with the Spitzer infrared telescope, gives an accretion rate of $\dot{M} \approx 3 \times 10^{-13} M_{\odot}/yr$. This rate is consistent with polars in a low accretion state, but significantly higher than expected from wind-driven mass transfer.</description>

      <title>Dark matter admixed relativistic stars: Structural properties and tidal Love numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of bosonic, self-interacting dark matter on structural properties and tidal deformabilities of compact stars. As far as the gravitational theory is concerned, we assume Einstein's gravity in four dimensions with a vanishing cosmological constant. Regarding matter content, we consider a state-of-matter to a linear form of equation-of-state (EoS), while for dark matter we assume a quartic scalar potential, which implies a certain non-linear EoS obtained long time ago. Adopting the two-fluid formalism we integrate the structure equations as well as the Riccati equation for the metric even perturbations imposing appropriate initial conditions at the center of the stars and matching conditions at their surface. We compute the stellar mass and radius, factor of compactness and dimensionless deformability varying several free parameters of the model studied here. Tidal deformability and the corresponding tidal Love number determine the imprint of the underlying EoS within the signals emitted during binary coalescences, and it is expected to be altered due to the presence of dark matter inside the objects. We find that in all cases considered here, the dimensionless deformability of the canonical stellar mass remains lower than the upper bound, $\Lambda_{1.4} &lt; 800$. We also look at the stability of these stars based on the Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov criterion under various conditions. It is observed that the presence of dark matter implies significantly lower highest stellar mass, and also smaller and more compact stars for a given stellar mass.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired wormholes from String T-Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic non-perturbative features of string-theoretic corrections, particularly those arising from T-duality, have been shown to naturally introduce an effective ultraviolet (UV) cutoff into the gravitational framework. This cutoff, often referred to as the zero-point length in the context of path integral duality, acts as a fundamental minimal length scale that regulates short-distance divergences. Using the established correspondence between T-duality and path integral duality, it has been shown that the static Newtonian potential becomes regularized at small distances. Building upon this regular behavior, we proceed to construct self-consistent, spherically symmetric, and electrically neutral wormhole solutions, which remain free of curvature singularities and embodies the effects of this duality-induced UV completion. We explore wormhole configurations with the aim of minimizing violations of the null energy condition (NEC). In fact, solutions with a constant redshift function or specific shape functions generally exhibit NEC violations throughout the entire spacetime. To address this, we explore two distinct thin shell constructions: (i) wormholes formed by matching an interior wormhole geometry to an exterior Schwarzschild vacuum spacetime, thereby confining exotic matter to a localized region; and (ii) standard thin-shell wormholes generated by gluing two identical black hole spacetimes across a timelike hypersurface situated outside their event horizons. In both cases, the NEC violations are minimised and restricted to a finite region, improving the physical plausibility and traversability of the resulting configurations.</description>

      <title>In pursuit of the low-energy Solar neutron flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of low-energy solar neutrons flux is crucial for probing solar energetic processes and neutron transport mechanisms in interplanetary space. This study investigates the role of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in modulating the low-energy solar neutrons. The neutron flux is modeled by incorporating a CME-width scaling factor into existing neutron fluence models. Our analysis, based on CME data from the SECHHI COR2 database during the DANSON experiment (2016-10-27 to 2017-03-17), identified narrow-width (20$^\circ$ $&lt;$ $\alpha$ $&lt;$ 80$^\circ$) and fast (v $&gt;$ 800 km/s) CMEs as key contributors to neutron production. The revised model predicts a neutron flux of 5 - 49 neutrons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at 1 AU for a neutron travel time of 1.66 hours, aligning with previous reports. Additionally, the estimated total flux of 2.45 MeV neutrons over a 4-hour period accounts for 10.23\% of DANSON's total flux. These findings suggest that CME-driven mechanisms may significantly influence the low-energy solar neutron flux. More observational efforts are needed to refine neutron flux estimates and improve background subtraction techniques for spaceborne neutron detectors.</description>

      <title>The Scotogenic Model with Two Inert Doublets: Parameters Space and Electroweak Precision Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a scotogenic extension of the Standard Model featuring two inert scalar doublets and three singlet Majorana fermions, where neutrino masses are generated radiatively at one loop. The lightest among the Majorana fermions and neutral scalars can serve as dark matter candidates. We explore the parameter space, considering theoretical constraints (perturbativity, unitarity, vacuum stability) and experimental limits (lepton flavor violation, Higgs measurements, electroweak precision observables). Our analysis identifies regions where sizable Yukawa couplings naturally arise due to constructive interference in the scalar sector. Additionally, we estimate the oblique parameters, finding that only $\Delta T$ is sensitive to charged mass splittings, while $\Delta S$ and $\Delta U$ remain small across the viable parameter space. However, 60\% of the viable parameter space is excluded by the recent CMS measurement of the $W$ boson mass, since the shift $\Delta M_W$ depends on the oblique parameters, particularly $\Delta T$ that is sensitive to scalar mass splittings.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark-Matter Spikes and the Final-Parsec Problem: Bayesian constraints from the NANOGrav 15-Year Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing ``final-parsec problem.'' Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15 year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>HAWC Performance Enhanced by Machine Learning in Gamma-Hadron Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving gamma-hadron separation is one of the most effective ways to enhance the performance of ground-based gamma-ray observatories. With over a decade of continuous operation, the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory has contributed significantly to high-energy astrophysics. To further leverage its rich dataset, we introduce a machine learning approach for gamma-hadron separation. A Multilayer Perceptron shows the best performance, surpassing traditional and other Machine Learning based methods. This approach shows a notable improvement in the detector's sensitivity, supported by results from both simulated and real HAWC data. In particular, it achieves a 19\% increase in significance for the Crab Nebula, commonly used as a benchmark. These improvements highlight the potential of machine learning to significantly enhance the performance of HAWC and provide a valuable reference for ground-based observatories, such as Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) and the upcoming Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO).</description>

      <title>X-ray and Optical Analysis of the Prototype Polar AN UMa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a long-term optical and X-ray photometric study of AN UMa, one of the prototypical polar-type cataclysmic variables, tracing more than 34 years of its accretion history. Observations from both ground-based and space-based facilities have been analysed to investigate state transitions within the system. Throughout this period, significant changes in the light curve have been observed, corresponding to different mass accretion states. From four years of TESS photometry, we derive a revised photometric period that agrees with the spectroscopic period to within 1.2$\sigma$. These optical observations further suggest switching between two accretion poles. During intervals of high accretion, dips in the X-ray light curve indicate that the primary accretion pole is obscured by an accretion stream elevated above the orbital plane, a feature also evident in the TESS light curves. Additionally, periodogram analysis reveals a periodicity of $\approx$437 days, which may be related to long-term accretion state changes. Following a 16-year high state, AN UMa entered two short-lived low states, lasting 180 and 123 days, during which it faded to a magnitude of 19.2, as recorded by the ZTF and ATLAS surveys. Using the system's low-state brightness and the distance provided by Gaia, we estimate that the system may have a white dwarf with an effective temperature of $\approx$15000~K, and a donor of spectral type M4.7. This work provides a useful reference for future studies of polars with variable accretion geometries and highlights the importance of long-term, multi-wavelength monitoring in the study of magnetic cataclysmic variables.</description>

      <title>On quasi-periodic decameter radio emission from Jupiter related to Ganymede</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper discusses the possibility of implementing a plasma generation mechanism in a source of decameter radio emission associated with Ganymede and an explanation based on this mechanism of forming quasi-periodic sequences of bursts of this radiation. According to the discussed model, the registered quasi-periodic sequences of radiation pulses are a consequence of implementing in the source a pulsating mode of plasma wave conversion into extraordinary electromagnetic waves with a small refractive index. The negative frequency drift of the radiation observed in the frequency-time spectrogram is due to the group delay of waves with a small refractive index and the dispersion of the medium. Based on the plasma model, estimates of the plasma parameters in the generation region are obtained, which are in agreement with the data obtained as a result of satellite measurements.</description>

      <title>Identifying multiple images of gravitational-wave sources lensed by elliptical lensing potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real astrophysical lenses typically lack axisymmetry, necessitating the study of gravitational-wave (GW) lensing by elliptical mass distributions to accurately assess detectability and waveform interpretation. We investigate strong lensing using the singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model, which produces two or four images depending on the source's position relative to lens caustics. Employing a quasi-geometrical optics framework, we determine that the geometrical-optics approximation holds reliably for lens masses above approximately $10^5 \, M_\odot$ at GW frequencies relevant for ground-based detectors $(\sim 10^2 \,\text{Hz})$, though wave-optics effects become significant for lower masses or sources near caustics. Our waveform mismatch analysis demonstrates that the use of three-image templates significantly improves our ability to distinguish source signals, reducing mismatches from $O(10^{-1})$ to $O(10^{-2})$, typically by factors between 1.5 and 5 compared to the standard two-image template model. At lens masses above $10^7 \, M_\odot$, diffraction effects become negligible for ground-based detectors, resulting in an additional mismatch reduction by a factor of approximately three. These findings highlight the critical need for multi-image templates in GW searches to enhance detection efficiency and accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We investigate $g$-mode oscillations in dark matter admixed neutron stars employing a relativistic mean field model to describe hadronic matter and a model for self-interacting fermionic dark matter motivated by the neutron decay anomaly. Following the construction of such admixed configurations, we derive the equilibrium and adiabatic speeds of sound therein, leading to a computation of the star's $g$-mode spectrum in the Cowling approximation. In particular, we explore the effect of dark matter self-interaction, the nucleon effective mass and dark matter fraction on the principal $g$-mode frequency, and its first overtone. We show that the effect on $g$-mode frequency depends predominantly on the dark matter fraction, and demonstrate an equation of state-independent constraint for the latter. Prospects of identifying the presence of dark matter in neutron stars using $g$-mode are discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing fermionic asymmetric dark matter cores using global neutron star properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is possible for asymmetric dark matter (ADM) to accumulate in neutron star interiors and affect their global properties. Considering the effects of this accumulation, neutron star mass-radius measurements can deliver new insights into the cold dense matter equation of state (EoS). In this paper, we employ Bayesian parameter estimation using real and synthetic neutron star mass-radius data to infer constraints on the combined baryonic matter and fermionic ADM EoS, where the fermionic ADM forms a core in the neutron star interior. Using currently available mass-radius data, we find that the lower bound of the ratio between ADM effective self-repulsion strength ($g_\chi/m_\phi$) and particle mass ($m_\chi$) can be constrained at the 68\% (95\%) credible level to $10^{-6.59}$ ($10^{-7.77}$). We also find that, if neutron star mass-radius measurement uncertainties are reduced to the 2\% level, the constraints on the lower bound of the ratio of $g_\chi/m_\phi$ to $m_\chi$ can be improved to $10^{-6.49}$ and $10^{-7.68}$ at the 68\% and 95\% credible levels, respectively. However, all other combinations, of $m_\chi$, $g_\chi$, and the ADM mass-fraction, $F_\chi$, (i.e., the ratio of the gravitational ADM mass to the gravitational mass of the neutron star) are unconstrained. Furthermore, in the pressure-energy density and mass-radius planes, the inferences which include the possibility of fermionic ADM cores are nearly identical with the inferences that neglect fermionic ADM for $F_\chi \leq 1.7\%$ and neutron star mass-radius uncertainties $\geq 2\%$. Therefore, we find that neutron star mass-radius measurements can constrain the ratio of $g_\chi/m_\phi$ to $m_\chi$ and that neutron stars with ADM are indistinguishable from purely baryonic stars. This implies that neutron stars with ADM are equally as consistent with the available mass-radius data as neutron stars without ADM.</description>

      <title>Co-precession of a curved jet and compact accretion disk in M87</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observational constraints on the configuration of the black hole (BH)-accretion disk-jet system are crucial to understanding BH spin, accretion disk physics, and jet formation. The recently reported variation in the M87 jet position angle (PA) provides a novel avenue to explore these long-standing issues. The observed $\sim$ 11-year periodicity, spanning over two cycles, is consistent with the Lense-Thirring (LT) precession of a compact, tilted accretion disk. However, how such a compact region decouples from the larger-scale accretion flow remains an open question in current numerical simulations. The jet precession challenges the traditional view of a strictly collimated jet, revealing a subtle curvature in the jet's inner regions that dynamically links the jet to the spinning BH and successfully accounts for its unexpectedly wide inner projected profile. While continued long-term observations are needed to distinguish coherent precession from stochastic fluctuations in the disk or jet orientation, these results open a new window for probing BH systems through coordinated multi-scale observations and follow-on theoretical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) channel for the formation of binary black hole (BBH) mergers has been previously studied as a potential formation channel for the merging compact binaries observed by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) scientific collaboration. The first two papers in this series explored the McFACTS code for the evolution of black hole orbits in AGN accretion disks for individual galaxy models and described the characteristics of predicted BBH populations in realizations of those models (such as the correlation between mass ratio and aligned spin). In this work, we explore the impact of the properties of AGN host galaxies and assume an AGN lifetime and cosmological model for the density of AGN in a universe like our own. By sampling from an inferred population of AGN, we marginalize over galaxy mass to predict a population of BBH mergers observable by modern ground-based gravitational wave observatories. We find that for reasonable assumptions, AGN disk environments may account for massive BBH mergers such as GW190521 and GW190929_012149. We find that the majority of observable BBH mergers from our simulation are expected to originate in galaxies with a super-massive black hole between $10^{7}M_{\odot}$ and $10^{9.4}M_{\odot}$. We also find that if hierarchical mergers from AGN disks account for a substantial part of the LVK population, our current models require an AGN lifetime of 0.5 to 2.5 Myr.</description>

      <title>The more accurately the metal-dependent star formation rate is modeled, the larger the predicted excess of binary black hole mergers</title>

Abstract: As the number of gravitational-wave detections grows, the merger rate of binary black holes (BBHs) can help us to constrain their formation, the properties of their progenitors, and their birth environment. Here, we aim to address the impact of the metal-dependent star formation rate (SFR) on the BBH merger rate. To this end, we have developed a fully data-driven approach to model the metal-dependent SFR and coupled it to BBH evolution. We have adopted the most up-to-date scaling relations, based on recent observational results, and we have studied how the BBH merger rate density varies over a wide grid of galaxy and binary evolution parameters. Our results show that including a realistic metal-dependent SFR evolution yields a value of the merger rate density which is too high compared to the one inferred from gravitational-wave data. Moreover, variations in the SFR in low-mass galaxies ($M_\ast \lesssim 10^8 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) do not contribute more than a factor $\sim 2$ to the overall merger rate density at redshift $z=0$. These results suggest that the discrepancy between the BBH merger rate density inferred from data and theoretical models is not caused by approximations in the treatment of the metal-dependent SFR, but rather stems from stellar evolution models and/or BBH formation channels.</description>

      <title>Direct nonparametric multimessenger constraints on the equation of state of cold dense nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize the now substantial amount of astrophysical observations of neutron stars (NSs), along with perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations at high density, to directly constrain the NS equation of state (EOS). To this end, we construct nonparametric EOS priors by using Gaussian processes trained on 75 EOSs, which include models with either hadrons, hyperons, or quarks at high densities. We create a prior using the full EOS sample (model agnostic), and one prior for each EOS family to test model discrimination. We introduce a novel inference approach, which allows the simultaneous sampling of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of binary NS mergers, as well as a nonparametric equation of state. We showcase this method in a Bayesian updating scheme by first performing a complete analysis of the binary NS merger event GW170817 with minimal assumptions, and sequentially adding information from x-ray and radio NS observations, along with pQCD calculations. Besides providing standard constraints, such as the pressure at twice nuclear saturation density $p(2\rho_\text{sat})=4.3^{+0.6}_{-0.6}\,\times 10^{34}\text{dyne/cm}^{2}$, at $95\%$ confidence level, for the model agnostic prior, our methodology shows how the choice of EOS families used in conditioning changes the inferred astrophysical properties of the EOS, namely tidal deformability and maximum supported NS mass. We find hyperonic priors predicting higher tidal deformabilities for a $1.4M_\odot$ NS, and hadronic priors being preferred by the considered astrophysical data.</description>

      <title>Commensal Transient Searches with MeerKAT in Gamma-Ray Burst and Supernova Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity and field of view of the MeerKAT radio telescope provides excellent opportunities for commensal transient searches. We carry out a commensal transient search in supernova and short gamma-ray burst fields using methodologies established in~\citet{commensal1}. We search for transients in MeerKAT L-band images with 30 minute integration times, finding 13 variable sources. We compare these sources to the VLASS and RACS survey data, and examine possible explanations for the variability. Additionally, for one of these sources we examine archival \textit{Chandra} ACIS data. We find that 12 of these sources are consistent with variability due to interstellar scintillation. The remaining source could possibly have some intrinsic variability. We also split the MeerKAT L-band into an upper and lower half, and search for transients in images with an 8 second integration time. We find a source with a duration of 8 to 16 seconds that is highly polarized at the lowest frequencies. This source is spatially coincident with a star detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\textit{TESS}). We conclude that this source may be consistent with a stellar flare. Finally, we calculate accurate upper and lower limits on the transient rate using transient simulations.</description>

      <title>A long-term study of Mrk 50 : Appearance and disappearance of soft excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extensive temporal and spectral study of the Seyfert 1 AGN Mrk 50 using 15 years (2007-2022) of multiwavelength observations from XMM-Newton, Swift, and NuSTAR for the first time. From the timing analysis, we found that the source exhibited variability of $\sim$20 % during the 2007 observation, which reduced to below 10 % in the subsequent observations and became non-variable in the observations from 2010 onward. From the spectral study, we found that the spectra are nearly featureless. Non-detection of absorption in the low-energy domain during the 15 years of observation infers the absence of obscuration around the central engine, rendering the nucleus a `bare' type. A prominent soft X-ray excess below 2 keV was detected in the source spectrum during the observations between 2007 and 2010, which vanished during the later observations. To describe the nature of the soft excess, we use two physical models, such as warm Comptonization and blurred reflection from the ionized accretion disk. Both the physical models explain the nature and origin of the soft excess in this source. Our analysis found that Mrk~50 accretes at sub-Eddington accretion rate ($\lambda_{Edd}=0.13-0.02$) during all the observations used in this work.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Hot CGM Gas: An Inverse-Compton Origin for Diffuse X-ray Emission in the Circumgalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations have argued that Milky Way (MW), Andromeda, and lower-mass galaxies exhibit extended soft X-ray diffuse halos to radii $R\gtrsim100\,$kpc in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). If interpreted as thermal emission, the shallow surface brightness profiles $S_{X}\propto R^{-1}$ are difficult to explain and contradict other observations. We show that such halos instead arise from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons with GeV cosmic ray (CR) electrons. GeV electrons have ~Gyr lifetimes and escape the galaxy, forming a shallow extended profile out to $\gtrsim100\,$kpc, where IC off the CMB should produce soft, thermal-like X-ray spectra peaked at ~keV. The observed keV halo luminosities and brightness profiles agree well with those expected for CRs observed in the local interstellar medium (LISM) escaping the galaxy, with energetics consistent with known CRs from SNe and/or AGN, around galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\ast}\lesssim2\times 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$. At higher masses observed X-ray luminosities are larger than predicted from IC and should be dominated by hot gas. In the MW+M31, the same models of escaping CRs reproduce gamma-ray observations if we assume an LISM-like proton-to-electron ratio and CR-pressure-dominated halo. In all other halos, the radio and $\gamma$-ray brightness is below detectable limits. If true, the observations provide qualitatively new constraints on CGM and CR physics: X-ray brightness directly traces the CR lepton energy density in the CGM. This agrees with LISM values within 10 kpc, which following the profile expected for escaping CRs in the CGM. The inferred CR pressure is a major part of the MW CGM pressure budget. X-ray surface brightness and luminosity allows one to further determine the CGM diffusivity at radii $\sim10-1000\,$kpc. These also agree with LISM values at small radii but increase in the CGM.</description>

      <title>The diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background radiation: star-forming galaxies are not the dominant component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star-forming galaxies (SFGs) are considered to be an important component of the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB) radiation observed in 0.1 -- 820 GeV, but their quantitative contribution has not yet been precisely determined. In this study, we aim to provide the currently most reliable estimate of the contribution of SFGs based on careful calibration with gamma-ray luminosities of nearby galaxies and physical quantities (star formation rate, stellar mass, and size) of galaxies observed by high-redshift galaxy surveys. Our calculations are based on the latest database of particle collision cross-sections and energy spectra of secondary particles, and take into account not only hadronic but also leptonic processes with various radiation fields in a galaxy. We find that SFGs are not the dominant component of the unresolved EGB measured by Fermi; the largest contribution is around 50% -- 60% in the 1 -- 10 GeV region, and the contribution falls rapidly in lower and higher energy ranges. This result appears to contradict a previous study, which claimed that SFGs are the dominant component of the unresolved EGB, and the origin of the discrepancy is examined. In calculations of cosmic-ray production, propagation, and interaction in a galaxy, we try models developed by two independent groups and find that they have little impact on EGB.</description>

      <title>The FAST Discovery of a Millisecond Pulsar M15O (PSR J2129+1210O) Hidden in the Harmonics of M15A (PSR J2129+1210A)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an isolated millisecond pulsar M15O (J2129+1210O) from the globular cluster M15 (NGC 7078) with a period of $\sim$11.06686 ms and a dispersion measure of $\sim$67.44 cm$^{-3}$ pc. Its spin period is so close to the 10th harmonic of the bright pulsar M15A ($\sim$11.06647 ms) that it was missed in previous pulsar search. We suggest adding the spectrum in the pulsar candidate diagnostic plot to identify new signals near the harmonics. M15O has the first spin frequency derivative and the second spin frequency derivative,being 1.79191(5) $\times$ $10^{-14}$ Hz $s^{-1}$ and 3.3133(6)$\times$ $10^{-23}$ Hz $s^{-2}$, respectively. Its projected distance from the optical center of M15 is the closest among all the pulsars in M15. The origin can be something from the center of the massive and core-collapsed globular cluster M15.</description>

      <title>A LOFAR-style reconstruction of cosmic-ray air showers with SKA-Low</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray air shower detection with the low-frequency part of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescope is envisioned to yield very high precision measurements of the particle composition of cosmic rays between $10^{16}$ and $10^{18}$ eV. This is made possible by the extreme antenna density of the core of SKA-Low, surpassing the current most dense radio air shower observatory LOFAR by over an order of magnitude. In order to make these measurements, the technical implementation of this observation mode and the development of reconstruction methods have to happen hand-in-hand. As a first lower limit of what is obtainable, we apply the current most precise reconstruction methods as used at LOFAR to a first complete simulation of air shower signals for the SKA-Low array. We describe this simulation setup and discuss the obtainable accuracy and resolution. A special focus is put on effects of the dynamic range of the system, beamforming methods to lower the energy threshold, as well as the limits to the mass composition accuracy given by statistical and systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a variable yellow supergiant progenitor for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a progenitor candidate for the Type~IIb SN2024abfo using multi-epoch pre-explosion images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. The progenitor exhibited a ~0.7 mag decline in F814W from 2001 to 2013, followed by significant brightening and color fluctuations in the g, r and z bands. This is the first time that substantial photometric variability has been found for the progenitor of a SN IIb. We suggest that the variability is caused by intrinsic changes in the progenitor star instead of varying obscuration by circumstellar dust. Our results show that the progenitor of SN2024abfo was likely a yellow supergiant star with an initial mass of 12--18 Msun for circumstellar reddening of E(B-V)_CSM &lt; 0.2 mag. Our study underscores the critical role of multi-epoch imaging surveys in revealing the final stages of core-collapse supernovae progenitors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: More and more observations have indicated the existence of slow diffusion phenomena in astrophysical environments, such as around the supernova remnants and pulsar $\gamma$-ray halos, where the diffusion coefficient of cosmic rays (CRs) near the source region is significantly smaller than that far away from the source region. The inhomogeneous diffusion indicates the existence of multiple diffusion mechanisms.Comparing the CR mirror diffusion with the scattering one, we aim to explore their diffusion characteristics in different magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence regimes and understand the effect of different MHD modes on mirror and scattering diffusion. We perform numerical simulations with the test particle method. Within the global frame of reference, we first measure parallel and perpendicular CR diffusion and then determine the mean free path of CRs with varying energies.Our main results demonstrate that: (1) CRs experience a transition from superdiffusion to normal diffusion; (2) mirror diffusion is more important than scattering diffusion in confining CRs; (3) CR diffusion strongly depends on the properties of MHD turbulence; and (4) magnetosonic and Alfv\'en modes dominate the parallel and perpendicular diffusion of CR particles, respectively. The diffusion of CRs is a complex problem of mixing the mirror diffusion and scattering diffusion. The property of turbulent magnetic fields influences CR diffusion. The CR slow diffusion due to the presence of magnetic mirrors in turbulence has important implications for explaining observations near a CR source.</description>

      <title>A gating-and-inpainting perspective on GW150914 ringdown overtone: understanding the data analysis systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the recent debate on the evidence for an overtone in the black hole ringdown of GW150914 using an independent data-analysis pipeline. By gating and inpainting the data, we discard the contamination from earlier parts of the gravitational wave signal before ringdown. This enables parameter estimation to be conducted in the frequency domain, which is mathematically equivalent to the time domain method. We keep the settings as similar as possible to the previous studies by Cotesta et al. arXiv:2201.00822 and Isi et al. arXiv:1905.00869 arXiv:2202.02941 which yielded conflicting results on the Bayes factor of the overtone. Our aim is to understand how different data analysis systematics, including sampling rates, erroneous timestamps, and the frequency resolution of the noise power spectrum, would influence the statistical significance of an overtone. Our main results indicate the following: (i) a low-resolution estimation of the noise power spectrum tends to diminish the significance of overtones, (ii) adjusting the start time to a later digitized point reduces the significance of overtones, and (iii) overtone evidence varies with different sampling rates if the start time is too early, indicating that the overtone is a poor model, hence we propose a convergence test to verify the validity of an overtone model. With these issues addressed, we find the Bayes factors for the overtone to range from $10$ to $26$ in a range of times centered at the best-fit merger time of GW150914, which supports the existence of an overtone in agreement with the conclusions of Isi et al. arXiv:1905.00869 arXiv:2202.02941. These results are obtained by keeping the start time and sky location fixed, enabling a direct comparison with other work. Marginalizing over these parameters would lower the Bayes factor to 1 for the evidence of an overtone.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters III: Probability of Binary Black Holes Hidden in Gaia Black Hole Binary</title>

Abstract: The Gaia mission and its follow-up observations have discovered a few candidates of non-interacting single black holes (BHs) and visible stars, Gaia BH1, BH2, and BH3, collectively called ``astrometric BH binaries''. This paper investigates whether any of these candidates harbor binary BHs (BBHs), namely, whether any such candidates are previously undiscovered ``astrimetric BBH triples''. Focusing on open star clusters, which are promising formation sites of astrometric BH binaries, we estimate the formation rate of astrometric BBH triples through gravitational $N$-body simulations. We find a competitively high formation efficiency of astrometric BBH triples ($\sim 10^{-6} {\rm M}_\odot^{-1}$ or $\sim 10$\% of astrometric BH binaries) in low-metallicity environments but no astrometric BBH triples in solar-metallicity environments. Most of the astrometric BBH triples in our simulations were dynamically stable for $10$ Gyrs, indicating that $\sim10$\% of astrometric BH binary candidates may indeed harbor inner BBHs if they originate from open star clusters in low-metallicity environments. Astrometric BBH triples can be distinguished from astrometric BH binaries through radial velocity follow-up of the tertiary star. According to the statistics of our simulated samples, a small percent of astrometric BH binary candidates should exhibit detectable radial-velocity modulations generated by inner BBHs. Such candidates preferentially exhibit ``outer'' orbital periods of $\gtrsim 10^3$ days and moderately high ``outer'' orbital eccentricities ($\gtrsim 0.7$). Our current result will strongly motivate the search for astrometric BBH triples in the upcoming Gaia Data Release 4 and Gaia Final Data Release.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing between light curves of ellipsoidal variables with massive dark companions, contact binaries, and semidetached binaries using principal component analysis</title>

Abstract: Photometric methods for identifying dark companion binaries - binary systems hosting quiescent black holes and neutron stars - operate by detecting ellipsoidal variations caused by tidal interactions. The limitation of this approach is that contact and semidetached binaries can produce similarly looking light curves. In this work, we address the degeneracy of ellipsoidal light curves by studying the differences between synthetically generated light curves of dark companion, semidetached, and contact binary systems. We inject the light curves with various levels of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise to simulate the effects of instrumental noise and stellar spots. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and Fourier decomposition, we construct low-dimensional representations of the light curves. We find that the first two to five PCA components are sufficient to explain $99\%$ of variance in the data. The PCA representations are generally more informative than the Fourier representation for the same number of coefficients as measured by both the silhouette scores of the representations and the macro recalls of random forest classifiers trained on the representations. The random forest classifiers reach macro recalls from $0.97$ to $0.70$, indicating that the classes remain largely separable even under adverse conditions. We find that instrumental noise significantly impacts the class separation only when its standard deviation exceeds $10^{-3}$ mag, whereas the presence of spots can markedly reduce the class separation even when they contribute as little as $1\%$ of the light curve amplitude. We discuss the application of our method to real ellipsoidal samples, and we show that we can increase the purity of a sample of dark companion candidates by a factor of up to $27$ if we assume a prior purity of $1\%$, significantly improving the cost-efficiency of follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Hongmeng mission using the 21 cm global spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19257</link>

Abstract: Probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes remains a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. Exotic energy injections from dark matter annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking evaporation can alter the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm global spectrum. We assess the potential of the upcoming space project, the Hongmeng mission, to probe dark matter particles and PBHs using the 21 cm global spectrum. Under ideal conditions with 1000 hours of integration time and negligible foreground residuals, the Hongmeng project can reach sensitivities to dark matter annihilation cross sections and decay lifetimes to $\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim 10^{-28}\,\mathrm{cm^3\,s^{-1}}$ and $\tau \sim 10^{28}\,\mathrm{s}$, respectively, for dark matter particles with a mass of $10\,\mathrm{GeV}$. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances as low as $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the Hongmeng mission can improve current constraints on dark matter annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation by nearly two orders of magnitude. Moreover, the Hongmeng mission surpasses current limits on sub-GeV dark matter probing and enables the probing of Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,\mathrm{g}$, which remain undetectable through conventional cosmological means. Overall, the upcoming Hongmeng project holds great promise for advancing the investigation of both dark matter and PBHs, potentially deepening our understanding of the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Resolution Limiting Factors in Low-Energy Cascade Zenith Angle Reconstruction with the IceCube Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory includes low energy extensions such as the existing DeepCore subarray and the upcoming IceCube Upgrade, which will consist of seven new strings of photosensors with denser instrumentation than the existing array. The setup will allow for the study of neutrino oscillations with greater sensitivity compared to the existing instrumentation, improve neutrino mass ordering studies, and test for the unitarity of the PMNS mixing matrix with high precision. A critical component in these low-energy physics analyses is the accurate reconstruction of event information, particularly the zenith angle of incoming neutrinos. In this study, we discuss the processes that limit the zenith resolution, which include the transverse spread of the hadronic shower, in-ice photon scattering, module resolutions, and module noise. By considering approximations to these processes, we aim to approach the intrinsic zenith resolution limits for purely hadronic events.</description>

      <title>The impact of wind accretion in Evolving Symbiotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of geometric corrections to the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion scheme applied to evolving symbiotic systems. We model systems where 0.7 and 1 M$_\odot$ white dwarfs accrete material from Solar-like stars with initial masses of 1, 2, and 3 M$_\odot$. The primary star is evolved using the MESA stellar evolution code, while the orbital dynamics of the system are calculated using REBOUND. The analysis focuses on systems evolving through the red giant branch and the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phases that do not experience a Wind Roche Lobe Overflow phase. We compare three scenarios: no accretion, standard BHL accretion, and the improved wind accretion. The choice of accretion prescription critically influences the evolution of symbiotic systems. Simulations using the modified model did not reach the Chandrasekhar limit, suggesting that type Ia supernova progenitors require accretors originating from ultra-massive WDs. In contrast, the standard BHL model predicts WD growth to this limit in compact systems. This discrepancy suggests that population synthesis studies adopting the traditional BHL approach may yield inaccurate results. The revised model successfully reproduces the accretion properties of observed symbiotic systems and predicts transitions between different accretion regimes driven by donor mass-loss variability. These results emphasize the need for updated wind accretion models to accurately describe the evolution of symbiotic binaries.</description>
