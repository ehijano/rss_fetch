      <title>Evolving Rules: Imitation and Best Response Learning in Cournot Oligopoly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study evolutionary dynamics in which firms endogenously revise the behavioral rules that govern strategy revisions in symmetric Cournot oligopoly. Specifically, we consider two principles that guide rule revision, No-Birth and Survival-of-the-Fittest, both grounded in imitation-based heuristics. We show that, under these principles, all firms eventually adopt the same behavioral rule. Focusing on two classical rules, myopic best response and imitation, we demonstrate that rule revision plays a crucial role in determining long-run equilibria in Cournot oligopoly. The set of long-run equilibria includes the state where all players use best response learning and choose the Nash equilibrium quantities and states where all firms use imitation learning and choose specific symmetric quantities which include (but are not necessarily restricted to) Walrasian quantities. Our results extend to more general aggregative games.</description>

      <title>Zoned Out: The Long-Term Consequences of School Choice for Wealth Segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how school choice mechanisms shape wealth segregation in the long term by endogenizing residential choice. Families buy houses in school zones that determine admission priority, experience shocks to school preferences, and participate in one of three mechanisms: neighborhood assignment (N), Deferred Acceptance (DA), or Top Trading Cycles (TTC). Neighborhood segregation increases from N to DA to TTC. DA and TTC reduce school-level segregation relative to neighborhoods but typically not enough to reverse this ranking, and housing prices in oversubscribed zones rise in the same order. Two desegregation policies further illustrate how short- and long-term perspectives can differ.</description>

      <title>Matching Under Preference Uncertainty: Random Allocation, Informativeness, and Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a decentralized many-to-one matching market where preferences remain uncertain during the matching process. Institutions initiate matching by sending offers, and applicants decide whether to accept upon receiving them. Since applicants learn their preferences only after receiving offers, institutions face a challenge in deciding how many offers to issue. I address this challenge by introducing probabilistic offers (admitting applicants with a probability less than one), which ensure that ex-ante market clearing and stability are achievable. However, the welfare effect of information is subtle: applicants may become worse off as they acquire more information.</description>

      <title>On Multi-Level Apportionment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Apportionment refers to the well-studied problem of allocating legislative seats among parties or groups with different entitlements. We present a multi-level generalization of apportionment where the groups form a hierarchical structure, which gives rise to stronger versions of the upper and lower quota notions. We show that running Adams' method level-by-level satisfies upper quota, while running Jefferson's method or the quota method level-by-level guarantees lower quota. Moreover, we prove that both quota notions can always be fulfilled simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Privacy Structure and Blackwell Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper characterizes the set of feasible posterior distributions subject to graph-based inferential privacy constraint, including both differential and inferential privacy. This characterization can be done through enumerating all extreme points of the feasible posterior set. A connection between extreme posteriors and strongly connected semi-chains is then established. All these semi-chains can be constructed through successive unfolding operations on semi-chains with two partitions, which can be constructed through classical spanning tree algorithm. A sharper characterization of semi-chains with two partitions for differential privacy is provided.</description>

      <title>Private From Whom? Minimal Information Leakage in Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many auctions, bidders may be reluctant to reveal private information to the auctioneer and other bidders. Among deterministic bilateral communication protocols, reducing what bidders learn requires increasing what the auctioneer learns. A protocol implementing a given social choice rule is on the privacy Pareto frontier if no alternative protocol reveals less to both bidders and the auctioneer. For first-price auctions, the descending protocol and the sealed-bid protocol are both on the privacy Pareto frontier. For second-price auctions, the ascending protocol and the ascending-join protocol of Haupt and Hitzig (2025) are both on the privacy Pareto frontier, but the sealed-bid protocol is not. A designer can flexibly trade off between what bidders learn and what the auctioneer learns by "stitching" different protocols together.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Punishment and Reward on Cooperation in a Prisoners' Dilemma Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper characterizes how different incentive instruments shape cooperation in a repeated Prisoner`s Dilemma with a continuum of players. A simple tit-for-tat strategy competes against unconditional defection, and the long-run outcome is summarized by a tipping-point share of cooperators, above which cooperation spreads and below which defection prevails. Closed-form expressions for this tipping-point are derived as a function of four payoff classes: targeted punishment of defectors, general punishment applied to all deviations, and two symmetric reward instruments. The formula implies sharply diminishing returns to targeted punishment so that increasing the penalty lowers the temptation payoff and reduces the cooperation threshold but can only drive the threshold asymptotically toward zero, so a positive mass of defectors persists even under extreme sanctions. By contrast, sufficiently strong general incentives (taxes, subsidies, or reputational payoffs) that shift the entire payoff profile can increase cooperation and make it self-enforcing. The framework nests several standard strategy refinements (evil and generous tit-for-tat, Win-Stay-Lose-Shift, heterogeneous horizons, and imperfect monitoring) and derives the corresponding shifts in the cooperation threshold. A numerical calibration illustrates these comparative statics and links them to policy environments where unilateral incentives conflict with collective welfare, including climate agreements, online platform governance, and systemic financial regulation. The results suggest that durable cooperation is rarely secured by a single heavyweight mechanism, but rather that robust outcomes emerge when policy simultaneously tilts payoffs away from unilateral defection and extends the effective horizon over which cooperative gains are realized, combining moderate targeted measures with broader, general instruments.</description>

      <title>Commitment and Randomization in Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When does Sender, in a Sender-Receiver game, strictly value commitment? In a setting with finitely many actions and states, we establish that, generically, commitment has no value if and only if a partitional experiment is optimal. Moreover, if Sender's preferred cheap-talk equilibrium necessarily involves randomization, then Sender values commitment. Our results imply that if a school values commitment to a grading policy, then the school necessarily prefers to grade unfairly. We also ask: for what share of preference profiles does commitment have no value? For any state space, if there are $\left|A\right|$ actions, the share is at least $\frac{1}{\left|A\right|^{\left|A\right|}}$. As the number of states grows large, the share converges precisely to $\frac{1}{\left|A\right|^{\left|A\right|}}$.</description>

      <title>Correlated equilibrium implementation: Navigating toward social optima with learning dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implementation theory has made significant advances in characterizing which social choice functions can be implemented in Nash equilibrium, but these results typically assume sophisticated strategic reasoning by agents. However, evidence exists to show that agents frequently cannot perform such reasoning. In this paper, we present a finite mechanism which fully implements Maskin-monotonic social choice functions as the outcome of the unique correlated equilibrium of the induced game. Due to the results in Hart and MasColell (2000), this yields that even when agents use a simple adaptive heuristic like regret minimization rather than computing equilibrium strategies, the designer can expect to implement the SCF correctly. We demonstrate the mechanism's effectiveness through simulations in a bilateral trade environment, where agents using regret matching converge to the desired outcomes despite having no knowledge of others' preferences or the equilibrium structure. The mechanism does not use integer games or modulo games.</description>
