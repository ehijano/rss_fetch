      <title>A comparison of three kinds of monotonic proof-theoretic semantics and the base-incompleteness of intuitionistic logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I deal with two approaches to proof-theoretic semantics: one based on argument structures and justifications, which I call reducibility semantics, and one based on consequence among (sets of) formulas over atomic bases, called base semantics. The latter splits in turn into a standard reading, and a variant of it put forward by Sandqvist. I prove some results which, when suitable conditions are met, permit one to shift from one approach to the other, and I draw some of the consequences of these results relative to the issue of completeness of (recursive) logical systems with respect to proof-theoretic notions of validity. This will lead me to focus on a notion of base-completeness, which I will discuss with reference to known completeness results for intuitionistic logic. The general interest of the proposed approach stems from the fact that reducibility semantics can be understood as a labelling of base semantics with proof-objects typed on (sets of) formulas for which a base semantics consequence relation holds, and which witness this very fact. Vice versa, base semantics can be understood as a type-abstraction of a reducibility semantics consequence relation obtained by removing the witness of the fact that this relation holds, and by just focusing on the input and output type of the relevant proof-object.</description>

      <title>Some results in non-monotonic proof-theoretic semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I explore the relationships between Prawitz's approach to non-monotonic proof-theoretic validity, which I call reducibility semantics, and some later proof-theoretic approaches, which I call standard base semantics and Sandqvist's base semantics respectively. I show that, if suitable conditions are met, reducibility semantics and standard base semantics are equivalent, and that, if Sandqvist's variant is complete over reducibility semantics, then also the inverse holds. Finally, notions of "point-wise" soundness and completeness (called base-soundness and base-completeness) are discussed against some known principles from the proof-theoretic literature, as well as against monotonic proof-theoretic semantics. Intuitionistic logic is proved not to be "point-wise" complete on any kind of non-monotonic proof-theoretic semantics. The way in which this result is proved, as well as the overall behaviour of "point-wise" soundness and completeness, is significantly different in the non-monotonic framework as compared to what happens in the monotonic one - where the notions at issue can be used too to prove the "point-wise" incompleteness of intuitionistic logic.</description>

      <title>Structures preserved by primitive actions of $S_\omega$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dichotomy for structures $A$ that are preserved by primitive actions of $S_{\omega} = \text{Sym}({\mathbb N})$: either such a structure interprets all finite structures primitively positively, or it is of a very simple form and in particular has a binary polymorphism $f$ and an automorphism $\alpha$ satisfying $f(x,y) = \alpha(f(y,x))$. It is a consequence of our results that the constraint satisfaction problem for $A$ is in P or NP-complete.
  To prove our result, we study the first-order reducts of the Johnson graph $J(k)$, for $k \geq 2$, whose automorphism group $G$ equals the action of $S_{\omega}$ on the set $V$ of $k$-element subsets of $\mathbb N$. We use the fact that $J(k)$ has a finitely bounded homogeneous Ramsey expansion and that $G$ is a maximal closed subgroup of $\text{Sym}(V)$.</description>
