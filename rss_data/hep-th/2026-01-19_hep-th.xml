      <title>Holographic Correlators of Giant Gravitons in Monodromy Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute holographically correlation functions for giant gravitons in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM in the presence of monodromy defects through probe branes. The computation boils down to the study of charged geodesics in certain five-dimensional gauged supergravity backgrounds. In addition to the standard U-shaped geodesic, in the presence of the defect, we find an extra, novel, contribution from a geodesic anchored at the defect which captures the one-point function of the square of the giant graviton.</description>

      <title>The gravitational wave landscape of cosmic string networks with varying tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fully classify the phenomenology of gravitational wave emission from scaling cosmic string networks with varying tension and compute the spectral indices of the resulting stochastic backgrounds. In string compactifications, periods of varying tension occur when moduli acquire a time-dependence. We present concrete examples in type IIB string theory as D3- and NS5- branes wrapping internal cycles, which become dynamical due to the effect of moduli potentials. Moreover, we use Swampland constraints to derive general bounds on the allowed time-variation of the effective string tension in FLRW backgrounds and on the resulting spectral indices.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Mitosis and Hasse Diagram Diamonds: A Note on Brane Configurations with $\mathrm{ON}^{0}$ Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter considers 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ (unitary-)orthosymplectic quiver gauge theories originating from Type IIA and Type IIB brane systems with $\mathrm{ON}^0$ planes. Such theories lie outside the scope of present combinatorial techniques for Coulomb branch symmetry and symplectic stratification. It turns out that the correct prescription involves `symmetry mitosis': a common subset of nodes in two linear balanced chains source \emph{two} factors of a Coulomb branch global symmetry instead of one; the correct Coulomb branch Hasse diagram is obtained by a `doubling' procedure on that computed by naive quiver subtraction. Input from 6d SQFTs and little string theories allows for the construction of various `mitotic' magnetic quivers. The full Higgs branch Hasse diagram of minimal $(E_6,E_6)$ conformal matter is given. Additionally, a new Type I$'$ brane system using eight full D8 branes, negatively charged D6 branes, and $\mathrm{ON}^0$ planes is found corresponding to a product of $\mathrm{Spin}(32)$ instantons on $\mathbb C^2$. The corresponding 6d theory uses $\mathrm{Sp}(-1)$ gauge nodes which have the interpretation of bi-spinor matter of $\mathrm{O}(a)$ and $\mathrm{O}(12-a)$ for $a=0,1,\cdots,12$.</description>

      <title>What is a Gravitational Path Integral? {\it or} Gravitational Path Integrals as Fluctuating Gravito-Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how Gravitational Path Integral formulae for various quantities that have been computed in the literature, follow from a few coarse grained hydrodynamic assumptions about the relations between space-time geometry, entropy, and fluctuations of the modular Hamiltonian of causal diamonds. These remarks have implications for the way we think about such path integrals in relation to a more fundamental model of quantum gravity, and to questions about which space-time topologies are actually summed over in real models.</description>

      <title>An AS${}^2$ Menagerie</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a large number of exact solutions of three-dimensional gravity with heavy matter particles that generalize the construction of Antonini, Sasieta, and Swingle (AS${}^2$), argued to define CFT states dual to a spacetime with a closed baby universe cosmology. Our construction starts with an arbitrary heavy-particle closed universe cosmology of the type constructed in arXiv:2503.12227, and via a gluing procedure adds an arbitrary number of AdS tubes connecting the past and future conformal boundaries of the associated Euclidean wormhole solution. With our construction, it is straightforward to produce examples where the cosmology is approximately homogeneous and isotropic. We describe a necessary condition for the cosmological wormhole saddle to dominate the Euclidean path integral with the specified boundary conditions. We argue that the original AS${}^2$ construction usually does not meet this condition, and describe alternative saddles that are likely to dominate. We discuss various possibilities for how the cosmological saddle might be made to dominate in our generalized construction.</description>

      <title>Thermostatistical analysis and negative heat capacities of Yukawa and Lee-Wick potentials in noncommutative phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, physical models involving noncommutative algebras have attracted considerable interest since we can study theories with a Planck scale parameter which can seen as a semiclassical theory and consequently a path to a kind of quantum gravity. The noncommutative geometry introduces modifications to the underlying phase space structure, which can lead to new insights, and potentially solves outstanding problems in theoretical physics. In this work, we adopt a semiclassical perspective to perform a thermostatistical analysis of well-established potential models - Yukawa and Lee-Wick - within a noncommutative phase space. We obtain statistical thermodynamics quantities such as the density of states, partition function, average energy, and the heat capacity. We employ both the microcanonical and canonical ensemble formalisms, with the system embedded in a phase space modified by the noncommutativity of the space-time. We analyzed the negative heat capacities results obtained here in this noncommutativity scenario as a function of the modification of the microstructure of phase space thanks to the $\theta$-parameter introduction. The entire treatment is conducted within the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics framework.</description>

      <title>Confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in holography: a smooth switch-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the holographic description of the thermal first order phase transition of N=4 SYM compactified on a spatial circle. At the transition, the dominant bulk saddle exchanges between a geometry with a compact spatial circle and one with a compact Euclidean time circle. We construct a one-parameter family of Euclidean geometries that describes the unstable branch of the transition, completing the swallow-tail structure of the free energy. Although these configurations are thermodynamically unstable, they provide a continuous interpolation between the confining soliton and the deconfined black hole phases. Using probe fundamental strings, we show that the theory remains confining along the unstable branch, with a string tension that decreases smoothly and vanishes only in the black hole limit. Introducing fundamental matter via probe D5-branes, we find that chiral symmetry breaking follows the same pattern: the condensate decreases continuously and switches off precisely where confinement disappears. We discuss the implications for the confinement and chiral symmetry breaking mechanisms at large Nc.</description>

      <title>An algebraic description of the Page transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an algebraic description of the Page transition, a key feature in black hole evaporation where the entropy of Hawking radiation follows a unitary Page curve instead of monotonically increasing. By applying concepts from approximate quantum error correction with complementary recovery, we characterize the Page transition as a phase transition in channel recovery. We then generalize the description to infinite-dimensional settings using algebraic relative entropy, which remains valid even in type III factors. For type I/II factors, explicit probes based on relative entropy differences are derived, serving as indicators for the transition at the Page time.</description>

      <title>In search of diabolical critical points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A phase transition is an example of a ``topological defect'' in the space of parameters of a quantum or classical many-body systems. In this paper, we consider phase diagram topological defects of higher codimension. These have the property that equilibrium states undergo some kind of non-trivial winding as one moves around the defect. We show that such topological defects exist even in classical statistical mechanical systems, and describe their general structure in this context. We then introduce the term ``diabolical critical point'' (DCP), which is a higher-codimension analog of a continuous phase transition, with the proximate phases of matter replaced by the non-trivial winding of the proximate equilibrium states. We propose conditions under which a system can have a stable DCP. We also discuss some examples of stable DCPs in (1+1)-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Shadow signatures and energy accumulation in Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole has been recently introduced as a geodesically complete spacetime featuring a signature shift at the event horizon where causal geodesics are precluded from reaching the central $r=0$ singularity. In this paper, we investigate the shadows produced by this geometry to identify deviations from the standard Schwarzschild solution. Our analysis reveals an excess intensity in the inner shadow region that points to a potential observational signature of the novel behavior of light rays propagating near the event horizon. This excess could be a probe for horizon-scale modifications of black hole geometries. Furthermore, although the horizon surface of the Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole continuously accumulates photons and energy, we show that its backreaction response differs from that of stable light rings found in various exotic compact objects.</description>

      <title>A Magnus group construction for a class of Borcherds algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a group associated to a class of Borcherds algebras that admit a direct sum decomposition into a Kac--Moody (or semi-simple) subalgebra and a pair of free Lie subalgebras. Such Borcherds algebras have no mutually orthogonal imaginary simple roots.Our group is a semi-direct product of a Kac--Moody (or semi-simple) group and a Magnus group of invertible formal power series corresponding to a basis of a certain highest weight module determined by the simple imaginary roots. We show that our group is independent of this choice of basis, up to isomorphism. We apply our construction to a number of concrete examples, such as certain Borcherds algebras formed using root lattices of hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebras, the Monster Lie algebra, Monstrous Lie algebras of Fricke type and the gnome Lie algebra.</description>

Abstract: We derive the master equations governing axial and polar gravitational perturbations of a generic static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetime within the framework of the revised Deser--Woodard nonlocal gravity theory. We then apply our general formalism to a one-parameter family of black hole solutions recently obtained by the present authors, representing small first-order deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry. We provide well-motivated arguments that allow us to render the analysis analytically tractable. Our results provide the first complete perturbative characterization of nonlocal black holes and lay the groundwork for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Positive Genus Pairs from Amplituhedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A main conjecture in the field of Positive Geometry states that amplituhedra are positive geometries. It is motivated by examples showing that the canonical forms of certain amplituhedra compute scattering amplitudes in particle physics. In recent work, Brown and Dupont introduced a new framework, based on mixed Hodge theory, connecting canonical forms and de Rham cohomology. In this paper, we show that this framework is consistent with the known results for amplituhedra but does not apply beyond those families. We provide an explicit example showing that the central assumption of the Brown-Dupont framework (namely to have a pair of genus zero) is not a necessary condition to be a positive geometry in the original sense of Arkani-Hamed, Bai, and Lam. This underscores the fact that our results do not immediately disqualify the amplituhedron from being a positive geometry.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the fine-tuning of radiative alpha-particle capture on carbon, $\alpha(^{12}{\rm C},^{16}{\rm O})\gamma$, at astrophysical energies. Utilizing results from cluster effective field theory for this reaction, we find that the low-energy data of the astrophysical S-factor allow for only very small variations in the electromagnetic fine-structure constant $\alpha$, namely $|\delta \alpha/\alpha| \leq 0.2\,$ per mille, in both the $E1$ and the $E2$ radiative capture.</description>

Abstract: For a class of two-dimensional Euclidean lattice field theories admitting topological lines encoded into a spherical fusion category, we explore aspects of their realisations as boundary theories of a three-dimensional topological quantum field theory. After providing a general framework for explicitly constructing such realisations, we specialise to non-abelian generalisations of the Ising model and consider two operations: gauging an arbitrary subsymmetry and performing Fourier transforms of the local weights encoding the dynamics of the theory. These are carried out both in a traditional way and in terms of the three-dimensional topological quantum field theory. Whenever the whole symmetry is gauged, combining both operations recovers the non-abelian Kramers-Wannier duals \`a la Freed and Teleman of the generalised Ising models. Moreover, we discuss the interplay between renormalisation group fixed points of gapped symmetric phases and these generalised Kramers-Wannier dualities.</description>

      <title>A Strategy for Proving the Strong Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis : Chaotic Systems and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09746v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization and equilibration. Although it is expected to be hold in a wide class of highly chaotic theories, there are only a few analytic examples demonstrating the strong ETH in special cases, often through methods related to integrability. In this paper, we explore sufficient conditions for the strong ETH that may apply to a broad range of chaotic theories. These conditions are expressed as inequalities involving the long-time averages of real-time thermal correlators. Specifically, as an illustration, we consider simple toy examples which satisfy these conditions under certain technical assumptions. This toy models have same properties as holographic theories at least in the perturbation in large $N$. We give a few comments for more realistic holographic models.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Deflection of Vector Photons via Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational scattering of the electromagnetic field from a heavy scalar field provides a fundamental testbed for understanding the deflection of light by massive bodies. In many approaches based on effective field theory, the calculation of scattering amplitudes quickly becomes complicated due to the large number of Feynman integrals required, especially beyond leading order. In this work, we study this problem using effective field theory in the weak field approximation. We utilize Integration-By-Parts reduction techniques to precisely examine the long-range contributions governed by terms in the amplitude which are non-analytic in momentum transfer. Using geometric optics and the eikonal approximation, we derive expressions for the deflection angle and find the origin of differences relative to earlier works.</description>

Abstract: It is shown to all orders of perturbation theory that in the effective field theory of general relativity the condition of vanishing of the vacuum energy leads to the same value of the cosmological constant, viewed as a parameter of the effective Lagrangian, as obtained by demanding the consistency of the effective field theory in Minkowski background. The resulting effective action is characterized by the cosmological constant term that vanishes exactly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter spacetimes exhibiting gravitational radiative behavior, employing null gauges that allow for a well-defined flat limit. The radiative content in the bulk is captured by the boundary Cotton and stress tensor, which we collect into a radiative vector. We reinterpret this vector holographically in terms of fluid variables in the dual boundary theory. For algebraically special solutions, we uncover a close connection between bulk radiation and dissipative corrections in the boundary stress tensor, demonstrating a direct link between radiation and entropy production in the boundary fluid. This reveals a rich interplay between radiative dynamics in the bulk and out-of-equilibrium conformal physics at the boundary. We then investigate the flat limit of this correspondence in the context of flat-space holography. In this setting, we construct a Carrollian analogue of the radiative vector and introduce Celestial observables, such as energy detectors, which emerge naturally from the bulk's radiative structure. Our analysis shows that bulk radiation sources the Carrollian viscous stress tensor and heat current, which encodes the Bondi news in this framework. We illustrate our results with explicit examples, including Robinson-Trautman spacetimes and accelerating black holes.</description>

      <title>On Integrable Structure of Null String in (Anti-)de Sitter Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Presently integrability turned out to be the key property in the study of duality between superconformal gauge theories and strings in anti-de Sitter superspaces. Complexity of the study of integrable structure in string theory is caused by complicated dependence of background fields of the Type II supergravity multiplets, with which strings interact, on the superspace coordinates. This explains an interest to study of limiting cases, in which superstring equations simplify. In the present work, we considered the limiting case of zero tension corresponding to null string. The representation in the form of the Lax equation of null-string equations in (anti-)de Sitter space realized as a coset manifold is obtained. Proposed is twistor interpretation of the Lagrangian of (null) string in anti-de Sitter space expressed in terms of group variables.</description>

Abstract: The four-dimensional Chern-Simons (CS) theory provides a systematic procedure for realizing two-dimensional integrable field theories. It is therefore a natural question to ask whether integrable deformations of the theories can be realized in the four-dimensional CS theory. In this work, we study $T\bar{T}$ and root-$T\bar{T}$ deformations of two-dimensional integrable field theories, formulated in terms of dynamical coordinate transformations, within the framework of four-dimensional CS theory coupled to disorder defects. We illustrate our procedure in detail for the degenerate $\mathcal{E}$-model, a specific construction that captures and unifies a broad range of integrable systems, including the principal chiral model.</description>

Abstract: We study the real-time dynamics of multi-party entanglement signals in chaotic quantum many-body systems including but not necessarily restricted to holographic conformal field theories. We find that scrambling dynamics generates multiparty entanglement with rich structure including: (a) qualitatively different dynamical behaviours for different signals, likely reflecting different dynamics for different kinds of entanglement patterns, (b) discontinuities indicating dynamical phase transitions in the entanglement structure, (c) transient and non-monotonic multiparty entanglement, and (d) periods during which the extensive entanglement of some regions is entirely multipartite. Our main technical tool is the membrane theory of entanglement dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adapt the Hamilton-Jacobi method of holographic renormalization to scalar field theories in Minkowski spacetime with scattering boundary conditions. The approach yields a flat-space holographic dictionary in which the expectation value of a dual operator is given by the renormalized canonical momentum. The source of the operator is imposed as a Dirichlet condition in a radial timelike foliation of the bulk theory and corresponds to the scattering data appearing in the Arefeva-Faddeev-Slavnov generating functional. We initiate a study of massive scalars and interacting fields within this formalism and we comment on extensions to different bulk theories and backgrounds.</description>

      <title>A Unique Bosonic Symmetry in a 4D Field-Theoretic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the combined field-theoretic system of the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) Abelian 3-form and 1-form gauge theories, we show the existence of a unique bosonic symmetry transformation that is constructed from the four infinitesimal, continuous and off-shell nilpotent symmetry transformations which exist for the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantized versions of the coupled (but equivalent) Lagrangian densities that describe the present 4D field-theoretic system. The above off-shell nilpotent symmetry transformations are nothing but the BRST, co-BRST, anti-BRST and anti-co-BRST, under which, the Lagrangian densities transform to the total spacetime derivatives. The proof of the uniqueness of the above bosonic symmetry transformation operator crucially depends on the validity of all the four Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions that exist on our theory. We highlight the importance of these CF-type restrictions, at various levels of our theoretical discussions, in the context of the unique bosonic transformation. We compare this observation against the backdrop of the three CF-type restrictions that appear in the requirements of the absolute anticommutativity of the specific set of nilpotent symmetries.</description>

Abstract: Are duality transformations symmetries of string theory? For AdS space-time the answer is no for generic asymptotic values of the moduli, since the duality symmetry is broken explicitly in the dual conformal field theory. In contrast, in string theory in flat space-time, monodromy around codimension two exotic branes show that duality transformations are spontaneously broken discrete gauge symmetries with observable consequences, provided macroscopic loops of these branes are not hidden behind an event horizon. We discuss how this can be achieved and how the situation in flat space-time differs from that in AdS space-time. We also discuss observability of codimension two non-BPS branes and codimension one BPS and non-BPS branes.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of writing an effective, linearised theory in small derivatives that reproduces the Mittag-Leffler expansion of a charge current correlator with an arbitrary number of simple poles. We demonstrate how such a framework: can be compatible with hydrostaticity without modification of thermodynamics, properly accounts for the differing notions of smallness in time and space derivatives including setting the lowest order effective equation of motion, and corrects the effective equations in derivatives. As an application, we apply the results to charge fluctuations of the D3/D5 probe brane and quantify how the transport coefficients behave when quasihydrodynamics emerges at large charge density.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormholes from a smoothed string fluid in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate traversable wormhole solutions in four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity sourced by a smoothed string fluid. Originally proposed to model regular black holes, this energy density profile is adapted here to sustain wormhole geometries by allowing for a radially varying equation of state. We obtain zero-tidal-force solutions that satisfy all traversability criteria and remain globally regular. The Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling $\alpha$ plays a central role in shaping the throat geometry. We identify a parameter region ($\alpha \geq 1$, $\varepsilon \leq 0.1$) in which the null energy condition is satisfied in the vicinity of the throat, representing a significant improvement over general relativistic counterparts. The interplay between the smoothing scale $a$ and the string density $\varepsilon$ ensures finite curvature invariants while reducing the violation of energy conditions. An analysis of the volume integral quantifier and the complexity factor further shows that strong EGB coupling simultaneously suppresses gravitational complexity and the total amount of exotic matter. These results establish a unified framework in which the same string fluid source can generate both regular black holes and stable traversable wormholes, depending on the strength of higher-curvature corrections.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal magnetoconductivity in chiral multifold semimetals exemplified by pseudospin-1 nodal points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We embark on computing the longitudinal magnetoconductivity within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, where an isotropic triple-point semimetal (TSM) is subjected to collinear electric ($\boldsymbol E $) and magnetic ($\boldsymbol B$) fields. Except for the Drude part, the $B$-dependence arises exclusively from topological properties like the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. We solve the Boltzmann equations exactly in the linear-response regime, applicable in the limit of weak/nonquantising magnetic fields. The novelty of our investigation lies in the consideration of the truly multifold character of the TSMs, where the so-called flat-band (flatness being merely an artefact of linear-order approximations) is made dispersive by incorporating the appropriate quadratic-in-momentum correction in the effective Hamiltonian. It necessitates the consideration of interband scatterings within the same node as well, providing a complex interplay of intraband, interband, intranode, and internode processes, offering an overwhelmingly rich set of possibilities. The exact results are compared with those obtained from a naive relaxation-time approximation.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal spectra of a wormhole family: overtone features and a parameter-controlled redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Though investigated extensively in the past, we take a detailed relook at the study of quasinormal modes (QNM) in a known family of wormholes (ultrastatic ($g_{00}=-1$), as well as spacetimes with different, non-constant $g_{00}$), which includes the familiar Bronnikov-Ellis spacetime as a special case. Our focus here is to go beyond the fundamental mode and obtain some of the QNM overtones using a suitable numerical scheme. Scalar and axial gravitational QNMs including two or three overtones are obtained for the family of ultrastatic geometries and their parameter dependencies are shown explicitly. Further, we comment on how (a) the overtones may influence the time-domain profile in a perturbation and (b) in what sense, the use of overtones may help in distinguishing between different geometries within the family.
  Finally, we show how an effect somewhat similar to the so-called `environment induced redshift' of QNMs, introduced recently (Phys. Rev. D \textbf{111}, 064026 (2025)), may be obtained for spacetimes with non-constant $g_{00}$, via an appropriate tuning of available metric parameters which systematically modify the shapes of the effective potentials arising in the perturbation equations.</description>

      <title>A Step in Flux to Suppress Axion Isocurvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion in the pre-inflation scenario faces a stringent isocurvature constraint, which requires a relatively low Hubble scale during inflation. If the axion was heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, its isocurvature is suppressed and the constraint disappears. We point out a novel mechanism for achieving this, relying on the topological nature of a BF-type (monodromy) mass for the axion. Such a mass term has an integer coefficient, so it could naturally have been very large during inflation and exactly zero by the time of the QCD phase transition. This integer can be viewed as a quantized flux, which is discharged in a first-order phase transition that proceeds by the nucleation of charged branes. This mechanism can be embedded in cosmology in several different ways, with tunneling during, at the end of, or after inflation. We provide a detailed case study of the scenario in which the tunneling event occurs during inflation. We also comment briefly on possible UV completions within extra-dimensional gauge theories and string theory. Intriguingly, the phase transition could be accompanied by the emergence of the chiral Standard Model field content from a non-chiral theory during inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guided by symmetry principles, we construct an effective field theory that captures the long-wavelength dynamics of two-dimensional vortex crystals observed in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a harmonic potential. By embedding the system into Newton--Cartan spacetime and analyzing its isometries, we identify the appropriate spacetime symmetry group for trapped condensates at finite angular momentum. After introducing a coarse-grained description of the vortex lattice we consider a homogeneous equilibrium configuration and discuss the associated symmetry breaking pattern. We apply the coset construction method to identify covariant structures that enter the effective action and discuss the physical interpretation of the inverse Higgs constraints. We verify that Kohn's theorem is satisfied within our construction and subsequently focus on the gapless sector of the theory. In this regime, the effective theory accommodates a single gapless excitation--the Tkachenko mode--for which we construct both the leading-order and next-to-leading-order actions, the latter including cubic interaction terms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design a lattice model of a non-compact U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions with a flavor chemical potential and solve it with large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations. For zero flavor chemical potential, the model realizes three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED3) which has been argued to describe the ground state and low-energy excitations of the Dirac spin liquid phase of quantum antiferromagnets. At finite flavor chemical potential, corresponding to a Zeeman field perturbing the Dirac spin liquid, we find a "chiral flux" phase which is characterized by the generation of a finite mean emergent gauge flux and, accordingly, the formation of relativistic Landau levels for the Dirac fermions. In this state, the U(1)m magnetic symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to a gapless free photon mode which, due to spin-flux-attachment, is observable in the longitudinal spin structure factor. We numerically compute longitudinal and transverse spin structure factors which match our continuum and lattice mean-field theory predictions. In a different region of the phase diagram, strong fluctuations of the emergent gauge field give rise to an antiferromagnetically ordered state with gapped Dirac fermions coexisting with a deconfined gauge field. We also find an interesting intermediate phase where the chiral flux phase and the antiferromagnetic phase coexist. We argue that our results pave the way to testable predictions for magnetized Dirac spin liquids in frustrated quantum antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>The 3d mixed BF Lagrangian 1-form: a variational formulation of Hitchin's integrable system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of gauged Lagrangian $1$-forms, extending the notion of Lagrangian $1$-forms to the setting of gauge theories. This general formalism is applied to a natural geometric Lagrangian $1$-form on the cotangent bundle of the space of holomorphic structures on a smooth principal $G$-bundle $\mathcal{P}$ over a compact Riemann surface $C$ of arbitrary genus $g$, with or without marked points, in order to gauge the symmetry group of smooth bundle automorphisms of $\mathcal{P}$. The resulting construction yields a multiform version of the $3$d mixed BF action with so-called type A and B defects, providing a variational formulation of Hitchin's completely integrable system over $C$. By passing to holomorphic local trivialisations and going partially on-shell, we obtain a unifying action for a hierarchy of Lax equations describing the Hitchin system in terms of meromorphic Lax matrices. The cases of genus $0$ and $1$ with marked points are treated in greater detail, producing explicit Lagrangian $1$-forms for the rational Gaudin hierarchy and the elliptic Gaudin hierarchy, respectively, with the elliptic spin Calogero-Moser hierarchy arising as a special subcase.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on Galileon dark energy with broken shift symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current cosmological data seem to show that dark energy is evolving in time and that it possibly crossed the phantom divide in the past. So far the only theories that lead to such a behavior involve a non-trivial coupling between dark energy, in the form of a scalar field, and the gravitational or matter sector. We show that there is another possibility involving both a non-trivial kinetic sector in a cubic Galileon theory and a scalar field potential that breaks the Galileon shift symmetry, which can lead to a similar phenomenology on large scales. We perform a full Bayesian analysis using the latest cosmological data, including DESI DR2 BAO measurements, type Ia SNe measurements from DESY5, Union3, and Pantheon+, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that it is statistically strongly favored over a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant (with a Bayes factor of $\log B\simeq 6.5$). Yet, as with other non-minimally coupled theories, it has severe ancillary gravitational effects. These can be mitigated to some extent, but as with other viable theories, the penalty is ever more elaborate scalar field models of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Is our vacuum global in a 331 model with three triplets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a 331 model, based on $\beta=-1/\sqrt{3}$, with three $SU(3)$ triplets with a softly broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The resulting scalar potential is commonly used in phenomenology. We systematically determine all the potential minima and obtain the conditions under which the electroweak vacuum is global with the help of orbit space methods. For the case the electroweak vacuum is not global, we calculate bounds on the scalar couplings from metastability. We find a parametrisation of the potential couplings in terms of physical quantities and use it to show the available parameter space.</description>

      <title>Backreactions from loading the stable photon sphere in Weyl conformal gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the accumulation of null matter at the stable photon sphere in the Mannheim-Kazanas metric, the analogue to the Schwarzschild solution in Weyl's conformal theory of gravity. In our toy problem in which we consider an infinitely-thin shell, we find that a jump in radial pressure ${T^r}_r$ is induced across the shell unless the shell has a radius of either the unstable or stable photon sphere radii. We then find that upon loading the stable photon sphere, its area remains invariant. Furthermore, at a critical threshold loading limit for this zero-width null matter shell, we are able to produce a metric containing an extremal horizon with an AdS$_2\times$S$^2$ geometry completely independent of the cosmological curvature. This hitherto unencountered and therefore unexpected result is a phenomenon unseen in standard nonconformal second-order metrics with nonzero cosmological constants.</description>

      <title>Topological BF Theory construction of twisted dihedral quantum double phases from spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonabelian topological orders host exotic anyons central to quantum computing, yet established realizations rely on case-by-case constructions that are often conceptually involved. In this work, we present a systematic construction of nonabelian dihedral quantum double phases based on a continuous $O(2)$ gauge field. We first formulate a topological $S[O(2)\times O(2)]$ BF theory, and by identifying the Wilson loops and twist operators of this theory with anyons, we show that our topological BF theory reproduces the complete anyon data, and can incorporate all Dijkgraaf--Witten twists. Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further suggests a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry. Our proposal offers an alternative route to nonabelian topological order with promising prospects in synthetic gauge field platforms.</description>

      <title>Transversal Clifford-Hierarchy Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an entirely 2D transversal realization of phase gates at any level of the Clifford hierarchy, and beyond, using non-Abelian surface codes. Our construction encodes a logical qubit in the quantum double $D(G)$ of a non-Abelian group $G$ on a triangular spatial patch. The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--K\"onig theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this limitation, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \mathrm{diag}(1, e^{i\pi/(4N)})$ in the logical $\overline{Z}$ basis. In this context we propose a non-abelian stabilizer group formalism, which we work out for dihedral groups. For $8N = 2^n$, the logical gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice. We also discuss code-switching to the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface-codes, which can be utilized for the quantum error correction in this setup.</description>

Abstract: The Kerr-Schild gauge is generalized to the case that the vector generating the deformation is not null. Contrary to naive expectations, this vector generates a finite expansion for the curvature tensor. We prove a theorem
  on the conditions for the deformed metric being Ricci flat, namely that the deformation vector must be geodesic of the background spacetime.</description>

      <title>Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23962v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P. W. Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations:
  (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and
  (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)).
  These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</description>

      <title>Total Gluon Helicity Contribution to the Proton Spin from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation of the total gluon helicity contribution to the proton spin, $\Delta G$. The calculation is done on ensembles with three different lattice spacings $a=\{0.08, 0.09, 0.11\}$ fm. By employing distillation and momentum smearing for proton external states, we extract the bare matrix elements of the topological current $K^\mu$ using 5-HYP smeared Coulomb gauge fixing configurations. Furthermore, we apply a non-perturbative $\mathrm{RI/MOM}$ renormalization scheme augmented by the Cluster Decomposition Error Reduction (CDER) technique to determine the renormalization constants of $K^\mu$. The results obtained from different components $K^{t,i}$ (with $i$ being the direction of proton momentum or polarization) are consistent with Lorentz covariance within uncertainties. After extrapolating to the continuum limit, $\Delta G$ is found to be $\Delta G = 0.231(17)^{\mathrm{sta.}}(44)^{\mathrm{sym.}}$ at the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scale ${\mu}^2=10\ \mathrm{GeV}^2$, which constitutes approximately $46(9)\%$ of the proton spin.</description>
