      <title>Implicit representations via the polynomial method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semialgebraic graphs are graphs whose vertices are points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and adjacency between two vertices is determined by the truth value of a semialgebraic predicate of constant complexity. We show how to harness polynomial partitioning methods to construct compact adjacency labeling schemes for families of semialgebraic graphs.
  That is, we show that for any family of semialgebraic graphs, given a graph on $n$ vertices in this family, we can assign a label consisting of $O(n^{1-2/(d+1) + \varepsilon})$ bits to each vertex (where $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ can be made arbitrarily small and the constant of proportionality depends on $\varepsilon$ and on the complexity of the adjacency-defining predicate), such that adjacency between two vertices can be determined solely from their two labels, without any additional information. We obtain for instance that unit disk graphs and segment intersection graphs have such labelings with labels of $O(n^{1/3 + \varepsilon})$ bits. This is in contrast to their natural implicit representation consisting of the coordinates of the disk centers or segment endpoints, which sometimes require exponentially many bits. It also improves on the best known bound of $O(n^{1-1/d}\log n)$ for $d$-dimensional semialgebraic families due to Alon (Discrete Comput. Geom., 2024), a bound that holds more generally for graphs with shattering functions bounded by a degree-$d$ polynomial.
  We also give new bounds on the size of adjacency labels for other families of graphs. In particular, we consider semilinear graphs, which are semialgebraic graphs in which the predicate only involves linear polynomials. We show that semilinear graphs have adjacency labels of size $O(\log n)$. We also prove that polygon visibility graphs, which are not semialgebraic in the above sense, have adjacency labels of size $O(\log^3 n)$.</description>

      <title>Splitting Sandwiches Unevenly via Unique Sink Orientations and Rainbow Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The famous Ham-Sandwich theorem states that any $d$ point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be simultaneously bisected by a single hyperplane. The $\alpha$-Ham-Sandwich theorem gives a sufficient condition for the existence of biased cuts, i.e., hyperplanes that do not cut off half but some prescribed fraction of each point set. We give two new proofs for this theorem. The first proof is completely combinatorial and highlights a strong connection between the $\alpha$-Ham-Sandwich theorem and Unique Sink Orientations of grids. The second proof uses point-hyperplane duality and the Poincar\'e-Miranda theorem and allows us to generalize the result to and beyond oriented matroids. For this we introduce a new concept of rainbow arrangements, generalizing colored pseudo-hyperplane arrangements. Along the way, we also show that the realizability problem for rainbow arrangements is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete, which also implies that the realizability problem for grid Unique Sink Orientations is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete.</description>

      <title>An open-source heuristic to reboot 2D nesting research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 2D nesting problems rank among the most challenging cutting and packing problems. Yet, despite their practical relevance, research over the past decade has seen remarkably little progress. One reasonable explanation could be that nesting problems are already solved to near optimality, leaving little room for improvement. However, as our paper demonstrates, we are not at the limit after all. This paper presents $\texttt{sparrow}$, an open-source heuristic approach to solving 2D irregular strip packing problems, along with ten new real-world instances for benchmarking. Our approach decomposes the optimization problem into a sequence of feasibility problems, where collisions between items are gradually resolved. $\texttt{sparrow}$ consistently outperforms the state of the art - in some cases by an unexpectedly wide margin. We are therefore convinced that the aforementioned stagnation is better explained by both a high barrier to entry and a widespread lack of reproducibility. By releasing $\texttt{sparrow}$'s source code, we directly address both issues. At the same time, we are confident there remains significant room for further algorithmic improvement. The ultimate aim of this paper is not only to take a single step forward, but to reboot the research culture in the domain and enable continued, reproducible progress.</description>
