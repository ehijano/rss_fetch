      <title>pathfinder: A Semantic Framework for Literature Review and Knowledge Discovery in Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of astronomical literature poses significant challenges for researchers navigating and synthesizing general insights or even domain-specific knowledge. We present Pathfinder, a machine learning framework designed to enable literature review and knowledge discovery in astronomy, focusing on semantic searching with natural language instead of syntactic searches with keywords. Utilizing state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and a corpus of 350,000 peer-reviewed papers from the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), Pathfinder offers an innovative approach to scientific inquiry and literature exploration. Our framework couples advanced retrieval techniques with LLM-based synthesis to search astronomical literature by semantic context as a complement to currently existing methods that use keywords or citation graphs. It addresses complexities of jargon, named entities, and temporal aspects through time-based and citation-based weighting schemes. We demonstrate the tool's versatility through case studies, showcasing its application in various research scenarios. The system's performance is evaluated using custom benchmarks, including single-paper and multi-paper tasks. Beyond literature review, Pathfinder offers unique capabilities for reformatting answers in ways that are accessible to various audiences (e.g. in a different language or as simplified text), visualizing research landscapes, and tracking the impact of observatories and methodologies. This tool represents a significant advancement in applying AI to astronomical research, aiding researchers at all career stages in navigating modern astronomy literature.</description>

      <title>SuperBIT Superpressure Flight Instrument Overview and Performance: Near diffraction-limited Astronomical Imaging from the Stratosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SuperBIT was a 0.5-meter near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wide-field telescope that launched on a NASA superpressure balloon into the stratosphere from New Zealand for a 45-night flight. SuperBIT acquired multi-band images of galaxy clusters to study the properties of dark matter using weak gravitational lensing. We provide an overview of the instrument and its various subsystems. We then present the instrument performance from the flight, including the telescope and image stabilization system, the optical system, the power system, and the thermal system. SuperBIT successfully met the instrument's technical requirements, achieving a telescope pointing stability of 0.34 +/- 0.10 arcseconds, a focal plane image stability of 0.055 +/- 0.027 arcseconds, and a PSF FWHM of ~ 0.35 arcseconds over 5-minute exposures throughout the 45-night flight. The telescope achieved a near-diffraction limited point-spread function in all three science bands (u, b, and g). SuperBIT served as a pathfinder to the GigaBIT observatory, which will be a 1.34-meter near-ultraviolet to near-infrared balloon-borne telescope.</description>

      <title>GALI -- A GAmma-ray burst Localizing Instrument: Results from Full Size Engineering Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a full-size engineering model of GALI - The GAmma-ray burst Localizing Instrument, composed of 362 CsI(Tl) small cubic scintillators, distributed within a small volume of $\sim2$l, and read out by silicon photo-multipliers. GALI can provide directional information about GRBs with high angular accuracy from angle-dependent mutual obstruction between its scintillators. Here, we demonstrate GALI's laboratory experiments with an $^{241}$Am source, which achieved directional reconstruction of $&lt;$3$^\circ$ accuracy, in agreement with our Monte-Carlo simulations. GALI has a wide field view of the unobstructed sky. With its current cubic configuration, GALI's effective area varies between 97 cm$^2$ (face on) and 138 cm$^2$ (from the corners at 45$^\circ$), which is verified in the current experiment.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of energy and arrival directions of UHECRs registered by fluorescence telescopes with a neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence telescopes are important instruments widely used in modern experiments for registering ultraviolet radiation from extensive air showers (EASs) generated by cosmic rays of ultra-high energies. We present a proof-of-concept convolutional neural network aimed at reconstruction of energy and arrival directions of primary particles using model data for two telescopes developed by the international JEM-EUSO collaboration. We also demonstrate how a simple convolutional encoder-decoder can be used for EAS track recognition. The approach is generic and can be adopted for other fluorescence telescopes.</description>

      <title>Accelerated signal-to-noise ratio interpolation across the gravitational-wave signal manifold powered by artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matched-filter based gravitational-wave search pipelines identify candidate events within seconds of their arrival on Earth, offering a chance to guide electromagnetic follow-up and observe multi-messenger events. Understanding the detectors' response to an astrophysical signal across the searched signal manifold is paramount to inferring the parameters of the progenitor and deciding which candidates warrant telescope time. In this paper, we use artificial neural networks to accelerate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) computation for sufficiently local patches of the signal manifold. Our machine-learning based model generates a single waveform (or equivalently, computes a single SNR timeseries) in 6 milliseconds on a CPU and 0.4 milliseconds on a GPU. When we use the GPU to generate batches of waveforms simultaneously, we find that we can produce $10^4$ waveforms in $\lesssim 1$ ms on a GPU. This is achieved while remaining faithful, on average, to 1 part in $10^4$ (1 part in $10^5$) for binary black hole (binary neutron star) waveforms. The model we present is designed to directly utilize intermediate detection pipeline outputs, and is a step towards ultra-low-latency parameter estimation within search pipelines.</description>

      <title>Magnets are Weber Bar Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a gravitational wave (GW) passes through a DC magnetic field, it couples to the conducting wires carrying the currents which generate the magnetic field, causing them to oscillate at the GW frequency. The oscillating currents then generate an AC component through which the GW can be detected - thus forming a resonant mass detector or a Magnetic Weber Bar. We quantify this claim and demonstrate that magnets can have exceptional sensitivity to GWs over a frequency range demarcated by the mechanical and electromagnetic resonant frequencies of the system; indeed, we outline why a magnetic readout strategy can be considered an optimal Weber bar design. The concept is applicable to a broad class of magnets, but can be particularly well exploited by the powerful magnets being deployed in search of axion dark matter, for example by DMRadio and ADMX-EFR. Explicitly, we demonstrate that the MRI magnet that is being deployed for ADMX-EFR can achieve a broadband GW strain sensitivity of $\sim$$10^{-20}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ from a few kHz to about 10 MHz, with a peak sensitivity down to $\sim$$10^{-22}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at a kHz exploiting a mechanical resonance.</description>

      <title>Inflight Performance and Calibrations of the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope on board the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) on board the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) is the first payload to image the full solar disk and the solar corona in both white-light (WL) and ultraviolet (UV) H I Lya, extending up to 2.5 solar radii (Rs). Since the launch of the ASO-S on 9 October 2022, LST has captured various significant solar activities including flares, prominences, coronal mass ejections (CMEs). LST covers different passbands of 121.6 nm, 360 nm and 700 nm. The Lya Solar Disk Imager (SDI) has a field of view (FOV) of 38.4 arcmin and a spatial resolution of around 9.5 arcsec, while the White-Light Solar Telescope (WST) has a FOV of 38.43 arcmin and a spatial resolution of around 3.0 arcsec. The FOV of the Lya Solar Corona Imager (SCI) reaches 81.1 arcmin and its spatial resolution is 4.3 arcsec. The stray-light level in the 700 nm waveband is about 7.8e-6 MSB (mean solar brightness) at 1.1 Rs and 7.6e-7 MSB at 2.5 Rs, and in the Lya waveband it is around 4.3e-3 MSB at 1.1 Rs and 4.1e-4 MSB at 2.5 Rs. This article will detail the results from on-orbit tests and calibrations.</description>

      <title>The Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transient incoherent-sum survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With wide-field phased array feed technology, the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) is ideally suited to search for seemingly rare radio transient sources. The Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transient (CRAFT) Survey Science Project has developed instrumentation to continuously search for fast radio transients (duration $\lesssim$ 1 second) with ASKAP, with a particular focus on finding and localising Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Of particular interest are Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Since 2018, the CRAFT survey has been searching for FRBs and other fast transients by incoherently adding the intensities received by individual ASKAP antennas, and then correcting for the impact of frequency dispersion on these short-duration signals in the resultant incoherent sum (ICS) in real-time. This low-latency detection enables the triggering of voltage buffers, which facilitates the localisation of the transient source and the study spectro-polarimetric properties at high time resolution. Here we report the sample of 43 FRBs discovered in this CRAFT/ICS survey to date. This includes 22 FRBs that had not previously been reported: 16 FRBs localised by ASKAP to $\lesssim$ 1 arcsec and 6 FRBs localised to approximately 10 arcmin. Of the new arcsecond-localised FRBs, we have identified and characterised host galaxies (and measured redshifts) for 11. The median of all 30 measured host redshifts from the survey to date is z = 0.23. We summarise results from the searches, in particular those contributing to our understanding of the burst progenitors and emission mechanisms, and on the use of bursts as probes of intervening media. We conclude by foreshadowing future FRB surveys with ASKAP using a coherent detection system that is currently being commissioned.</description>

      <title>First search for dark photon dark matter with a MADMAX prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first result from a dark photon dark matter search in the mass range from ${78.62}$ to $83.95~\mathrm{\mu eV}/c^2$ with a dielectric haloscope prototype for MADMAX (Magnetized Disc and Mirror Axion eXperiment). Putative dark photons would convert to observable photons within a stack consisting of three sapphire disks and a mirror. The emitted power of this system is received by an antenna and successively digitized using a low-noise receiver. No dark photon signal has been observed. Assuming unpolarized dark photon dark matter with a local density of $\rho_{\chi}=0.3~\mathrm{GeV/cm^3}$ we exclude a dark photon to photon mixing parameter $\chi &gt; 3.0 \times 10^{-12}$ over the full mass range and $\chi &gt; 1.2 \times 10^{-13}$ at a mass of $80.57~\mathrm{\mu eV}/c^2$ with a 95\% confidence level. This is the first physics result from a MADMAX prototype and exceeds previous constraints on $\chi$ in this mass range by up to almost three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>On Interstellar Quantum Communication and the Fermi Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since it began \cite{CocconiMorrison}, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) has focused on interstellar \emph{classical} communication. Recently, Berera \cite{Berera:2020rpl} pointed out that, at certain frequencies, photon qubits can retain their quantum coherence over interstellar (and even intergalactic) distances, raising the prospect of interstellar \emph{quantum} communication. This is an intriguing possibility, since quantum communication permits certain tasks that would be impossible with classical communication, and allow exponential speed-ups for others. (We suggest some motivations in the interstellar context.) But quantum coherence alone is not sufficient for quantum communication: here, for the first time, we analyze the \emph{quantum capacity} $Q$ of an interstellar channel. We point out that, to have non-zero quantum capacity $Q&gt;0$, interstellar communication over a distance $L$ must use wavelengths $\lambda &lt; 26.5\,cm$ (to avoid depolarization by the cosmic microwave background), and \emph{enormous} telescopes of effective diameter $D&gt;0.78\sqrt{\lambda L}$ (to satisfy quantum erasure constraints). For example, for two telescopes of diameter $D$ on Earth and Proxima Centauri, this implies $D&gt;100\,km$! This is a technological threshold that remains to be crossed in order for reliable one-way quantum communication to become possible, and suggests a fundamental new resolution of the Fermi paradox.</description>

      <title>Operational range bounding of spectroscopy models with anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe operation of machine learning models requires architectures that explicitly delimit their operational ranges. We evaluate the ability of anomaly detection algorithms to provide indicators correlated with degraded model performance. By placing acceptance thresholds over such indicators, hard boundaries are formed that define the model's coverage. As a use case, we consider the extraction of exoplanetary spectra from transit light curves, specifically within the context of ESA's upcoming Ariel mission. Isolation Forests are shown to effectively identify contexts where prediction models are likely to fail. Coverage/error trade-offs are evaluated under conditions of data and concept drift. The best performance is seen when Isolation Forests model projections of the prediction model's explainability SHAP values.</description>

      <title>Tunable 30 GHz laser frequency comb for astronomical spectrograph characterization and calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for earth-like exoplanets with the Doppler radial velocity technique is an extremely challenging and multifaceted precision spectroscopy problem. Currently, one of the limiting instrumental factors in reaching the required long-term $10^{-10}$ level of radial velocity precision is the defect-driven sub-pixel quantum efficiency variations in the large-format detector arrays used by precision echelle spectrographs. Tunable frequency comb calibration sources that can fully map the point spread function across a spectrograph's entire bandwidth are necessary for quantifying and correcting these detector artifacts. In this work, we demonstrate a combination of laser frequency and mode spacing control that allows full and deterministic tunability of a 30 GHz electro-optic comb together with its filter cavity. After supercontinuum generation, this gives access to any optical frequency across 700 - 1300 nm. Our specific implementation is intended for the comb deployed at the Habitable Zone Planet Finder spectrograph and its near-infrared Hawaii-2RG array, but the techniques apply to all laser frequency combs used for precision astronomical spectrograph calibration and other applications that require broadband tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic ray muons prove valuable across various fields, from particle physics experiments to non-invasive tomography, thanks to their high flux and exceptional penetrating capability. Utilizing a scintillator detector, one can effectively study the topography of mountains situated above tunnels and underground spaces. The Hankuk Atmospheric-muon Wide Landscaping (HAWL) project successfully charts the mountainous region of eastern Korea by measuring cosmic ray muons with a detector in motion. The real-time muon flux measurement shows a tunnel length accuracy of 6.0 %, with a detectable overburden range spanning from 8 to 400 meter-water-equivalent depth.

      <title>Fast marginalization algorithm for optimizing gravitational wave detection, parameter estimation and sky localization</title>

Abstract: We introduce an algorithm to marginalize the likelihood for a gravitational wave signal from a quasi-circular binary merger over its extrinsic parameters, accounting for the effects of higher harmonics and spin-induced precession. The algorithm takes as input the matched-filtering time series of individual waveform harmonics against the data in all operational detectors, and the covariances of the harmonics. The outputs are the Gaussian likelihood marginalized over extrinsic parameters describing the merger time, location and orientation, along with samples from the conditional posterior of these parameters. Our algorithm exploits the waveform's known analytical dependence on extrinsic parameters to efficiently marginalize over them using a single waveform evaluation. Our current implementation achieves a 10% precision on the marginalized likelihood within $\approx 50$ ms on a single CPU core and is publicly available through the package `cogwheel`. We discuss applications of this tool for gravitational wave searches involving higher modes or precession, efficient and robust parameter estimation, and generation of sky localization maps in low latency for electromagnetic followup of gravitational-wave alerts. The inclusion of higher modes can improve the distance measurement, providing an advantage over existing low-latency localization methods.</description>

      <title>Performance testing of a novel short axis photomultiplier tube for the HUNT project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) with large-area cathodes are increasingly being used in cosmic-ray experiments to enhance detection efficiency. The optical modules (OMs) of the High-Energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT) have employed a brand new N6205 20-inch microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT) developed by the North Night Vision Science &amp; Technology (Nanjing) Research Institute Co. Ltd. (NNVT). In order to make the 20-inch PMT fit into the 23-inch diameter pressure-resistant glass sphere, NNVT improved the internal structure of PMT and shortened the height of PMT by more than 10~cm. The first batch of these PMTs has been delivered for preliminary research work. This paper describes a specific PMT testing platform built for the first batch of 15 MCP-PMTs, and some performance parameters of PMT, such as peak-to-valley ratio, TTS and nonliniearity, are measured. The measurement results show that the new PMT still has good performance and can meet the requirements of HUNT project.</description>
