      <title>Knowledge Graph Enrichment and Reasoning for Nobel Laureates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project aims to construct and analyze a comprehensive knowledge graph of Nobel Prize and Laureates by enriching existing datasets with biographical information extracted from Wikipedia. Our approach integrates multiple advanced techniques, consisting of automatic data augmentation using LLMs for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) tasks, and social network analysis to uncover hidden patterns within the scientific community. Furthermore, we also develop a GraphRAG-based chatbot system utilizing a fine-tuned model for Text2Cypher translation, enabling natural language querying over the knowledge graph. Experimental results demonstrate that the enriched graph possesses small-world network properties, identifying key influential figures and central organizations. The chatbot system achieves a competitive accuracy on a custom multiple-choice evaluation dataset, proving the effectiveness of combining LLMs with structured knowledge bases for complex reasoning tasks. Data and source code are available at: https://github.com/tlam25/network-of-awards-and-winners.</description>

      <title>Interpretation as Linear Transformation: A Cognitive-Geometric Model of Belief and Meaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a geometric framework for modeling belief, motivation, and influence across cognitively heterogeneous agents. Each agent is represented by a personalized value space, a vector space encoding the internal dimensions through which the agent interprets and evaluates meaning. Beliefs are formalized as structured vectors-abstract beings-whose transmission is mediated by linear interpretation maps. A belief survives communication only if it avoids the null spaces of these maps, yielding a structural criterion for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death.
  Within this framework, I show how belief distortion, motivational drift, counterfactual evaluation, and the limits of mutual understanding arise from purely algebraic constraints. A central result-"the No-Null-Space Leadership Condition"-characterizes leadership as a property of representational reachability rather than persuasion or authority. More broadly, the model explains how abstract beings can propagate, mutate, or disappear as they traverse diverse cognitive geometries.
  The account unifies insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment by grounding meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality. I argue that this cognitive-geometric perspective clarifies the epistemic boundaries of influence in both human and artificial systems, and offers a general foundation for analyzing belief dynamics across heterogeneous agents.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Machine Learning to Identify Gendered Stereotypes and Body Image Concerns on Diet and Fitness Online Forums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pervasive expectations about ideal body types in Western society can lead to body image concerns, dissatisfaction, and in extreme cases, eating disorders and other psychopathologies related to body image. While previous research has focused on online pro-anorexia communities glorifying the "thin ideal," less attention has been given to the broader spectrum of body image concerns or how emerging disorders like muscle dysmorphia ("bigorexia") present on online platforms. To address this gap, we analyze 46 Reddit forums related to diet, fitness, and mental health. We map these communities along gender and body ideal dimensions, revealing distinct patterns of emotional expression and community support. Feminine-oriented communities, especially those endorsing the thin ideal, express higher levels of negative emotions and receive caring comments in response. In contrast, muscular ideal communities display less negativity, regardless of gender orientation, but receive aggressive compliments in response, marked by admiration and toxicity. Mental health discussions align more with thin ideal, feminine-leaning spaces. By uncovering these gendered emotional dynamics, our findings can inform the development of moderation strategies that foster supportive interactions while reducing exposure to harmful content.</description>

      <title>ProbeWalk: Fast Estimation of Biharmonic Distance on Graphs via Probe-Driven Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The biharmonic distance is a fundamental metric on graphs that measures the dissimilarity between two nodes, capturing both local and global structures. It has found applications across various fields, including network centrality, graph clustering, and machine learning. These applications typically require efficient evaluation of pairwise biharmonic distances. However, existing algorithms remain computationally expensive. The state-of-the-art method attains an absolute-error guarantee epsilon_abs with time complexity O(L^5 / epsilon_abs^2), where L denotes the truncation length. In this work, we improve the complexity to O(L^3 / epsilon^2) under a relative-error guarantee epsilon via probe-driven random walks. We provide a relative-error guarantee rather than an absolute-error guarantee because biharmonic distances vary by orders of magnitude across node pairs. Since L is often very large in real-world networks (for example, L &gt;= 10^3), reducing the L-dependence from the fifth to the third power yields substantial gains. Extensive experiments on real-world networks show that our method delivers 10x-1000x per-query speedups at matched relative error over strong baselines and scales to graphs with tens of millions of nodes.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Independence Breeds Disruption but Limits Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on scientific disruption, two questions remain: why disruption has declined amid growing knowledge, and why disruptive work receives fewer and delayed citations. One way to address these questions is to identify an intrinsic, paper-level property that reliably predicts disruption and explains both patterns. Here, we propose a novel measure, knowledge independence, capturing the extent to which a paper draws on references that do not cite one another. Analyzing 114 million publications, we find that knowledge independence strongly predicts disruption and mediates the disruptive advantage of small, onsite, and fresh teams. Its long-term decline, nonreproducible by null models, provides a mechanistic explanation for the parallel decline in disruption. Causal and simulation evidence further indicates that knowledge independence drives the persistent trade-off between disruption and impact. Taken together, these findings fill a critical gap in understanding scientific innovation, revealing a universal law: Knowledge independence breeds disruption but limits recognition.</description>
