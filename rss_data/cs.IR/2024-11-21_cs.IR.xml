      <title>Advancing Large Language Models for Spatiotemporal and Semantic Association Mining of Similar Environmental Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval and recommendation are two essential tasks in modern search tools. This paper introduces a novel retrieval-reranking framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the spatiotemporal and semantic associated mining and recommendation of relevant unusual climate and environmental events described in news articles and web posts. This framework uses advanced natural language processing techniques to address the limitations of traditional manual curation methods in terms of high labor cost and lack of scalability. Specifically, we explore an optimized solution to employ cutting-edge embedding models for semantically analyzing spatiotemporal events (news) and propose a Geo-Time Re-ranking (GT-R) strategy that integrates multi-faceted criteria including spatial proximity, temporal association, semantic similarity, and category-instructed similarity to rank and identify similar spatiotemporal events. We apply the proposed framework to a dataset of four thousand Local Environmental Observer (LEO) Network events, achieving top performance in recommending similar events among multiple cutting-edge dense retrieval models. The search and recommendation pipeline can be applied to a wide range of similar data search tasks dealing with geospatial and temporal data. We hope that by linking relevant events, we can better aid the general public to gain an enhanced understanding of climate change and its impact on different communities.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Text Retrieval Models on DaReCzech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive evaluation of 7 off-the-shelf document retrieval models: Splade, Plaid, Plaid-X, SimCSE, Contriever, OpenAI ADA and Gemma2 chosen to determine their performance on the Czech retrieval dataset DaReCzech. The primary objective of our experiments is to estimate the quality of modern retrieval approaches in the Czech language. Our analyses include retrieval quality, speed, and memory footprint. Secondly, we analyze whether it is better to use the model directly in Czech text, or to use machine translation into English, followed by retrieval in English. Our experiments identify the most effective option for Czech information retrieval. The findings revealed notable performance differences among the models, with Gemma22 achieving the highest precision and recall, while Contriever performing poorly. Conclusively, SPLADE and PLAID models offered a balance of efficiency and performance.</description>

      <title>Data Watermarking for Sequential Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of large foundation models, data has become a crucial component for building high-performance AI systems. As the demand for high-quality and large-scale data continues to rise, data copyright protection is attracting increasing attention. In this work, we explore the problem of data watermarking for sequential recommender systems, where a watermark is embedded into the target dataset and can be detected in models trained on that dataset. We address two specific challenges: dataset watermarking, which protects the ownership of the entire dataset, and user watermarking, which safeguards the data of individual users. We systematically define these problems and present a method named DWRS to address them. Our approach involves randomly selecting unpopular items to create a watermark sequence, which is then inserted into normal users' interaction sequences. Extensive experiments on five representative sequential recommendation models and three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DWRS in protecting data copyright while preserving model utility.</description>

      <title>Explainable LLM-driven Multi-dimensional Distillation for E-Commerce Relevance Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective query-item relevance modeling is pivotal for enhancing user experience and safeguarding user satisfaction in e-commerce search systems. Recently, benefiting from the vast inherent knowledge, Large Language Model (LLM) approach demonstrates strong performance and long-tail generalization ability compared with previous neural-based specialized relevance learning methods. Though promising, current LLM-based methods encounter the following inadequacies in practice: First, the massive parameters and computational demands make it difficult to be deployed online. Second, distilling LLM models to online models is a feasible direction, but the LLM relevance modeling is a black box, and its rich intrinsic knowledge is difficult to extract and apply online. To improve the interpretability of LLM and boost the performance of online relevance models via LLM, we propose an Explainable LLM-driven Multi-dimensional Distillation framework for e-commerce relevance learning, which comprises two core components: (1) An Explainable LLM for relevance modeling (ELLM-rele), which decomposes the relevance learning into intermediate steps and models relevance learning as a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, thereby enhancing both interpretability and performance of LLM. (2) A Multi-dimensional Knowledge Distillation (MKD) architecture that transfers the knowledge of ELLM-rele to current deployable interaction-based and representation-based student models from both the relevance score distribution and CoT reasoning aspects. Through distilling the probabilistic and CoT reasoning knowledge, MKD improves both the semantic interaction and long-tail generalization abilities of student models. Extensive offline evaluations and online experiments on Taobao search ad scene demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances e-commerce relevance learning performance and user experience.</description>

      <title>On-device Content-based Recommendation with Single-shot Embedding Pruning: A Cooperative Game Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Content-based Recommender Systems (CRSs) play a crucial role in shaping user experiences in e-commerce, online advertising, and personalized recommendations. However, due to the vast amount of categorical features, the embedding tables used in CRS models pose a significant storage bottleneck for real-world deployment, especially on resource-constrained devices. To address this problem, various embedding pruning methods have been proposed, but most existing ones require expensive retraining steps for each target parameter budget, leading to enormous computation costs. In reality, this computation cost is a major hurdle in real-world applications with diverse storage requirements, such as federated learning and streaming settings. In this paper, we propose Shapley Value-guided Embedding Reduction (Shaver) as our response. With Shaver, we view the problem from a cooperative game perspective, and quantify each embedding parameter's contribution with Shapley values to facilitate contribution-based parameter pruning. To address the inherently high computation costs of Shapley values, we propose an efficient and unbiased method to estimate Shapley values of a CRS's embedding parameters. Moreover, in the pruning stage, we put forward a field-aware codebook to mitigate the information loss in the traditional zero-out treatment. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, Shaver has demonstrated competitive performance with lightweight recommendation models across various parameter budgets.

      <title>Branches, Assemble! Multi-Branch Cooperation Network for Large-Scale Click-Through Rate Prediction at Taobao</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing click-through rate (CTR) prediction works have studied the role of feature interaction through a variety of techniques. Each interaction technique exhibits its own strength, and solely using one type could constrain the model's capability to capture the complex feature relationships, especially for industrial large-scale data with enormous users and items. Recent research shows that effective CTR models often combine an MLP network with a dedicated feature interaction network in a two-parallel structure. However, the interplay and cooperative dynamics between different streams or branches remain under-researched. In this work, we introduce a novel Multi-Branch Cooperation Network (MBCnet) which enables multiple branch networks to collaborate with each other for better complex feature interaction modeling. Specifically, MBCnet consists of three branches: the Expert-based Feature Grouping and Crossing (EFGC) branch that promotes the model's memorization ability of specific feature fields, the low rank Cross Net branch and Deep branch to enhance both explicit and implicit feature crossing for improved generalization. Among branches, a novel cooperation scheme is proposed based on two principles: branch co-teaching and moderate differentiation. Branch co-teaching encourages well-learned branches to support poorly-learned ones on specific training samples. Moderate differentiation advocates branches to maintain a reasonable level of difference in their feature representations. The cooperation strategy improves learning through mutual knowledge sharing via co-teaching and boosts the discovery of diverse feature interactions across branches. Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets and online A/B test demonstrate MBCnet's superior performance, delivering a 0.09 point increase in CTR, 1.49% growth in deals, and 1.62% rise in GMV. Core codes will be released soon.</description>

      <title>DMQR-RAG: Diverse Multi-Query Rewriting for RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models often encounter challenges with static knowledge and hallucinations, which undermine their reliability. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by incorporating external information. However, user queries frequently contain noise and intent deviations, necessitating query rewriting to improve the relevance of retrieved documents. In this paper, we introduce DMQR-RAG, a Diverse Multi-Query Rewriting framework designed to improve the performance of both document retrieval and final responses in RAG. Specifically, we investigate how queries with varying information quantities can retrieve a diverse array of documents, presenting four rewriting strategies that operate at different levels of information to enhance the performance of baseline approaches. Additionally, we propose an adaptive strategy selection method that minimizes the number of rewrites while optimizing overall performance. Our methods have been rigorously validated through extensive experiments conducted in both academic and industry settings.</description>

      <title>Writing Style Matters: An Examination of Bias and Fairness in Information Retrieval Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Language Model technologies has opened new opportunities, but also introduced new challenges related to bias and fairness. This paper explores the uncharted territory of potential biases in state-of-the-art universal text embedding models towards specific document and query writing styles within Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Our investigation reveals that different embedding models exhibit different preferences of document writing style, while more informal and emotive styles are less favored by most embedding models. In terms of query writing styles, many embedding models tend to match the style of the query with the style of the retrieved documents, but some show a consistent preference for specific styles. Text embedding models fine-tuned on synthetic data generated by LLMs display a consistent preference for certain style of generated data. These biases in text embedding based IR systems can inadvertently silence or marginalize certain communication styles, thereby posing a significant threat to fairness in information retrieval. Finally, we also compare the answer styles of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on different LLMs and find out that most text embedding models are biased towards LLM's answer styles when used as evaluation metrics for answer correctness. This study sheds light on the critical issue of writing style based bias in IR systems, offering valuable insights for the development of more fair and robust models.</description>

      <title>On the Statistical Significance with Relevance Assessments of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test collections are an integral part of Information Retrieval (IR) research. They allow researchers to evaluate and compare ranking algorithms in a quick, easy and reproducible way. However, constructing these datasets requires great efforts in manual labelling and logistics, and having only few human relevance judgements can introduce biases in the comparison. Recent research has explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for labelling the relevance of documents for building new retrieval test collections. Their strong text-understanding capabilities and low cost compared to human-made judgements makes them an appealing tool for gathering relevance judgements. Results suggest that LLM-generated labels are promising for IR evaluation in terms of ranking correlation, but nothing is said about the implications in terms of statistical significance. In this work, we look at how LLM-generated judgements preserve the same pairwise significance evaluation as human judgements. Our results show that LLM judgements detect most of the significant differences while maintaining acceptable numbers of false positives. However, we also show that some systems are treated differently under LLM-generated labels, suggesting that evaluation with LLM judgements might not be entirely fair. Our work represents a step forward in the evaluation of statistical testing results provided by LLM judgements. We hope that this will serve as a basis for other researchers to develop reliable models for automatic relevance assessments.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Online Advertisement Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling law is a notable property of neural network models and has significantly propelled the development of large language models. Scaling laws hold great promise in guiding model design and resource allocation. Recent research increasingly shows that scaling laws are not limited to NLP tasks or Transformer architectures; they also apply to domains such as recommendation. However, there is still a lack of literature on scaling law research in online advertisement retrieval systems. This may be because 1) identifying the scaling law for resource cost and online revenue is often expensive in both time and training resources for large-scale industrial applications, and 2) varying settings for different systems prevent the scaling law from being applied across various scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight paradigm to identify the scaling law of online revenue and machine cost for a certain online advertisement retrieval scenario with a low experimental cost. Specifically, we focus on a sole factor (FLOPs) and propose an offline metric named R/R* that exhibits a high linear correlation with online revenue for retrieval models. We estimate the machine cost offline via a simulation algorithm. Thus, we can transform most online experiments into low-cost offline experiments. We conduct comprehensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed metric R/R* and to identify the scaling law in the online advertisement retrieval system of Kuaishou. With the scaling law, we demonstrate practical applications for ROI-constrained model designing and multi-scenario resource allocation in Kuaishou advertising system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the scaling laws for online advertisement retrieval of real-world systems, showing great potential for scaling law in advertising system optimization.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Power of Large Language Models for Group POI Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendations aim to predict the next POI that satisfies the diverse preferences of a group of users. This task is more challenging than traditional individual POI recommendations due to complex group decision-making and extremely sparse group-level check-in data. Existing methods for group POI recommendations primarily rely on single ID-based features from check-in data, capturing only statistical correlations and failing to fully utilize the rich semantic information contained in the check-ins, resulting in suboptimal performance. To this end, we propose a framework that unleashes the power of the Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware group POI recommendations (LLMGPR). Our approach first introduces POI tokens alongside the original word tokens of the LLM, which are initialized by applying the LLM to the rich information of each POI. We then propose a novel sequencing adapter guided by Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLORA) to modify the LLM. The enhanced LLM can learn sequence representations by combining semantic-enhanced POI tokens and rich contextual information including positional encodings and spatio-temporal differences. This approach can be adapted for learning either group or user representations depending on the sequence type. Furthermore, we enhance group representations by aggregating individual member representations with another QLORA-based aggregation adapter and introducing a self-supervised learning task that predicts the purpose of check-in sequences, alleviating the data sparsity issue. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMGPR outperforms existing methods, effectively addressing group-level data sparsity and providing superior recommendations.</description>

      <title>FedCL-Ensemble Learning: A Framework of Federated Continual Learning with Ensemble Transfer Learning Enhanced for Alzheimer's MRI Classifications while Preserving Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research work introduces a novel approach to the classification of Alzheimer's disease by using the advanced deep learning techniques combined with secure data processing methods. This research work primary uses transfer learning models such as ResNet, ImageNet, and VNet to extract high-level features from medical image data. Thereafter, these pre-trained models were fine-tuned for Alzheimer's related subtle patterns such that the model is capable of robust feature extraction over varying data sources. Further, the federated learning approaches were incorporated to tackle a few other challenges related to classification, aimed to provide better prediction performance and protect data privacy. The proposed model was built using federated learning without sharing sensitive patient data. This way, the decentralized model benefits from the large and diversified dataset that it is trained upon while ensuring confidentiality. The cipher-based encryption mechanism is added that allows us to secure the transportation of data and further ensure the privacy and integrity of patient information throughout training and classification. The results of the experiments not only help to improve the accuracy of the classification of Alzheimer's but at the same time provides a framework for secure and collaborative analysis of health care data.</description>

      <title>SEFD: Semantic-Enhanced Framework for Detecting LLM-Generated Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) has created an urgent need for robust tools to detect LLM-generated text, especially in light of \textit{paraphrasing} techniques that often evade existing detection methods. To address this challenge, we present a novel semantic-enhanced framework for detecting LLM-generated text (SEFD) that leverages a retrieval-based mechanism to fully utilize text semantics. Our framework improves upon existing detection methods by systematically integrating retrieval-based techniques with traditional detectors, employing a carefully curated retrieval mechanism that strikes a balance between comprehensive coverage and computational efficiency. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach in sequential text scenarios common in real-world applications, such as online forums and Q\&amp;A platforms. Through comprehensive experiments across various LLM-generated texts and detection methods, we demonstrate that our framework substantially enhances detection accuracy in paraphrasing scenarios while maintaining robustness for standard LLM-generated content.</description>

Abstract: The rapid spread of rumors on social media has posed significant challenges to maintaining public trust and information integrity. Since an information cascade process is essentially a propagation tree, recent rumor detection models leverage graph neural networks to additionally capture information propagation patterns, thus outperforming text-only solutions. Given the variations in topics and social impact of the root node, different source information naturally has distinct outreach capabilities, resulting in different heights of propagation trees. This variation, however, impedes the data-driven design of existing graph-based rumor detectors. Given a shallow propagation tree with limited interactions, it is unlikely for graph-based approaches to capture sufficient cascading patterns, questioning their ability to handle less popular news or early detection needs. In contrast, a deep propagation tree is prone to noisy user responses, and this can in turn obfuscate the predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel Epidemiology-informed Network (EIN) that integrates epidemiological knowledge to enhance performance by overcoming data-driven methods sensitivity to data quality. Meanwhile, to adapt epidemiology theory to rumor detection, it is expected that each users stance toward the source information will be annotated. To bypass the costly and time-consuming human labeling process, we take advantage of large language models to generate stance labels, facilitating optimization objectives for learning epidemiology-informed representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EIN not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets but also exhibits enhanced robustness across varying tree depths.</description>

      <title>PatentEdits: Framing Patent Novelty as Textual Entailment</title>

Abstract: A patent must be deemed novel and non-obvious in order to be granted by the US Patent Office (USPTO). If it is not, a US patent examiner will cite the prior work, or prior art, that invalidates the novelty and issue a non-final rejection. Predicting what claims of the invention should change given the prior art is an essential and crucial step in securing invention rights, yet has not been studied before as a learnable task. In this work we introduce the PatentEdits dataset, which contains 105K examples of successful revisions that overcome objections to novelty. We design algorithms to label edits sentence by sentence, then establish how well these edits can be predicted with large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that evaluating textual entailment between cited references and draft sentences is especially effective in predicting which inventive claims remained unchanged or are novel in relation to prior art.</description>

      <title>Redefining Information Retrieval of Structured Database via Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Retrieval augmentation is critical when Language Models (LMs) exploit non-parametric knowledge related to the query through external knowledge bases before reasoning. The retrieved information is incorporated into LMs as context alongside the query, enhancing the reliability of responses towards factual questions. Prior researches in retrieval augmentation typically follow a retriever-generator paradigm. In this context, traditional retrievers encounter challenges in precisely and seamlessly extracting query-relevant information from knowledge bases. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel retrieval augmentation framework called ChatLR that primarily employs the powerful semantic understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) as retrievers to achieve precise and concise information retrieval. Additionally, we construct an LLM-based search and question answering system tailored for the financial domain by fine-tuning LLM on two tasks including Text2API and API-ID recognition. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ChatLR in addressing user queries, achieving an overall information retrieval accuracy exceeding 98.8\%.</description>

      <title>Crocodile: Cross Experts Covariance for Disentangled Learning in Multi-Domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12706</link>

Abstract: Multi-domain learning (MDL) has become a prominent topic in enhancing the quality of personalized services. It's critical to learn commonalities between domains and preserve the distinct characteristics of each domain. However, this leads to a challenging dilemma in MDL. On the one hand, a model needs to leverage domain-aware modules such as experts or embeddings to preserve each domain's distinctiveness. On the other hand, real-world datasets often exhibit long-tailed distributions across domains, where some domains may lack sufficient samples to effectively train their specific modules. Unfortunately, nearly all existing work falls short of resolving this dilemma. To this end, we propose a novel Cross-experts Covariance Loss for Disentangled Learning model (Crocodile), which employs multiple embedding tables to make the model domain-aware at the embeddings which consist most parameters in the model, and a covariance loss upon these embeddings to disentangle them, enabling the model to capture diverse user interests among domains. Empirical analysis demonstrates that our method successfully addresses both challenges and outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on public datasets. During online A/B testing in Tencent's advertising platform, Crocodile achieves 0.72% CTR lift and 0.73% GMV lift on a primary advertising scenario.</description>

      <title>Retrieval with Learned Similarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval plays a fundamental role in recommendation systems, search, and natural language processing (NLP) by efficiently finding relevant items from a large corpus given a query. Dot products have been widely used as the similarity function in such tasks, enabled by Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) algorithms for efficient retrieval. However, state-of-the-art retrieval algorithms have migrated to learned similarities. These advanced approaches encompass multiple query embeddings, complex neural networks, direct item ID decoding via beam search, and hybrid solutions. Unfortunately, we lack efficient solutions for retrieval in these state-of-the-art setups. Our work addresses this gap by investigating efficient retrieval techniques with expressive learned similarity functions. We establish Mixture-of-Logits (MoL) as a universal approximator of similarity functions, demonstrate that MoL's expressiveness can be realized empirically to achieve superior performance on diverse retrieval scenarios, and propose techniques to retrieve the approximate top-k results using MoL with tight error bounds. Through extensive experimentation, we show that MoL, enhanced by our proposed mutual information-based load balancing loss, sets new state-of-the-art results across heterogeneous scenarios, including sequential retrieval models in recommendation systems and finetuning language models for question answering; and our approximate top-$k$ algorithms outperform baselines by up to 66x in latency while achieving &gt;.99 recall rate compared to exact algorithms.</description>

      <title>Annotative Indexing</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces annotative indexing, a novel framework that unifies and generalizes traditional inverted indexes, column stores, object stores, and graph databases. As a result, annotative indexing can provide the underlying indexing framework for databases that support knowledge graphs, entity retrieval, semi-structured data, and ranked retrieval. While we primarily focus on human language data in the form of text, annotative indexing is sufficiently general to support a range of other datatypes, and we provide examples of SQL-like queries over a JSON store that includes numbers and dates. Taking advantage of the flexibility of annotative indexing, we also demonstrate a fully dynamic annotative index incorporating support for ACID properties of transactions with hundreds of multiple concurrent readers and writers.</description>

      <title>Neon: News Entity-Interaction Extraction for Enhanced Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capturing fresh information in near real-time and using it to augment existing large language models (LLMs) is essential to generate up-to-date, grounded, and reliable output. This problem becomes particularly challenging when LLMs are used for informational tasks in rapidly evolving fields, such as Web search related to recent or unfolding events involving entities, where generating temporally relevant responses requires access to up-to-the-hour news sources. However, the information modeled by the parametric memory of LLMs is often outdated, and Web results from prototypical retrieval systems may fail to capture the latest relevant information and struggle to handle conflicting reports in evolving news. To address this challenge, we present the NEON framework, designed to extract emerging entity interactions -- such as events or activities -- as described in news articles. NEON constructs an entity-centric timestamped knowledge graph that captures such interactions, thereby facilitating enhanced QA capabilities related to news events. Our framework innovates by integrating open Information Extraction (openIE) style tuples into LLMs to enable in-context retrieval-augmented generation. This integration demonstrates substantial improvements in QA performance when tackling temporal, entity-centric search queries. Through NEON, LLMs can deliver more accurate, reliable, and up-to-date responses.</description>
