      <title>Microwave characterization of superconducting coplanar resonators made out of granular aluminium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have designed, fabricated and characterized microwave resonators made out of thin films of granular aluminium (grAl) with different oxygen content. We extract the contribution of the large kinetic-inductance of this disordered superconductor from the frequency shift of the resonators as a function of temperature, and discuss the correlation with the resistivity of the films. At low temperatures, measurements of the internal quality factor as a function of microwave power indicate the presence of two-level systems, which are inherent to the growth process of the granular aluminium. The characterization methods presented here may be useful for the design of MKIDs, high-impedance resonators and superinductors.</description>

      <title>$\boldsymbol{d}$-vector precession induced pumping in topological $p$-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-reversal invariant $p$-wave superconductors (SCs) are characterized by their $\boldsymbol{d}$-vectors, whose orientations could be manipulated by a tiny magnetic field. We study in this paper the adiabatic pumping process induced by periodically rotating $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector in a topological $p$-wave SC, which is coupled to two normal leads. If $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector rotates nearly within a plane, the pumped spin $2S_z/\hbar$ over one cycle is nearly quantized at $2$ without net charge pumping. When the pumping lead is fully spin-polarized, both the pumped charge $Q/e$ and spin $2S_z/\hbar$ would peak nearly at $1$. When a mixing $s$-wave pairing component is taken into account, a topological phase transition can be driven by modulating the ratio between the pairing components. We found a sharp resonance phenomenon near the phase transition when the $p$-wave $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector is adiabatically rotating, which may help experimentally distinguish the topological SCs from trivial ones.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Raman probe of the photoinduced superconducting to normal state transition in the cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an ultrafast Time-Resolved Raman scattering study of the out-of-equilibrium photoinduced dynamics across the superconducting to normal state phase transition of the cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. Using the polarization-resolved momentum space selectivity of Raman scattering, we track the superconducting condensate destruction and recovery with sub-ps resolution in the anti-nodal region of the Fermi surface where the superconducting gap is maximum. Leveraging ultrafast Raman thermometry, we find a significant dichotomy between the superconducting condensate and the quasiparticle temperature dynamics near the anti-nodes, which cannot be framed in terms of a single effective electron temperature. The present work demonstrates the ability of TR-Raman to selectively probe out-of-equilibrium pathways of different electron sub-degrees of freedom during a photoinduced phase transition.</description>

      <title>Nematic chiral Superconductivity driven by chiral loop current order in kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sequence of unconventional quantum phases in the kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K), including charge-density-wave and loop-current order, gives rise to exotic chiral electronic states that lack time-reversal symmetry (TRS). These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Intertwined Electron pairing in the Bilayer Two-orbital Kanamori-Hubbard Model: a Unified Picture of Two Superconductivities in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism of pairing in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ bulk and film superconductors remains actively debated. Here, we investigate the bilayer two-orbital Kanamori-Hubbard model for $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ using cellular dynamical mean-field theory. We find two intertwined $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivities with distinct physical origins under enhanced Hund's coupling $J_H$. We show that when $d_{z^2}$ orbital is half-filled and its bonding band lies below Fermi level, electron pairing associated to $J_H$ prevails. As $d_{z^2}$ orbital is hole-doped, this superconducting state becomes suppressed and a second superconductivity, which is largely insensitive to $J_H$ but exhibiting a critical reliance on $d_{z^2}$ - $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hybridization $V$, arises. These two pairing states exhibit comparable maximum transition temperatures and evolve continuously from one to the other with varying $d_{z^2}$ doping, resulting a smooth $T_c$ versus doping evolution. The dependence on various physical parameters of the two superconductivities is studied. Our results present a unified picture reconciling the debate about the role of $d_{z^2}$ orbital in pairing. We discuss the relevance of our results to recent experiments on superconducting $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ films.</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical Shapiro steps in small Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model describing the formation of both dual (quantum) and classical Shapiro steps in small Josephson junctions. According to this model, the dual Shapiro steps are formed at relatively low frequency of the microwave signal and low microwave power, while the classical steps are formed in the opposite limit of high frequency and power. The crossover between the two regimes is controlled by a single parameter - the effective relaxation time of the environment. The model accounts for the effect of a large inductor in the bias circuit, which has been used in recent experiments to protect the junction from the high frequency noise of the environment. We predict the possibility of observing both types of steps in the same sample. Our model describes the I-V curves observed in the experiments with reasonable accuracy, thus opening up an opportunity for quantitative fitting of the data.</description>

      <title>Charge sensitivity in the transmon regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmons are widely adopted in quantum computing architectures for their engineered insensitivity to charge noise and correspondingly long relaxation times. Despite this advantage, transmons often exhibit large fluctuations in dephasing times across different devices and also within qubits on the same device. Existing transmon qubits are assumed to be insensitive to charge noise. However, very little recent attention has been paid to the dependence of dephasing on the local charge environment. In this study, we see fluctuations in the dephasing time, $T_{\phi}$, which correlate to charge offset. While charge offset fluctuations are slow, parity switches are fast processes tied to the charge offset and can affect $T_{\phi}$ in Ramsey experiments. We implement a protocol to detect parity switching events using single-shot methods, which are interleaved within a Ramsey measurement. We find that events that remain in the same parity state have a higher $T_2$ than measurements averaged over both parities. Our results show that transmons can be limited by charge-noise, even with $E_\text{J}/E_\text{C} \approx 50$. Consequently, parity flip rates must be considered as a device characterization metric.</description>

      <title>Transmon qubit using Sn as a junction superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductor qubits typically use aluminum-aluminum oxide tunnel junctions to provide the non-linear inductance. Junctions with semiconductor barriers make it possible to vary the superconductor material and explore beyond aluminum. We use InAs semiconductor nanowires coated with thin superconducting shells of beta-Sn to realize transmon qubits. By tuning the Josephson energy with a gate voltage, we adjust the qubit frequency over a range of 3 GHz. The longest energy relaxation time, T1 = 27 microseconds, is obtained at the lowest qubit frequencies, while the longest echo dephasing time, T2 = 1.8 microseconds, is achieved at higher frequencies. We assess the possible factors limiting coherence times in these devices and discuss steps to enhance performance through improvements in materials fabrication and circuit design.</description>

      <title>Density of States (Gate) - Controlled Andreev Molecule and Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum computing typically relies on topological Andreev bound states (ABSs) engineered in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices, where gate control offers key advantages. While strong Zeeman fields can induce such states, an alternative approach emerges through Andreev molecules -- closely spaced, coupled ABSs, also key building-block for Kitaev chain -- that enable topological behavior without high magnetic fields. However, existing Andreev molecules are controlled via magnetic flux in superconducting loops, limiting scalability. Here, we introduce a gate-controlled Andreev molecule, where electrostatic tuning of the density of states in one site nonlocally enhances the critical current of another. This eliminates superconducting loops, offering superior tunability, scalability, and sensitivity. We further extend such an Andreev molecule to a multi-site Kitaev chain, and a noninvasive sensor resolving single-Cooper-pair charge for parity readout. This platform bridges the gap between scalable ABS engineering and high-sensitivity quantum sensing, advancing the development for constructing and parity-readout in topological ABSs and long Kitaev chains towards topological qubits.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved dynamics of the amplitude Schmid-Higgs mode in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spatially-resolved dynamics of the collective amplitude Schmid-Higgs (SH) mode in disordered $s$-wave superconductors and fermionic superfluids. By analyzing the analytic structure of the zero-temperature SH susceptibility in the complex frequency plane, we find that when the coherence length greatly exceeds the mean free path: (i) the SH response at fixed wave vectors exhibits late-time oscillations decaying as $1/t^2$ with frequency $2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the superconducting gap; (ii) sub-diffusive oscillations with a dynamical exponent $z{=}4$ emerge at late times and large distances; and (iii) spatial oscillations at fixed frequency decay exponentially, with a period that diverges as the frequency approaches $2\Delta$ from above. When the coherence length is comparable to the mean free path, additional exponentially-decaying oscillations at fixed wave vectors appear with frequency above $2\Delta$. Furthermore, we show that the SH mode induces an extra peak in the third-harmonic generation current at finite wave-vectors. The frequency of this peak is shifted from the conventional resonance at $\Delta$, thereby providing an unambiguous signature of order parameter amplitude dynamics.</description>

      <title>Prediction of high-Tc superconductivity in ternary actinium beryllium hydrides at low pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen-rich superconductors are promising candidates to achieve room-temperature superconductivity. However, the extreme pressures needed to stabilize these structures significantly limit their practical applications. An effective strategy to reduce the external pressure is to add a light element M that binds with H to form MHx units, acting as a chemical precompressor. We exemplify this idea by performing ab initio calculations of the Ac-Be-H phase diagram, proving that the metallization pressure of Ac-H binaries, for which critical temperatures as high as 200 K were predicted at 200 GPa, can be significantly reduced via beryllium incorporation. We identify three thermodynamically stable (AcBe2H10, AcBeH8, and AcBe2H14) and four metastable compounds (fcc AcBeH8, AcBeH10, AcBeH12 and AcBe2H16). All of them are superconductors. In particular, fcc AcBeH8 remains dynamically stable down to 10 GPa, where it exhibits a superconducting transition temperature Tc of 181 K. The Be-H bonds are responsible for the exceptional properties of these ternary compounds and allow them to remain dynamically stable close to ambient pressure. Our results suggest that high-Tc superconductivity in hydrides is achievable at low pressure and may stimulate experimental synthesis of ternary hydrides.</description>

      <title>Ionic-Bond-Driven Atom-Bridged Room-Temperature Cooper Pairing in Cuprates and Nickelates: a Theoretical Framework Supported by 32 Experimental Evidences</title>

Abstract: Unlike ordinary conductors and semiconductors, which conduct electricity through individual electrons, superconductors usually conduct electricity through pairs of electrons, known as Cooper pairs. Even after 4 decades of intense study, no one knows what holds electrons together in complex high-$T_c$ oxides. Here, targeting the critical challenge of the pairing mechanism behind high-$T_c$ superconductivity in cuprates and nickelates, we create a new theoretical framework by standing on the foundation of the chemical-bond$\rightarrow$structure$\rightarrow$property relationship. Considering the dominance of eV-scale ionic bonding, affinity of O$^-$ (1.46 eV) and O$^{2-}$ (-8.08 eV) and large second ionization energy ($\sim$10-20 eV) of metal atoms, we propose a groundbreaking idea of electron e$^-$ (hole h$^+$) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, i.e., the ionic-bond-driven $\mathbf{e^--O-e^-}$ ($\mathbf{h^+-M-h^+}$) itinerant Cooper pairing, by following the principle of "tracing electron footprints to explore pairing mechanisms". Its correctness and universality are confirmed by 32 diverse experimental evidences, especially, the STM topographic image combining with the small Cooper-pair size. Any other sub-eV and covalent-binding pairing mechanisms would be doubtful. Our findings resolve a 40-year puzzle of the microscopic mechanism for high-$T_c$ superconductivity and validate the feasibility of room-temperature carrier-pairing in ionic-bonded superconductors, bringing the dream of room-temperature superconductivity one step closer.</description>

      <title>Pomeranchuk instability in the nematic phase of two monolayer FeSe/SrTiO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.10136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nematicity, where electrons break rotational symmetry while preserving translational symmetry, is ubiquitous in strongly correlated quantum matters, including high-Tc cuprates and iron-based superconductors. A central question in nematicity is whether it is driven by Pomeranchuk instability in momentum space or orbital order (polarization) in real space, especially as nematicity intertwines with superconductivity. FeSe/SrTiO3 (STO), where nematicity occurs without long-range magnetic order, is an ideal platform for studying the nature and origin of the electronic nematicity. Here we present direct evidence of Pomeranchuk nematic order in two monolayer FeSe/STO using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, revealing a remarkable degeneracy of dxz and dyz bands at the Brillouin zone center, but a significant band separation at the zone corner. This momentum-dependent nematicity demonstrates that nematicity in FeSe/STO originates from the Pomeranchuk instability, offering insights into the relationship between nematicity and superconductivity. Our results establish two-dimensional FeSe thin film as a powerful platform for investigating quantum physics under complex intertwinement.</description>

Abstract: The recently predicted unconventional magnets offer a new ground for exploring the formation of nontrivial spin states due to their inherent nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. In this work, we consider unconventional magnets with $d$- and $p$-wave parities, and investigate the effect of time-periodic light drives for inducing the formation of spin-triplet phases in the normal and superconducting states. In particular, we consider unconventional magnets without and with conventional superconductivity under linearly and circularly polarized light drives and treat the time-dependent problem within Floquet formalism, which naturally unveils photon processes and Floquet bands determining the emergent phenomena. We demonstrate that the interplay between unconventional magnetism and light gives rise to a non-trivial light-matter coupling which governs the emergence of Floquet spin-triplet states with and without superconductivity that are absent otherwise. We find that photon-assisted processes promote the formation of spin-triplet densities and spin-triplet Cooper pairs between different Floquet sidebands. More precisely, the Floquet sidebands offer an additional quantum number, the Floquet index, which considerably broadens the classification of superconducting correlations that lead to Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs as an entirely dynamical phenomenon due to the interplay between light and unconventional magnetism. Furthermore, we discuss how the number of photons is connected to the symmetry of Cooper pairs and also explore how the distinct light drives can be used to manipulate them and probe the angular symmetry of unconventional magnets. Our results therefore unveil the potential of unconventional magnets for realizing nontrivial light-induced superconducting states.</description>
