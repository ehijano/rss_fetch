      <title>Identification and estimation of structural vector autoregressive models via LU decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models are widely used to analyze the simultaneous relationships between multiple time-dependent data. Various statistical inference methods have been studied to overcome the identification problems of SVAR models. However, most of these methods impose strong assumptions for innovation processes such as the uncorrelation of components. In this study, we relax the assumptions for innovation processes and propose an identification method for SVAR models under the zero-restrictions on the coefficient matrices, which correspond to sufficient conditions for LU decomposition of the coefficient matrices of the reduced form of the SVAR models. Moreover, we establish asymptotically normal estimators for the coefficient matrices and impulse responses, which enable us to construct test statistics for the simultaneous relationships of time-dependent data. The finite-sample performance of the proposed method is elucidated by numerical simulations. We also present an example of an empirical study that analyzes the impact of policy rates on unemployment and prices.</description>

      <title>Functional Factor Regression with an Application to Electricity Price Curve Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a function-on-function linear regression model for time-dependent curve data that is consistently estimated by imposing factor structures on the regressors. An integral operator based on cross-covariances identifies two components for each functional regressor: a predictive low-dimensional component, along with associated factors that are guaranteed to be correlated with the dependent variable, and an infinite-dimensional component that has no predictive power. In order to consistently estimate the correct number of factors for each regressor, we introduce a functional eigenvalue difference test. Our setting allows us to construct a novel central limit theorem for the regression parameters in a fully functional model, making it possible to construct confidence bands and conduct statistical inference. The model is applied to forecast electricity price curves in three different energy markets. Its prediction accuracy is found to be comparable to popular machine learning approaches, while providing statistically valid inference and interpretable insights into the conditional correlation structures of electricity prices.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Hidden Forces Behind Laos' 2022 Exchange Rate Crisis and Balance of Payments Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This working paper uses a Dynamic Factor Model ('the model') to identify underlying factors contributing to the debt-induced economic crisis in the People's Democratic Republic of Laos ('Laos'). The analysis aims to use the latent macroeconomic insights to propose ways forward for forecasting. We focus on Laos's historic structural weaknesses to identify when a balance of payments crisis with either a persistent current account imbalance or rapid capital outflows would occur. By extracting latent economic factors from macroeconomic indicators, the model provides a starting point for analyzing the structural vulnerabilities leading to the value of the kip in USD terms dropping and contributing to inflation in the country. This findings of this working paper contribute to the broader literature on exchange rate instability and external sector vulnerabilities in emerging economies, offering insights on what constitutes as 'signals' as opposed to plain 'noise' from a macroeconomic forecasting standpoint.</description>

      <title>Difference-in-Differences Designs: A Practitioner's Guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Difference-in-Differences (DiD) is arguably the most popular quasi-experimental research design. Its canonical form, with two groups and two periods, is well-understood. However, empirical practices can be ad hoc when researchers go beyond that simple case. This article provides an organizing framework for discussing different types of DiD designs and their associated DiD estimators. It discusses covariates, weights, handling multiple periods, and staggered treatments. The organizational framework, however, applies to other extensions of DiD methods as well.</description>

      <title>Visual Polarization Measurement Using Counterfactual Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Political polarization is a significant issue in American politics, influencing public discourse, policy, and consumer behavior. While studies on polarization in news media have extensively focused on verbal content, non-verbal elements, particularly visual content, have received less attention due to the complexity and high dimensionality of image data. Traditional descriptive approaches often rely on feature extraction from images, leading to biased polarization estimates due to information loss. In this paper, we introduce the Polarization Measurement using Counterfactual Image Generation (PMCIG) method, which combines economic theory with generative models and multi-modal deep learning to fully utilize the richness of image data and provide a theoretically grounded measure of polarization in visual content. Applying this framework to a decade-long dataset featuring 30 prominent politicians across 20 major news outlets, we identify significant polarization in visual content, with notable variations across outlets and politicians. At the news outlet level, we observe significant heterogeneity in visual slant. Outlets such as Daily Mail, Fox News, and Newsmax tend to favor Republican politicians in their visual content, while The Washington Post, USA Today, and The New York Times exhibit a slant in favor of Democratic politicians. At the politician level, our results reveal substantial variation in polarized coverage, with Donald Trump and Barack Obama among the most polarizing figures, while Joe Manchin and Susan Collins are among the least. Finally, we conduct a series of validation tests demonstrating the consistency of our proposed measures with external measures of media slant that rely on non-image-based sources.</description>

      <title>SNPL: Simultaneous Policy Learning and Evaluation for Safe Multi-Objective Policy Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To design effective digital interventions, experimenters face the challenge of learning decision policies that balance multiple objectives using offline data. Often, they aim to develop policies that maximize goal outcomes, while ensuring there are no undesirable changes in guardrail outcomes. To provide credible recommendations, experimenters must not only identify policies that satisfy the desired changes in goal and guardrail outcomes, but also offer probabilistic guarantees about the changes these policies induce. In practice, however, policy classes are often large, and digital experiments tend to produce datasets with small effect sizes relative to noise. In this setting, standard approaches such as data splitting or multiple testing often result in unstable policy selection and/or insufficient statistical power. In this paper, we provide safe noisy policy learning (SNPL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of algorithmic stability to address these challenges. Our method enables policy learning while simultaneously providing high-confidence guarantees using the entire dataset, avoiding the need for data-splitting. We present finite-sample and asymptotic versions of our algorithm that ensure the recommended policy satisfies high-probability guarantees for avoiding guardrail regressions and/or achieving goal outcome improvements. We test both variants of our approach approach empirically on a real-world application of personalizing SMS delivery. Our results on real-world data suggest that our approach offers dramatic improvements in settings with large policy classes and low signal-to-noise across both finite-sample and asymptotic safety guarantees, offering up to 300\% improvements in detection rates and 150\% improvements in policy gains at significantly smaller sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Estimating interaction effects with panel data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes how interaction effects can be consistently estimated under economically plausible assumptions in linear panel models with a fixed $T$-dimension. We advocate for a \emph{correlated interaction term estimator} (CITE) and show that it is consistent under conditions that are not sufficient for consistency of the interaction term estimator that is most common in applied econometric work. Our paper discusses the empirical content of these conditions, shows that standard inference procedures can be applied to CITE, and analyzes consistency, relative efficiency, inference, and their finite sample properties in a simulation study. In an empirical application, we test whether labor displacement effects of robots are stronger in countries at higher income levels. The results are in line with our theoretical and simulation results and indicate that standard interaction term estimation underestimates the importance of a country's income level in the relationship between robots and employment and may prematurely reject a null hypothesis about interaction effects in the presence of misspecification.</description>

      <title>Debiased Machine Learning when Nuisance Parameters Appear in Indicator Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies debiased machine learning when nuisance parameters appear in indicator functions. An important example is maximized average welfare gain under optimal treatment assignment rules. For asymptotically valid inference for a parameter of interest, the current literature on debiased machine learning relies on Gateaux differentiability of the functions inside moment conditions, which does not hold when nuisance parameters appear in indicator functions. In this paper, we propose smoothing the indicator functions, and develop an asymptotic distribution theory for this class of models. The asymptotic behavior of the proposed estimator exhibits a trade-off between bias and variance due to smoothing. We study how a parameter which controls the degree of smoothing can be chosen optimally to minimize an upper bound of the asymptotic mean squared error. A Monte Carlo simulation supports the asymptotic distribution theory, and an empirical example illustrates the implementation of the method.</description>

      <title>Sequential Kernel Embedding for Mediated and Time-Varying Dose Response Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.03950v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose simple nonparametric estimators for mediated and time-varying dose response curves based on kernel ridge regression. By embedding Pearl's mediation formula and Robins' g-formula with kernels, we allow treatments, mediators, and covariates to be continuous in general spaces, and also allow for nonlinear treatment-confounder feedback. Our key innovation is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space technique called sequential kernel embedding, which we use to construct simple estimators that account for complex feedback. Our estimators preserve the generality of classic identification while also achieving nonasymptotic uniform rates. In nonlinear simulations with many covariates, we demonstrate strong performance. We estimate mediated and time-varying dose response curves of the US Job Corps, and clean data that may serve as a benchmark in future work. We extend our results to mediated and time-varying treatment effects and counterfactual distributions, verifying semiparametric efficiency and weak convergence.</description>
