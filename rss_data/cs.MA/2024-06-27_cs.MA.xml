      <title>Formation Under Communication Constraints: Control Performance Meets Channel Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wireless communication-based formation control systems, the control performance is significantly impacted by the channel capacity of each communication link between agents. This relationship, however, remains under-investigated in the existing studies. To address this gap, the formation control problem of classical second-order multi-agent systems with bounded process noises was considered taking into account the channel capacity. More specifically, the model of communication links between agents is first established, based on a new concept -- guaranteed communication region, which characterizes all possible locations for successful message decoding in the present of control-system uncertainty. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that, the guaranteed communication region does not unboundedly increase with the transmission time, which indicates an important trade-off between the guaranteed communication region and the data rate. The fundamental limits of data rate for any desired accuracy are also obtained. Finally, the integrated design to achieve the desired formation accuracy is proposed, where an estimation-based controller and transmit power control strategy are developed.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Target Capture using Voronoi Region Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses a cooperative strategy for capturing a target using multiple pursuers in a planar scenario. Given an initial position distribution of pursuers, the Voronoi Diagram is employed to characterize the target's proximity region. The key idea is to dynamically shape that region using a policy that directs its vertices towards its instantaneous centroid. Analysis of the resulting dynamics deduces the velocity control inputs for the pursuers. As the main result, target's proximity region is shown to shrink exponentially irrespective of its speed and evasion policy. Simulation results demonstrate the characteristics of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Strategy Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a nonparametric statistical test for determining whether an agent is following a given mixed strategy in a repeated strategic-form game given samples of the agent's play. This involves two components: determining whether the agent's frequencies of pure strategies are sufficiently close to the target frequencies, and determining whether the pure strategies selected are independent between different game iterations. Our integrated test involves applying a chi-squared goodness of fit test for the first component and a generalized Wald-Wolfowitz runs test for the second component. The results from both tests are combined using Bonferroni correction to produce a complete test for a given significance level $\alpha.$ We applied the test to publicly available data of human rock-paper-scissors play. The data consists of 50 iterations of play for 500 human players. We test with a null hypothesis that the players are following a uniform random strategy independently at each game iteration. Using a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, we conclude that 305 (61%) of the subjects are following the target strategy.</description>
