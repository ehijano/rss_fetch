      <title>q-deformed evolutionary dynamics in simple matrix games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider evolutionary games in which the agent selected for update compares their payoff to q neighbours, rather than a single neighbour as in standard evolutionary game theory. Through studying fixed point stability and fixation times for 2x2 games with all-to-all interactions, we find that the flow changes significantly as a function of q. Further, we investigate the effects of changing the underlying topology from an all-to-all interacting system to an uncorrelated graph via the pair approximation. We also develop the framework for studying games with more than two strategies, such as the rock-paper-scissors game where we show that changing q leads to the emergence of new types of flow.</description>

      <title>A minimal scenario for the origin of non-equilibrium order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extant life contains numerous non-equilibrium mechanisms to create order not achievable at equilibrium; it is generally assumed that these mechanisms evolved because the resulting order was sufficiently beneficial to overcome associated costs of time and energy. Here, we identify a broad range of conditions under which non-equilibrium order-creating mechanisms will evolve as an inevitable consequence of self-replication, even if the order is not directly functional. We show that models of polymerases, when expanded to include known stalling effects, can evolve kinetic proofreading through selection for fast replication alone, consistent with data from recent mutational screens. Similarly, replication contingent on fast self-assembly can select for non-equilibrium instabilities and result in more ordered structures without any direct selection for order. We abstract these results into a framework that predicts that self-replication intrinsically amplifies dissipative order-enhancing mechanisms if the distribution of replication times is wide enough. Our work suggests the intriguing possibility that non-equilibrium order can arise more easily than assumed, even before that order is directly functional, with consequences impacting such diverse phenomena as the evolution of mutation rates, kinetic traps in self-assembly, and the origin of life.</description>

      <title>Refining the drift barrier hypothesis: a role of recessive gene count and an inhomogeneous Muller`s ratchet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09094v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The drift-barrier hypothesis states that random genetic drift constrains the refinement of a phenotype under natural selection. The influence of effective population size and the genome-wide deleterious mutation rate were studied theoretically, and an inverse relationship between mutation rate and genome size has been observed for many species. However, the effect of the recessive gene count, an important feature of the genomic architecture, is unknown. In a Wright-Fisher model, we studied the mutation burden for a growing number of N completely recessive and lethal disease genes. Diploid individuals are represented with a binary $2 \times N$ matrix denoting wild-type and mutated alleles. Analytic results for specific cases were complemented by simulations across a broad parameter regime for gene count, mutation and recombination rates. Simulations revealed transitions to higher mutation burden and prevalence within a few generations that were linked to the extinction of the wild-type haplotype (least-loaded class). This metastability, that is, phases of quasi-equilibrium with intermittent transitions, persists over $100\,000$ generations. The drift-barrier hypothesis is confirmed by a high mutation burden resulting in population collapse. Simulations showed the emergence of mutually exclusive haplotypes for a mutation rate above 0.02 lethal equivalents per generation for a genomic architecture and population size representing complex multicellular organisms such as humans. In such systems, recombination proves pivotal, preventing population collapse and maintaining a mutation burden below 10. This study advances our understanding of gene pool stability, and particularly the role of the number of recessive disorders. Insights into Muller`s ratchet dynamics are provided, and the essential role of recombination in curbing mutation burden and stabilizing the gene pool is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler for rapid estimation of mutational histories of unusual lineages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 usually evolves at a relatively constant rate over time. Occasionally, however, lineages arise with higher-than-expected numbers of mutations given the date of sampling. Such lineages can arise for a variety of reasons, including selection pressures imposed by evolution during a chronic infection or exposure to mutation-inducing drugs like molnupiravir. We have developed an open-source web-based application (SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler; https://eringill.shinyapps.io/covid_mutation_distributions) that compares a list of user-submitted lineage-defining mutations with established mutation distributions including those observed during (1) the first nine months of the pandemic, (2) during the global transmission of Omicron, (3) during the chronic infection of immunocompromised patients, and (4) during zoonotic spillover from humans to deer. The application calculates the most likely distribution for the user's mutation list and displays log likelihoods for all distributions. In addition, the transition:transversion ratio of the user's list is calculated to determine whether there is evidence of exposure to a mutation-inducing drug such as molnupiravir and indicates whether the list contains mutations in the proofreading domain of nsp14 which could lead to a higher-than-expected mutation rate in the lineage. This tool will be useful for public health and researchers seeking to rapidly infer evolutionary histories of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which can aid risk assessment and public health responses.</description>
