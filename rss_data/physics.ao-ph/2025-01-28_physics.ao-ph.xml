      <title>Network science disentangles internal climate variability in global spatial dependence structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive characterization of internal climate variability and irreducible uncertainty through initial-condition large ensembles of Earth system models across different spatiotemporal scales remains a significant challenge in climate science. In this study, we find significant differences in the spatial connectivity structures of temperature networks across ensemble members, with variations in long-range connections providing a distinguishing feature across the outcomes of initial conditions. Based on this, we introduce a novel quantifier, the 'Connectivity Ratio' (R), to encapsulate the spatial connectivity structure of each ensemble member by investigating the influence of internal climate variability on the global connectivity patterns in air temperatures. R allows us to characterize the variability of spatial dependence structure across the initial condition ensemble members as well as multiple models. Furthermore, we examine changes in spatial connectivity between near-term and long-term projections using R, which shows a potential shift in climate predictability under anthropogenic influence on a spatial scale.</description>

      <title>Refined climatologies of future precipitation over High Mountain Asia using probabilistic ensemble learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Mountain Asia holds the largest concentration of frozen water outside the polar regions, serving as a crucial water source for more than 1.9 billion people. In the face of climate change, precipitation represents the largest source of uncertainty for hydrological modelling in this area. Future precipitation predictions remain challenging due to complex orography, lack of in situ hydrological observations, and limitations in climate model resolution and parametrisation for this region. To address the uncertainty posed by these challenges, climate models are often aggregated into multi-model ensembles. While multi-model ensembles are known to improve the predictive accuracy and analysis of future climate projections, consensus regarding how models are aggregated is lacking. In this study, we propose a probabilistic machine learning framework to systematically combine 13 regional climate models from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) over High Mountain Asia. Our approach accounts for seasonal and spatial biases within the models, enabling the prediction of more faithful precipitation distributions. The framework is validated against gridded historical precipitation data and is used to generate projections for the near-future (2036-2065) and far-future (2066-2095) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Learning Approach to Mediterranean Cyclones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mediterranean cyclones are extreme meteorological events of which much less is known compared to their tropical, oceanic counterparts. The raising interest in such phenomena is due to their impact on a region increasingly more affected by climate change, but a precise characterization remains a non trivial task. In this work we showcase how a Bayesian algorithm (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) can classify Mediterranean cyclones relying on wind velocity data, leading to a drastic dimensional reduction that allows the use of supervised statistical learning techniques for detecting and tracking new cyclones.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems for remote validation of very high-resolution ocean models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents and investigates a novel methodology for validating high-resolution ocean models using satellite imagery. High-resolution ocean models provide detailed information in coastal areas where other available data products are too coarse. Models are usually fitted by comparing them with observations; However, accessing in situ data in all small coastal areas is not feasible, as in situ observations are scarce and obtained through dedicated ships or instruments in limited and selected regions. Our work aims to use alternative remote sensing information to overcome this challenge. The approach involves establishing connections between the satellite observations and the outcomes of various computational experiments carried out using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), which allows the selection of different parameters to run the ocean model. These choices are not fully determined a priori and each one produces distinct outputs, which are then linked to the images through dynamical systems objects. By defining a performance index, we are able to quantify which experiment provides a better representation of the local ocean state.</description>

      <title>The stochastic skeleton model for the Madden-Julian Oscillation with time-dependent observation-based forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze solutions to the stochastic skeleton model, a minimal nonlinear oscillator model for the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). This model has been recognized for its ability to reproduce several large-scale features of the MJO. In previous studies, the model's forcings were predominantly chosen to be mathematically simple and time-independent. Here, we present solutions to the model with time-dependent observation-based forcing functions. Our results show that the model, with these more realistic forcing functions, successfully replicates key characteristics of MJO events, such as their lifetime, extent, and amplitude, whose statistics agree well with observations. However, we find that the seasonality of MJO events and the spatial variations in the MJO properties are not well reproduced. Having implemented the model in the presence of time-dependent forcings, we can analyze the impact of temporal variability at different time scales. In particular, we study the model's ability to reflect changes in MJO characteristics under the different phases of ENSO. We find that it does not capture differences in studied characteristics of MJO events in response to differences in conditions during El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na, and neutral ENSO.</description>

      <title>Using Generative Models to Produce Realistic Populations of UK Windstorms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the potential of generative models, trained on historical ERA5 reanalysis data, for simulating windstorms over the UK. Four generative models, including a standard GAN, a WGAN-GP, a U-net diffusion model, and a diffusion-GAN were assessed based on their ability to replicate spatial and statistical characteristics of windstorms. Different models have distinct strengths and limitations. The standard GAN displayed broader variability and limited alignment on the PCA dimensions. The WGAN-GP had a more balanced performance but occasionally misrepresented extreme events. The U-net diffusion model produced high-quality spatial patterns but consistently underestimated windstorm intensities. The diffusion-GAN performed better than the other models in general but overestimated extremes. An ensemble approach combining the strengths of these models could potentially improve their overall reliability. This study provides a foundation for such generative models in meteorological research and could potentially be applied in windstorm analysis and risk assessment.</description>

      <title>A Deep State Space Model for Rainfall-Runoff Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical way of studying the rainfall-runoff processes in the water cycle relies on conceptual or physically-based hydrologic models. Deep learning (DL) has recently emerged as an alternative and blossomed in hydrology community for rainfall-runoff simulations. However, the decades-old Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network remains the benchmark for this task, outperforming newer architectures like Transformers. In this work, we propose a State Space Model (SSM), specifically the Frequency Tuned Diagonal State Space Sequence (S4D-FT) model, for rainfall-runoff simulations. The proposed S4D-FT is benchmarked against the established LSTM and a physically-based Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model across 531 watersheds in the contiguous United States (CONUS). Results show that S4D-FT is able to outperform the LSTM model across diverse regions. Our pioneering introduction of the S4D-FT for rainfall-runoff simulations challenges the dominance of LSTM in the hydrology community and expands the arsenal of DL tools available for hydrological modeling.</description>

      <title>Improving Tropical Cyclone Forecasting With Video Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting is crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigation. While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, existing methods often treat TC evolution as a series of independent frame-to-frame predictions, limiting their ability to capture long-term dynamics. We present a novel application of video diffusion models for TC forecasting that explicitly models temporal dependencies through additional temporal layers. Our approach enables the model to generate multiple frames simultaneously, better capturing cyclone evolution patterns. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that significantly improves individual-frame quality and performance in low-data regimes. Experimental results show our method outperforms the previous approach of Nath et al. by 19.3% in MAE, 16.2% in PSNR, and 36.1% in SSIM. Most notably, we extend the reliable forecasting horizon from 36 to 50 hours. Through comprehensive evaluation using both traditional metrics and Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD), we demonstrate that our approach produces more temporally coherent forecasts while maintaining competitive single-frame quality.

      <title>YingLong-weather: AI-Based Limited Area Models for Forecasting of Non-precipitation Surface Meteorological Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, artificial intelligence-based (AI-based) models for forecasting of global weather have been rapidly developed. Most of the global models are trained on reanalysis datasets with a spatial resolution of 0.25{\deg}*0.25{\deg}. However, research on AI-based high spatial resolution limited area weather forecasting models remains limited. In this study, YingLong, an AI-based limited area weather forecasting model with a spatial resolution of 3 km * 3 km is developed. YingLong employs a parallel structure of global and local blocks to capture multiscale meteorological features and operates much faster than the dynamical limited area model WRF-ARW. In two selected limited areas (one relatively flat and the other featuring significant mountain ranges), YingLong (with lateral boundary condition imposed by the global AI-based model Pangu-weather) demonstrates superior skill in forecasting surface wind speed compared to WRF-ARW. Additionally, it shows comparable skill in forecasting surface temperature and pressure. The accuracy of surface temperature and humidity forecasts can be further improved by applying better boundary conditions. YingLong also addresses issues related to the lateral boundary conditions of AI-based limited area models, such as selecting the width of the lateral boundary region and combining finer and coarser resolution predictions in this region. Therefore, YingLong has a great potential to generate cost-effective multiyear high-resolution synthetic wind speed that maintain meteorological realism both spatially and temporally, aiding in the planning and operations for wind power generation companies.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh-B\'enard convective motion of stratified fluids in the Earth's troposphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Kaladze and Misra [Phys. Scr. 99 (2024) 085013] showed that the tropospheric stratified fluid flows may be unstable by the effects of the negative temperature gradient and the temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity arising from the thermal expansion. They also predicted that the modification in the Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency by the density inhomogeneity can lead to Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convective instability in the tropospheric unbounded layers. The purpose of the present work is to revisit the Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convective instability in more detail by considering both unbounded and bounded tropospheric layers. Starting from a set of fluid equations for incompressible neutral fluids with temperature gradients and using the Boussinesq approximation, we derive the general dispersion relations for Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convective waves in unbounded and bounded tropospheric domains and analyze them with some particular cases both analytically and numerically. We show that the conditions for instability in these two cases significantly differ. Furthermore, we obtain and analyze the critical values of the Raleigh numbers and the expressions for the instability growth rates of thermal waves in the two cases. In the case of the bounded region, we also derive the necessary boundary conditions and note that the vertical wave number is quantified, and the corresponding eigenvalue problem is well-set.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Anisotropic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is a widely observed state of fluid flows, characterized by complex, nonlinear interactions between motions across a broad spectrum of length and time scales. While turbulence is ubiquitous, from teacups to planetary atmospheres, oceans and stars, its manifestations can vary considerably between different physical systems. For instance, three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows display a forward energy cascade from large to small scales, while in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, energy cascades from small to large scales. In a given physical system, a transition between such disparate regimes of turbulence can occur when a control parameter reaches a critical value. The behavior of flows close to such transition points, which separate qualitatively distinct \textit{phases} of turbulence, has been found to be unexpectedly rich. Here, we survey recent findings on such transitions in highly anisotropic turbulent fluid flows, including turbulence in thin layers and under the influence of rapid rotation. We also review recent work on transitions induced by turbulent fluctuations, such as random reversals and transitions between large-scale vortices and jets, among others. The relevance of these results and their ramifications for future investigations are discussed.</description>
