      <title>Inverse Theorems for Point-Sphere Incidences over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the first inverse theorem for point--sphere incidence bounds over finite fields in dimensions $d \ge 3$, showing that near-extremality forces algebraic rigidity. While sharp upper bounds have been known for over a decade, the structural characterization of configurations that nearly saturate these bounds has remained completely open.
  Specifically, if a configuration of points $P \subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ and spheres $\mathscr{S}$ exceeds the random incidence baseline by a factor $K$ in the moderate-sphere regime, then there exists a subset $P' \subset P$ of size \[ |P'| \gtrsim K q^{(d-1)/2} \] contained in the zero set of a polynomial $F$ of degree at most $C K^C$. This yields a one-sided result: we identify necessary algebraic obstructions to extremality, without asserting sufficiency.
  The proof introduces a new rigidity mechanism for finite-field incidence geometry. Near-extremality manifests as persistent overlap among bisector hyperplanes. We prove that such persistent coincidence cannot occur without forcing the emergence of bounded-complexity algebraic certificates. The argument proceeds by isolating high-overlap layers via energy stratification, followed by a projective polynomial dichotomy applied to the set of normal directions.
  As applications, we obtain the first inverse-type results for pinned distance and dot-product problems over finite fields, resolving structural questions inaccessible to standard polynomial or Fourier-analytic methods.</description>

      <title>On supersaturation in the Erd\H{o}s--S\'os problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following classical question in extremal set theory is due to Erd\H os and S\'os: what is the size of the largest family $\mathcal F\subset {[n]\choose k}$ with no two sets $F_1,F_2\in \mathcal F$ such that $|F_1\cap F_2| = t$? In this paper, we address a supersaturation question for this extremal function. For a family $\mathcal F\subset {[n]\choose k}$ of a fixed size $\ell$, what is the smallest number of pairs $F_1,F_2\in \mathcal F$ with $|F_1\cap F_2|=t$ it may induce? For fixed $k$ and $n\to \infty$, we find the exact threshold when the minimum number of pairs matches the expected number of pairs in a random $\ell$-element family up to a constant factor. We also find an exact answer for $\ell$ slightly above the extremal function.</description>

      <title>Hunting for Directed 2-Spiders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10340v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hons, Klimo\v{s}ov\'a, Kucheriya, Mik\v{s}an\'ik, Tkadlec, and Tyomkyn proved that, for every integer $\ell \ge 1$, every directed graph with minimum out-degree at least $3.23 \cdot \ell$ contains a $(2,\ell)$-spider (a $1$-subdivision of the in-star with $\ell$ leaves) as a subgraph. They also conjectured that the bound on the minimum out-degree can be further improved to $2 \ell$. In this note, we confirm their conjecture by showing that every directed graph with minimum out-degree at least $2\ell$ contains a $(2, \ell)$-spider as a subgraph. This result is best possible, as the complete directed graph with $2\ell$ vertices does not contain a $(2,\ell)$-spider.</description>

      <title>On Lichnerowicz sharp distance-regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first non-zero Laplacian eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of a finite graph is bounded below by its minimum Lin--Lu--Yau curvature $\kappa$. This is a discrete analogue of the classical Lichnerowicz Theorem. A graph with $\lambda_1=\kappa$ is called Lichnerowicz sharp. In this note, we completely classify all Lichnerowicz sharp distance-regular graphs. Our result substantially strengthens the corresponding classification by Cushing, Kamtue, Koolen, Liu, M\"unch, and Peyerimhoff (Adv. Math. 2020), which required an extra spectral condition. As a key preparatory step, we provide a classification of all amply regular Terwilliger graphs with positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature, a result that is interesting of its own right.</description>

      <title>Critical Numbers for Restricted Sumsets: Rigidity and Collapse in Finite Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a classification of the critical numbers for restricted sumsets in finite abelian groups, determining them exactly for even-order groups and bounding them for odd-order groups, while revealing a fundamental structural dichotomy governed by parity. For groups of even order, we prove a universal rigidity theorem: the index-$2$ subgroup creates an immutable arithmetic barrier at density $1/2$, fixing the critical number at $|G|/2+1$ regardless of the group's internal structure. In sharp contrast, we demonstrate that for groups of odd order, this barrier vanishes, causing the critical threshold to collapse to significantly lower densities bounded by index-$5$ obstructions or the smallest prime divisor. These results unify and vastly generalize previous work on cyclic groups, providing a definitive structural theory for the transition from sparsity to saturation. As a decisive application, we resolve a conjecture of Han and Ren in algebraic coding theory. By translating the additive rigidity at density $1/2$ into a geometric constraint, we prove that for all sufficiently large $q$, any subset of rational points on an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{F}_q$ generating an MDS code must satisfy the tight bound $|P|\le|E(\mathbb{F}_q)|/2$.</description>

      <title>Ramsey numbers of K_s + mK_t versus K_n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For integers m &gt;= 1, s &gt;= 0, and t &gt;= 1, let K_s + mK_t denote the join of a clique K_s and m vertex-disjoint copies of K_t. We prove that for fixed m &gt;= 1, t &gt;= 1, and s &gt;= 0, R(K_s + mK_t, K_n) = O( n^{s+t-1} / (log n)^{s+t-2} ). This settles a problem proposed by Liu and Li (2026). Moreover, for (s,t) = (0,3) the bound is tight up to a constant factor, matching the classical result R(K_3, K_n) = Theta( n^2 / log n ) of Kim (1995).</description>

      <title>Transversal tilings in k-partite graphs without large holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any constant $\mu&gt;0$ and $k\ge 3$, there exists $\alpha&gt;0$ such that the following holds for sufficiently large $n \in \mathbb{N}$. If $G=(V_{1},\ldots,V_{k},E)$ is a spanning subgraph of the $n$-blow-up of $K_{k}$ with ${\delta^*}(G)\geq (\frac{1}{2}+\mu) n$ and $\alpha^*_{k-1}(G)&lt;\alpha n$, then $G$ has a transversal $K_{k}$-factor. Moreover, the bound $\frac{1}{2}$ is asymptotically tight for the case \(k=3\). In addition, we show that if $k\ge 4$, $G=(V_{1},\ldots,V_{k},E)$ is a spanning subgraph of the $n$-blow-up of $C_{k}$ with ${\delta^*}(G)\ge (\frac{2}{k}+\mu) n$, and $\alpha^*_{2}(G)&lt;\alpha n$, then $G$ has a transversal $C_{k}$-factor. This extends a recent result of Han, Hu, Ping, Wang, Wang and Yang.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Kazhdan--Lusztig Polynomials of Thagomizer Matroids with a Hyperoctahedral Group Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thagomizer matroid, realized as the graphic matroid of the complete tripartite graph $K_{1,1,n}$, has full automorphism group isomorphic to the hyperoctahedral group whenever $n \ge 2$. In the equivariant setting for this action, we compute both the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial and the inverse Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial in the sense of Proudfoot's Kazhdan--Lusztig--Stanley theory, and we show that each coefficient is an honest representation with a multiplicity-free irreducible decomposition. Our main idea is to exploit the palindromicity of the equivariant $Z$-polynomial, reducing the computation to the already established symmetric-group equivariant Kazhdan--Lusztig theory for the graphic matroids of cycle graphs, and then to apply Proudfoot's equivariant Kazhdan--Lusztig--Stanley inversion identity to obtain the inverse polynomial. Passing to dimensions recovers the previously known nonequivariant thagomizer polynomials, while the coefficient formulas admit a natural expression in terms of the wreath product Frobenius characteristic for the hyperoctahedral group.</description>

      <title>Forward Arc Maximization for Hamilton Oriented Cycles and Paths in Generalizations of Tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gishboliner, Krivelevich, and Michaeli (2023) conjectured the following generalization of Dirac's theorem: If the minimum degree $\delta$ of an $n$-vertex oriented graph $G$ is greater or equal to $n/2$, then $G$ has a Hamilton oriented cycle with at least $\delta$ forward arcs. Freschi and Lo (2024) proved this conjecture. In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing the number of forward arcs in Hamilton oriented cycles/paths in generalizations of tournaments. We obtain characterizations for the maximum number of forward arcs in semicomplete multipartite digraphs and locally semicomplete digraphs. These characterizations lead to polynomial-time algorithms. Note that the above problems are NP-hard for some other generalizations of tournaments even though the Hamilton cycle problem is polynomial-time solvable for these digraph classes.</description>

      <title>Chromatic Number of Grassmann Graphs and MRD codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the chromatic number of the Grassmann graphs and of their powers, denoted $J_q(n,m,t)$. In this graph, the vertices correspond to the $m$-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ and two vertices are adjacent if the corresponding subspaces intersect in a subspace of dimension at least $t$.
  By generalizing the lifting technique of Silva, K\"otter and Kschischang, we use \emph{maximum rank distance (MRD)} codes to establish that $\chi(J_q(n, m, t)) \leq (1 +o(1))n^{m-t}q^{(n-m)(m-t)})$ when $n \geq 2m$. Given that $J_q(n, m, t)$ is isomorphic to $J_q(n,n-m,n-2m+t)$, this establishes a new upper bound on $J_q(n, m, t)$ for any valid choice of parameters. Furthermore, we observe that in the regime that $n, m $, and $t$ are fixed, our bound is asymptotically tight, implying that $
\chi(J_q(n, m, t)) = \Theta(q^{(m-t)\max(n-m, m)}). $</description>

      <title>Splitting Sandwiches Unevenly via Unique Sink Orientations and Rainbow Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Ham-Sandwich theorem states that any $d$ point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be simultaneously bisected by a single hyperplane. The $\alpha$-Ham-Sandwich theorem gives a sufficient condition for the existence of biased cuts, i.e., hyperplanes that do not cut off half but some prescribed fraction of each point set. We give two new proofs for this theorem. The first proof is completely combinatorial and highlights a strong connection between the $\alpha$-Ham-Sandwich theorem and Unique Sink Orientations of grids. The second proof uses point-hyperplane duality and the Poincar\'e-Miranda theorem and allows us to generalize the result to and beyond oriented matroids. For this we introduce a new concept of rainbow arrangements, generalizing colored pseudo-hyperplane arrangements. Along the way, we also show that the realizability problem for rainbow arrangements is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete, which also implies that the realizability problem for grid Unique Sink Orientations is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the following ``symmetric analogue'' of Lov\'asz's estimate (1975): if an $r$-partite hypergraph of rank $r\geqslant2$ has a cover of cardinality $n&lt;\infty$, then it admits a cover of cardinality at most $nr/2$, which is invariant with respect to all automorphisms preserving the parts. We obtain also symmetric analogues of generalisations of Lov\'asz's estimate due to Aharoni, Holzman, and Krivelevich (1996).</description>

      <title>Note on the trace of random walks on pseudorandom graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the graph-theoretic properties of the trace of random walks on pseudorandom graphs. We show that for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists a constant $C$ such that the cover time of an $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph $G$ with $d/\lambda\ge C$ is at most $(1+\varepsilon)n\log n$, meaning the expected number of steps needed to reach all vertices at least once is at most $(1+\varepsilon)n\log n$ regardless of the starting vertex. Furthermore, we prove that with high probability, the trace of a random walk of length $(1+\varepsilon)n\log n$ on $G$ is Hamiltonian, regardless of the starting vertex. These results also hold for random $d$-regular graphs with sufficiently large $d$. These findings answer two questions proposed by Frieze, Krivelevich, Michaeli, and Peled [PLMS, 2018]. Notably, our results imply a bound on a stronger version of the cover time: with high probability, all vertices are covered after $(1+\varepsilon)n\log n$ steps, regardless of the starting vertex. Our proofs rely on the spectral properties of the adjacency matrix and the graph expansion. All results are asymptotically optimal.</description>

Abstract: We construct a statistic-swapping involution on the Cartesian product of the generalized symmetric group $S(k,n)$ with the symmetric group $S_{kn}$, which swaps the number of fixed points in the generalized symmetric group element with the number of $k$-cycles in the symmetric group element. This gives a combinatorial proof for a probabilistic observation: the distribution of fixed points on $S(k,n)$ matches the distribution of $k$-cycles on $S_{kn}$.</description>

      <title>Permanents of matrix ensembles: computation, distribution, and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a computational and experimental study of permanents. On the computational side, we use the GPU to greaatly accelerate the computation of permanents over $\mathbb{C},$ $\mathbb{R},$ $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Q}.$ In particular, we use this to compute the permanents of DFT and Schur matrices far beyond the ranges hitherto known. On the experimental side, we present two new observations. First, for Haar-distributed unitary matrices~$U$, the permanent $\perm(U)$ follows a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma^2)$ -- we confirm this via a number of tests for $n$ up to~23 with $50{,}000$ samples. The DFT matrix permanent is an extreme outlier for every prime $n\ge 7$. In contrast, for Haar-random \emph{orthogonal} matrices~$O$, the permanent $\perm(O)$ is approximately real Gaussian but with positive excess kurtosis that decays as~$O(1/n)$, indicating slower convergence. For matrices with Gaussian entries (GUE, GOE, Ginibre), the permanent follows an $\alpha$-stable distribution with stability index $\alpha\approx 1.0$--$1.4$, well below the Gaussian value $\alpha=2$.
  Secondly, we study the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group. For the geodesic from the identity to the $n$-cycle permutation matrix, we find a universal scaling function $f(t)=\frac{1}{n}\ln|\perm(\gamma(t))|$ that is independent of~$n$ in the large-$n$ limit, with a midpoint value \[
  \perm(\gamma({\textstyle\frac12}))
  = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\cdot 2e^{-n}\bigl(1+\tfrac{1}{3n}+O(n^{-2})\bigr) \] for odd~$n$ and zero for even~$n$. For the geodesic to the DFT matrix, the permanent recovers $10$--$40$ times above its valley minimum when $n$ is prime, but not when $n$ is composite -- a geodesic fingerprint of primality.</description>

      <title>Metric geometry for ranking-based voting: Tools for learning electoral structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the metric geometry of ranking statistics, proving that the two major permutation distances in the statistics literature -- Kendall tau and Spearman footrule -- extend naturally to incomplete rankings with both coordinate embeddings and graph realizations. This gives us a unifying framework that allows us to connect popular topics in computational social choice: metric preferences (and metric distortion), polarization, and proportionality.
  As an important application, the metric structure enables efficient identification of blocs of voters and slates of their preferred candidates. Since the definitions work for partial ballots, we can execute the methods not only on synthetic elections, but on a suite of real-world elections. This gives us robust clustering methods that often produce an identical grouping of voters -- even though one family of methods is based on a Condorcet-consistent ranking rule while the other is not.</description>

      <title>Realizable (reg, deg h)-Pairs for Cover Ideals via Independence Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph on $n$ vertices and set $R=\Bbbk[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, with edge ideal $I(G)$ and cover ideal $J(G)$. We give an explicit description of the $h$-polynomial of $R/J(G)$, in a form that extends to the Alexander dual of any squarefree monomial ideal. We then express $\textrm{deg } h_{R/I(G)}(t)$ and $\textrm{deg } h_{R/J(G)}(t)$ in terms of the independence polynomial $P_G(x)=\sum_{i\ge 0} g_i x^i$ via an invariant $M(G)$, the multiplicity of $x=-1$ as a root of $P_G(x)$. In particular, we prove \[\textrm{deg } h_{R/I(G)}(t)=\alpha(G)-M(G) \qquad\text{and}\qquad \textrm{deg } h_{R/J(G)}(t)=n-2-M(G), \] where $\alpha(G)$ is the independence number of $G$. As a corollary, $M(G)$ is the additive inverse of the $\mathfrak{a}$-invariants of $R/I(G)$ and $R/J(G)$. We develop recursions and closed formulas for $M(G)$ for broad graph families, and use them to analyze which (reg, deg h)-pairs occur for cover ideals within chordal classes, including explicit constructions realizing extremal behavior. We conclude with a conjectural bound on $\left|\textrm{reg }(R/J(G))-\textrm{deg } h_{R/J(G)}(t)\right|$ for connected graphs.</description>

      <title>Finite-sample confidence regions for spectral clustering and graph centrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let a graph be observed through a finite random sampling mechanism. Spectral methods are routinely applied to such graphs, yet their outputs are treated as deterministic objects. This paper develops finite-sample inference for spectral graph procedures.
  The primary result constructs explicit confidence regions for latent eigenspaces of graph operators under an explicit sampling model. These regions propagate to confidence regions for spectral clustering assignments and for smooth graph centrality functionals. All bounds are nonasymptotic and depend explicitly on the sample size, noise level, and spectral gap.
  The analysis isolates a failure of common practice: asymptotic perturbation arguments are often invoked without a finite-sample spectral gap, leading to invalid uncertainty claims. Under verifiable gap and concentration conditions, the present framework yields coverage guarantees and certified stability regions. Several corollaries address fairness-constrained post-processing and topological summaries derived from spectral embeddings.</description>

      <title>Exact determinant formulas for coalescing particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When particles on a line collide, they may coalesce into one. Such systems model diverse phenomena, from voter dynamics and opinion formation to ancestral lineages in population genetics. Computing exact coalescence probabilities has been difficult because collisions reduce the particle count, while classical determinantal methods require a fixed count throughout. We introduce ghost particles: when two particles merge, the discarded trajectory continues as an invisible walker. Ghosts restore the missing dimension, enabling an exact determinantal formula. We prove that the probability of any specified coalescence pattern is given by a determinant. Integrating out ghost positions yields a closed-form ghost-free formula for the surviving particles. The framework applies to discrete lattice paths, birth-death chains, and continuous diffusions including Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Implicit representations via the polynomial method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semialgebraic graphs are graphs whose vertices are points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and adjacency between two vertices is determined by the truth value of a semialgebraic predicate of constant complexity. We show how to harness polynomial partitioning methods to construct compact adjacency labeling schemes for families of semialgebraic graphs.
  That is, we show that for any family of semialgebraic graphs, given a graph on $n$ vertices in this family, we can assign a label consisting of $O(n^{1-2/(d+1) + \varepsilon})$ bits to each vertex (where $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ can be made arbitrarily small and the constant of proportionality depends on $\varepsilon$ and on the complexity of the adjacency-defining predicate), such that adjacency between two vertices can be determined solely from their two labels, without any additional information. We obtain for instance that unit disk graphs and segment intersection graphs have such labelings with labels of $O(n^{1/3 + \varepsilon})$ bits. This is in contrast to their natural implicit representation consisting of the coordinates of the disk centers or segment endpoints, which sometimes require exponentially many bits. It also improves on the best known bound of $O(n^{1-1/d}\log n)$ for $d$-dimensional semialgebraic families due to Alon (Discrete Comput. Geom., 2024), a bound that holds more generally for graphs with shattering functions bounded by a degree-$d$ polynomial.
  We also give new bounds on the size of adjacency labels for other families of graphs. In particular, we consider semilinear graphs, which are semialgebraic graphs in which the predicate only involves linear polynomials. We show that semilinear graphs have adjacency labels of size $O(\log n)$. We also prove that polygon visibility graphs, which are not semialgebraic in the above sense, have adjacency labels of size $O(\log^3 n)$.</description>

      <title>Multicolor Ramsey Number for Double Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $H$ and an integer $k\ge1$, let $r(H;k)$ and $r_\ell(H;k)$ denote the $k$-color Ramsey number and list Ramsey number of $H$, respectively. Alon, Buci\'c, Kalvari, Kuperwasser and Szab\'o in 2021 initiated the systematic study of list Ramsey numbers of graphs and hypergraphs, and conjectured that $ r(K_{1,n};k)$ and $r_\ell(K_{1,n};k)$ are always equal. Motivated by their work, we study the $k$-color Ramsey number for double stars $S(n,m)$, where $n\ge m\ge1$. To the best of our knowledge, little is known on the exact value of $r(S(n,m);k)$ when $k\ge3$. A classic result of Erd\H{o}s and Graham from 1975 asserts that $r(T;k)&gt;k(n-1)+1$ for every tree $T$ with $n\ge 1$ edges and $k$ sufficiently large such that $n$ divides $k-1$. Using a folklore double counting argument in set system and the edge chromatic number of complete graphs, we prove that if $k$ is odd and $n$ is sufficiently large compared with $m$ and $k$, then \[ r(S(n,m);k)=kn+m+2.\] This is a step in our effort to determine whether $r(S(n,m);k)$ and $r_\ell(S(n,m);k)$ are always equal, which remains wide open. We also prove that $ r(S^m_n;k)=k(n-1)+m+2$ if $k $ is odd and $n$ is sufficiently large compared with $m$ and $k$, where $1\le m\le n$ and $S^m_n$ is obtained from $K_{1, n}$ by subdividing $m$ edges each exactly once. We end the paper with some observations towards the list Ramsey number for $S(n,m)$ and $S^m_n$.</description>

      <title>Acyclic colourings of graphs with obstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, a colouring of $G$ is \emph{acyclic} if it is a proper colouring of $G$ and every cycle contains at least three colours. Its acyclic chromatic number $\chi_a(G)$ is the minimum~$k$ such that an acyclic $k$-colouring of $G$ exists. When $G$ has maximum degree $\Delta$, it is known that $\chi_a(G) = \mathcal {O}(\Delta^{4/3})$ as $\Delta \to \infty$, and that $\chi_a(G) = \mathcal {O}(\sqrt{t} \cdot \Delta)$ if in addition $G$ does not contain $K_{2,t}$ as a subgraph. We study the extremal value of the acyclic chromatic number in the class of graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ that do not contain some fixed subgraph $F$ on $t$ vertices. We establish that this extremal value is at most $\mathcal {O}(t^{8/3}\Delta^{2/3})$ if $F$ is a tree, $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt{t} \cdot \Delta)$ if $F$ is bipartite and can be made acyclic with the removal of one vertex, $2\Delta + \mathcal {O}(t\Delta^{2/3})$ if $F$ is an even cycle of length at least $6$, and $\mathcal {O}(t^{1/4}\Delta^{5/4})$ if $F=K_{3,t}$. Moreover, we exhibit an infinite family of obstructions $F$ that each induces a different asymptotic behaviour for this extremal value. This is obtained with the derivation of lower bounds that come from the analysis of the acyclic chromatic number of a random graph drawn from either $G(n,p)$ or $G(n,n,p)$, that we entirely determine up to a ${\rm polylog}(n)$ factor. As a byproduct, we can certify that most of our results are tight up to a $\Delta^{\mathcal{O}(1/t)}$ factor.</description>

Abstract: We develop the notion of Wilf-Zeilberger seeds as a powerful framework for generating WZ-pairs and for lifting classical hypergeometric identities to the $q$-setting. As an application, we systematically obtain a large family of $q$-analogues of Ramanujan-type $1/\pi^k$ formulas, extending a literature previously limited to sporadic examples. While the majority of these $q$-analogues are modular, we also uncover several curious instances of mock modularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct explicit families of polynomials $P \in \mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ with large root sets which have restricted intersections with affine lines. We use these sets to make substantial progress on a number of problems in extremal combinatorics.
  For each prime power $q$ and integer $2 \le t \le q-1$, we construct $t$-line evasive subsets of $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ of size \[ q^{\,n\left(1-\frac{2}{t^2+t}\right)}, \] which is significantly larger than those previously known. Moreover, our method yields a partition of $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ into such sets.
  We extend this partitioning result to the projective space $PG(n,q)$, obtaining the first explicit colorings for the vector space Ramsey number $R_q(2;k)$ that exhibit dependence on both $q$ and $k$. In particular, we show that \[ R_q(2;k) &gt; \frac{(q-1)k}{2} - O_q(1), \] improving recent bounds.
  Finally, we apply these constructions to extremal graph theory and improve the best-known bounds on the bipartite Tur\'an number $ \mathrm{ex}(n,m,\{C_4,\theta_{3,t}\})$. Most notably, we show that \[ \mathrm{ex}(n,n^{2/3},\{C_4,\theta_{3,3}\}) = \Theta(n^{1+1/9}), \] making progress on a question originally posed by Erd\H{o}s.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erd{\H o}s (1963) initiated extensive graph discrepancy research on 2-edge-colored graphs. Gishboliner, Krivelevich, and Michaeli (2023) launched similar research on oriented graphs. They conjectured the following extension of Dirac's theorem: If $D$ is an oriented graph on $n \ge 3$ vertices with minimum degree $\delta (D) \ge n/ 2$, then $D$ contains a Hamilton oriented cycle with at least $\delta(D)$ arcs in the same direction. This conjecture was proved by Freschi and Lo (2024) who posed an open problem to extend their result to an Ore-type condition. We propose two conjectures for such extensions and prove results which provide support to the conjectures.</description>

      <title>Complexity Framework For Forbidden Subgraphs V: Beyond Simple Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of the recently-introduced C123-framework, for (simple) graph problems restricted to inputs specified by the forbidding of some finite set of subgraphs, to more general graph problems possibly involving multiedges and self-loops. We study specifically the problems Multigraph Matching Cut, Multigraph d-Cut and Partially Reflexive Stable Cut in this connection. The last may be seen as a Surjective Homomorphism problem to a path P_3 in which both leaves are looped while the interior vertex is loopless. We consider also another family of Surjective Homomorphism problems to a cycle in which only one vertex is loopless.
  When one forbids a single (simple) subgraph, our first three problems exhibit the same complexity behaviour as C123-problems, but on finite sets of forbidden subgraphs, the classification appears more complex. While Multigraph Matching Cut and Multigraph d-Cut have the same classification as C123-problems, already Partially Reflexive Stable Cut fails to have. This is witnessed by forbidding as subgraphs both C_3 and H_1. Indeed, the difference of behaviour occurs only around pendant subdivisions of nets and pendant subdivisions of H_1. We examine this area in close detail.
  Our other Surjective Homomorphism problem, ostensibly somewhat similar to Partially Reflexive Stable Cut, behaves very differently when the input is restricted to some class that is H-subgraph-free. For example, it is solvable in polynomial time on any class of bounded degree. Also, its hardness will never be preserved under any form of edge subdivision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a unique decomposition of every 4-connected graph into parts that are either quasi-5-connected, cycles of triangle-torsos and 3-connected torsos on $\leq 5$ vertices, generalised double-wheels, or thickened $K_{4,m}$'s. The decomposition can be described in terms of a tree-decomposition but with edges allowed in the adhesion-sets. Our construction is explicit, canonical, and exhibits a defining property of the Tutte-decomposition.
  As a corollary, we obtain a new Tutte-type canonical decomposition of 3-connected graphs into parts that are either quasi-4-connected, generalised wheels or thickened $K_{3,m}$'s. This decomposition is similar yet different from the tri-separation decomposition.
  As an application of the decomposition for 4-connectivity, in a follow-up paper we obtain a new theorem characterising all vertex-transitive finite connected graphs as essentially quasi-5-connected or on a short explicit list of graphs.</description>

      <title>New bounds for proper $h$-conflict-free colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proper $k$-colouring of a graph $G$ is called $h$-conflict-free if every vertex $v$ has at least $\min\, \{h, {\rm deg}(v)\}$ colours appearing exactly once in its neighbourhood. Let $\chi_{\rm pcf}^h(G)$ denote the minimum $k$ such that such a colouring exists. We show that for every fixed $h\ge 1$, every graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ satisfies $\chi_{\rm pcf}^h(G) \le h\Delta + \mathcal{O}(\log \Delta)$. This expands on the work of Cho et al., and improves a recent result of Liu and Reed in the case $h=1$. We conjecture that for every $h\ge 1$ and every graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ sufficiently large, the bound $\chi_{\rm pcf}^h(G) \le h\Delta + 1$ should hold, which would be tight. When the minimum degree $\delta$ of $G$ is sufficiently large, namely $\delta \ge \max\{100h, 2000\log \Delta\}$, we show that this upper bound can be further reduced to $\chi_{\rm{pcf}}^h(G) \le \Delta + \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{h\Delta})$. This improves a recent bound from Kamyczura and Przyby{\l}o when $\delta \le \sqrt{h\Delta}$.</description>

      <title>Nordhaus-Gaddum-type theorems for maximum average degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $k$-decomposition $(G_1,\dots,G_k)$ of a graph $G$ is a partition of its edge set into $k$ spanning subgraphs $G_1,\dots,G_k$. The classical theorem of Nordhaus and Gaddum bounds $\chi(G_1) + \chi(G_2)$ and $\chi(G_1) \chi(G_2)$ over all 2-decompositions of $K_n$. For a graph parameter $p$, let $p(k,G) = \max \{ \sum_{i=1}^k p(Gi) \}$, taken over all $k$-decompositions of graph $G$. In this paper we consider $M(k,K_n) = M(k,n) = \max \{ \sum_{i=1}^k \mathrm{Mad}(G_i) \}$, taken over all $k$-decompositions of the complete graph $K_n$, where $\mathrm{Mad}(G)$ denotes the maximum average degree of $G$, $\mathrm{Mad}(G) = \max \{ 2e(H)/|H| : H \subseteq G \} = \max \{d(H) : H \subseteq G \}$. Among the many results obtained in this paper we mention the following selected ones.
  (1) $M(k, n) &lt; \sqrt{k} n$, and $\lim_{k\to\infty} ( \liminf_{n\to\infty} \frac{M(k,n)}{\sqrt{k}\,n} ) = 1$.
  (2) Exact determination of $M(2,n)$.
  (3) Exact determination of $M(k,n)$ when $k = \binom{n}{2} - t$, $0 \leq t\leq (n-1)^2/3$.
  Applications of these bounds to other parameters considered before in the literature are given.</description>

      <title>Enumerating planar stuffed maps as hypertrees of mobiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A planar stuffed map is an embedding of a graph into the 2-sphere $S^{2}$, considered up to orientation-preserving homeomorphisms, such that the complement of the graph is a collection of disjoint topologically connected components that are each homeomorphic to $S^{2}$ with multiple boundaries. This is a generalization of planar maps whose complement of the graph is a collection of disjoint topologically connected components that are each homeomorphic to a disc. The main goal of this work is to construct a bijection between bipartite planar stuffed maps and collections of integer-labelled trees connected by hyperedges such that they form a hypertree, called hypermobiles. This bijection directly generalizes the Bouttier-Di Franceso-Guitter bijection between bipartite planar maps and mobiles. Additionally, we show that the generating functions of these trees of mobiles satisfy both an algebraic equation, generalizing the case of ordinary planar maps, and a new functional equation. As an example, we explicitly enumerate a class of stuffed quadrangulations.</description>

      <title>Refuting Perfect Matchings in Spectral Expanders is Hard</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the complexity of refuting the existence of a perfect matching in spectral expanders with an odd number of vertices, in the Polynomial Calculus (PC) and Sum of Squares (SoS) proof system. Austrin and Risse [SODA, 2021] showed that refuting perfect matchings in sparse $d$-regular \emph{random} graphs, in the above proof systems, with high probability requires proofs with degree $\Omega(n/\log n)$. We extend their result by showing the same lower bound holds for \emph{all} $d$-regular graphs with a mild spectral gap.</description>

As a result, if $\mathcal{G}$ is the class of all circle graphs, or if $\mathcal{G}$ is any class with bounded twin-width, bounded merge-width, or a forbidden vertex-minor, then $\mathcal{G}$ is $\chi_{\mathrm{o}}$-bounded.</description>

      <title>Some exact inducibility-type results for graphs via flag algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01596v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $(\kappa,\ell)$-edge-inducibility problem asks for the maximum number of $\kappa$-subsets inducing exactly $\ell$ edges that a graph of given order $n$ can have. Using flag algebras and stability approach, we resolve this problem for all sufficiently large $n$ (including a description of all extremal and almost extremal graphs) in eleven new non-trivial cases when $\kappa\le 7$.
  We also compute the $F$-inducibility constant (the asymptotically maximum density of induced copies of $F$ in a graph of given order $n$) and obtain some corresponding structure results for three new graphs $F$ with $5$ vertices: the 3-edge star plus an isolated vertex, the 4-cycle plus an isolated vertex, and the 4-cycle with a pendant edge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the rank polynomial of the lattice of order ideals of a loop fence poset is unimodal. This poset arises as the poset of join-irreducibles in the lattice of good matchings of loop graphs associated with notched arcs. Equivalently, such polynomials can be obtained by evaluating all coefficient variables in an F-polynomial at a single variable q. We also conclude that the rank polynomial of any tagged arc, whether plain or notched, is not only unimodal but also satisfies a symmetry condition known as almost interlacing. Furthermore, when the lamination consists of a single curve, the cluster expansion-evaluated by setting all cluster variables to 1 and all coefficient variables to q-is also unimodal. We conjecture that polynomials in this case are log-concave.</description>

Abstract: We consider a general way to obtain Pr\'ekopa-Leindler and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb type inequalities from Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities and provide numerous examples. We use the same heuristic to prove a discrete version of the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities for functions over $\mathbb{Z}^d$. These are the functional extensions of the discrete Brunn-Minkowski inequality conjectured by Ruzsa and recently established by Keevash, Tiba, and the author.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate three properties conjectured to hold for a certain function by Levin (2025) in a study of the blimpy graphical shape of the number of bit strings with a given score under an interesting scoring system. The properties include discrete convexity, a simple formula for the greatest argument at which the function is negative, and a positive expectation under a certain probability function. A new set of inequalities which imply the latter is presented and proved under some monotonicity assumptions.</description>

      <title>On the strength of connectedness of unions of random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G_1,\dots, G_m$ be independent identically distributed random subgraphs of the complete graph ${\cal K}_n$. We analyse the threshold behaviour of the strength of connectedness of the union $\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ defined on the vertex set of ${\cal K}_n$. Let $a=\min\{t\ge 1:\, {\bf P}\{\delta(G_1)=t&gt;0\}\}$ be the minimal non zero vertex degree attained with positive probability. Given $k\ge 0$ let $\lambda(k)=\ln n+k\ln\frac{m}{n}-\frac{m}{n} {\bf E} X$, where $X$ stands for the number of non isolated vertices of $G_1$. Letting $n,m\to+\infty$ we show that ${\bf P}\{\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ is $a(k+1)$-connected$\} \to 1 $ for $\lambda(k)\to -\infty$, and ${\bf P}\{\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ is $ak+1$-connected$\} \to 0 $ for $\lambda(k)\to +\infty$. In particular, the connectivity strength of the union graph $\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ increases in steps of size $a$. Our results are obtained in a more general setting where the contributing random subgraphs do not need to be identically distributed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1512.03127v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine some flexible notions of constraint satisfaction, observing some relationships between model theoretic notions of universal Horn class membership and robust satisfiability. We show the \texttt{NP}-completeness of $2$-robust monotone 1-in-3 3SAT in order to give very small examples of finite algebras with \texttt{NP}-hard variety membership problem. In particular we give a $3$-element algebra with this property, and solve a widely stated problem by showing that the $6$-element Brandt monoid has \texttt{NP}-hard variety membership problem. These are the smallest possible sizes for a general algebra and a semigroup to exhibit \texttt{NP}-hardness for the membership problem of finite algebras in finitely generated varieties.</description>

      <title>Sparse Approximation in Lattices and Semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the following question: Suppose that there exist an integer or a non-negative integer solution $x$ to a system $Ax = b$, where the number of non-zero components of $x$ is $n$. The target is, for a given natural number $k &lt; n$, to approximate $b$ with $Ay$ where $y$ is an integer or non-negative integer solution with at most $k$ non-zero components. We establish upper bounds for this question in general. In specific cases, these bounds are tight. If we view the approximation quality as a function of the parameter $k$, then the paper explains why the quality of the approximation increases exponentially as $k$ goes to $n$. This paper is a complete version of an extended abstract that appeared at the 26th International Conference on Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization (IPCO).</description>

Abstract: Faulhaber's formula expresses the sum of the first $n$ positive integers, each raised to an integer power $p\geq 0$, as a polynomial in $n$ of degree $p+1$. Ramanujan expressed this sum for $p\in\{\frac12,\frac32,\frac52,\frac72\}$ as the sum of a polynomial in $\sqrt{n}$ and a certain infinite series. In the present work, we explore the connection to Bernoulli polynomials, and by generalizing those to formal series, we extend the Ramanujan result to all positive half-integers $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a seminal 2005 paper, Haagerup and Thorbj{\o}rnsen discovered that the norm of any noncommutative polynomial of independent complex Gaussian random matrices converges to that of a limiting family of operators that arises from Voiculescu's free probability theory. In recent years, new methods have made it possible to establish such strong convergence properties in much more general situations, and to obtain even more powerful quantitative forms of the strong convergence phenomenon. These, in turn, have led to a number of spectacular applications to long-standing open problems on random graphs, hyperbolic surfaces, and operator algebras, and have provided flexible new tools that enable the study of random matrices in unexpected generality. This survey aims to provide an introduction to this circle of ideas.</description>

      <title>Tight Bounds for Sparsifying Random CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of CSP sparsification asks: for a given CSP instance, what is the sparsest possible reweighting such that for every possible assignment to the instance, the number of satisfied constraints is preserved up to a factor of $1 \pm \epsilon$? We initiate the study of the sparsification of random CSPs. In particular, we consider two natural random models: the $r$-partite model and the uniform model. In the $r$-partite model, CSPs are formed by partitioning the variables into $r$ parts, with constraints selected by randomly picking one vertex out of each part. In the uniform model, $r$ distinct vertices are chosen at random from the pool of variables to form each constraint.
  In the $r$-partite model, we exhibit a sharp threshold phenomenon. For every predicate $P$, there is an integer $k$ such that a random instance on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges cannot (essentially) be sparsified if $m \le n^k$ and can be sparsified to size $\approx n^k$ if $m \ge n^k$. Here, $k$ corresponds to the largest copy of the AND which can be found within $P$. Furthermore, these sparsifiers are simple, as they can be constructed by i.i.d. sampling of the edges.
  In the uniform model, the situation is a bit more complex. For every predicate $P$, there is an integer $k$ such that a random instance on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges cannot (essentially) be sparsified if $m \le n^k$ and can sparsified to size $\approx n^k$ if $m \ge n^{k+1}$. However, for some predicates $P$, if $m \in [n^k, n^{k+1}]$, there may or may not be a nontrivial sparsifier. In fact, we show that there are predicates where the sparsifiability of random instances is non-monotone, i.e., as we add more random constraints, the instances become more sparsifiable. We give a precise (efficiently computable) procedure for determining which situation a specific predicate $P$ falls into.</description>

      <title>Relatively closed subgroups of permutation groups with a cyclic regular normal subgroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by some known problems concerning combinatorial structures associated with finite one-dimensional affine permutation groups, we study subgroups which are closed in $\operatorname{\Gamma{L}}_1(q)$. This brings us to a description of the relatively closed subgroups of permutation groups with a cyclic regular normal subgroup. Our results, in particular, provide a classification of the minimal nontrivial one-dimensional affine association schemes which generalizes the recent Muzychuk classification of the one-dimensional affine rank 3 graphs.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits of critical FK-decorated random planar maps with $q=4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the first scaling limit for FK($q$)-weighted planar maps in the critical case $q=4$, resolving a problem that has remained open since Sheffield's seminal work arXiv:1108.2241. In that work, Sheffield proved a scaling limit for $q&lt;4$ via the celebrated hamburger-cheeseburger bijection, which initiated the peanosphere (mating-of-trees) approach to Liouville quantum gravity. We prove that, at criticality, the associated burger count $\mathcal{S}$ and discrepancy $\mathcal{D}$ satisfy \[ \left(\frac{\mathcal{S}_{\lfloor nt \rfloor}}{\sqrt{n}}, \frac{\log(n)}{{2\pi }\sqrt{n}} \mathcal{D}_{\lfloor nt \rfloor}\right)_{t\in\mathbb{R}} \stackrel{\text{d}}{\longrightarrow} (B^1_t, B^2_{t})_{t\in\mathbb{R}}, \] where $B^1$ and $B^2$ are independent two-sided Brownian motions. To the best of our knowledge, no conjecture for the correct discrepancy scaling factor had previously been formulated. Matching the limiting process with the critical mating of trees arXiv:2109.00275, we establish the first rigorous planar map convergence towards CLE$_4$ and critical ($\gamma=2$) Liouville quantum gravity, in the peanosphere sense. Our proof is based on a novel approach that reveals the exactly solvable nature of the model through a correspondence with the (bicoloured) fully packed loop-$O(2)$ model on triangulations, and yields critical geometric exponents matching the predictions of conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>On homological invariants and Cohen-Macaulayness of closed neighborhood ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph and $NI(G)$ be the closed neighborhood ideal of $G$ in the polynomial ring $S=K[V(G)]$. In this paper, we study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, projective dimension and Cohen-Macaulayness of this ideal. For any chordal graph $G$, we show that $\text{reg}(S/NI(G))=\tau(G)$, where $\tau(G)$ denotes the vertex cover number of $G$. This generalizes the corresponding result for trees shown in [3], as in trees $\tau(G)$ is the same as the matching number of $G$. When $G$ is a bipartite graph or a very well-covered graph, we notice that $\text{reg}(S/NI(G))\geq \tau(G)$ and that this inequality can be strict in general. Moreover, we describe the projective dimension of $S/NI(G)$ for some families of graphs. Finally, we give a characterization of very well-covered graphs $G$ for which the ring $S/NI(G)$ is Cohen-Macaulay.</description>
