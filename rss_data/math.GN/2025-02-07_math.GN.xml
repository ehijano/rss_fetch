      <title>Totally bounded ultrametric spaces and locally finite trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interrelations between the metric properties, order properties and combinatorial properties of the set of balls in totally bounded ultrametric space. In particular, the Gurvich-Vyalyi representation of finite, ultrametric spaces by monotone rooted trees is generalized to the case of totally bounded ultrametric spaces. It is shown that such spaces have isometric completions if and only if their labeled representing trees are isomorphic. We characterize up to isomorphism the representing trees of these spaces and, up to order isomorphism, the posets of open balls in such spaces.</description>

      <title>Tranched graphs: consequences for topology and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare quasi-graphs and generalized $\sin(1/x)$-type continua, which are two classes of continua that generalize topological graphs and contain the Warsaw circle as a nontrivial common element. We show that neither class is a subset of the other, provide some characterizations, and present illustrative examples. We unify both approaches by considering the class of tranched graphs, compare it to concepts known from the literature, and describe how the topological structure of its elements restricts possible dynamics.</description>

      <title>Partitions of primitive Boolean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Boolean ring and its Stone space (Boolean space) are primitive if the ring is disjointly generated by its pseudo-indecomposable (PI) elements. Hanf showed that a primitive PI Boolean algebra can be uniquely defined by a structure diagram. In a previous paper we defined trim $P$-partitions of a Stone space, where $P$ is a PO system (poset with a distinguished subset), and showed how they provide a physical representation within the Stone space of these structure diagrams.
  In this paper we study the class of trim partitions of a fixed primitive Boolean space, which may not be compact, and show how they can be structured as a quasi-ordered set via an appropriate refinement relation. This refinement relation corresponds to a surjective morphism of the associated PO systems, and we establish a quasi-order isomorphism between the class of well-behaved partitions of a primitive space and a class of extended PO systems.
  We also define rank partitions, which generalise the rank diagrams introduced by Myers, and the ideal completion of a trim $P$-partition, whose underlying PO system is the ideal completion of $P$, and show that rank partitions are just the ideal completions of trim partitions. In the process, we extend a number of existing results regarding primitive Boolean algebras or compact primitive Boolean spaces to locally compact Boolean spaces.</description>
