      <title>Recognizing Relating Edges in Graphs without Cycles of Length 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is well-covered if all maximal independent sets are of the same cardinality. Let $w:V(G) \longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a weight function. Then $G$ is $w$-well-covered if all maximal independent sets are of the same weight. An edge $xy \in E(G)$ is relating if there exists an independent set $S$ such that both $S \cup \{x\}$ and $S \cup \{y\}$ are maximal independent sets in the graph. If $xy$ is relating then $w(x)=w(y)$ for every weight function $w$ such that $G$ is $w$-well-covered. Relating edges play an important role in investigating $w$-well-covered graphs.
  The decision problem whether an edge in a graph is relating is NP-complete. We prove that the problem remains NP-complete when the input is restricted to graphs without cycles of length $6$. This is an unexpected result because recognizing relating edges is known to be polynomially solvable for graphs without cycles of lengths $4$ and $6$, graphs without cycles of lengths $5$ and $6$, and graphs without cycles of lengths $6$ and $7$.
  A graph $G$ belongs to the class $W_2$ if every two pairwise disjoint independent sets in $G$ are included in two pairwise disjoint maximum independent sets. It is known that if $G$ belongs to the class $W_2$, then it is well-covered. A vertex $v \in V(G)$ is shedding if for every independent set $S \subseteq V(G)-N[v]$, there exists a vertex $u \in N(v)$ such that $S \cup \{u\}$ is independent. Shedding vertices play an important role in studying the class $W_2$. Recognizing shedding vertices is co-NP-complete, even when the input is restricted to triangle-free graphs. We prove that the problem is co-NP-complete for graphs without cycles of length $6$.</description>

      <title>Colorful Intersections and Tverberg Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The colorful Helly theorem and Tverberg's theorem are fundamental results in discrete geometry. We prove a theorem which interpolates between the two. In particular, we show the following for any integers $d \geq m \geq 1$ and $k$ a prime power. Suppose $F_1, F_2, \dots, F_m$ are families of convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, each of size $n &gt; (\frac{d}{m}+1)(k-1)$, such that for any choice $C_i\in F_i$ we have $\bigcap_{i=1}^mC_i\neq \emptyset$. Then, one of the families $F_i$ admits a Tverberg $k$-partition. That is, one of the $F_i$ can be partitioned into $k$ nonempty parts such that the convex hulls of the parts have nonempty intersection. As a corollary, we also obtain a result concerning $r$-dimensional transversals to families of convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that satisfy the colorful Helly hypothesis, which extends the work of Karasev and Montejano.</description>

      <title>Canon permutations and generalized descents of standard Young tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canon permutations are permutations of the multiset having $k$ copies of each integer between $1$ and $n$, with the property that the subsequences obtained by taking the $j$th copy of each entry, for each fixed $j$, are all the same. For $k=2$, canon permutations are sometimes called nonnesting permutations, and it is known that the polynomial that enumerates them by the number of descents factors as a product of an Eulerian polynomial and a Narayana polynomial. We extend this result to arbitrary $k$, and we relate the problem to the enumeration of standard Young tableaux of rectangular shape with respect to generalized descent statistics. Our proof is bijective, and it also settles a conjecture of Sulanke about the distribution of certain lattice path statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce stable multivariate generalizations of Narayana polynomials of type A and type B. Our polynomials are multivariate generating polynomials over labeled plane trees and can be generated by a grammatical labeling based on a context-free grammar. Our proof of real stability uses a characterization of stable-preserving linear operators due to Borcea and Br\"and\'en.</description>

      <title>Flip-Breakability: A Combinatorial Dichotomy for Monadically Dependent Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conjecture in algorithmic model theory predicts that the model-checking problem for first-order logic is fixed-parameter tractable on a hereditary graph class if and only if the class is monadically dependent. Originating in model theory, this notion is defined in terms of logic, and encompasses nowhere dense classes, monadically stable classes, and classes of bounded twin-width. Working towards this conjecture, we provide the first two combinatorial characterizations of monadically dependent graph classes. This yields the following dichotomy.
  On the structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by a Ramsey-theoretic property called flip-breakability. This notion generalizes the notions of uniform quasi-wideness, flip-flatness, and bounded grid rank, which characterize nowhere denseness, monadic stability, and bounded twin-width, respectively, and played a key role in their respective model checking algorithms. Natural restrictions of flip-breakability additionally characterize bounded treewidth and cliquewidth and bounded treedepth and shrubdepth.
  On the non-structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by explicitly listing few families of forbidden induced subgraphs. This result is analogous to the characterization of nowhere denseness via forbidden subdivided cliques, and allows us to resolve one half of the motivating conjecture: First-order model checking is AW[$*$]-hard on every hereditary graph class that is monadically independent. The result moreover implies that hereditary graph classes which are small, have almost bounded twin-width, or have almost bounded flip-width, are monadically dependent.
  Lastly, we lift our result to also obtain a combinatorial dichotomy in the more general setting of monadically dependent classes of binary structures.</description>

      <title>On the matching complexes of categorical product of path graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matching complex $\mathsf{M}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is a simplicial complex whose simplices are matchings in $G$. These complexes appears in various places and found applications in many areas of mathematics including; discrete geometry, representation theory, combinatorics, etc. In this article, we consider the matching complexes of categorical product $P_n \times P_m$ of path graphs $P_n$ and $P_m$. For $m = 1$, $P_n \times P_m$ is a discrete graph and therefore its matching complex is the void complex. For $m = 2$, $\mathsf{M}(P_n \times P_m)$ has been proved to be homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres by Kozlov. We show that for $n \geq 2$ and $3 \leq m \leq 5$, the matching complex of $P_n \times P_m$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres. For $m =3$, we give a closed form formula for the number and dimension of spheres appearing in the wedge. Further, for $m \in \{4, 5\}$, we give minimum and maximum dimension of spheres appearing in the wedge in the homotopy type of $\mathsf{M}(P_n \times P_m)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2017, Aharoni proposed the following generalization of the Caccetta-H\"{a}ggkvist conjecture: if $G$ is a simple $n$-vertex edge-colored graph with $n$ color classes of size at least $r$, then $G$ contains a rainbow cycle of length at most $\lceil n/r \rceil$.
  In this paper, we prove that, for fixed $r$, Aharoni's conjecture holds up to an additive constant. Specifically, we show that for each fixed $r \geq 1$, there exists a constant $c_r$ such that if $G$ is a simple $n$-vertex edge-colored graph with $n$ color classes of size at least $r$, then $G$ contains a rainbow cycle of length at most $n/r + c_r$.</description>

Abstract: Firstly studied by Kempa and Prezza in 2018 as the cement of text compression algorithms, string attractors have become a compelling object of theoretical research within the community of combinatorics on words. In this context, they have been studied for several families of finite and infinite words. In this paper, we obtain string attractors of prefixes of particular infinite words generalizing k-bonacci words (including the famous Fibonacci word) and related to simple Parry numbers. In fact, our description involves the numeration systems classically derived from the considered morphisms. This extends our previous work published in the international conference WORDS 2023.</description>

      <title>A framework unifying some bijections for graphs and its connection to Lawrence polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07376v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph. The Jacobian group (also known as the Picard group or sandpile group) of $G$ is a finite abelian group whose cardinality equals the number of spanning trees of $G$. The Jacobian group admits a canonical simply transitive action on the set $\mathcal{R}(G)$ of cycle-cocycle reversal classes of orientations of $G$. Hence one can construct combinatorial bijections between spanning trees of $G$ and $\mathcal{R}(G)$ to build connections between spanning trees and the Jacobian group. The BBY bijections and the Bernardi bijections are two important examples. In this paper, we construct a new family of such bijections that includes both. Our bijections depend on a pair of atlases (different from the ones in manifold theory) that abstract and generalize certain common features of the two known bijections. The definitions of these atlases are derived from triangulations and dissections of the Lawrence polytopes associated to $G$. The acyclic cycle signatures and cocycle signatures used to define the BBY bijections correspond to regular triangulations. Our bijections can extend to subgraph-orientation correspondences. Most of our results hold for regular matroids. We present our work in the language of fourientations, which are a generalization of orientations.</description>

      <title>Dually conformal hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, the dual hypergraph of $\mathcal{H}$ is the hypergraph of all minimal transversals of $\mathcal{H}$. The dual hypergraph is always Sperner, that is, no hyperedge contains another. A special case of Sperner hypergraphs are the conformal Sperner hypergraphs, which correspond to the families of maximal cliques of graphs. All these notions play an important role in many fields of mathematics and computer science, including combinatorics, algebra, database theory, etc. In this paper we study conformality of dual hypergraphs and prove several results related to the problem of recognizing this property. In particular, we show that the problem is in co-NP and can be solved in polynomial time for hypergraphs of bounded dimension. In the special case of dimension $3$, we reduce the problem to $2$-Satisfiability. Our approach has an implication in algorithmic graph theory: we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing graphs in which all minimal transversals of maximal cliques have size at most $k$, for any fixed $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, in general, the characteristic polynomial of a hypergraph is not determined by its ``polynomial deck'', the multiset of characteristic polynomials of its vertex-deleted subgraphs, thus settling the ``polynomial reconstruction problem'' for hypergraphs in the negative. The proof proceeds by showing that a construction due to Kocay of an infinite family of pairs of $3$-uniform hypergraphs which are non-isomorphic but share the same hypergraph deck, in fact, have different characteristic polynomials. The question remain unresolved for ordinary graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a series of recent talks Richard Stanley introduced a symmetric function associated to digraphs called the Redei-Berge symmetric function. This symmetric function enumerates descent sets of permutations corresponding to digraphs. We show that such constructed symmetric function arises from a suitable structure of combinatorial Hopf algebra on digraphs. The induced Redei-Berge polynomial satisfies the deletion-contraction property which makes it similar to the chromatic polynomial. The Berge's classical result on the number of Hamiltonian paths in digraphs is a consequence of the reciprocity formula for the Redei-Berge polynomial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sandpile groups are a subtle graph isomorphism invariant, in the form of a finite abelian group, whose cardinality is the number of spanning trees in the graph. We study their group structure for graphs obtained by attaching a cone vertex to a tree. For example, it is shown that the number of generators of the sandpile group is at most one less than the number of leaves in the tree. For trees on a fixed number of vertices, the paths and stars are shown to provide extreme behavior, not only for the number of generators, but also for the number of spanning trees, and for Tutte polynomial evaluations that count the recurrent sandpile configurations by their numbers of chips.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the connection between the ranks of the magnitude homology groups of a graph and the structure of its subgraphs. To this end, we introduce variants of magnitude homology called eulerian magnitude homology and discriminant magnitude homology. Leveraging the combinatorics of the differential in magnitude homology, we illustrate a close relationship between the ranks of the eulerian magnitude homology groups on the first diagonal and counts of subgraphs which fall in specific classes. We leverage these tools to study limiting behavior of the eulerian magnitude homology groups for Erdos-Renyi random graphs and random geometric graphs, producing for both models a vanishing threshold for the eulerian magnitude homology groups on the first diagonal. This in turn provides a characterization of the generators for the corresponding magnitude homology groups. Finally, we develop an explicit asymptotic estimate the expected rank of eulerian magnitude homology along the first diagonal for these random graph models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.10206v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop persistent homology in the setting of filtrations of (Cech) closure spaces. Examples of filtrations of closure spaces include metric spaces, weighted graphs, weighted directed graphs, and filtrations of topological spaces. We use various products and intervals for closure spaces to obtain six homotopy theories, six cubical singular homology theories, and three simplicial singular homology theories. Applied to filtrations of closure spaces, these homology theories produce persistence modules. We extend the definition of Gromov-Hausdorff distance from metric spaces to filtrations of closure spaces and use it to prove that any persistence module obtained from a homotopy-invariant functor on closure spaces is stable.</description>

      <title>Randomly punctured Reed--Solomon codes achieve list-decoding capacity over linear-sized fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09445v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reed--Solomon codes are a classic family of error-correcting codes consisting of evaluations of low-degree polynomials over a finite field on some sequence of distinct field elements. They are widely known for their optimal unique-decoding capabilities, but their list-decoding capabilities are not fully understood. Given the prevalence of Reed-Solomon codes, a fundamental question in coding theory is determining if Reed--Solomon codes can optimally achieve list-decoding capacity.
  A recent breakthrough by Brakensiek, Gopi, and Makam, established that Reed--Solomon codes are combinatorially list-decodable all the way to capacity. However, their results hold for randomly-punctured Reed--Solomon codes over an exponentially large field size $2^{O(n)}$, where $n$ is the block length of the code. A natural question is whether Reed--Solomon codes can still achieve capacity over smaller fields. Recently, Guo and Zhang showed that Reed--Solomon codes are list-decodable to capacity with field size $O(n^2)$. We show that Reed--Solomon codes are list-decodable to capacity with linear field size $O(n)$, which is optimal up to the constant factor. We also give evidence that the ratio between the alphabet size $q$ and code length $n$ cannot be bounded by an absolute constant. Our techniques also show that random linear codes are list-decodable up to (the alphabet-independent) capacity with optimal list-size $O(1/\varepsilon)$ and near-optimal alphabet size $2^{O(1/\varepsilon^2)}$, where $\varepsilon$ is the gap to capacity. As far as we are aware, list-decoding up to capacity with optimal list-size $O(1/\varepsilon)$ was previously not known to be achievable with any linear code over a constant alphabet size (even non-constructively). Our proofs are based on the ideas of Guo and Zhang, and we additionally exploit symmetries of reduced intersection matrices.</description>

      <title>On the order sequence of a group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a bridge between two active areas of research, the spectrum (set of element orders) and the power graph of a finite group.
  The order sequence of a finite group $G$ is the list of orders of elements of the group, arranged in non-decreasing order. Order sequences of groups of order $n$ are ordered by elementwise domination, forming a partially ordered set. We prove a number of results about this poset, among them the following.
  M.~Amiri recently proved that the poset has a unique maximal element, corresponding to the cyclic group. We show that the product of orders in a cyclic group of order $n$ is at least $q^{\phi(n)}$ times as large as the product in any non-cyclic group,where $q$ is the smallest prime divisor of $n$ and $\phi$ is Euler's function, with a similar result for the sum.
  The poset of order sequences of abelian groups of order $p^n$ is naturally isomorphic to the (well-studied) poset of partitions of $n$ with its natural partial order.
  If there exists a non-nilpotent group of order $n$, then there exists such a group whose order sequence is dominated by the order sequence of any nilpotent group of order $n$.
  There is a product operation on finite ordered sequences, defined by forming all products and sorting them into non-decreasing order. The product of order sequences of groups $G$ and $H$ is the order sequence of a group if and only if $|G|$ and $|H|$ are coprime.
  The paper concludes with a number of open problems.</description>

      <title>On graphs with well-distributed edge density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of graphs which we call average hereditary graphs. Most graphs that occur in the usual graph theory applications belong to this class of graphs. Many popular types of graphs fall under this class, such as regular graphs, trees and other popular classes of graphs. We prove a new upper bound for the chromatic number of a graph in terms of its maximum average degree and show that this bound is an improvement on previous bounds. From this, we show a relationship between the average degree and the chromatic number of an average hereditary graph. This class of graphs is explored further by proving some interesting properties regarding the class of average hereditary graphs. An equivalent condition is provided for a graph to be average hereditary, through which we show that we can decide if a given graph is average hereditary in polynomial time. We then provide a construction for average hereditary graphs, using which an average hereditary graph can be recursively constructed. We also show that this class of graphs is closed under a binary operation, from this another construction is obtained for average hereditary graphs, and we see some interesting algebraic properties this class of graphs has. We then explore the effect on the complexity of graph 3-coloring problem when the input is restricted to average hereditary graphs.</description>
