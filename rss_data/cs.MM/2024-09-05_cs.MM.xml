      <title>LSTMSE-Net: Long Short Term Speech Enhancement Network for Audio-visual Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose long short term memory speech enhancement network (LSTMSE-Net), an audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) method. This innovative method leverages the complementary nature of visual and audio information to boost the quality of speech signals. Visual features are extracted with VisualFeatNet (VFN), and audio features are processed through an encoder and decoder. The system scales and concatenates visual and audio features, then processes them through a separator network for optimized speech enhancement. The architecture highlights advancements in leveraging multi-modal data and interpolation techniques for robust AVSE challenge systems. The performance of LSTMSE-Net surpasses that of the baseline model from the COG-MHEAR AVSE Challenge 2024 by a margin of 0.06 in scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SISDR), $0.03$ in short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), and $1.32$ in perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). The source code of the proposed LSTMSE-Net is available at \url{https://github.com/mtanveer1/AVSEC-3-Challenge}.</description>

      <title>Coral Model Generation from Single Images for Virtual Reality Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of VR technology, the demand for high-quality 3D models is increasing. Traditional methods struggle with efficiency and quality in large-scale customization. This paper introduces a deep-learning framework that generates high-precision 3D coral models from a single image. Using the Coral dataset, the framework extracts geometric and texture features, performs 3D reconstruction, and optimizes design and material blending. Advanced optimization and polygon count control ensure shape accuracy, detail retention, and flexible output for various complexities, catering to high-quality rendering and real-time interaction needs.The project incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) to transform AI-generated models into interactive "artworks," best viewed in VR and XR. This enhances model interpretability and human-machine collaboration. Real-time feedback in VR interactions displays information like coral species and habitat, enriching user experience. The generated models surpass traditional methods in detail, visual quality, and efficiency. This research offers an intelligent approach to 3D content creation for VR, lowering production barriers, and promoting widespread VR applications. Additionally, integrating XAI provides new insights into AI-generated visual content and advances research in 3D vision interpretability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing adoption of video processing via Internet of Things (IoT) devices due to their cost-effectiveness, transmitting captured data to nearby servers poses challenges due to varying timing constraints and scarcity of network bandwidth. Existing video compression methods face difficulties in recovering compressed data when incomplete data is provided. Here, we introduce \emph{\project}, a deep-learning based solution that utilizes previously received data to predict the missing segments of a frame, enabling the reconstruction of a frame from partially received data.</description>

      <title>Low-Resolution Object Recognition with Cross-Resolution Relational Contrastive Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing objects in low-resolution images is a challenging task due to the lack of informative details. Recent studies have shown that knowledge distillation approaches can effectively transfer knowledge from a high-resolution teacher model to a low-resolution student model by aligning cross-resolution representations. However, these approaches still face limitations in adapting to the situation where the recognized objects exhibit significant representation discrepancies between training and testing images. In this study, we propose a cross-resolution relational contrastive distillation approach to facilitate low-resolution object recognition. Our approach enables the student model to mimic the behavior of a well-trained teacher model which delivers high accuracy in identifying high-resolution objects. To extract sufficient knowledge, the student learning is supervised with contrastive relational distillation loss, which preserves the similarities in various relational structures in contrastive representation space. In this manner, the capability of recovering missing details of familiar low-resolution objects can be effectively enhanced, leading to a better knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on low-resolution object classification and low-resolution face recognition clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our approach.</description>

      <title>PoseTalk: Text-and-Audio-based Pose Control and Motion Refinement for One-Shot Talking Head Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While previous audio-driven talking head generation (THG) methods generate head poses from driving audio, the generated poses or lips cannot match the audio well or are not editable. In this study, we propose \textbf{PoseTalk}, a THG system that can freely generate lip-synchronized talking head videos with free head poses conditioned on text prompts and audio. The core insight of our method is using head pose to connect visual, linguistic, and audio signals. First, we propose to generate poses from both audio and text prompts, where the audio offers short-term variations and rhythm correspondence of the head movements and the text prompts describe the long-term semantics of head motions. To achieve this goal, we devise a Pose Latent Diffusion (PLD) model to generate motion latent from text prompts and audio cues in a pose latent space. Second, we observe a loss-imbalance problem: the loss for the lip region contributes less than 4\% of the total reconstruction loss caused by both pose and lip, making optimization lean towards head movements rather than lip shapes. To address this issue, we propose a refinement-based learning strategy to synthesize natural talking videos using two cascaded networks, i.e., CoarseNet, and RefineNet. The CoarseNet estimates coarse motions to produce animated images in novel poses and the RefineNet focuses on learning finer lip motions by progressively estimating lip motions from low-to-high resolutions, yielding improved lip-synchronization performance. Experiments demonstrate our pose prediction strategy achieves better pose diversity and realness compared to text-only or audio-only, and our video generator model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing talking videos with natural head motions.

      <title>ExpLLM: Towards Chain of Thought for Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a critical task in multimedia with significant implications across various domains. However, analyzing the causes of facial expressions is essential for accurately recognizing them. Current approaches, such as those based on facial action units (AUs), typically provide AU names and intensities but lack insight into the interactions and relationships between AUs and the overall expression. In this paper, we propose a novel method called ExpLLM, which leverages large language models to generate an accurate chain of thought (CoT) for facial expression recognition. Specifically, we have designed the CoT mechanism from three key perspectives: key observations, overall emotional interpretation, and conclusion. The key observations describe the AU's name, intensity, and associated emotions. The overall emotional interpretation provides an analysis based on multiple AUs and their interactions, identifying the dominant emotions and their relationships. Finally, the conclusion presents the final expression label derived from the preceding analysis. Furthermore, we also introduce the Exp-CoT Engine, designed to construct this expression CoT and generate instruction-description data for training our ExpLLM. Extensive experiments on the RAF-DB and AffectNet datasets demonstrate that ExpLLM outperforms current state-of-the-art FER methods. ExpLLM also surpasses the latest GPT-4o in expression CoT generation, particularly in recognizing micro-expressions where GPT-4o frequently fails.</description>

      <title>Multi-Track MusicLDM: Towards Versatile Music Generation with Latent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promising results in cross-modal generation tasks involving audio and music, such as text-to-sound and text-to-music generation. These text-controlled music generation models typically focus on generating music by capturing global musical attributes like genre and mood. However, music composition is a complex, multilayered task that often involves musical arrangement as an integral part of the process. This process involves composing each instrument to align with existing ones in terms of beat, dynamics, harmony, and melody, requiring greater precision and control over tracks than text prompts usually provide. In this work, we address these challenges by extending the MusicLDM, a latent diffusion model for music, into a multi-track generative model. By learning the joint probability of tracks sharing a context, our model is capable of generating music across several tracks that correspond well to each other, either conditionally or unconditionally. Additionally, our model is capable of arrangement generation, where the model can generate any subset of tracks given the others (e.g., generating a piano track complementing given bass and drum tracks). We compared our model with an existing multi-track generative model and demonstrated that our model achieves considerable improvements across objective metrics for both total and arrangement generation tasks.</description>

      <title>LongLLaVA: Scaling Multi-modal LLMs to 1000 Images Efficiently via Hybrid Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expanding the long-context capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) is crucial for video understanding, high-resolution image understanding, and multi-modal agents. This involves a series of systematic optimizations, including model architecture, data construction and training strategy, particularly addressing challenges such as \textit{degraded performance with more images} and \textit{high computational costs}. In this paper, we adapt the model architecture to a hybrid of Mamba and Transformer blocks, approach data construction with both temporal and spatial dependencies among multiple images and employ a progressive training strategy. The released model \textbf{LongLLaVA}~(\textbf{Long}-Context \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{a}nd \textbf{V}ision \textbf{A}ssistant) is the first hybrid MLLM, which achieved a better balance between efficiency and effectiveness. LongLLaVA not only achieves competitive results across various benchmarks, but also maintains high throughput and low memory consumption. Especially, it could process nearly a thousand images on a single A100 80GB GPU, showing promising application prospects for a wide range of tasks.</description>

      <title>MCDubber: Multimodal Context-Aware Expressive Video Dubbing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic Video Dubbing (AVD) aims to take the given script and generate speech that aligns with lip motion and prosody expressiveness. Current AVD models mainly utilize visual information of the current sentence to enhance the prosody of synthesized speech. However, it is crucial to consider whether the prosody of the generated dubbing aligns with the multimodal context, as the dubbing will be combined with the original context in the final video. This aspect has been overlooked in previous studies. To address this issue, we propose a Multimodal Context-aware video Dubbing model, termed \textbf{MCDubber}, to convert the modeling object from a single sentence to a longer sequence with context information to ensure the consistency of the global context prosody. MCDubber comprises three main components: (1) A context duration aligner aims to learn the context-aware alignment between the text and lip frames; (2) A context prosody predictor seeks to read the global context visual sequence and predict the context-aware global energy and pitch; (3) A context acoustic decoder ultimately predicts the global context mel-spectrogram with the assistance of adjacent ground-truth mel-spectrograms of the target sentence. Through this process, MCDubber fully considers the influence of multimodal context on the prosody expressiveness of the current sentence when dubbing. The extracted mel-spectrogram belonging to the target sentence from the output context mel-spectrograms is the final required dubbing audio. Extensive experiments on the Chem benchmark dataset demonstrate that our MCDubber significantly improves dubbing expressiveness compared to all advanced baselines. The code and demos are available at https://github.com/XiaoYuanJun-zy/MCDubber.</description>

      <title>IDNet: A Novel Dataset for Identity Document Analysis and Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective fraud detection and analysis of government-issued identity documents, such as passports, driver's licenses, and identity cards, are essential in thwarting identity theft and bolstering security on online platforms. The training of accurate fraud detection and analysis tools depends on the availability of extensive identity document datasets. However, current publicly available benchmark datasets for identity document analysis, including MIDV-500, MIDV-2020, and FMIDV, fall short in several respects: they offer a limited number of samples, cover insufficient varieties of fraud patterns, and seldom include alterations in critical personal identifying fields like portrait images, limiting their utility in training models capable of detecting realistic frauds while preserving privacy.
  In response to these shortcomings, our research introduces a new benchmark dataset, IDNet, designed to advance privacy-preserving fraud detection efforts. The IDNet dataset comprises 837,060 images of synthetically generated identity documents, totaling approximately 490 gigabytes, categorized into 20 types from $10$ U.S. states and 10 European countries. We evaluate the utility and present use cases of the dataset, illustrating how it can aid in training privacy-preserving fraud detection methods, facilitating the generation of camera and video capturing of identity documents, and testing schema unification and other identity document management functionalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting geometry features from photographic images independently of surface texture and transferring them onto different materials remains a complex challenge. In this study, we introduce Harmonizing Attention, a novel training-free approach that leverages diffusion models for texture-aware geometry transfer. Our method employs a simple yet effective modification of self-attention layers, allowing the model to query information from multiple reference images within these layers. This mechanism is seamlessly integrated into the inversion process as Texture-aligning Attention and into the generation process as Geometry-aligning Attention. This dual-attention approach ensures the effective capture and transfer of material-independent geometry features while maintaining material-specific textural continuity, all without the need for model fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Hand1000: Generating Realistic Hands from Text with Only 1,000 Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable advancements in recent years, aiming to produce realistic images from textual descriptions. However, these models often struggle with generating anatomically accurate representations of human hands. The resulting images frequently exhibit issues such as incorrect numbers of fingers, unnatural twisting or interlacing of fingers, or blurred and indistinct hands. These issues stem from the inherent complexity of hand structures and the difficulty in aligning textual descriptions with precise visual depictions of hands. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach named Hand1000 that enables the generation of realistic hand images with target gesture using only 1,000 training samples. The training of Hand1000 is divided into three stages with the first stage aiming to enhance the model's understanding of hand anatomy by using a pre-trained hand gesture recognition model to extract gesture representation. The second stage further optimizes text embedding by incorporating the extracted hand gesture representation, to improve alignment between the textual descriptions and the generated hand images. The third stage utilizes the optimized embedding to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model to generate realistic hand images. In addition, we construct the first publicly available dataset specifically designed for text-to-hand image generation. Based on the existing hand gesture recognition dataset, we adopt advanced image captioning models and LLaMA3 to generate high-quality textual descriptions enriched with detailed gesture information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hand1000 significantly outperforms existing models in producing anatomically correct hand images while faithfully representing other details in the text, such as faces, clothing, and colors.</description>
