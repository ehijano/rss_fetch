      <title>A resistive MHD module in the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic macroscopic plasma dynamics can be described by general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. In many high-energy astrophysical settings, such as the interior dynamics of magnetized stars, the ideal GRMHD approximation, in which we assume infinite conductivity, provides an excellent description. However, ideal GRMHD neglects resistive effects that are essential for processes such as magnetic reconnection, dissipation, and magnetospheric dynamics. Incorporating resistivity into astrophysical plasma models accounts for the fact that plasmas in such environments are not perfect conductors. We present a resistive version of the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X, which evolves the full resistive GRMHD equations using the Z4c formalism for Einstein's equations. We implement a second-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme to handle stiff source terms, obtain the primitive quantities from the conserved quantities using a one-dimensional recovery method, and employ the HLLE Riemann solver in combination with TVD and WENO reconstruction schemes. We validate the module using a range of standard tests, including 1D shocktubes, current sheets, Alfv\'{e}n waves, 2D cylindrical explosions, and 3D TOV stars. The results of these tests demonstrate accurate recovery of the ideal MHD limit, correct resistive behavior, and stable evolution in dynamical spacetimes. Leveraging the GPU-accelerated resistive version of GRaM-X enables efficient large-scale simulations, paving the way for realistic studies of binary mergers, accretion flows, and relativistic jets within the framework of multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Axion-Like Particles from VERITAS Observations of a Flaring Radio Galaxy in the Perseus Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical particles that emerge in numerous theoretical extensions to the Standard Model. Their coupling to electromagnetic field implies that ALPs would mix with photons in the presence of external magnetic fields. As ALP phenomenology is governed by the mass and strength of its coupling, there is a subset of this parameter space in which this mixing would be expected to leave an imprint on the spectra of TeV gamma-ray sources.
  Data: In 2017, the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory recorded the second day of a dramatic flare of the radio galaxy NGC 1275, embedded at the center of the Perseus galaxy cluster. This serendipitous locale provides a spatially-extended magnetic field of strength O(10$\mu$G) through which escaping photons traverse, making it an excellent target to study ALPs.
  Methods: We analyze the VERITAS data of NGC 1275's 2017 flare with the gammapy analysis package. Extensive fitting and modeling are performed to ultimately conduct a likelihood analysis used to search for any evidence of a preference for ALPs and to explore the confidence with which constraints can be set. We adopt the CLs method for this study for its conservative approach to setting limits in regimes where the search has limited sensitivity.
  Results: No evidence for the existence of ALPs is found, and no combination of mass and coupling strength can be excluded at or above 95% confidence level. We provide a map showing the strength of our exclusions in the mass and coupling parameter space. The strongest exclusions are found in the mass range $2 \times 10^{-7}$eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-7}$eV and at the coupling strength of $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ up to 80% confidence level, which are consistent with previous studies.
  Conclusions: We find the CLs method to be a trustworthy approach, and advocate for its...</description>

      <title>X-ray Observations of Nova Scorpii 2023 (V1716 Sco) in Outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nova Scorpii 2023 was first detected as a luminous supersoft X-ray source (SSS) 93 days after outburst and continued emitting soft X-rays for over two months, until it was too close to the Sun to observe. The nova was monitored with the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) and the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) on the International Space Station, and in long exposures with the Chandra High Resolution Camera (HRC) and Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG) on days 128, 129, and 183-185 after optical maximum. Swift detected a rapidly decaying SSS when observations resumed, constraining the constant bolometric luminosity phase to 9 months. The SSS flux was irregularly variable. A nearly three-fold increase in flux was observed between August and October 2023 in the 15 to 35 Angstrom range, from 3.5 x 10^(-11) to 9.4 x 10^(-11) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1). The SSS duration and effective temperature derived from the October LETG spectra indicate a massive white dwarf with temperature fitting nova evolutionary tracks for a 1.2 solar mass WD; emission lines superimposed on the WD continuum are attributed to surrounding shocked ejecta. We present a timing study based on Chandra and archival NICER data. The irregular variability timescale was days, but a 77.9 second periodic modulation in the SSS flux with varying amplitude was measured in many observations. Our analysis shows that this period was stable; short drifts derived with NICER, but not in long, uninterrupted Chandra exposures, are artifacts of measuring variable amplitude modulation. We suggest the modulations are associated with the WD rotation.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Energy Injection in the Short and Distant GRB 250221A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-duration GRB 250221A ($T_{90}=1.80\pm0.32$ s), using a data set from the optical facilities COLIBR\'I, the Harlingten 50 cm Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We complement these observations with data from the \textit{Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} and the \textit{Einstein Probe}, as well as radio observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy with a star-formation rate of $\sim3\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and optical light curves up to $T_0+10$ ks (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at $T_0+0.6$ days, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet with a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=11.5^{\circ}$ through a refreshed shock powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$), which is more typical of a Collapsar environment. This tension over the classification of this burst (short-hard vs. long-soft) as inferred from the prompt and afterglow emissions makes GRB~250221A an unusual event and underscores the limitations of duration-based classifications and the importance of multi-wavelength, time-resolved follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eighteen years after their discovery, the astronomical sources and radiation mechanisms of fast radio bursts remain mysterious. Their radiation is as bright as that of pulsars, with brightness temperatures as high as $\sim 10^{36}$ K, implying coherent emission, but the plasma physics that forms the coherent charge bunches, with net charges of order a Coulomb, is not understood. Some FRB have been identified with galaxies at redshifts of a few tenths, but one originated within a globular cluster in the galaxy M81 at a distance of 3.6 Mpc. A minority of FRB have been observed to repeat, in some cases thousands of times. The vast majority of FRB have not been observed to repeat, but it is not known if they are truly ``one-offs'' or repeat at unobservably long intervals. Some FRB originate within dense, rapidly varying, plasma environments, while others appear to be surrounded by high vacuum. Hypotheses for their sources include magnetars and black hole accretion discs.</description>

      <title>An XMM long look at the accretion disk plasma in the dipping neutron star LMXB 4U1624-490</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dipping neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (NS LMXBs) are systems that exhibit periodic drops in their X-ray light curves. These are believed to be caused by material at the impact point of the gas stream onto the accretion disk, the bulge. Dipping systems are observed at high inclination and provide exceptional opportunities to address important open questions about accretion disks, such as the physical properties of the bulge, and the connection between disk atmospheres and disk winds. We aimed to characterize the accretion disk plasmas present in the 21h-period NS LMXB 4U 1624-490, and perform a detailed spectral analysis of the material present at the impact region. We used four XMM EPIC pn observations that were specifically targeting dips, and allow us to probe dipping activity over different timescales (i.e. consecutive orbits and $\sim$6 months). We use both time- and flux-resolved spectroscopic analysis to probe the structural properties of the bulge moving along the line of sight and its homogeneity, respectively. During dipping, the primary spectrum is modulated by an ionized (log$\xi\sim$ 3.4) absorber with varying column density and covering factor, as well as a colder absorber. This suggests that the bulge is a multiphase and clumpy absorbing medium. From size scale arguments, we estimate the number of clumps in the bulge to be $&gt;$7$\times10^{3}$. A highly ionized disk atmosphere becomes evident only when different phases of absorption are analyzed individually. This work demonstrates the feasibility of constructing a physical picture of the bulge, and highlights how future research could reveal how its properties depend on system parameters, and whether the bulge could influence the dynamics of the accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Anomalous scattering of pulsars towards the Gum Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report wideband scatter-broadening estimates of 14 pulsars towards the Gum nebula region using the Band-3 of the upgraded GMRT. This work increases the measurements of frequency scaling index of scatter-broadening ($\alpha$) across the nebula by more than 3 times. A strong correlation between the distance and the scattering strength is observed for pulsars behind the nebula. It is also observed that for distant pulsars ($&gt; 2 kpc$), the effect of the Gum nebula in DM and scattering strength is not substantial. We also report a much flatter $\alpha$ for the Vela pulsar and argue that its scattering is not caused by the Gum nebula, but the Vela supernova remnant.</description>

      <title>Application and development of advanced mathematical tools for population and time series analysis in pulsar astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we introduce novel methods for analyzing pulsar populations using a variety of mathematical techniques. These tools-particularly graph theory-have been thoroughly validated in advanced mathematics, enabling us to overcome some of the constraints (even dimensional) inherent in conventional visualization approaches. This exploration benefits from dimensionality reduction techniques, which not only lessen computational demands but also highlight potential for describing physical characteristics. The resulting structures encode information about pulsar similarities that extend beyond standard spin parameters, revealing relationships that are not readily apparent in traditional diagrams. With a physically motivated topological perspective, we leverage the strengths of these methods and present results that span from prospective source classification and the emergence of new classes to catalog comparison, among other applications. This new approach enables fresh interpretations of longstanding problems, laying a new foundation for visualizing the pulsar population and categorizing sources. Building on this, we identify several sources as likely members of specific binary subclasses and investigate the potential transitional nature of others. Furthermore, we extend the use of graph theory to the boundary of machine learning, demonstrating its capability for binary separation in an unsupervised context. Finally, we introduce and apply an innovative, flexible time-series alignment technique to the field of gamma-ray astrophysics. The method identifies notable similarities among the light curves of gamma-ray pulsars. The results presented here are promising, offering a refreshing direction for the field and new pathways for rigorous mathematical analysis, ultimately providing meaningful alternatives to traditional approaches in high-energy astrophysics.</description>

      <title>The impact of superradiance on the spin evolution of variably accreting massive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores how time-varying increases in mass accretion onto rapidly spinning black holes influence their long-term spin evolution when affected by superradiance - a process where energy is extracted from the black hole by a surrounding axion field. Using simulations the study tracks how sudden accretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop) during which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains nearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition between two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion, and how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that boosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest effect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the region of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance. In particular, a super-Eddington accretion rate of 5 times Eddington accretion, lasting for 4 Myr and occurring 30 Myr before the superradiance drop can reduce the superradiance exclusion region in the mass-spin plane by 40 percent. In contrast, boosts to the accretion rate after the superradiance drop only cause temporary changes in the black hole spin. The study also shows that black holes with lighter axion clouds are more sensitive to these early boosts and can show observable spin changes lasting tens to hundreds of millions of years. Heavier axion clouds, however, require much stronger or longer-lasting boosts to produce similar effects, making them more stable under variable accretion.</description>

      <title>Interacting supernovae and where to find them</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early interaction of supernova blast waves with CSM has the potential to accelerate particles to PeV energies, although this has not yet been detected. Current models for this interaction assume the shock expands into a smooth stellar wind, although observations of many SNe do not support this assumption.
  We extend previous work by considering shocks expanding into complex density profiles consisting of smooth winds with dense CSM shells at various distances from the progenitor star. We aim to predict the gamma-ray and multiwavelength signatures of CSM interaction.
  We used the PION code to model the CSM around LBV including a brief episode of enhanced mass-loss and to simulate the formation of photoionization-confined shells around RSGs. Consequently, we used the time-dependent acceleration-code RATPaC to study the acceleration of cosmic rays in SNe expanding into these media and to evaluate the emitted radiation across the whole electromagnetic spectrum.
  We find that the interaction with the CSM shells can significantly boost the gamma-ray emission, with the emission peaking weeks to years after the explosion. The peak luminosity for Type-IIP and Type-IIn remnants can exceed the luminosity expected for smooth winds by orders of magnitude. For Type-IIP explosions, the light-curve peak is only reached years after the explosion. We evaluate the multiwavelength signatures expected from the interaction of the blast wave with a dense CSM shell from radio, over optical, to thermal X-rays.
  We identify high-cadence optical surveys and continuous monitoring of nearby SN in radio and mm wavelengths as the best-suited strategies for identifying targets that should be followed-up by gamma-ray observatories. We predict that gamma-rays from interaction with dense CSM shells may be detectable out to a few Mpc for late interaction, and tens of Mpc for early interaction.</description>

      <title>Can we ignore the time dependence in matter neutrino resonance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the vicinity of neutron star mergers (NSMs), it is possible for the neutrino self-interaction potential to cancel with the matter potential leading to matter neutrino resonance (MNR). MNR is one of the most interesting mechanisms by which neutrino flavor evolution can occur in dense astrophysical environments. Previous studies have typically assumed that the neutrino flavor field evolves to a steady state -- a simplification also used in other self-interaction models such as the neutrino-bulb model. Here, we perform reproducible calculations of MNR using both time-independent and time-dependent formalisms and show that they yield qualitatively different flavor survival probabilities. The time-independent approach produces unstable steady-state solutions that differ fundamentally from the dynamical behavior captured in time-dependent simulations. These results demonstrate that the steady-state assumption is generally invalid, and physical interpretations based on time-independent calculations of dense neutrino systems require re-evaluation.</description>

      <title>Probing Accretion Disk Winds of Stratified Nature with Fe XXVI Doublet in Black Hole X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powerful ionized accretion disk winds are often observed during episodic outbursts in Galactic black hole transients. Among those X-ray absorbers, \fexxvi\ doublet structure (Ly$\alpha_1$+Ly$\alpha_2$ with $\sim 20$eV apart) has a unique potential to better probe the underlying physical nature of the wind; i.e. density and kinematics. We demonstrate, based on a physically-motivated magnetic disk wind scenario of a stratified structure in density and velocity, that the doublet line profile can be effectively utilized as a diagnostics to measure wind density and associated velocity dispersion (due to thermal turbulence and/or dynamical shear motion in winds). Our simulated doublet spectra with post-process radiative transfer calculations indicate that the profile can be (1) broad with a single peak for higher velocity dispersion ($\gsim 5,000$ km~s$^{-1}$), (2) a standard shape with 1:2 canonical flux ratio for moderate dispersion ($\sim 1,000-5,000$ km~s$^{-1}$) or (3) double-peaked with its flux ratio approaching 1:1 for lower velocity dispersion ($\lsim 1,000$ km~s$^{-1}$) in optically-thin regime, allowing various line shape. Such a diversity in doublet profile is indeed unambiguously seen in recent observations with XRISM/Resolve at microcalorimeter resolution. We show that some implications inferred from the model will help constrain the local wind physics where \fexxvi\ is predominantly produced in a large-scale, stratified wind.</description>

      <title>The Regulated GeAs Cycles with the New $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As Reaction Rates and Their Impact on the GS 1826$-$24 Clocked Bursts and SAX J1808.4$-$3658 Photospheric Radius Expansion Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As thermonuclear reactions connect the ZnGa and GeAs cycles by diverting the flow of the rapid proton capture process from $^{63}$Ga to $^{65}$As. Changes in these two reaction rates regulate the ZnGa and GeAs cycles and may affect the modeled properties matching with the observed counterparts of a type I X-ray burster. We implement the latest $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As reaction rates to the state-of-the-art self-consistent one-dimensional multi-zone thermo-hydrodynamic code, KEPLER, to study the influence of these new reaction rates on the models of the GS 1826$-$24 clocked burster and SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion burster. Both new reaction rates obtained by Lu et al. [Phys. Rev. C 110, 065804 (2024)] are determined from complementing the experimental input with the nuclear spectroscopic information deduced from the full pf-shell space configuration-interaction shell-model calculations. By constraining the models on reproducing the observed burst peak, light-curve profile, fluence, and recurrence time, we find that the impact of the newly measured proton thresholds and respective proton-capture reactions on the burst light-curve profile of the GS 1826$-$24 clocked burster is, in fact, not as significant as claimed by Zhou et al. [Nat. Phys. 19, 1091 (2023)]. With or without the inclusion of the newly determined reaction rate of the highly influential $^{22}$Mg($\alpha$,p)$^{25}$Al reaction, the impact of the new $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As reaction rates on SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion bursts is evident. Our finding indicates that the models reproducing the 2002 October epoch of SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion burster is more sensitive to the uncertainties of thermonuclear reaction rates.</description>

      <title>Accretion with two-phase gas supply and its application in black hole X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion in black hole X-ray binaries is commonly believed to be supplied by the Roche lobe overflow or the stellar wind. The former is thought to form a geometrically thin disc while the diffuse wind could form a geometrically thick hot accretion flow. In this paper, we instead consider a more generalised case, i.e., accretion with both cold and hot gas supplies, which feed a disc and a corona respectively. We investigate the interaction of disc and corona by analysing the energy coupling and matter exchange, i.e. corona condensation/disc evaporation, with a semi-analytical method. It is found that the accretion geometry in the radial direction and the resultant emission spectrum depend strongly on both the total gas supply rate and the ratio of cold and hot gases. For gas supply rates of a few percent of the Eddington value, diverse geometries and spectral shapes are possible, depending on the fraction of cold gas supply. This provides an interpretation for the various spectra observed in intermediate states. However, at higher accretion rates, regardless of the form of the feeding gas, the inner accretion flow is always disc-dominated, implying an inevitable transition to the soft state, while at very low gas supply rates, hard state spectrum dominated by the hot flow is expected. We also present the predicted hardness-intensity correlation of Cygnus X-1, and constrain the value of the viscosity parameter of the accretion flow to the range of 0.25--0.35 by comparing our results with MAXI observations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Radio Lateral Distribution Function: An amplitude dependence on $X_{\rm max}$ and primary composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there is a strong dependence of the radio LDF electric field amplitudes at ground level on the position of $X_{\rm max}$ in the atmosphere, even accounting for differences in the EM energy of the showers. Since an $X_{\rm max}$ dependence leads to a primary composition dependence, this implies that information on the mass composition is encoded not only in the LDF shape but also in its amplitude. This $X_{\rm max}$ dependence can be explained in terms of two competing scalings of the measured electric field: One goes with $(1/\rho)^J$, where $\rho$ is the air density at $X_{\rm max}$ and $J$ is a zenith dependent non-linearity factor describing coherence loss. This density scaling tends to decrease the geomagnetic emission of deeper showers. The other scaling goes with $(1/R)$, where $R$ is the distance from $X_{\rm max}$ to the core at ground, and instead increases the measured electric field of deeper showers. At low zenith angles, the $(1/R)$ scaling is stronger and leads to larger measured electric fields as $X_{\rm max}$ increases. The picture at higher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the deflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time delays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission. This loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic field and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission with decreasing air density. This strong, yet historically overlooked LDF amplitude dependence on $X_{\rm max}$/composition could be used to directly infer, even bypassing any $X_{\rm max}$ reconstruction, the cosmic ray primary composition on an event-by-event basis. It could also have some repercussions on other radio reconstruction methods, such as a possible $X_{\rm max}$/composition bias on shower electromagnetic energy reconstruction methods.</description>

      <title>Distortions in Periodicity Analysis of Blazars II: The Impact of Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series analysis is fundamental to characterizing the variability inherent in multi-wavelength emissions from blazars. However, a major observational challenge lies in the need for well-sampled, temporally uniform data, which is often hindered by irregular sampling and data gaps. These gaps can significantly affect the reliability and accuracy of methods used to probe source variability. This paper investigates the impact of such observational gaps on time series analysis of blazar emissions. To do so, we systematically evaluate how these gaps alter observed variability patterns, mask genuine periodic signals, and introduce false periodicity detections. This evaluation is conducted using both simulated and real observational data. We assess a range of widely used time series analysis methods, including the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, Phase Dispersion Minimization, and the recently proposed Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). Our results demonstrate a clear and significant degradation in period detection reliability when the percentage of gaps exceeds 50\%. In such cases, the period-significance relationship becomes increasingly distorted, often leading to misleading results. Among the tested methods, SSA stands out for its ability to yield consistent and robust detections despite high data incompleteness. Additionally, the analyzed methods tend to identify artificial periodicities of around one year, likely due to seasonal sampling effects, which can result in false positives if not carefully recognized. Finally, the periods detected with $\geq$3$\sigma$ confidence are unlikely to result from stochastic processes or from the presence of gaps in the analyzed time series.</description>

      <title>On the origin of ~ 100 TeV neutrinos from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of TeV-PeV neutrinos detected by IceCube remains largely unknown. The most significant individual neutrino source is the close-by Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 at 4.2$\sigma$ level with a soft spectral index. Another notable candidate is the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, which has been recently proposed as a potential neutrino emitter. The likelihood fit of the IceCube data for this source returned a very hard spectral index of ~ 1.9 and the excess is dominated by two high-energy events, issued as two neutrino alerts IC220424A and IC230416A. The energies of the two neutrinos are estimated to be 100-200 TeV, implying a maximum proton energy &gt; 2 PeV, significantly higher than that in NGC 1068. The lack of lower-energy neutrinos from NGC 7469 also suggests a neutrino spectrum harder than that of NGC 1068. In this paper, we analyze the Fermi-LAT observations of NGC 7469, which yield non-detection. By requiring the cascade flux accompanying neutrino production not to exceed the upper limit of the GeV flux, the size of the neutrino-emitting region can be constrained when the neutrino flux takes a high value of the allowed range. We suggest that protons are accelerated to PeV energies via turbulence or magnetic reconnection in the corona of NGC 7469 and interact with OUV photons from the accretion disk and X-rays from the corona through the $p\gamma$ process, producing neutrinos with energy of 100-200 TeV. In the turbulence acceleration scenario, the required maximum proton energy can be achieved with a magnetization parameter close to unity ($\sigma\sim 1$), while in the reconnection scenario, a magnetization parameter with $\sigma\sim 10$ is needed. In both scenarios, a pair dominated composition for the corona is preferred. The difference in the neutrino spectrum between NGC 7469 and NGC 1068 could be due to a different magnetization despite that they belong to the same type of AGN.</description>

      <title>Coupling of neutrino beam-driven MHD waves and resonant instabilities in rotating magnetoplasmas with neutrino two-flavor oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of neutrino-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and instabilities in a rotating magnetoplasma with weak neutrino interactions. We show, for the first time, that neutrino-driven shear Alfv{\'e}n and oblique magnetosonic waves can be coupled by the Coriolis force, forming new wave modes affected by this force, as well as neutrino beam and two neutrino flavor oscillations. Our work extends previous theories by demonstrating that shear Alfv{\'e}n waves are influenced by neutrino effects and by identifying instabilities resulting from resonant interactions with both a streaming neutrino beam and flavor oscillations. We find that the Coriolis force, as well as plasma density and magnetic field strength, have a significant impact on the profiles of the instability growth rates. Our findings may shed new light on the physical mechanisms underlying core-collapse supernovae.</description>

Abstract: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) may originate from a wide variety of explosion scenarios and progenitor channels. They exhibit a factor of about 10 difference in brightness and, thus, a differentiation in the mass of 56Ni-&gt;56Co-&gt;56 Fe. We present a study on the fate of positrons within SNe Ia in order to evaluate their escape fractions and energy spectra. Our detailed Monte Carlo transport simulations for positrons and gamma-rays include both beta + decay of 56 Co and pair production. We simulate a wide variety of explosion scenarios, including the explosion of white dwarfs (WD) close to the Chandrasekhar mass, M(Ch), He-triggered explosions of sub-M Ch WDs, and dynamical mergers of two WDs. For each model, we study the influence of the size and morphology of the progenitor magnetic field between 1 and 1E13 G. Population synthesis based on the observed brightness distribution of SNe Ia was used to estimate the overall contributions to Galactic positrons due to escape from SN Ia. We find that this is dominated by normal-bright SNe Ia, where variations in the distribution of emitted positrons are small. We estimate a total SNe Ia contribution to the Galactic positrons of &lt; 2% and, depending on the magnetic field morphology, less than 6...20% for M(Ch) and sub-M(Ch), respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dynamically coupling gas torques with gravitational wave (GW) emission during the orbital evolution of an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB). We perform hydrodynamical simulations of eccentric MBHBs with total mass $M=10^6~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a prograde locally isothermal circumbinary disk (CBD). We evolve the binary from $55$ to $49$ Schwarzschild radii separations using up to 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the binary dynamics, which allow us to follow the GW-driven in-spiral. For the first time, we report the measurement of gas torques onto a live binary a few years before the merger, with and without concurrent GW radiation. We also report the gas-induced orbital dephasing $\delta \phi_{\rm orb}\sim-0.007$ rad over $278$ orbital cycles that is likely driven mainly by disc-induced precession and LISA should be able to detect it at redshift $z=1$. Our results show how GWs alone can be used to probe the astrophysical properties of CBDs and have important implications for multi-messenger strategies aimed at studying the environments of MBHBs.</description>

Abstract: Although Cherenkov detectors of high-energy neutrinos in ice and water are often optimized to detect TeV-PeV neutrinos, they may also be sensitive to transient neutrino sources in the 1-100~GeV energy range. A wide variety of transient sources have been predicted to emit GeV neutrinos. In light of the upcoming IceCube-Upgrade, which will extend the IceCube detector's sensitivity down to a few GeV, as well as improve its angular resolution, we survey a variety of transient source models and compare their predicted neutrino fluences to detector sensitivities, in particular those of IceCube-DeepCore and the IceCube Upgrade. We consider the ranges of neutrino fluence from transients powered by non-relativistic shocks, such as novae, supernovae, fast blue optical transients, and tidal disruption events. We also consider fast radio bursts and relativistic outflows of high- and low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts. Our study sheds light on the prospects of observing GeV transients with existing and upcoming neutrino facilities.</description>

      <title>Spectro-temporal analysis of ultra-fast radio bursts using per-channel arrival times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs), especially those from repeating sources, exhibit a rich variety of morphologies in their dynamic spectra (or waterfalls). Characterizing these morphologies and spectro-temporal properties is a key strategy in investigating the underlying unknown emission mechanism of FRBs. This type of analysis has been typically accomplished using two-dimensional Gaussian techniques and the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the waterfall. These techniques are effective and precise at all duration scales, but can be limited in the presence of scattered tails, complex morphologies, or recently observed microshot forests. Here, we present a technique that involves the tagging of per-channel arrival times of an FRB to perform spectro-temporal measurements using a Gaussian profile model for each channel. While scattering and dispersion remain important and often dominating sources of uncertainty in measurements, this technique provides an adaptable and firm foundation for obtaining spectro-temporal properties from all types of FRB morphologies. We present measurements using this technique of several hundred bursts across 12 repeating sources, including over 400 bursts from the repeating sources FRB 20121102A, FRB 20220912A, and FRB 20200120E, all of which exhibit recently observed microsecond-long ultra-FRBs, as well as 143 multi-component drift rates. In addition to retrieving the known relationship between sub-burst slope and duration, we explore other correlations between burst properties. We find that the sub-burst slope law extends smoothly to ultra-FRBs, and that ultra-FRBs appear to form a distinct population in the duration-frequency relation.</description>

      <title>Proto-neutron Stars with Dark Matter Admixture: A Single-Fluid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of dark matter (DM) on the microscopic and macroscopic properties of proto-neutron stars (PNSs). We employ a single-fluid framework in which DM interacts with ordinary matter (OM) via the Higgs portal and remains in thermal equilibrium through non-gravitational interactions. Using a quasi-static approximation, we analyze the evolution of PNSs during the Kelvin-Helmholtz phase by varying the DM mass while keeping the entropy per baryon and lepton fraction fixed. Our results show that DM absorbs thermal energy from the stellar medium without efficient re-emission, thereby altering neutrino emission and affecting the star's thermal evolution history. Furthermore, neutrinos contribute significantly to pressure support in the PNS phase, inhibiting DM mass accretion during neutrino-trapped stages. Based on the requirement to satisfy the observed $2,\rm M_\odot$ neutron star mass constraint and to maintain consistency with supernova remnant data, we suggest an upper limit of $m_\chi \leq 0.62,\rm GeV$ for the DM mass that can accrete in evolving PNSs, within the model framework. In contrast, we established that cold neutron stars (NSs) can support higher DM masses without compromising equilibrium stability, owing to increased central density, enhanced gravitational binding energy, and reduced thermal pressure.</description>

Abstract: We present new methods to quantify the AGN population in terms of a multi-dimensional luminosity function that describes the space density of sources as a function of both X-ray and radio luminosity. We compile a sample of 1538 radio and X-ray detected extragalactic sources from the Bo\"otes and COSMOS fields. First, we investigate the X-ray-radio luminosity correlation in the sample and find that an apparent correlation is introduced due to the sensitivity limits of the surveys; when considering individual redshift bins we find a wide range of radio luminosities associated with a given X-ray luminosity, and vice versa, indicating little direct connection between the emission processes. We then measure the X-ray luminosity function, radio luminosity function and multi-dimensional X-ray-radio luminosity function across redshift ($0&lt;z&lt;6$). We apply luminosity thresholds in X-ray and radio to restrict our sample to those in the AGN-dominated regime and explore how the fraction of radio-selected AGN within the overall X-ray sample varies with increasing X-ray luminosity (and vice versa). We find that towards the highest X-ray and radio luminosities the fraction of sources with both an X-ray and radio detection increases towards 100%, indicating that at the highest luminosities we are more likely to obtain a detection in both bands, though the source will not necessarily be bright in both bands. Thus, the most luminous accretion events are more likely to be associated with the production of a jet, despite the distinct physical structures that produce the emission and likely persist over very different timescales.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of SN 2023ixf I: Completing the Early Multi-Wavelength Picture with Plateau-phase Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and analyze panchromatic (0.35--14 $\mu$m) spectroscopy of the Type II supernova 2023ixf, including near- and mid-infrared spectra obtained 33.6 days after explosion during the plateau-phase, with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This is the first in a series of papers examining the evolution of SN 2023ixf with JWST spanning the initial 1000 days after explosion, monitoring the formation and growth of molecules and dust in ejecta and surrounding environment. The JWST infrared spectra are overwhelmingly dominated by H lines, whose profiles reveal ejecta structures, including flat tops, blue notches, and red shoulders, unseen in the optical spectra. We characterize the nature of these structures, concluding that they likely result from a combination of ejecta geometry, viewing angle, and opacity effects. We find no evidence for the formation of dust precursor molecules such as carbon-monoxide (CO), nor do we observe an infrared excess attributable to dust. These observations imply that the detections of molecules and dust in SN 2023ixf at later epochs arise either from freshly synthesized material within the ejecta or circumstellar material at radii not yet heated by the supernova at this epoch.</description>

      <title>Extensive Analysis of gamma-Ray Periodicity in Jetted AGN from the 4FGL Catalog Using Fermi-LAT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest to uncover periodic patterns within the $\gamma$-ray emissions of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) has recently emerged as a focal point in astrophysics. One of the primary challenges has been the necessity for prolonged exposures in the $\gamma$-ray energy band. In our investigation, we leverage 12 years' worth of observations from the \textit{Fermi}-LAT to systematically explore periodicity across 1492 jetted AGN cataloged in 4FGL, representing the largest sample analyzed to date. Our analysis involves a robust pipeline employing nine distinct techniques designed to detect potential periodic emissions within their $\gamma$ rays. We note that 24 objects with previous hints of periodicity are deliberately excluded in the present work since they were reanalyzed in a dedicated paper using a similar methodology. Using this thorough approach, we do not find any evidence for periodic signals in the 1492 jetted AGN $\gamma$-ray light curves analyzed here.</description>

      <title>A fast powerful X-ray transient from possible tidal disruption of a white dwarf</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars captured by black holes (BHs) can be torn apart by strong tidal forces, producing electromagnetic flares. To date, more than 100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been observed, each involving invariably normal gaseous stars whose debris falls onto the BH, sustaining the flares over years. White dwarfs (WDs), which are the most prevalent compact stars and a million times denser--and therefore tougher--than gaseous stars, can only be disrupted by intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of 10^2--10^5 solar masses. WD-TDEs are considered to generate more powerful and short-lived flares, but their evidence has been lacking. Here we report observations of a fast and luminous X-ray transient EP250702a detected by Einstein Probe. Its one-day-long X-ray peak as luminous as 10^(47-49) erg/s showed strong recurrent flares with hard spectra extending to several tens of MeV gamma-rays, as detected by Fermi/GBM and Konus-Wind, indicating relativistic jet emission. The jet's X-ray dropped sharply from 3 x 10^49 erg/s to around 10^44 erg/s within 20 days (10 days in the source rest frame). These characteristics are inconsistent with any known transient phenomena other than a jetted-TDE evolving over an unprecedentedly short timescale, indicating the disruption of a WD by an IMBH. At late times, a new soft component progressively dominates the X-ray spectrum, exhibiting an extreme super-Eddington luminosity, which possibly originates from an accretion disc. WD-TDEs open a new window for investigating the elusive IMBHs and their surrounding stellar environments, and they are prime sources of gravitational waves in the band of space-based interferometers.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Origin of the KM3-230213A event and associated Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel cosmological scenario to explain the exceptional KM3-230213A neutrino event reported at an energy scale of $\mathcal{O}(100)$~PeV by the KM3NeT collaboration, along with its associated gravitational wave (GW) signatures. In our framework, ultra high energy neutrinos originate from the decay of a super-heavy sterile neutrino produced via the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early Universe. Employing an ultraviolet complete type-I seesaw model, we demonstrate that while two sterile neutrinos are responsible for light neutrino masses as required by oscillation data, one sterile neutrino can have an exceedingly feeble coupling, allowing its lifetime to be tuned so that its decay yields a neutrino flux consistent with the observed event. Furthermore, our scenario predicts two distinct GW signatures: one arising from gravitons emitted during PBH evaporation and another from the Bremsstrahlung process during the decay of the sterile neutrino. These complementary signals provide a multi-messenger probe of the underlying physics. Our results thus offer a compelling explanation for the KM3-230213A event and open new avenues for investigating the interplay between high-energy neutrino astronomy and gravitational wave cosmology.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from eccentric binary neutron star mergers: Systematic biases and inadequacy of quasicircular templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of quasicircular waveforms in matched-filter analyses of signals from eccentric binary neutron star mergers can lead to biases in the source's parameter estimation. We demonstrate that significant biases can be present already for moderate eccentricities $e_{0} \gtrsim 0.05$ and signals detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with signal-to-noise ratio $\gtrsim 12$. We perform systematic Bayesian mock analyses of unequal-mass nonspinning binary neutron star signals up to eccentricities $e_0 \sim 0.1$ using quasicircular effective-one-body waveforms with spins. We find fractional signal-to-noise ratio losses up to tens of percent and up to 16$\sigma$ deviations in the inference of the chirp mass. The latter effect is sufficiently large to lead to an incorrect (and ambiguous) source identification. The inclusion of spin precession in the quasicircular waveform does not capture eccentricity effects. We conclude that high-precision observations with advanced (and next generation) detectors are likely to require standardized, accurate, and fast eccentric waveforms.</description>
