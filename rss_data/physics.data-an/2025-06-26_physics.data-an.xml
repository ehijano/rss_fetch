      <title>Graph theory inspired anomaly detection at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing model-independent anomaly detection algorithms for analyzing LHC data remains a central challenge in the search for new physics, due to the high dimensionality of collider events. In this work, we develop a graph autoencoder as an unsupervised, model-agnostic tool for anomaly detection, using the LHC Olympics dataset as a benchmark. By representing jet constituents as a graph, we introduce a method to systematically control the information available to the model through sparse graph constructions that serve as physically motivated inductive biases. Specifically, (1) we construct graph autoencoders based on locally rigid Laman graphs and globally rigid unique graphs, and (2) we explore the clustering of jet constituents into subjets to interpolate between high- and low-level input representations. We obtain the best performance, measured in terms of the Significance Improvement Characteristic curve for an intermediate level of subjet clustering and certain sparse unique graph constructions. We further investigate the role of graph connectivity in jet classification tasks. Our results demonstrate the potential of leveraging graph-theoretic insights to refine and increase the interpretability of machine learning tools for collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Direct reconstruction of the Reionization history from 21cm 2D Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21cm line from the spin-flip transition of neutral hydrogen (HI) provides a unique window into the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), the final phase transition of our Universe. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) enables precise measurements of 21cm fluctuations that trace ionization, temperature, and density fluctuations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Nevertheless, a direct reconstruction of the timeline of the EoR in terms of the progress of ionization remains an ongoing challenge due to the highly non-Gaussian nature and thus intractable likelihood of the 21cm signal. Here, we present EoRFlow, a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework for reconstructing the global neutral hydrogen fraction $x_{\mathrm{HI}}(z)$ directly from 2D cylindrically averaged power spectra (2DPS) of the 21cm signal. We validate our method on realistic mock datasets for SKA-Low. Bypassing the need for explicit likelihood formulations, our approach enables fast, unbiased posterior estimation of the $x_{\mathrm{HI}}$ evolution in narrow redshift slices, allowing for piecewise reconstruction of the global reionization history. By directly inferring the reionization history from 21cm power spectra, our framework provides a scalable and robust path forward for 21cm cosmology in the SKA era.</description>

      <title>Lost in Retraining: Roaming the Parameter Space of Exponential Families Under Closed-Loop Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Closed-loop learning is the process of repeatedly estimating a model from data generated from the model itself. It is receiving great attention due to the possibility that large neural network models may, in the future, be primarily trained with data generated by artificial neural networks themselves. We study this process for models that belong to exponential families, deriving equations of motions that govern the dynamics of the parameters. We show that maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters endows sufficient statistics with the martingale property and that as a result the process converges to absorbing states that amplify initial biases present in the data. However, we show that this outcome may be prevented by polluting the data with an infinitesimal fraction of data points generated from a fixed model, by relying on maximum a posteriori estimation or by introducing regularisation. Furthermore, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics is not reparametrisation invariant.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning machine-learned particle-flow reconstruction for new detector geometries in future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00131v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate transfer learning capabilities in a machine-learned algorithm trained for particle-flow reconstruction in high energy particle colliders. This paper presents a cross-detector fine-tuning study, where we initially pretrain the model on a large full simulation dataset from one detector design, and subsequently fine-tune the model on a sample with a different collider and detector design. Specifically, we use the Compact Linear Collider detector (CLICdet) model for the initial training set and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer to the CLIC-like detector (CLD) proposed for the Future Circular Collider in electron-positron mode. We show that with an order of magnitude less samples from the second dataset, we can achieve the same performance as a costly training from scratch, across particle-level and event-level performance metrics, including jet and missing transverse momentum resolution. Furthermore, we find that the fine-tuned model achieves comparable performance to the traditional rule-based particle-flow approach on event-level metrics after training on 100,000 CLD events, whereas a model trained from scratch requires at least 1 million CLD events to achieve similar reconstruction performance. To our knowledge, this represents the first full-simulation cross-detector transfer learning study for particle-flow reconstruction. These findings offer valuable insights towards building large foundation models that can be fine-tuned across different detector designs and geometries, helping to accelerate the development cycle for new detectors and opening the door to rapid detector design and optimization using machine learning.</description>
