      <title>Blockchain-based Pseudonym Management for Vehicle Twin Migrations in Vehicular Edge Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the great advances in metaverse and edge computing technologies, vehicular edge metaverses are expected to disrupt the current paradigm of intelligent transportation systems. As highly computerized avatars of Vehicular Metaverse Users (VMUs), the Vehicle Twins (VTs) deployed in edge servers can provide valuable metaverse services to improve driving safety and on-board satisfaction for their VMUs throughout journeys. To maintain uninterrupted metaverse experiences, VTs must be migrated among edge servers following the movements of vehicles. This can raise concerns about privacy breaches during the dynamic communications among vehicular edge metaverses. To address these concerns and safeguard location privacy, pseudonyms as temporary identifiers can be leveraged by both VMUs and VTs to realize anonymous communications in the physical space and virtual spaces. However, existing pseudonym management methods fall short in meeting the extensive pseudonym demands in vehicular edge metaverses, thus dramatically diminishing the performance of privacy preservation. To this end, we present a cross-metaverse empowered dual pseudonym management framework. We utilize cross-chain technology to enhance management efficiency and data security for pseudonyms. Furthermore, we propose a metric to assess the privacy level and employ a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) approach to obtain an optimal pseudonym generating strategy. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes are high-efficiency and cost-effective, showcasing their promising applications in vehicular edge metaverses.</description>

      <title>Network Calculus Characterization of Congestion Control for Time-Varying Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models for the dynamics of congestion control generally involve systems of coupled differential equations. Universally, these models assume that traffic sources saturate the maximum transmissions allowed by the congestion control method. This is not suitable for studying congestion control of intermittent but bursty traffic sources. In this paper, we present a characterization of congestion control for arbitrary time-varying traffic that applies to rate-based as well as window-based congestion control. We leverage the capability of network calculus to precisely describe the input-output relationship at network elements for arbitrary source traffic. We show that our characterization can closely track the dynamics of even complex congestion control algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Modular, End-to-End Next-Generation Network Testbed: Towards a Fully Automated Network Management Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimentation in practical, end-to-end (E2E) next-generation networks deployments is becoming increasingly prevalent and significant in the realm of modern networking and wireless communications research. The prevalence of fifth-generation technology (5G) testbeds and the emergence of developing networks systems, for the purposes of research and testing, focus on the capabilities and features of analytics, intelligence, and automated management using novel testbed designs and architectures, ranging from simple simulations and setups to complex networking systems; however, with the ever-demanding application requirements for modern and future networks, 5G-and-beyond (denoted as 5G+) testbed experimentation can be useful in assessing the creation of large-scale network infrastructures that are capable of supporting E2E virtualized mobile network services. To this end, this paper presents a functional, modular E2E 5G+ system, complete with the integration of a Radio Access Network (RAN) and handling the connection of User Equipment (UE) in real-world scenarios. As well, this paper assesses and evaluates the effectiveness of emulating full network functionalities and capabilities, including a complete description of user-plane data, from UE registrations to communications sequences, and leads to the presentation of a future outlook in powering new experimentation for 6G and next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>CASPER: Carbon-Aware Scheduling and Provisioning for Distributed Web Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a significant societal push towards sustainable practices, including in computing. Modern interactive workloads such as geo-distributed web-services exhibit various spatiotemporal and performance flexibility, enabling the possibility to adapt the location, time, and intensity of processing to align with the availability of renewable and low-carbon energy. An example is a web application hosted across multiple cloud regions, each with varying carbon intensity based on their local electricity mix. Distributed load-balancing enables the exploitation of low-carbon energy through load migration across regions, reducing web applications carbon footprint. In this paper, we present CASPER, a carbon-aware scheduling and provisioning system that primarily minimizes the carbon footprint of distributed web services while also respecting their Service Level Objectives (SLO). We formulate CASPER as an multi-objective optimization problem that considers both the variable carbon intensity and latency constraints of the network. Our evaluation reveals the significant potential of CASPER in achieving substantial reductions in carbon emissions. Compared to baseline methods, CASPER demonstrates improvements of up to 70% with no latency performance degradation.</description>

      <title>CODA: A COst-efficient Test-time Domain Adaptation Mechanism for HAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, emerging research on mobile sensing has led to novel scenarios that enhance daily life for humans, but dynamic usage conditions often result in performance degradation when systems are deployed in real-world settings. Existing solutions typically employ one-off adaptation schemes based on neural networks, which struggle to ensure robustness against uncertain drifting conditions in human-centric sensing scenarios. In this paper, we propose CODA, a COst-efficient Domain Adaptation mechanism for mobile sensing that addresses real-time drifts from the data distribution perspective with active learning theory, ensuring cost-efficient adaptation directly on the device. By incorporating a clustering loss and importance-weighted active learning algorithm, CODA retains the relationship between different clusters during cost-effective instance-level updates, preserving meaningful structure within the data distribution. We also showcase its generalization by seamlessly integrating it with Neural Network-based solutions for Human Activity Recognition tasks. Through meticulous evaluations across diverse datasets, including phone-based, watch-based, and integrated sensor-based sensing tasks, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of online adaptation with CODA. The promising results achieved by CODA, even without learnable parameters, also suggest the possibility of realizing unobtrusive adaptation through specific application designs with sufficient feedback.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metaverse aims to construct a large, unified, immersive, and shared digital realm by combining various technologies, namely XR (extended reality), blockchain, and digital twin, among others. This article explores the Metaverse from the perspective of multimedia communication by conducting and analyzing real-world experiments on four different Metaverse platforms: VR (virtual reality) Vircadia, VR Mozilla Hubs, VRChat, and MR (mixed reality) Virtual City. We first investigate the traffic patterns and network performance in the three VR platforms. After raising the challenges of the Metaverse streaming and investigating the potential methods to enhance Metaverse performance, we propose a remote rendering architecture and verify its advantages through a prototype involving the campus network and MR multimodal interaction by comparison with local rendering.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work discusses the benefits of having multiple simulated environments with different degrees of realism for the development of algorithms in scenarios populated by autonomous nodes capable of communication and mobility. This approach aids the development experience and generates robust algorithms. It also proposes GrADyS-SIM NextGen as a solution that enables development on a single programming language and toolset over multiple environments with varying levels of realism. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of this approach with a toy problem that makes use of the simulation framework, taking advantage of the proposed environments to iteratively develop a robust solution.</description>

      <title>LogPr\'ecis: Unleashing Language Models for Automated Malicious Log Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collection of security-related logs holds the key to understanding attack behaviors and diagnosing vulnerabilities. Still, their analysis remains a daunting challenge. Recently, Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated unmatched potential in understanding natural and programming languages. The question arises whether and how LMs could be also useful for security experts since their logs contain intrinsically confused and obfuscated information. In this paper, we systematically study how to benefit from the state-of-the-art in LM to automatically analyze text-like Unix shell attack logs. We present a thorough design methodology that leads to LogPr\'ecis. It receives as input raw shell sessions and automatically identifies and assigns the attacker tactic to each portion of the session, i.e., unveiling the sequence of the attacker's goals. We demonstrate LogPr\'ecis capability to support the analysis of two large datasets containing about 400,000 unique Unix shell attacks. LogPr\'ecis reduces them into about 3,000 fingerprints, each grouping sessions with the same sequence of tactics. The abstraction it provides lets the analyst better understand attacks, identify fingerprints, detect novelty, link similar attacks, and track families and mutations. Overall, LogPr\'ecis, released as open source, paves the way for better and more responsive defense against cyberattacks.</description>

      <title>Sparse Mean Field Load Balancing in Large Localized Queueing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable load balancing algorithms are of great interest in cloud networks and data centers, necessitating the use of tractable techniques to compute optimal load balancing policies for good performance. However, most existing scalable techniques, especially asymptotically scaling methods based on mean field theory, have not been able to model large queueing networks with strong locality. Meanwhile, general multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques can be hard to scale and usually lack a theoretical foundation. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging recent advances in sparse mean field theory to learn a near-optimal load balancing policy in sparsely connected queueing networks in a tractable manner, which may be preferable to global approaches in terms of wireless communication overhead. Importantly, we obtain a general load balancing framework for a large class of sparse bounded-degree wireless topologies. By formulating a novel mean field control problem in the context of graphs with bounded degree, we reduce the otherwise difficult multi-agent problem to a single-agent problem. Theoretically, the approach is justified by approximation guarantees. Empirically, the proposed methodology performs well on several realistic and scalable wireless network topologies as compared to a number of well-known load balancing heuristics and existing scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.</description>
