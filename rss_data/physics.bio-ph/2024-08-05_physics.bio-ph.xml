      <title>In-silico model of the pregnant uterus as a network of oscillators under sparse adaptive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To ensure optimal survival of the neonate, the biological timing of parturition must be tightly controlled. Medical studies show that a variety of endocrine systems play the role of a control system, establishing a dynamic balance between the forces that cause uterine quiescence during pregnancy and the forces that produce coordinated uterine contractility at parturition. These control mechanism, and the factors that affect their performance, are still poorly understood. To help fill this gap, we propose a model of the pregnant uterus as a network of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators, with each cell symbolizing the electrical activity of a myocyte. The model is augmented with sparse adaptive control mechanisms representing the regulating endocrine functions. The control system is characterized by the fraction of controlled sites, and strength of control. We quantitatively find the conditions for which the control system exhibit a balance between robustness (resilience against perturbations) and flexibility (ability to switch function with minimal cost) crucial for optimal neonatal survival. Specifically, we show that Braxton-Hicks and Alvarez contractions, which are observed sporadic contractions of the uterine muscle, serve as a safety valve against over-controlling, strategically suppressed yet retained to optimize the control system's efficiency. Preterm birth is suggested to be understood as a mis-identification of the control boundaries. These insights contribute to advancing our understanding of maternal-fetal health.</description>

      <title>Extreme-value analysis in nano-biological systems: Applications and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme value analysis (EVA) is a statistical method that studies the properties of extreme values of datasets, crucial for fields like engineering, meteorology, finance, insurance, and environmental science. EVA models extreme events using distributions such as Fr\'echet, Weibull, or Gumbel, aiding in risk prediction and management. This review explores EVA's application to nanoscale biosystems. Traditionally, biological research focuses on average values from repeated experiments. However, EVA offers insights into molecular mechanisms by examining extreme data points. We introduce EVA's concepts with simulations and review its use in studying motor protein movements within cells, highlighting the importance of in vivo analysis due to the complex intracellular environment. We suggest EVA as a tool for extracting motor proteins' physical properties in vivo and discuss its potential in other biological systems. While EVA's use in nanoscale biological systems is limited, it holds promise for uncovering hidden properties in extreme data, promoting its broader application in life sciences.</description>

      <title>Effect of interleaflet friction on the dynamics of molecular rotors in lipid membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular rotors form twisted conformations upon photoexcitation, with their fluorescent relaxation time serving as a measure of viscosity. They have been used to assess membrane viscosities but yield higher values compared to other methods. Here, we show that the rotor's relaxation time is influenced by a combination of membrane viscosity and interleaflet friction. We present a theory for the relaxation time and obtain a correction factor that accounts for the discrepancy. If the membrane's viscosity is known, molecular rotors may enable the extraction of the elusive interleaflet friction.</description>

      <title>Competition between transient oscillations and early stochasticity in exponentially growing populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that the exponential growth rate of a population of bacterial cells starting from a single cell shows transient oscillations due to early synchronized bursts of division. These oscillations are enhanced by cell size regulation and contain information about single-cell growth statistics. Here, we report a phase transition in these oscillations as a function of growth rate variability. Below the transition point, these oscillations become asymptotically deterministic and can be measured experimentally, while above the transition point, the stochasticity in population growth dominates the oscillations and masks all the information about single cell growth statistics. The analytically calculated transition point, which roughly corresponds to $13\%$ variability in single-cell growth rate, falls within physiologically relevant parameters. Additionally, we show that the oscillations can stochastically emerge even when the initial state contains multiple cells with out-of-phase division cycles. We show that the amplitude and the phase of these oscillations are stochastic and would vary across repeated measurements with the same initial conditions. We provide analytic expressions as well as numerical estimates for the typical oscillation amplitude and the number of generations before the amplitude falls below a given measurement threshold for E. coli in multiple growth conditions.</description>
