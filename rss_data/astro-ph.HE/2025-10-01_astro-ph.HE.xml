      <title>The Accretion Disk Size Problem in AGN Disk Reverberation Mapping is an Obscuration Effect: A Uniform AGN Sample Study with Swift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, Swift has performed several AGN high-cadence reverberation mapping campaigns, and generally found that the UV/optical interband lags are $\sim$3 times longer than predicted for a standard thin disk, thus coined "the accretion disk size problem". Here we present a systematic sample of Swift-monitored AGN. In this analysis, we confirm the accretion disk size problem, but find that the lag excess occurs only in the subset of obscured AGN, which show a significantly elevated mean normalization of $5.21 \pm 0.47$ ($p = 0.008$), whereas the unobscured AGN exhibit a mean excess consistent with standard disk predictions ($1.00 \pm 0.31$). Correlation and regression analyses similarly reveal X-ray column density as the strongest predictor of lag excess, explaining over 80% of its variance. We interpret these results as line-of-sight obscuration being linked to the too-long lags via additional reprocessed emission from the absorbing material itself. The consistency of lags in the unobscured subgroup with standard disk predictions suggests that the accretion disk size problem is not the result of shortcomings of standard accretion disk theory nor contamination by the broad-line region (BLR). X-ray to UV lag amplitudes and correlations show more complex and variable behavior in obscured AGN, suggesting that obscuration may disrupt or complicate the connection between high- and low-energy emission potentially through reprocessing, scattering, and/or ionization changes.</description>

      <title>Untangling the Complex Nature of AGN Variability with Fairall 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion flow in AGN is not well understood, motivating intensive monitoring campaigns of multiwavelength variability to probe its structure. One of the best of these is the 3 year optical/UV/X-ray approximately daily monitoring campaign on Fairall\,9, a fairly typical moderate accretion rate AGN. The UV lightcurve shows a clear increase over $\sim 50$ days between years 1 and 2, strongly coherent with the X-ray lightcurve rise. This changes the average spectral energy distribution such that the disc component is stronger while the X-ray spectrum steepens, so that the total X-ray power remains roughly constant. Outside of this global change, we apply a Fourier resolved analysis to test stochastic models where intrinsic fluctuations in the UV disc propagate down into the hard X-ray emission region via both changing the seed photon flux for Compton scattering (short light travel timescale) and changing the electron density (longer propagation timescale). Unlike these models, the hard X-rays are not particularly well correlated with the UV, and also have the wrong sign in that the hard X-rays marginally lead the UV fluctuations. We show that this is instead consistent with uncorrelated stochastic fluctuations in both the UV (slow) and X-ray (fast), which are linked together only weakly via light travel time. These variability properties, as well as the changes in the SED, has implications for our understanding of AGN structure and physics, as well as future monitoring campaigns.</description>

      <title>Supernovae Exploding within Dense Extended Material: Early Emission Regimes and Degeneracies in Parameter Inference from Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early light curves of many core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are thought to be powered by the interaction of the shock wave with optically thick extended material, either a bound envelope or preexplosion ejected circumstellar matter (CSM). We analytically analyze the early emission produced by a shock with velocity $v$ traversing a material of mass $M_\mathrm{e}$ and opacity $\kappa$ extending to radius $R_\mathrm{e}$, and show the emission varies qualitatively with varying $\tau_\mathrm{e}=\kappa\!M_\mathrm{e}/(4\pi\!R_\mathrm{e}^2)$: For $\tau_\mathrm{e}\gg\!c/v$ a shock breakout occurs near $R_\mathrm{e}$ producing an ``edge breakout"- a UV-dominated breakout burst followed by ``cooling emission" of the shock-heated material; for $\tau_\mathrm{e}\lesssim\!c/v$ a ``wind breakout" occurs- the breakout pulse is prolonged and followed by extended emission shifting from UV to X-ray as the shock becomes collisionless. We derive the dependence on $\{v,\kappa,M_\mathrm{e},R_\mathrm{e}\}$ of the duration and luminosity characterizing the different emission phases, and show that current observations typically do not allow inference of all parameters. In particular, since the optical bands lie in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of radiation emitted during the cooling phase, the observed cooling luminosity depends weakly on radius, $\propto\!R_\mathrm{e}^{1/4}$, leading to $1-2$ orders of magnitude uncertainty in its inferred value. This suggests, e.g., that the common day-scale light curve features in Stripped-Envelope SNe do not necessarily imply material extending to $R_\mathrm{e}\sim10^3\!R_\odot$ and are often consistent with low-mass $R_\mathrm{e}\sim\!10^2\!R_\odot$ bound envelopes. Early multiband coverage (especially in UV/X-ray) can break these degeneracies; the forthcoming \emph{ULTRASAT} UV mission will allow inferring the properties of extended material around the population of SNe progenitors.</description>

      <title>The Non Parametric Reconstruction of Binary Black Hole Mass Evolution from GWTC-4.0 Gravitational Wave Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of binary black hole (BBH) masses and its evolution with redshift provide key insights into the different formation channels of the compact objects and their evolution with cosmic time and stellar properties such stellar metallicity and star formation rate history. We present a non parametric, model-independent joint reconstruction of the redshift evolution of BBH mass distribution from gravitational wave (GW) catalog GWTC-4.0 from the fourth observation of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). This method simultaneously searches for the signature of any linear and quadratic redshift evolution with respect to the low redshift in a Bayesian framework taking into accounting the detector selection effects. We find tentative evidence for a linear redshift-dependent evolution of the mass distribution, consistent over a mass range ($m \gtrsim 50\,M_\odot$). While lower mass systems shows no signature of evolution. The quadratic term remains consistent with zero, indicating that a simple linear dependence adequately describes the population up to redshift $z \sim 1$. In future with more GW sources, this technique can shed light into the true nature of the redshift dependence and possibility to uncover subtle evolutionary features in BBH populations and to probe the cosmic history of black hole formation.</description>

      <title>VERITAS Follow-Up Observations of the Ultra-High-Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent announcement of the detection of the ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino event KM3-230213A by the KM3NeT telescope represents a critical opportunity to explore the origins of cosmic neutrinos and their potential gamma-ray counterparts. With an inferred neutrino energy exceeding 100 PeV, this event stands as the most energetic neutrino observed to date. The large offset from the galactic plane (11 degrees) and the presence of several blazars with temporally correlated multiwavelength counterparts within the 3 degrees localization region raise the possibility of an extragalactic origin. Additionally, the event's apparent tension with IceCube constraints suggests that it could be transient in nature rather than cosmogenic. VERITAS conducted a targeted follow-up campaign to search for very-high-energy (VHE, greater than 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission associated with KM3-230213A. Observations were performed in February and March 2025, using a four-point wobble strategy centered on the best-fit neutrino position, covering nearly the entire 90 percent confidence region. These observations probe potential hadronic gamma-ray emission from a common origin with the neutrino, placing constraints on particle-acceleration scenarios. We present the results of this search, including upper limits on very-high-energy gamma-ray flux and their implications for possible source models of KM3-230213A.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the host galaxies and delay times of Ca-rich gap transients vs 91bg-like SNe and normal Type Ia SNe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calcium-rich gap transients are a faint, fast-evolving class of supernovae that show strong nebular Ca emission lines. Their progenitor systems are uncertain, but they are often associated with old and quiescent host galaxies. In this work, we compare the properties of the hosts of hydrogen-poor Ca-rich gap transients to the hosts of 3 other classes of supernova (SNe): normal Type Ia, 91bg-like, and Type II. We use data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Census of the Local Universe (CLU) experiment to build up our 4 SNe samples and identify the host galaxies. A combination of precomputed host properties from the CLU catalog and those derived from SED fitting are used to characterize each host's stellar mass, star formation rate, and specific star formation rate (sSFR). We find that the hosts of Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe occupy a similar parameter space of mass and sSFR, and are more massive and quiescent compared to the hosts of Type Ia and Type II SNe. Additionally, we construct delay time distributions (DTDs) for our 4 samples, finding that Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe have the longest peak delay times $\sim 10^4$ Myr, compared to the peak delay times of Type Ia SNe ($\sim 10^3$ Myr) and Type II SNe ($\sim 10$ Myr). The similarity of host environment and DTDs for Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe motivates further analysis of the relationship of these two transient classes.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Magnetic Fields and Molecular Cloud Interactions in the Supernova Remnant G1.9+0.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present on results of a spatially resolved spectral analysis of G1.9+0.3, the youngest known supernova remnant in the Galaxy. The X-ray spectra are well described by synchrotron emission from a power-law electron distribution with an exponential cutoff. We found a cutoff energy $\epsilon_0 \sim 1 ~ \rm{keV}$ in both the radio bright rim and the X-ray bright rims. In the loss-limited case, the cutoff energy depends on the shock velocity $v_{\rm{sh}}$ and the Bohm factor $\eta$, following the relation $\epsilon_0 \propto v_{\rm{sh}}^2 \eta^{-1} $. Our analysis shows that $\eta$ ranges from 2 to 4 in the radio rim and from 12 to 15 in the X-ray rims. This suggests that the magnetic field in the radio rim is more turbulent than in the X-ray rims. The presence of CO clouds along the radio rim likely contributes to this difference. Interaction between the shock and these clouds can slow the shock down and generate turbulent eddies. The resulting turbulence eddies can amplify the magnetic field. We propose that the strong radio emission from the radio rim is primarily due to this amplified magnetic field. In contrast, a CO cloud located in the south-west appears to lie in the foreground, as indicated by its low turbulence and the absence of shock deceleration.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity from neutron decays to dark baryons in neutron star matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of neutron decay into dark particles has been proposed as a way to resolve a growing discrepancy between two different measurements of the neutron lifetime. The most popular formulation is a dark sector consisting of a dark baryon $\chi$ and a dark scalar $\phi$, where a neutron in vacuum decays about 1% of the time via the channel $n\rightarrow \chi+\phi$. In this work, we consider the effect of this additional neutron decay channel on transport in neutrons star mergers. We find that the neutron dark decay rate in medium is quite slow, and thus the dark baryons modify the dense matter equation of state in a way that decreases the Urca bulk viscosity by, at most, a factor of 2-3. However, if the neutron dark decay was to occur more rapidly, then the bulk viscosity at merger temperatures of tens of MeV would be strongly enhanced, potentially rapidly damping oscillations in merger environments and therefore providing a signature of slowly equilibrating matter in the merger.</description>

      <title>A fast powerful X-ray transient from tidal disruption of a white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars captured by black holes (BHs) can be tore apart by strong tidal force, producing electromagnetic flares. Some 100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been observed, involving invariably normal gaseous stars whose debris falls onto the BH fueling the flares over years. White dwarfs (WDs)-the most prevalent compact stars a million times denser and thus tougher than gaseous stars-can only be disrupted by intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of 10^2-10^5 solar masses. WD-TDEs are predicted to generate more powerful and short-lived flares, but their evidence has been lacking. Here we report observations of a fast, luminous X-ray transient EP250702a. Its one-day-long peak showed strong recurrent flares extending to several tens of MeV in gamma-rays, indicating relativistic jet emission. The jet X-rays dropped sharply from exceeding 3 x 10^49 to around 10^44 erg/s within 20 days. These characteristics are inconsistent with any known transient phenomena other than a jetted-TDE evolving within a short timespan previously unseen-indicating the disruption of a white dwarf by an IMBH. At late times, a new soft component progressively dominates the X-ray spectrum, exhibiting extreme super-Eddington luminosity, possibly from an accretion disc. WD-TDEs open a new window to study elusive IMBHs and the otherwise invisible interior of degenerate stars.</description>

      <title>Spatial distribution of secondary electrons' Synchrotron emission: property and implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic $\gamma$-ray sources can be produced by either high-energy protons via proton-proton collisions or electrons/positrons via inverse Compton scattering. Distinguishing between the hadronic and leptonic origin of $\gamma$-ray emission in Galactic sources remains challenging. Measurements of non-thermal X-ray spectra of these sources, which could originate from primary electrons in the leptonic scenario or secondary electrons/positrons in the hadronic scenario, have been suggested as an efficient way of discriminating between these scenarios. In this work, we investigate the morphology of the X-ray emission from secondary electrons/positrons. By calculating the surface brightness profile and the photon index profile of X-ray emission, we find that secondary electrons produce a distinctively flat X-ray surface brightness profile. Our results suggest that, in addition to the X-ray spectrum, the X-ray morphology is crucial to determine the radiation mechanism of ultrahigh-energy $\gamma$-ray sources and help to identify sources of PeV cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic-Dissipative St\"{o}rmer Problem-Trajectories and Radiation Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the classical nonrelativistic St\"{o}rmer problem, describing the motion of charged particles in a purely magnetic dipole field, by taking into account the effects of the dissipation, assumed to be of friction type, proportional to the velocity of the particle, and of the presence of stochastic forces. In the presence of dissipative/stochastic effects, the motion of the particle in the magnetic dipole field can be described by a generalized Langevin type equation, which generalizes the standard Lorentz force equation. We perform a detailed numerical analysis of the dynamical behavior of the particles in a magnetic dipolar field in the presence of dissipative and stochastic forces, as well as of the electromagnetic radiation patterns emitted during the motion. The effects of the dissipation coefficient and of the stochastic force on the particle motion and on the emitted electromagnetic power are investigated, and thus a full description of the spectrum of the magnetic dipole type electromagnetic radiation and of the physical properties of the motion is also obtained. The power spectral density of the emitted electromagnetic power is also obtained for each case, and, for all considered St\"{o}rmer type models, it shows the presence of peaks in the radiation spectrum, corresponding to certain intervals of the frequency.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Gaussian Methods for Robust Background Modeling in CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) Gravitational-Wave Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for gamma-ray counterparts to gravitational-wave events with the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) requires accurate and robust background modeling. Previous CALET observing runs (O3 and O4) relied on averaged pre/post-event baselines or low-order polynomial fits, approaches that neglect correlated noise, temporal non-stationarity, and the propagation of background uncertainty into derived flux upper limits. These simplifications can lead to reduced sensitivity to faint or atypical transients. In this work, we present a novel Bayesian framework for background estimation based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression and change-point modeling. Our approach captures correlated structures in the detector background, quantifies predictive uncertainties, and propagates them into both detection statistics and Bayesian credible upper limits. We demonstrate, using archival CALET time-tagged event data and simulated signal injections, that our method improves sensitivity to weak short-duration bursts by up to an order of magnitude compared to traditional polynomial fits. This probabilistic background treatment enables a more physically robust interpretation of non-detections and offers a scalable, real-time compatible extension for future joint multi-messenger searches.

      <title>The Formation of Neutron Star Systems through Electron-capture Supernovae: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally believed that the electron-capture reactions happen when the oxygen-neon (ONe) cores grow in masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit, leading to the formation of neutron stars (NSs) via electron-capture supernovae (EC-SNe). EC-SNe are predicted to be the most likely short-lived and faint optical transients, and a small ejecta mass is expected during the collapse. This kind of SNe provide an alternative channel for producing isolated NSs and NS systems, especially for the formation of X-ray binaries and double NSs. However, there are still some uncertainties for the origin of EC-SNe. In this article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor channels of EC-SNe, i.e., the single star channel and the binary star channel. In the single star channel, EC-SNe can happen in super asymptotic giant branch stars or He stars, whereas in the binary star channel EC-SNe can occur in He stars in binaries (including He star+MS systems and NS+He star systems) or accretion-induced collapse in white dwarf binaries (including the single-degenerate scenario and the double-degenerate scenario). Recent progress on the two progenitor channels is discussed, including the initial parameter range for EC-SNe, the evolutionary paths to EC-SNe, related objects, and some observational constraints, etc. We also discuss the formation of double NSs through NS+He star binaries, in which the He star companion experiences an EC-SN. Research on EC-SNe is at a pivotal stage, with key theoretical uncertainties and observational challenges requiring integrated modeling and multi-wavelength observations for robust identification.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent obscuration of a tidal disruption event candidate in the active galactic nucleus CSS100217</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CSS100217 is considered a peculiar tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate occurring in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Unlike typical TDEs, where the post-flare luminosity is equal to that pre-flare, CSS100217 decayed to $\sim$ 0.4 magnitudes fainter than its pre-flare V band level. In this manuscript, we propose an obscured TDE model to explain the light curve of CSS100217. Assuming that the time-dependent obscuration, caused by the TDE unbound stellar debris, or by nuclear clouds moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH), follows a Weibull distribution, we find that the light curve of CSS100217 can be described by the tidal disruption of a $4.6_{-0.9}^{+0.9}{\rm M_\odot}$ main-sequence star by a $3.3_{-0.3}^{+0.3}\times10^7{\rm M_\odot}$ black hole. The total energy of the event derived from our fit is $7.23\times10^{53}$ ergs and about 1.38 ${\rm M_\odot}$ of debris mass is accreted by the central SMBH. The model indicates that the contribution of the host galaxy to the observed pre-flare optical luminosity is not-significant compared to that of the AGN, which is consistent with the results of the spectral analysis. These results suggest that obscuration may play an important role in explaining the unusual TDE-like variability observed in CSS100217.</description>

      <title>Investigating four new candidate redback pulsars discovered in the image plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports the discovery and follow-up of four candidate redback spider pulsars: GPM J1723-33, GPM J1734-28, GPM J1752-30 and GPM J1815-14, discovered with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) from an imaging survey of the Galactic Plane. These sources are considered to be redback candidates based on their eclipsing variability, steep negative spectral indices, and potential Fermi $\gamma$-ray associations, with GPM J1723-33 and GPM J1815-14 lying within a Fermi 95% error ellipse. Follow-up pulsation searches with MeerKAT confirmed pulsations from GPM J1723-33, while the non-detections of the other three are likely due to scattering by material ablated from their companion stars. We identify possible orbital periods by applying folding algorithms to the light curves and determine that all sources have short orbital periods (&lt;24 hours), consistent with redback spider systems. Following up on the sources at multiple radio frequencies revealed that the sources exhibit frequency-dependent eclipses, with longer eclipses observed at lower frequencies. We place broad constraints on the eclipse medium, ruling out induced Compton scattering and cyclotron absorption. Three sources are spatially consistent with optical sources in the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey imaging, which may contain the optical counterparts. Each field is affected by strong dust extinction, and follow-up with large telescopes is needed to identify the true counterparts. Identifying potential radio counterparts to four previously unassociated Fermi sources brings us closer to understanding the origin of the unexplained $\gamma$-ray excess in the Galactic Centre.</description>

      <title>Search for UHE neutrinos from GRBs with the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the search for ultra-high-energy neutrinos from the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using Surface Detector (SD) data from Phase I of the Pierre Auger Observatory (2004-2021). A total of 570 GRBs occur within the most neutrino-sensitive field of view of the SD, considering both Earth-skimming and downward-going detection channels. For this purpose, GRB neutrino emission has been modeled using the numerical software NeuCosmA, incorporating gamma-ray measurements and inferred parameters such as the jet Lorentz factor and the minimum variability time scale. No neutrino candidates were found, and upper limits were obtained by stacking the individual GRB neutrino fluences. These limits are complementary to those of IceCube and ANTARES and provide the strongest constraints on prompt GRB neutrino fluence above $10^{18}$ eV. Additionally, limits on GRB fluence in alternative models of neutrino production have been derived using Auger data.</description>

      <title>Stereo observations of CTA 1 with SST-1M</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CTA~1 is a composite supernova remnant featuring a shell structure and an inner Pulsar Wind Nebula. The shell is visible in the radio band, while Fermi has detected the radio-quiet pulsar PSR J0007+7303 at its core. Gamma-ray detectors such as LHAASO and VERITAS have detected TeV emission in the vicinity of the pulsar. However, the derived SEDs from LHAASO WCDA and VERITAS show significant discrepancies, which could be due to a complicated energy-dependent morphology not accounted for in the spectral analysis, and different angular resolution of the two experiments. CTA~1 has been a target for dedicated observations by the SST-1M telescopes, a pair of small-sized Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) capable of operating in both mono and stereo modes. Located at the Ond\v{r}ejov Observatory in Czech Republic, these telescopes are sensitive to the high energy range of the gamma-ray spectrum, spanning from 1 to 300 TeV. To investigate the very high-energy emission of CTA~1, the SST-1Ms have accumulated approximately 30 hours of selected observations, aiming to further constrain the characteristics of the source's high energy emission, and to shed some light into the discrepancy between different experiments.</description>

      <title>The detection of high X-ray polarization from an accretion disc corona source and its modelling via Monte Carlo radiation transfer simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an X-ray polarization degree (PD) of $8.8\pm1.4\%~(1\sigma)$ from the accretion-disc-corona (ADC) neutron-star system 2S 0921-630 (=V395 Car) observed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). The PD increases with energy, while the polarization angle (PA) varies significantly across the band. These trends are consistent with a high-inclination ADC geometry where the vertically extended disc blocks direct sight of the central X-ray source, and the observed X-rays are those scattered in an equatorial disc wind. We also find tentative PD variability in the 2--3 keV band. To interpret the time-averaged polarization, we build spectropolarimetric models by Monte Carlo radiation transfer simulation with column density distribution of thermal-radiative wind launched by X-ray irradiation of the outer disc under an axisymmetric geometry. The model combines boundary-layer emission, its disc reflection, and the disc continuum, each with its intrinsic polarization. Scattering of this composite spectrum in the wind reproduces both the observed PD and its increase with energy. However, the observed PA evolution is not captured, which may indicate departures from axisymmetry--e.g. misalignment between the inner disc (and/or neutron-star spin) and the outer disc/wind, or a weak disc warping.</description>

      <title>Testing the nature of GW200105 by probing the frequency evolution of eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GW200105 is a compact binary coalescence (CBC) event, consisting of a neutron star and a black hole, observed in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's (LVK's) third observing run (O3). Recent reanalyses of the event using state-of-the-art waveform models have claimed observation of signatures of an eccentric orbit. It has nevertheless been pointed out in the literature that certain physical or modified gravity effects could mimic eccentricity by producing a spurious non-zero eccentricity value, at a given reference frequency, when recovered with an eccentric waveform model. We recently developed a model-independent Eccentricity Evolution Consistency Test (EECT, S. A. Bhat et al. 2025) to identify such mimickers, by comparing the measured frequency $\textit{evolution}$ of eccentricity, $e(f)$, with that expected from General Relativity (GR). In this $\textit{Letter}$, we apply EECT to GW200105 and find that it satisfies EECT within 68% confidence. Our analysis therefore lends complementary support in favour of the eccentricity hypothesis, while also providing a novel test of the consistency of $e(f)$ with GR.</description>

      <title>On the Ultra-Long Gamma-Ray Transient GRB 250702B/EP250702</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 250702B/EP250702a is an interesting long-duration gamma-ray transient whose nature is in debate. To obtain a full picture in gamma-ray band, we implement a comprehensive targeted search of burst emission in a wide window of 30 days jointly with Insight-HXMT, GECAM and Fermi/GBM data within the ETJASMIN framework. In gamma-ray band, we find there is a 50-second precursor about 25 hours before the 4-hour main burst, which generally consists of 4 emission episodes. Remarkably, we find that the soft X-ray emission (after the main burst) decays as a power-law with start time aligning with the last episode of main emission and index of -5/3 perfectly consistent with the canonical prediction of fallback accretion. We conclude that the properties of precursor, main burst and the following soft X-ray emission strongly support the atypical collapsar Ultra-Long Gamma-Ray Burst (ULGRB) scenario rather than the Tidal Disruption Event (TDE), and all these gamma-ray and soft X-ray emission probably originate from relativistic jet whose luminosity is dominated by the fallback accretion rate during the death collapse of a supergiant star.</description>

      <title>Two-component diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission revealed with Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enigma of cosmic ray origin and propagation stands as a key question in particle astrophysics. The precise spatial and spectral measurements of diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission provide new avenues for unraveling this mystery. Based on 16 years of Fermi-LAT observations, we find that the diffuse gamma-ray spectral shapes are nearly identical for low energies (below a few GeV) but show significant dispersion at high energies (above a few GeV) across the Galactic disk. We further show that the diffuse emission can be decomposed into two components, a universal spectral component dominating at low energies which is consistent with the expectation from interactions of background cosmic rays and the interstellar matter, and a spatially variant component dominating at high energies which is likely due to local accelerators. These findings suggest that there is dual-origin of the Galactic diffuse emission, including the ``cosmic ray sea'' from efficient propagation of particles and the ``cosmic ray islands'' from inefficient propagation of particles, and thus shed new light on the understanding of the propagation models of Galactic cosmic rays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense neutrino systems, which display collectivity mediated by the weak interaction, have deep parallels with mean-field kinetic systems governed by other fundamental forces. We identify analogues in fast flavor conversion (FFC) of some time-honored nonlinear phenomena in plasmas and self-gravitating systems. We focus in particular on nonlinear Landau damping and collisionless equilibria, which are likely important pieces of the unsolved puzzle of neutrino oscillations in core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. Our analysis additionally reveals the previously unexplored phenomenon of flavor-wave synchronization.</description>

      <title>Is the Peculiar Galactic Center Transient Swift J174610.4-290018 A Recurrent Nova?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swift J174610.4-290018, a peculiar transient X-ray source originally discovered by the Swift satellite in February 2024 at the onset of its outburst, recently attracted intentional or coincident follow-up X-ray observations using Swift, NuSTAR and Chandra. We have performed a comprehensive analysis of the relevant X-ray data to investigate the spectral and temporal properties of this source between October 2000 and July 2024. Archival Chandra data reveal a plausible additional outburst in 2005, followed by a quiescent state in the next $\sim$19 years. The X-ray spectra in both the quiescent and outburst phases are consistent with a thermal plasma spectrum with relatively high temperatures ($\sim$10 keV) and prominent emission lines from both neutral and highly-ionized iron. A previously proposed low-mass X-ray binary/accretion disk corona scenario for Swift J174610, based on XRISM observations near the peak of the 2024 outburst, is examined against the newly derived X-ray properties and is disfavored, in particular due to its difficulty in explaining the quiescent state spectrum. Instead, we suggest a symbiotic binary/recurrent nova scenario, which gains support from many of the observed X-ray properties of Swift J174610 and a close comparison with the famous Galactic recurrent nova RS Oph. If confirmed, Swift J174610 would represent the first nova detected in the Galactic center, offering new insights into the otherwise elusive population of massive white dwarfs as well as wide binaries in the close vicinity of Sgr A*. Our findings call for multi-wavelength follow-up observations for this highly unusual X-ray source.</description>

      <title>$\phi$-Dwarfs: White Dwarfs probe Quadratically Coupled Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study ultralight scalar fields with quadratic couplings to Standard-Model fermions and derive strong constraints from white-dwarf mass-radius data. Such couplings source scalar profiles inside compact stars, shift fermion masses, and can produce a new ground state of matter. We analyze couplings to electrons and to nucleons, incorporating composition and finite-temperature effects in white dwarf structure and equations of state. We identify two robust observables: (i) forbidden gaps - ranges of radii with no stable configurations - and (ii) characteristic shape distortions that drive white dwarf masses toward the Chandrasekhar limit (electron couplings) or shift the maximum mass (nucleon couplings). Confronting these predictions with precise measurements for Sirius B and Procyon B, together with the global white dwarf population, excludes large regions of unexplored parameter space and extends earlier QCD-axion-specific bounds to a broader class of scalar theories. Our stellar constraints rely only on sourcing and do not assume the scalar constitutes dark matter; where mass reductions are small, precision laboratory searches remain competitive. White-dwarf astrophysics thus provides a powerful, largely assumption-minimal probe of ultralight, quadratically coupled scalars.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. Detection of shock-heated gas beyond the halo boundary into the accretion region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot gas in the outskirts of galaxy cluster-sized halos, extending around and beyond the virial radius into nearby accretion regions, remains among one of the least explored baryon components of large-scale cosmic structure. We present a stacking analysis of 680 galaxy clusters located in the western Galactic hemisphere, using data from the first two years of the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. The stacked X-ray surface brightness profile reveals a statistically significant signal extending out to 2r200m (~4.5 Mpc). The best-fit surface brightness profile is well described by a combination of terms describing orbiting and infalling gas, with a transition occurring around r200m. At this radius, the best-fit gas density is 2.5e-5 cm^-3, corresponding to a baryon overdensity of 30. By integrating the gas density profile out to r200m, we infer a gas fraction of 90% of the universal baryon fraction with the assumption of a typical halo concentration, indicating the completeness of the baryon budget within large radii. Additionally, we examine the hot gas distribution in massive clusters in the IllustrisTNG simulations from the halo center to the accretion region. This analysis reveals differences in radial gas profiles depending on whether the direction probes voids or nearby cosmic filaments. Beyond r200m, the density profile along the filament direction exceeds that along the void direction. This pattern aligns with the observed transition radius between the one-halo and two-halo terms, suggesting that r200m is the approximate radius marking the location at which cosmic filaments connect to galaxy clusters. Meanwhile, the comparisons of the gas density profile and gas fraction profile between the observation and the IllustrisTNG simulation suggest that the feedback processes in the stacking sample are more efficient than the IllustrisTNG model in distributing gas to large radii.</description>

      <title>Null matter and the ultrarelativistic origin of hydrodynamics at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover a universal sector of relativistic fluid dynamics by taking a novel ultrarelativistic limit in which the temperature tends to zero while the flow simultaneously approaches the speed of light. In this regime, hydrodynamics becomes an effective theory of \emph{null matter}, characterised by a preferred null vector, a preferred scale, and their gradients. We show that this theory of null matter constitutes an example of a hydrodynamic theory that can be linearly stable and causal in an arbitrary choice of frame. The framework developed here for null matter can offer insights into ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, astrophysical phenomena with inherently large Lorentz factors, and the dynamics of black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>Shocked, Heated, and Now Resolved: H$_2$ excitation in the low-luminosity AGN at M58 core with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present \textit{JWST} NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations of the central kiloparsec of M58 (NGC 4579), a nearby LINER galaxy hosting a low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN; $L_\mathrm{bol} \sim 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) with a low-power jet. These data provide an unprecedented view of the warm molecular gas phase and reveal clear signatures of feedback. We detect 44 H$_2$ lines, including bright pure rotational lines (S(1)-S(18)) and rovibrational lines up to $\nu=2$, probing a wide range of excitation conditions. Excitation diagrams show that rotational lines follow a power-law temperature distribution with an exponential cutoff, consistent with heating by low-velocity shocks. H$_2$ rovibrational lines deviate from thermal models primarily because of sub-thermal excitation at low density. Additionally, there may be a 10% contribution by AGN X-ray heating in the nucleus. The dust lanes associated with the spiral inflow appear dynamically undisturbed but show signs of shock heating, while the inner $\sim$200 pc exhibits turbulent kinematics produced by outflowing molecular gas. These results reveal the subtle yet measurable impact of LLAGN feedback on the interstellar medium, demonstrating that even weak, vertically oriented jets and low radiative accretion rates can perturb molecular gas and regulate nuclear reservoirs. This study highlights JWST's transformative ability to uncover hidden modes of AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>A Photometric Classifier for Tidal Disruption Events in Rubin LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are astrophysical phenomena arising when stars are disrupted by supermassive black holes. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), with its unprecedented depth and cadence, will detect thousands of TDEs, motivating the need for robust photometric classifiers capable of efficiently distinguishing these events from other extragalactic transients. We aim to develop and validate a machine learning pipeline for photometric TDE identification in LSST-scale datasets. Our classifier is designed to provide high precision and recall, enabling the construction of reliable TDE catalogs for multi-messenger follow-up and statistical studies. Using the second Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC2) dataset, we fit Gaussian Processes (GP) to light curves for feature extraction (e.g., color, rise/fade times, GP length scales). We then train and tune boosted decision-tree models (XGBoost) with a custom scoring function emphasizing high-precision recovery of TDEs. Our pipeline is tested on a diverse simulation of transient and variable events, including supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and superluminous supernovae. We achieve high precision (up to 95%) while maintaining competitive recall (about 72%) for TDEs, with minimal contamination from non-TDE classes. Key predictive features include post-peak colors and GP hyperparameters, reflecting characteristic timescales and spectral behaviors of TDEs. Our photometric classifier provides a practical and scalable approach to identifying TDEs in forthcoming LSST data. By capturing essential color and temporal properties through GP-based feature extraction, it enables efficient construction of clean TDE candidate samples.</description>

      <title>Second-timescale Glints from Satellites and Space Debris Detected with Tomo-e Gozen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A search for second-timescale optical transients is one of the frontiers of time-domain astronomy. However, it has been pointed out that reflections of sunlight from Earth-orbiting objects can also produce second-timescale ``glints.'' We conducted wide-field observations at 2 frames per second using Tomo-e Gozen on the 1.05 m Kiso Schmidt telescope. We identified 1554 point-source glints that appeared in only one frame (0.5 sec). Their brightness ranges from 11 to 16 mag, with fainter glints being more numerous. These glints are likely caused by satellites and space debris in high-altitude orbits such as the geosynchronous Earth orbit or highly elliptical orbits. Many glints brighter than 14 mag are associated with known satellites or debris with large apogees ($&gt;$ 30,000 km). In contrast, most fainter glints are not associated with cataloged objects and may be due to debris with sizes of 0.3--1 m. The event rate of second-timescale glints is estimated to be $4.7 \pm 0.2\ {\rm deg^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$ (average) and $9.0 \pm 0.3\ {\rm deg^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$ (near the equator) at 15.5 mag. Our results demonstrate that high-altitude debris can represent a significant foreground in searches for second-timescale optical transients. They also imply that deep surveys such as Rubin/LSST will detect many of these glints in single-exposure images.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption of a neutron star near a naked singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tidal disruption of a neutron star (NS) near a black hole (BH), and for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, near a naked singularity (NaS). For a BH with a mass greater than about $10 M_{\odot}$, the tidal disruption of NS should occur within the event horizon, and hence neither can the stellar material escape nor a distant observer observe the disruption. Since NaS does not have an event horizon, a significant portion of the NS's material can escape, and the tidal disruption can be observed by a distant observer. One could identify such an event from the observed emission from the disrupted NS's material and the decay of the light curve of the disruption event. The escape of a significant fraction of the NS's material may also have implications for the heavy elements in the universe. Moreover, observing such an event can be useful for confirming a NaS, probing its spacetime, and studying the motion of matter in such a geometry. This may help constrain the NS parameters and equation of state models. As a first step in this direction, we calculate here the tidal disruption radius and other parameters for a specific type (Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan type 1) of NaS and compare our results with observations.</description>

      <title>Multi-strangeness matter from ab initio calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypernuclei and hypernuclear matter connect nuclear structure in the strangeness sector with the astrophysics of neutron stars, where hyperons are expected to emerge at high densities and affect key astrophysical observables. We present the first {\em ab initio} calculations that simultaneously describe single- and double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei from the light to medium-mass range, the equation of state for $\beta$-stable hypernuclear matter, and neutron star properties. Despite the formidable complexity of quantum Monte Carlo~(QMC) simulations with multiple baryonic degrees of freedom, by combining nuclear lattice effective field theory with a newly developed auxiliary-field QMC algorithm we achieve the first sign-problem free {\em ab initio} QMC simulations of hypernuclear systems containing an arbitrary number of neutrons, protons, and $\Lambda$ hyperons, including all relevant two- and three-body interactions. This eliminates reliance on the symmetry-energy approximation, long used to interpolate between symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter. Our unified calculations reproduce hyperon separation energies, yield a neutron star maximum mass consistent with observations, predict tidal deformabilities compatible with gravitational-wave measurements, and give a trace anomaly in line with Bayesian constraints. By bridging the physics of finite hypernuclei and infinite hypernuclear matter within a single {\em ab initio} framework, this work establishes a direct microscopic link between hypernuclear structure, dense matter composition, and the astrophysical properties of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>A Multiwavelength View of $\rho$ Oph I: Resolving the X-ray Source Between A and B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multiwavelength analysis of the central stellar pair of $\rho$ Oph, components A and B. Using recent high-resolution \textit{Chandra X-ray Observatory} observations, we demonstrate with high confidence that the dominant X-ray source is $\rho$ Oph B, while $\rho$ Oph A is comparatively X-ray faint. This result contrasts with earlier \textit{XMM-Newton} observations, which, due to limited spatial resolutions, attributed the X-ray emission to $\rho$ Oph A. An analysis of $\rho$ Oph B's X-ray light curves and spectra reveals properties more consistent with a cool star than a hot star. We therefore propose that $\rho$ Oph B is an Algol-like binary system, consisting of a B-type primary and an active, X-ray-emitting GK-type companion.</description>

      <title>Radiative and Jet Signatures of Regular Black Holes in Quantum-Corrected Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate regular rotating black holes predicted by asymptotically safe gravity, where the Newton constant varies with energy scale and modifies the near horizon geometry. These solutions remain asymptotically flat and avoid central singularities while differing from the classical Kerr spacetime in the strong field region. We compute the radiative efficiency of thin accretion disks and the jet power from the Blandford Znajek mechanism, both of which depend on the deformation parameter of the model. The predictions are compared with observational estimates for six stellar mass black holes. For systems with low or moderate spin the model reproduces the data within reported uncertainties, while rapidly spinning sources such as GRS 1915 105 present tensions and point to a restricted deformation range or the need for additional physics. The results show that quantum corrections confined to the strong gravity regime can still leave detectable imprints on high energy astrophysical processes. Radiative and jet based diagnostics therefore provide a promising method to test the geometry near the horizon and to explore possible signatures of quantum gravity in observations.</description>

      <title>Double Power-law Electron Spectra in Solar Flares Due to Temperature Anisotropy Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive observational and theoretical efforts, the physical processes responsible for shaping the diversity of accelerated electron spectra observed in solar flares remain poorly understood. We use 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of magnetized plasmas subject to continuous shear-driven magnetic amplification to investigate whether electron temperature anisotropy instabilities in above-the-loop-top (ALT) regions can account for this diversity. We explore how the resulting spectra depend on key plasma parameters: the initial electron temperature $T_e$ and the initial ratio of electron cyclotron to plasma frequencies, $f_e = \omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}$. In our simulations, the adiabatic evolution of the plasma generates electron temperature anisotropy with the electron temperature perpendicular to the magnetic field being larger than the parallel temperature. This eventually drives electromagnetic instabilities capable of scattering and accelerating electrons. The simulations consistently produce nonthermal tails in the electron spectra whose hardness increases with the initial value of $f_e$, while depending only weakly on $T_e$. For runs in which $f_e \lesssim 1.2$, the spectra exhibit double power-law shapes with downward (knee-like) breaks, and the electron scattering is dominated by OQES modes. In runs with $f_e\gtrsim 1.5$, PEMZ modes dominate and produce harder double power-law spectra with upward (elbow-like) breaks. Cases that include the $f_e\sim 1.2-1.5$ transition yield nearly single power-laws that end with bump-like breaks. Our results support the role of temperature anisotropy instabilities in accelerating electrons in ALT regions, offering a promising framework to help explain the wide range of nonthermal electron spectra reported in solar flare observations.</description>

      <title>Fast giant flares in discs around supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the thermal stability of non-self-gravitating turbulent $\alpha$-discs around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) to test a new type of high-amplitude galactic nucleus flares. By calculating the disc structures, we computed the critical points of equilibrium curves for discs around SMBHs, which cover a wide range of accretion rates and resemble the shape $\xi$. We find that a transition of a disc ring from a recombined cold state to a hot, fully ionised, advection dominated, geometrically thick state is possible. Such a transition can trigger a giant flare for SMBHs with masses $\sim 10^6-10^8\, M_\odot$ if the prior geometrically thin and optically thick disc surrounded a central radiatively inefficient accretion flow. An increase in the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ is a necessary condition for this scenario. This increase may be related to the fact that the magnetic Prandtl number increases and exceeds 1 during ionisation. When self-gravity effects in the disc are negligible, the duration and power of the flare exhibit a positive correlation with the prior truncation radius of the geometrically thin disc. According to our estimates, the mass of about $\sim 4-3000\, M_\odot$ can be involved in the giant flare lasting 1 to 400 years if the flare is triggered somewhere between $60$ and $600$ gravitational radii from the SMBH of $10^7\, M_\odot$. The accretion rate on the SMBH peaks about 10 times faster at the potentially super-Eddington level. An optically thick outflow leads to anisotropy of the emission. At the beginning of the giant flare, the region near the truncation radius is heated to $\sim 10^5\,$K, and its UV/optical luminosity is at least $\sim 0.3-4 \,L_\mathrm{Edd}$ depending on the SMBH mass. The sudden heating of a cold disc around a SMBH can trigger a massive outburst, similar in appearance to what is proposed to occur after a tidal disruption event.</description>

      <title>On the distance to the black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the existing distance estimates to the black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613, present new radio and near-UV spectra to update the distance constraints, and discuss the accuracies and caveats of the associated methodologies. We use line-of-sight HI absorption spectra captured using the MeerKAT radio telescope to estimate a maximum radial velocity with respect to the local standard of rest of $24.8 \pm 2.8 \, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ for Swift J1727.8$-$1613, which is significantly lower than that of a nearby extragalactic reference source. From this we derive a near kinematic distance of $d_{\rm near} = 3.6 \pm 0.3 \, ({stat}) \pm 2.3 \, ({sys}) \, {\rm kpc}$ as a lower bound after accounting for additional uncertainties given its Galactic longitude and latitude, $(l, b) \approx (8.6^{\circ}, 10.3^{\circ})$. Near-UV spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph allows us to constrain the line-of-sight colour excess to $E(B\!-\!V) = 0.37 \pm 0.01 \, ({stat}) \pm 0.025 \, ({sys})$. We then implement this in Monte Carlo simulations and present a distance to Swift J1727.8$-$1613 of $5.5^{+1.4}_{-1.1} \, {\rm kpc}$, under the assumption that the donor star is an unevolved, main sequence K3-5V star. This distance implies a natal kick velocity of $190 \pm 30 \, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ and therefore an asymmetrical supernova explosion within the Galactic disk as the expected birth mechanism. A lower distance is implied if the donor star has instead lost significant mass during the binary evolution. Hence, more accurate measurements of the binary inclination angle or donor star rotational broadening from future observations would help to better constrain the distance.</description>

      <title>Spectral-timing analysis of the kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations and constraints on the mass of the neutron star in 4U 1636-536 using AstroSat observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) are believed to originate from the orbital timescales of the inner accretion flow, reflecting the dynamics of the innermost disk regions under strong gravitational forces. Despite numerous radiative and geometric models proposed so far, a comprehensive explanation of the observed properties of these variability components remains elusive. This study systematically examines kHz QPOs, their variability, and their connection to spectral properties in $4U 1636-536$ using AstroSat data. Our analysis tracks the source transition from hard to soft states in the hardness-intensity diagram. Broad spectral analysis (0.7-25 keV) using SXT and LAXPC data indicates a spectrum shaped by reflection from a thermal corona, with contributions from boundary layer emission and a soft disk component. We find significant changes in optical depth, blackbody temperature, and inner disk temperature that likely drive state transitions. Power density spectra reveal three variability types: a low frequency QPO (LFQPOs) (~30 Hz), and two simultaneous kHz QPOs. The LFQPOs and the upper kHz QPOs appear more prominently in soft spectral states. The presence of LFQPOs and twin kHz QPOs in soft spectral states enable us to estimate the neutron star mass at (2.37 $\pm$ 0.02) $M_\odot$ using the relativistic precession model (RPM). Additionally, time-lag and root mean square (rms) analysis provide insights into the size of the corona and the radiative origin of these variability components.</description>

Abstract: We present microsecond-resolution, coherently-dedispersed, polarimetric measurements of 35 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected during the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) incoherent sum (ICS) survey with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We find a wide diversity of time-frequency morphology and polarisation properties broadly consistent with those of currently known non-repeating FRBs. The high S/N and fine time-resolution of our data however reveals a wealth of new information. Key results include (i) the distribution of scattering timescales, ${\tau}_{obs}$, is limited purely by instrumental effects, with no downturn at high ${\tau}_{obs}$ as expected from a log-normal distribution; (ii) for the 29 FRBs with known redshift, there is no detectable correlation between $\tau_{obs}$ and dispersion measure (DM) fluctuations about the Macquart relation, in contrast to expectations from pulsar scattering-DM relations; (iii) all FRBs probably have multiple components, and at least a large fraction have variable PA, the identification of which is limited by scattering; (iv) at least half of all FRBs exhibit PA microstructure at 200 ${\mu}s$-200 ns timescales, with behaviour most closely resembling a sub-category of Crab main pulses; (v) that there is a break in the FRB circular polarisation distribution at Stokes V $\gtrsim$ 20%, which is suggestive of a discrete sub-population.</description>

      <title>Occurrence of fast neutrino flavor conversions in QCD phase-transition supernovae</title>

Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae undergoing a first-order quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition experience the collapse of the central proto-neutron star that leads to a second bounce. This event is accompanied by the release of a second neutrino burst. Unlike the first stellar core bounce neutrino burst which consists exclusively of electron neutrinos, the second burst is dominated by electron antineutrinos. Such a condition makes QCD supernovae an ideal site for the occurrence of fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC), which can lead to rapid flavor equilibration and significantly impact the related neutrino signal. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of the conditions for fast flavor instability (FFI) around and after the second neutrino burst in QCD phase transition supernova models launched from 25~$M_\odot$ and 40~$M_\odot$ progenitor models. We evaluate the relevant instability criteria and find two major phases of FFC. The first phase is closely associated with the collapse and the rapidly expanding shock wave, which is a direct consequence of the proto-neutron star collapse due to the phase transition. The second phase takes place a few milliseconds later when electron degeneracy is restored near the proto-neutron star surface. We also characterize the growth rate of FFI and estimate its impact on the evolution of the neutrino flavor content. The potential observational consequences on neutrino signals are evaluated by comparing a scenario assuming complete flavor equipartition with other scenarios without FFC. Finally, we investigate how FFC may influences $r$-process nucleosynthesis associated with QCD phase transition driven supernova explosions.</description>

Abstract: Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are one of the most common subclasses of thermonuclear supernova and yet their sample size, particularly those observed shortly after explosion, remains relatively small. In this paper we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of two SNe Iax discovered shortly after explosion, SN 2024bfu and SN 2025qe. Both SNe were observed by multiple all-sky surveys, enabling tight constraints on the moment of first light and the shape of the early light curve. Our observations of SN 2025qe begin &lt;2d after the estimated time of first light and represent some of the earliest observations of any SN Iax. Spectra show features consistent with carbon absorption throughout the evolution of SN 2025qe, potentially indicating the presence of unburned material throughout the ejecta. We gather a sample of SNe Iax observed by ATLAS, GOTO, and ZTF shortly after explosion and measure their rise times and early light curve power-law rise indices. We compare our results to a sample of normal SNe Ia and find indications that SNe Iax show systematically shorter rise times, consistent with previous work. We also find some indication that SNe Iax show systematically lower rise indices than normal SNe Ia. The low rise indices observed among SNe Iax are qualitatively consistent with extended $^{56}$Ni distributions and more thoroughly-mixed ejecta compared to normal SNe Ia, similar to predictions from pure deflagration explosions.</description>

      <title>Advanced techniques of searching for flares of ultra-high-energy photons from point sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical flares are one of the possible prominent source classes of ultra-high-energy (UHE, $E &gt; 10^{17}$ eV) cosmic rays, which can be detected by recording clusters of extensive air showers in arrays of detectors. The search for sources of neutral particles offers distinct advantages over searching for sources of charged particles, as the former traverse cosmic distances undeflected by magnetic fields. While no cosmic-ray photons exceeding $10^{17}$ eV have been definitively detected, identifying the clustering of events in cosmic-ray data would provide compelling evidence for their existence. We compare two analysis methods for detecting direction-time clustering in UHE extensive air showers: an approach in which one examines multiplets, and the stacking method, in which one analyzes sets of doublets that are not necessarily consecutive, thus making it sensitive to multiple flares. Both techniques combine time-clustering algorithms with unbinned likelihood study. Background events (initiated by hadrons) can be more efficiently distinguished from photon-induced events (signals) by using a photon tag that employs probability distribution functions to classify each event as more likely to be initiated by either a photon or a hadron. We demonstrate that these methods can effectively distinguish between events initiated by photons and those initiated by hadrons (background), and can accurately reproduce both the number of photon events within flares and their duration. We calculate the discovery potentials, i.e., the number of events required to identify a photon flare. The methods discussed can be used to search for cosmic ray sources and/or improve limits on the fluxes of UHE photons.</description>

      <title>VegasAfterglow: A High-Performance Framework for Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows</title>

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous astrophysical transients, known to be associated with core collapse of massive stars or mergers of two compact objects such as two neutron stars. They are followed by multi-wavelength afterglow emission originating from the deceleration of the relativistic jets by the ambient medium. The study of afterglow emission offers crucial insights into the physics of relativistic shocks, the properties of the circumburst environment, the physical and geometrical structure of relativistic jets, as well as the viewing geometry of the observer. We present {\tt VegasAfterglow}, a newly developed, high-performance C++ framework designed for modeling GRB afterglows with flexibility and computational efficiency as key features of design. The framework self-consistently solves forward and reverse shock dynamics and calculates synchrotron (including self-absorption or all spectral regimes) and inverse Compton radiation (including Klein-Nishina corrections); it can handle arbitrary user-defined ambient density profiles, central engine activity histories, viewing angles, and the jet structures of energy, Lorentz factor, and magnetization profiles. It supports both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes and includes lateral jet spreading effects. In this paper, we describe the numerical implementation of the framework and assess its computational performance. Our results demonstrate that {\tt VegasAfterglow} is well-suited for interpreting current and future multi-wavelength observations in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Triggered Type Ia Supernovae I: Impact on Explosion Dynamics and Light Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window are compelling dark matter candidates, made plausible by the existence of black holes and by the variety of mechanisms of their production in the early universe. If a PBH falls into a white dwarf (WD), the strong tidal forces can generate enough heat to trigger a thermonuclear runaway explosion, depending on the WD mass and the PBH orbital parameters. In this work, we investigate the WD explosion triggered by the passage of PBH. We perform 2D simulations of the WD undergoing thermonuclear explosion in this scenario, with the predicted ignition site as the parameter assuming the deflagration-detonation transition model. We study the explosion dynamics and predict the associated light curves and nucleosynthesis. We find that the model sequence predicts the light curves which align with the Phillip's relation ($B_{\max}$ vs. $\Delta M_{15}$). Our models hint at a unifying approach in triggering Type Ia supernovae without involving two distinctive evolutionary tracks.</description>

      <title>Possible detection of HFQPOs associated with 'unknown' variability class of GRS 1915+105</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectro-temporal analysis of GRS $1915+105$ observed with AstroSat during June, $2017$. A detailed study of the temporal properties reveals the appearance of an `unknown' variability class ($\tau$) during $\rho \rightarrow \kappa$ class transition of the source. This new `unknown' class ($\tau$) is characterized by the irregular repetition of low count `dips' along with the adjacent `flare' like features in between two successive steady count rate durations, resulting in uniform `$C$' shaped distribution in the color-color diagram. A detailed comparative study of the variability properties between the $\tau$ class and other known variability classes of GRS $1915+105$ indicates it as a distinct variability class of the source. Further, we find evidence of the presence of possible HFQPO features at $\sim 71$ Hz with quality factor $\sim 13$, rms amplitude $\sim 4.69\%$, and significance $3\sigma$, respectively. In addition, a harmonic-like feature at $\sim 152$ Hz is also seen with quality factor $\sim 21$, rms amplitude $\sim 5.75\%$ and significance $\sim 4.7\sigma$. The energy-dependent power spectral study reveals that the fundamental HFQPO and its harmonic are present in $3-15$ keV and $3-6$ keV energy ranges, respectively. Moreover, the wide-band ($0.7-50$ keV) spectral modelling comprising of thermal Comptonization component indicates the presence of a cool ($kT_{\rm e}\sim 1.7$ keV) and optically thick (optical depth $\sim 14$) Comptonizing `corona', which seems to be responsible in regulating the HFQPO features in GRS $1915$+$105$. Finally, we find the bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$) to be about $42\% L_{\rm Edd}$ within $1-100$ keV, indicating the sub-Eddington accretion regime of the source.</description>

      <title>Supernova rates and luminosity functions from ASAS-SN II: 2014-2017 core-collapse supernovae and their subtypes</title>

Abstract: The volumetric rates and luminosity functions (LFs) of core-collapse supernovae (ccSN) and their subtypes are important for understanding the cosmic history of star formation and the buildup of ccSN products. To estimate these rates, we use data of nearby ccSNe discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) from 2014--2017, when all observations were made in the $V$-band. The sample is composed of 174 discovered or recovered events, with high spectroscopic completeness from followup observations. This allows us to obtain a statistically precise and systematically robust estimate of nearby rates for ccSNe and their subtypes. The volumetric rates are estimated by correcting the observed number of events for the survey completeness, which was estimated through injection recovery simulations using ccSN light curves. We find a total volumetric rate for ccSNe of $7.0^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \times 10^{-5} \ \textrm{yr}^{-1} \ \textrm{Mpc}^{-3} \ h^{3}_{70}$, at a median redshift of 0.0149, for absolute magnitudes at peak $M_{V,peak} \leq -14$ mag. This result is in agreement with previous local volumetric rates. We obtain volumetric rates for the different ccSN subtypes (II, IIn, IIb, Ib, Ic, Ibn, and Ic-BL), and find that the relative fractions of Type II, stripped-envelope, and interacting ccSNe are $63.2\%$, $32.3\%$, and $4.4\%$, respectively. We also estimate a volumetric rate for superluminous SNe of $1.5^{+4.4}_{-1.1} \ \textrm{yr}^{-1} \ \textrm{Gpc}^{-3} \ h^{3}_{70}$, corresponding to a fraction of $0.002\%$ of the total ccSN rate. We produce intrinsic $V$-band LFs of ccSNe and their subtypes, and show that ccSN rates steadily decline for increasing luminosities. We further investigate the specific ccSN rate as a function of their host galaxy stellar mass, and find that the rate decreases with increasing stellar mass, with significantly higher rates at lower mass galaxies.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic rays reaching the atmosphere of an astrophysical object produce showers of secondary particles that may then scape into space. Here we obtain the flux of gammas and neutrinos of energy $E&gt;10$ GeV emited by the Sun, Jupiter and Earth. We show that, while the solar magnetic field induces an albedo flux of gammas from all the points in the Sun's surface, the dipolar magnetic field in the planets implies gammas only from the very peripheral region. Neutrinos, in contrast, can cross these objects and emerge from any point in their surface. The emission from these astrophysical objects is above the diffuse flux from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium and has a distinct spectrum and gamma to neutrino ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are various surveys that will provide excellent data to search for and localize Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The BINGO project will be one such survey, and this collaboration has already estimated a FRB detection rate that the project will yield. We present a forecast of the future constraints on our current cosmological model that the BINGO FRB detections and localizations will have when added to other current cosmological datasets. We quantify the dispersion measure (DM) as a function of redshift ($z$) for the BINGO FRB mock sample. Furthermore, we use current datasets (Supernovae, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Microwave Background data) prior to assessing the efficacy of constraining dark energy models using Monte Carlo methods. Our results show that spatially localized BINGO FRB dataset will provide promising constraints on the population of host galaxies intrinsic DM and be able to measure the nuisance parameters present within a FRB cosmological analysis. They will also provide alternative estimates on other parameters such as the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation of state. In particular, we should see that BINGO FRB data can put constraints on the degenerate $w-H_0$ plane, which the CMB is incapable of measuring, allowing FRBs to be a viable alternative to BAO to constrain the dark energy equation of state. We conclude that FRBs remain a promising future probe for cosmology and that the FRBs localized by the BINGO project will contribute significantly to our knowledge of the current cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Superradiant dark matter production from primordial black holes: Impact of multiple modes and gravitational wave emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe can emit particles through superradiance, a process particularly efficient when the particle's Compton wavelength is comparable to the PBH's gravitational radius. Superradiance leads to an exponential growth of particle occupation numbers in gravitationally bound states. We present an analysis of heavy bosonic dark matter (DM) production through three gravitational mechanisms: Hawking radiation, superradiant instabilities, and ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in. We consider PBHs that evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For both scalar and vector DM, our analysis incorporates the evolution of a second superradiant mode. We demonstrate that the growth of a second superradiant mode causes the decay of the first mode, and thus the second mode cannot further enhance the DM abundance beyond that already achieved by the first mode. Our study also reveals that while superradiance generally enhances DM production, gravitational wave (GW) emission from the superradiant cloud may significantly modify this picture. For scalar DM, GW emission reduces the parameter space where superradiance effectively augments relic abundance. For vector DM, rapid GW emission from the superradiant cloud may yield relic abundances below those achieved through Hawking radiation alone. These findings demonstrate that multiple-mode effect and GW emission play critical roles in modeling DM production from PBHs in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Betelgeuse's Buddy: X-Ray Constraints on the Nature of $\alpha$ Ori B</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\sim$$2100$d Long Secondary Period of Betelgeuse's optical lightcurve and radial velocity motivated the prediction of a low-mass stellar companion, expected to be at maximal apparent separation from Betelgeuse around December 2024. We carried out Director's Discretionary Time observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory to identify any X-ray emission from the companion and constrain its nature as either a compact object or young stellar object (YSO). Past X-ray observations occurred at the wrong phase of the companion's orbit for optimal detection prospects and/or lacked the deep exposure required to constrain the typical X-ray luminosities of YSOs. In our 41.85 ks exposure with Chandra, we do not detect an X-ray source at the position of Betelgeuse. For an estimated hydrogen column density $N_H$$=$$6\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, we place a limit on the X-ray luminosity of $L_X$$\lesssim$$2\times10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\lesssim$$4.7\times10^{-4}L_\odot$) in $0.5$$-$$8$ keV for a 10 MK plasma temperature spectral model, or $L_X$$\lesssim$$5\times10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\lesssim$$1.2\times10^{-4}L_\odot$) for an absorbed power law with photon index $\Gamma$$=$$2$. These limits robustly exclude an accreting compact object (white dwarf or neutron star) as the companion. Solar mass YSOs with an age similar to Betelgeuse ($\sim$10 Myr) display a range of X-ray luminosities ($10^{28-32}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and we can place upper bounds within this range for most absorbing columns. Based on these considerations, we conclude that the companion to Betelgeuse is likely a low-mass YSO.</description>

      <title>Rapid binary mass transfer: Circumbinary outflows and angular momentum losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High rates of stable mass transfer likely occur for some binary star systems, but the resulting flow of mass and angular momentum (AM) is unclear. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a polytropic donor star and a point mass secondary to determine the mass, AM, and velocity of gas that escapes the system, and the dependence on binary parameters such as mass ratio. The simulations use an adiabatic equation of state and do not include any radiative cooling or irradiation of the outflow. Mass transfer is initiated by injecting heat into the stellar envelope, causing it to gradually inflate and overflow its Roche lobe. The transferred mass flows into an accretion disk, but soon begins to escape through the outer Lagrange point (L2), with a lesser amount escaping through the L3 point. This creates an equatorially concentrated circumbinary outflow with an opening angle of 10 to 30 degrees with a wind-like density profile $\rho \propto r^{-2}$. We find that the ratios of the specific AM of the outflowing gas over that of the L2 point are approximately {0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.65} for binary mass ratios $q$ (accretor/donor) of {0.25, 0.5, 1, 2}. The asymptotic radial velocity of the outflowing gas, in units of the binary orbital velocity, is approximately 0.1 to 0.2 for the same mass ratios, except for $q=0.25$ where it might be higher. This outflow, if ultimately unbound from the binary, may be a source of circumstellar material that will interact with ejecta from a subsequent supernova or stellar merger.</description>

      <title>GW231123 Mass Gap Event and the Primordial Black Hole Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that the recently reported GW231123 event, with component masses $M_1=137^{+22}_{-17}\,M_\odot$, $M_2=103^{+20}_{-52}\,M_\odot$ and a local merger rate $R_{\mathrm{local}}=0.08^{+0.19}_{-0.07}\,\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$, originates from primordial black holes (PBHs) formed during an early matter-dominated era. We compute the PBH mass function, abundance, spin distribution and the merger rate density and find a set of choices for the parameters to reproduce the key properties of GW231123. While PBHs formed in such a scenario can acquire large spins through sustained tidal torques, the spin distribution remains uncertain and additional accretion might lead to extreme spin values inferred in GW231123. We also show that the resulting PBH abundance, $f_{\mathrm{pbh}}=1.64^{+5.00}_{-1.59}\times10^{-1}$, lies close to the exclusion bounds from CMB accretion limits and other probes, highlighting a potential tension with current constraints. Finally, we estimate the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) that are inevitably generated during PBH formation. PBHs that interpret GW231123 are accompanied by negligible SIGWs in the nano-hertz band, indicating no conflict with current pulsar timing arrays data.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of SN 2024ggi I: Interpretation and Model Comparison of the Type II Supernova 2024ggi at 55 days Past Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present panchromatic 0.4-21 microns observations of the nearby (about 7.2 Mpc) Type II supernova 2024ggi, obtained during the plateau phase at about 55 d past explosion. Our dataset includes JWST spectra spanning 1.7-14 microns, MIR imaging at 7.7 and 21 microns, and near-simultaneous ground-based optical and NIR spectra covering 0.32-1.8 microns. The NIR and MIR spectral features of SN 2024ggi are dominated by HI emission. We present line IDs and a toy PHOENIX/1D model that reproduces the observations well, especially the continuum redward of 0.9 microns We compare SN 2024ggi to SN 2022acko and SN 2023ixf, two other Type II supernovae that were also observed by JWST, and highlight key similarities and differences in their spectral features. No evidence for a MIR excess or dust is found at these epochs, with the model matching the observed flux out to 21 microns. We discuss the model's shortcomings, focusing on the density profile, which suppresses line blanketing and produces features in the optical that are too narrow. Our results show the power of panchromatic studies in both exploring the nature of the SN ejecta and constraining detailed models of SNe.</description>

      <title>High Energy Particle Production from Proton Synchrotron Radiation in Strong Magnetic Fields in Relativistic Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate photon, pion, and rho-meson production from proton synchrotron radiation in the presence of strong magnetic fields. The proton decay widths and the luminosities of the emitted particles are calculated within a relativistic quantum framework that incorporates Landau quantization. A scaling rule is derived for the transition probability between different Landau levels. This allows an evaluation of transitions for extremely high Landau numbers exceeding $10^{15}$. Furthermore, we calculate the momentum distribution of the emitted particles by properly including the proton recoil effect associated with particle emission. The results differ significantly from conventional semiclassical approaches.</description>
