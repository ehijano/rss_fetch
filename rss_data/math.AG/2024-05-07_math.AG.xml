      <title>Tamanoi equation for orbifold Euler characteristics: revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tamanoi equation is a Macdonald type equation for the orbifold Euler characteristic and for its analogues of higher orders. It claims that the generating series of the orbifold Euler characteristics of a fixed order of analogues of the symmetric powers for a space with a finite group action can be represented as a certain unified (explicitly written) power series in the exponent equal to the orbifold Euler characteristic of the same order of the space itself. In the paper, in particular, we explain how the Tamanoi equation follows from its verification for actions of (finite) groups on the one-point space. Statements used for that are generalized to analogues of the orbifold Euler characteristic corresponding to finitely generated groups. It is shown that, for these generalizatins, the analogue of the Tamanoi equation does not hold in general.</description>

      <title>Purity for Perfectoidness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a long-standing question about whether being perfectoid for an algebra is local in the analytic topology. We provide affirmative answers for the algebras (e.g., over $\overline{\mathbb{Z}_p}$) whose spectra are inverse limits of semi-stable affine schemes. In fact, we established a valuative criterion for such an algebra being perfectoid, saying that it suffices to check the perfectoidness of the stalks of the associated Riemann-Zariski space. Combining with Gabber-Ramero's computation of differentials of valuation rings, we obtain a differential criterion for perfectoidness. We also establish a purity result for perfectoidness when the limit preserves generic points of the special fibres.
  As an application to limits of smooth $p$-adic varieties (on the generic point), assuming either the poly-stable modification conjecture or working only with curves, we prove that stalk-wise perfectoidness implies vanishing of the higher completed \'etale cohomology groups of the smooth varieties, which is inspired by Scholze's vanishing for Shimura varieties. Moreover, we give an explicit description of the completed \'etale cohomology group in the top degree in terms of the colimit of Zariski cohomology groups of the structural sheaves.</description>

      <title>Quadratic varieties of small codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X \subset \mathbb P^{n+c}$ be a nondegenerate smooth projective variety of dimension $n$ defined by quadratic equations. For such varieties, P. Ionescu and F. Russo proved the Hartshorne conjecture on complete intersections, which states that X is a complete intersection provided that $n\geq 2c+1$. As the extremal case, they also classified $X$ with $n=2c$. In this paper, we classify $X$ with $n=2c-1$.</description>

      <title>Nef cones of some Quot Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve over $\mathbb C$ of genus $g(C)\geqslant 3$ (respectively, $g(C)=2$). Fix integers $r,k$ such that $2\leqslant k\leqslant r-2$, (respectively, $3\leqslant k\leqslant r-2$). Let $\mathcal Q:=\mathcal Q_{C/ \mathbb C}(\mathcal O^{\oplus r}_C, k, d)$ be the Quot scheme parametrizing rank $k$ and degree $d$ quotients of the trivial bundle of rank $r$. Let $\mathcal Q_L$ denote the closed subscheme of the Quot scheme parametrizing quotients such that the quotient sheaf has determinant $L$. It is known that $\mathcal Q_L$ is an integral, normal, local complete intersection, locally factorial scheme of Picard rank 2, when $d\gg0$. In this article we compute the nef cone and canonical divisor of this variety when $d\gg0$. We show this variety is Fano iff $r=2k+1$.</description>

      <title>Tropicalization of linear series and tilings by polymatroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that tropicalization of linear series on curves gives rise to two-parameter families of tilings by polymatroids, with one parameter arising from the theory of divisors on tropical curves and the other from the reduction of linear series of rational functions in non-Archimedean geometry. In order to do this, we introduce a general framework that produces tilings of vector spaces and their subsets by polymatroids. We furthermore show that these tilings are regular and relate them to work by Kapranov and Lafforgue on Chow quotients of Grassmannians.</description>

      <title>Triangulated characterizations of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a range of triangulated characterizations for important classes of singularities such as derived splinters, rational singularities, and Du Bois singularities. We measure singularity types by the potential for a pair of objects to finitely build one another in the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves utilizing a combination of cones, shifts, or finite coproducts. An invariant called 'level' in a triangulated category can be used to measure the failure of a variety to have a prescribed singularity type. We provide explicit computations of this invariant for reduced Nagata schemes of Krull dimension one and for affine cones over smooth projective hypersurfaces. Furthermore, these computations are utilized to produce upper bounds for Rouquier dimension on the respective bounded derived categories.</description>

      <title>On the classification of product-quotient surfaces with $q=0$, $p_g=3$ and their canonical map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present new results to produce an algorithm that returns, for any fixed pair of natural integers $K^2$ and $\chi$, all regular surfaces $S$ of general type with self-intersection $K_S^2=K^2$ and Euler characteristic $\chi(\mathcal O_S)=\chi$, that are product-quotient surfaces. The key result we obtain is an algebraic characterization of all families of regular product-quotients surfaces, up to isomorphism, arising from a pair of $G$-coverings of $\mathbb P^1$. As a consequence of our work, we provide a classification of all regular product-quotient surfaces of general type with $23\leq K^2\leq 32$ and $\chi(\mathcal O_S)=4$. Furthermore, we study their canonical map and present several new examples of surfaces of general type with a high degree of the canonical map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distribution of the Hodge spectral exponents of an irreducible plane curve by comparing it with a continuous distribution. We provide a closed formula for this difference in terms of numerical invariants of the curve. We characterize those families of irreducible plane curves whose limit distribution of Hodge spectral exponents is the continuous distribution and we provide intervals of dominating values.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Dualities of Type II Little String Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the symmetry structure of Type II Little String Theories and their T-dualities. We construct these theories both from the bottom-up perspective starting with seed Superconformal Field Theories, and from the top-down using F-/M-theory. By exploiting anomaly inflow and unitarity of the LST worldsheet theory, we derive strong conditions on the possible 6D bulk theories and their flavor algebras. These constraints continue to apply if gravity is coupled to the theory. We also study the higher form symmetry structure of these theories and show how they get exchanged under T-duality. Finally, we comment on seemingly consistent bottom-up Little String Theories that cannot be constructed from the top-down approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an asymptotic formula for the Euler characteristic of Kontsevich's commutative graph complex. This formula implies that the total amount of commutative graph homology grows super-exponentially with the rank and, via a theorem of Chan, Galatius, and Payne, that the dimension of the top weight cohomology of the moduli space of curves, $\mathcal M_g$, grows super-exponentially with the genus $g$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit algebraic description, based on prismatic cohomology, of the algebraic K-groups of rings of the form $O_K/I$ where $K$ is a p-adic field and $I$ is a non-trivial ideal in the ring of integers $O_K$; this class includes the rings $\mathbf{Z}/p^n$ where $p$ is a prime.
  The algebraic description allows us to describe a practical algorithm to compute individual K-groups as well as to obtain several theoretical results: the vanishing of the even K-groups in high degrees, the determination of the orders of the odd K-groups in high degrees, and the degree of nilpotence of $v_1$ acting on the mod $p$ syntomic cohomology of $\mathbf{Z}/p^n$.</description>

      <title>A transversality theorem for semi-algebraic sets with application to signal recovery from the second moment and cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-algebraic priors are ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning. Prevalent examples include a) linear models where the signal lies in a low-dimensional subspace; b) sparse models where the signal can be represented by only a few coefficients under a suitable basis; and c) a large family of neural network generative models. In this paper, we prove a transversality theorem for semi-algebraic sets in orthogonal or unitary representations of groups: with a suitable dimension bound, a generic translate of any semi-algebraic set is transverse to the orbits of the group action. This, in turn, implies that if a signal lies in a low-dimensional semi-algebraic set, then it can be recovered uniquely from measurements that separate orbits.
  As an application, we consider the implications of the transversality theorem to the problem of recovering signals that are translated by random group actions from their second moment. As a special case, we discuss cryo-EM: a leading technology to constitute the spatial structure of biological molecules, which serves as our prime motivation. In particular, we derive explicit bounds for recovering a molecular structure from the second moment under a semi-algebraic prior and deduce information-theoretic implications. We also obtain information-theoretic bounds for three additional applications: factoring Gram matrices, multi-reference alignment, and phase retrieval. Finally, we deduce bounds for designing permutation invariant separators in machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the characteristic-$p$ fibers of $\mathsf{GU}(q-2,2)$ Shimura varieties, which classify abelian varieties with additional structure. These Shimura varieties admit two stratifications of interest: the Ekedahl-Oort stratification, based on the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion subgroup scheme, and the Newton stratification, based on the isogeny class of the $p$-divisible group. It is natural to ask which Ekedahl-Oort strata intersect the unique closed Newton stratum, called the \emph{supersingular locus}. In this paper, we present several novel techniques that give information about the interaction between the two stratifications for general signature $(q-2,2)$, and as an application, we completely answer this question for the signature $(3,2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.04590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the number of connected components of a smooth hypersurface in the positive orthant of $\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by a real polynomial with $d + k + 1$ monomials, where $d$ is the dimension of the affine span of the exponent vectors, is smaller than or equal to $8(d+1)^{k-1} 2^{k-1 \choose 2}$, improving the previously known bounds. We refine this bound for $k = 2$ by showing that a smooth hypersurface defined by a real polynomial with $d+3$ monomials in $n$ variables has at most $\lfloor(d-1)/2\rfloor + 3$ connected components in the positive orthant of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We present an explicit polynomial in $2$ variables with $5$ monomials which defines a curve with three connected components in the positive orthant, showing that our bound is sharp for $d = 2$ (and any $n$). Our results hold for polynomials with real exponent vectors.</description>

      <title>Fourier transforms of irregular holonomic D-modules, singularities at infinity of meromorphic functions and irregular characteristic cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04113v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the recent developments in the irregular Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for holonomic D-modules and the Fourier-Sato transforms for enhanced ind-sheaves, we study the Fourier transforms of some irregular holonomic D-modules. For this purpose, the singularities of rational and meromorphic functions on complex affine varieties will be studied precisely, with the help of some new methods and tools such as meromorphic vanishing cycle functors. As a consequence, we show that the exponential factors and the irregularities of the Fourier transform of a holonomic D-module are described geometrically by the stationary phase method, as in the classical case of dimension one. A new feature in the higher-dimensional case is that we have some extra rank jump of the Fourier transform produced by the singularities of the linear perturbations of the exponential factors at their points of indeterminacy. In the course of our study, not necessarily homogeneous Lagrangian cycles that we call irregular characteristic cycles will play a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Log canonical pairs with conjecturally minimal volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct log canonical pairs $(X,B)$ with $B$ a nonzero reduced divisor and $K_X+B$ ample that have the smallest known volume. We conjecture that our examples have the smallest volume in each dimension. The conjecture is true in dimension 2, by Liu and Shokurov. The examples are weighted projective hypersurfaces that are not quasi-smooth.
  We also develop an example for a related extremal problem. Esser constructed a klt Calabi-Yau variety which conjecturally has the smallest mld in each dimension (for example, mld $1/13$ in dimension 2 and $1/311$ in dimension 3). However, the example was only worked out completely in dimensions at most 18. We now prove the desired properties of Esser's example in all dimensions (in particular, determining its mld).</description>

Abstract: We give necessary conditions for a category fibred in pseudo-abelian additive categories over the classifying topos of a profinite group to be a stack; these conditions are sufficient when the coefficients are $\mathbf{Q}$-linear. This applies to pure motives over a field in the sense of Grothendieck, Deligne-Milne and Andr\'e, to mixed motives in the sense of Nori and to several motivic categories considered in arXiv:1506.08386 [math.AG]. We also give a simple proof of the exactness of a sequence of motivic Galois groups under a Galois extension of the base field, which applies to all the above (Tannakian) situations. Finally, we clarify the construction of the categories of Chow-Lefschetz motives given in arXiv:2302.08327 [math.AG] and simplify the computation of their motivic Galois group in the numerical case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12092v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any number of general fat points of any multiplicities impose the expected number of conditions on a linear system on a smooth projective surface, in several cases including primitive linear systems on very general K3 and abelian surfaces, `Du Val' linear systems on blowups of ${\mathbb P}^2$ at $9$ very general points, and certain linear systems on some ruled surfaces over elliptic curves. This is done by answering a question of the author about the case of only one fat point on a certain ruled surface, which follows from a circle of results due to Treibich--Verdier, Segal--Wilson, and others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work exhibits that the essential image of the derived pushforward along a proper surjective morphism of Noetherian schemes generates the targets derived category of bounded complexes with coherent cohomology. There are two primary consequences to our work. First, we show that classical generators in the bounded derived category are preserved by derived pushforward along a proper surjective morphism of Noetherian schemes. Secondly, the bounded derived category coincides with the thick subcategory generated by perfect complexes and structure sheaves of closed integral subschemes supported in the singular locus of the ambient scheme.</description>

      <title>Milnor fibrations of arrangements with trivial algebraic monodromy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Each complex hyperplane arrangement gives rise to a Milnor fibration of its complement. Although the Betti numbers of the Milnor fiber $F$ can be expressed in terms of the jump loci for rank 1 local systems on the complement, explicit formulas are still lacking in full generality, even for $b_1(F)$. We study here the "generic" case (in which $b_1(F)$ is as small as possible), and look deeper into the algebraic topology of such Milnor fibrations with trivial algebraic monodromy. Our main focus is on the cohomology jump loci and the lower central series quotients of $\pi_1(F)$. In the process, we produce a pair of arrangements for which the respective Milnor fibers have the same Betti numbers, yet non-isomorphic fundamental groups: the difference is picked by the higher-depth characteristic varieties and by the Schur multipliers of the second nilpotent quotients.</description>

      <title>Weighted Ehrhart theory via mixed Hodge modules on toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a cohomological and geometrical interpretation for the weighted Ehrhart theory of a full-dimensional lattice polytope $P$, with Laurent polynomial weights of geometric origin. For this purpose, we calculate the motivic Chern and Hirzebruch characteristic classes of a mixed Hodge module complex $\mathcal{M}$ whose underlying cohomology sheaves are constant on the $\mathbb{T}$-orbits of the toric variety $X_P$ associated to $P$. Besides motivic coefficients, this also applies to the intersection cohomology Hodge module. We introduce a corresponding generalized Hodge $\chi_y$-polynomial of the ample divisor $D_P$ on $X_P$. Motivic properties of these characteristic classes are used to express this Hodge polynomial in terms of a very general weighed lattice point counting and the corresponding weighted Ehrhart theory. We introduce, for such a mixed Hodge modules complex $\mathcal{M}$ on $X$, an Ehrhart polynomial $E_{P,\mathcal{M}}$ generalizing the Hodge polynomial of $\mathcal{M}$ and satisfying a reciprocity formula and a purity formula fitting with the duality for mixed Hodge modules. This Ehrhart polynomial and its properties depend only on a Laurent polynomial weight function on the faces $Q$ of $P$. In the special case of the intersection cohomology mixed Hodge module, the weight function corresponds to Stanley's $g$-function of the polar polytope of $P$, hence it depends only on the combinatorics of $P$. In particular, we obtain a combinatorial formula for the intersection cohomology signature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\pi: X_r \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^2$ be a blow up of $\mathbb{P}^2$ at $r$ distinct points $p_1,p_2,\dots, p_r$. We study lower bounds for Seshadri constants of ample line bundles on $X_r$. First, we consider the case when $p_1,p_2,\dots, p_r$ are on a curve of degree $d\leq 3$. Then we assume that the points are very general and show that $\varepsilon(X_r,L,x)\geq 1$ for any ample line bundle $L$ and any $x\in X_r$ if the Strong SHGH conjecture is true. We explore the relation between bounded negativity and Seshadri constants and study the Seshadri function on $X_r$.</description>

      <title>The spectral genus of an isolated hypersurface singularity and a conjecture relating to the Milnor number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of spectral genus $\widetilde{p}_{g}$ of a deformation of a germ of an isolated hypersurface singularity $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1}, 0) \to (\mathbb{C}, 0)$, defined as a sum of small exponents of monodromy eigenvalues. The number of these is equal to the geometric genus $p_{g}$, and hence $\widetilde{p}_g$ can be considered as a secondary invariant to it. We then explore a secondary version of the Durfee conjecture on $p_{g}$, regarding the relationship between $\widetilde{p}_{g}$ and the Milnor number $\mu$, to the effect that $$\frac{\mu}{(n+2)!} &gt; \widetilde{p}_g.$$ We provide evidence by confirming the conjecture in several cases, including homogeneous singularities and singularities with large Newton polyhedra, and quasi-homogeneous or irreducible curve singularities.
  Our conjecture is shown to relate closely to the asymptotic behavior of the holomorphic analytic torsion of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on a degeneration of projective varieties, potentially indicating deeper geometric and analytic connections.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau Four/Five/Six-folds as $\mathbb{P}^n_\textbf{w}$ Hypersurfaces: Machine Learning, Approximation, and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calabi-Yau four-folds may be constructed as hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces of complex dimension 5 defined via weight systems of 6 weights. In this work, neural networks were implemented to learn the Calabi-Yau Hodge numbers from the weight systems, where gradient saliency and symbolic regression then inspired a truncation of the Landau-Ginzburg model formula for the Hodge numbers of any dimensional Calabi-Yau constructed in this way. The approximation always provides a tight lower bound, is shown to be dramatically quicker to compute (with compute times reduced by up to four orders of magnitude), and gives remarkably accurate results for systems with large weights. Additionally, complementary datasets of weight systems satisfying the necessary but insufficient conditions for transversality were constructed, including considerations of the interior point, reflexivity, and intradivisibility properties. Overall producing a classification of this weight system landscape, further confirmed with machine learning methods. Using the knowledge of this classification, and the properties of the presented approximation, a novel dataset of transverse weight systems consisting of 7 weights was generated for a sum of weights $\leq 200$; producing a new database of Calabi-Yau five-folds, with their respective topological properties computed. Further to this an equivalent database of candidate Calabi-Yau six-folds was generated with approximated Hodge numbers.</description>
