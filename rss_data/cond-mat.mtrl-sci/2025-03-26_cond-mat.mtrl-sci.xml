      <title>Machine Learning - Driven Materials Discovery: Unlocking Next-Generation Functional Materials - A minireview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven techniques is revolutionizing materials discovery, property prediction, and material design by minimizing human intervention and accelerating scientific progress. This review provides a comprehensive overview of smart, machine learning (ML)-driven approaches, emphasizing their role in predicting material properties, discovering novel compounds, and optimizing material structures. Key methodologies ranging from deep learning, graph neural networks, and Bayesian optimization to automated generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) enable the autonomous design of materials with tailored functionalities. By leveraging AutoML frameworks (e.g., AutoGluon, TPOT, and H2O.ai), researchers can automate the model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, significantly improving the efficiency of materials informatics. Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven robotic laboratories and high-throughput computing has established a fully automated pipeline for rapid synthesis and experimental validation, drastically reducing the time and cost of material discovery. This review highlights real-world applications of automated ML-driven approaches in predicting mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of materials, demonstrating successful cases in superconductors, catalysts, photovoltaics, and energy storage systems. We also address key challenges, such as data quality, interpretability, and the integration of AutoML with quantum computing, which are essential for future advancements. Ultimately, the synergy between AI, automated experimentation, and computational modeling transforms the way the materials are discovered, optimized, and designed, paving the way for next-generation innovations in energy, electronics, and nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>New Diamond Magnet CaCo2TeO6: Strong Quantum Fluctuations and Enhanced Competing Exchange Interactions Enabled by Octahedral Co2+ Ligand Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Understanding Colossal Magnetoresistance and Complex Resistivity Behaviors in Magnetic Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is commonly observed in magnetic semiconductors when an external magnetic field is applied, usually accompanied by anomalous resistivity peaks or humps which were previously considered as evidence of a metal-insulator transition (MIT). Previous research efforts primarily focused on elucidating the CMR effect in ferromagnetic semiconductor systems, which may be inapplicable to antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic systems. In our work, we propose a framework to unravel the mechanisms underlying the CMR related phenomenon in magnetic semiconductor, and apply it to the ferrimagnetic semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. A two-carrier model, with electron and hole carriers generated by thermal excitation across the magnetization-dependent band gap, is employed, which accurately reproduces the observed $\rho(B, T)$ curves. Additionally, the shift of $T_c$ (or the anomalous resistivity peak) with increasing direct currents, previously attributed to current control of the chiral orbital current (COC) state, is also reproduced within our framework by properly accounting for the Joule heating effects. Our work provides a quantitative methodology for analyzing and calculating the novel resistivity curves in magnetic semiconductors and clarifies the controversy surrounding the origins of CMR and the concomitant complex behaviors.</description>

      <title>Jahn-Teller Effect for Controlling Quantum Correlations in Hexanuclear Fe$^{3+}$ Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the low-temperature magnetic and quantum properties of hexanuclear Fe$^ {3+}_6$ complexes under an external magnetic field. We primarily study the impact of competing exchange interactions and their asymmetries induced by the Jahn-Teller distortion on the quantum properties of the complexes. The inequality in exchange interactions lifts the ground-state degeneracy that gives rise to complex quantum behavior. By constructing the ground-state phase diagram and analyzing magnetization, we identify key magnetic phases and critical phenomena. We further quantify quantum correlations using tripartite entanglement negativity and conditional von Neumann entropy to unveil how the Jahn-Teller effect enhances intra-triangle entanglement while modulating inter-triangle correlations. Our findings highlight the Fe$^{3+}_6$ complex as a promising molecular platform for tunable quantum correlations, with potential applications in quantum information processing and molecular qubits.</description>

      <title>A Recipe for Flat Bands in Pyrochlore Materials: A Chemist's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials in which atoms are arranged in a pyrochlore lattice have found renewed interest, as, at least theoretically, orbitals on those lattices can form flat bands. However, real materials often do not behave according to theoretical models, which is why there has been a dearth of pyrochlore materials exhibiting flat band physics. Here we examine the conditions under which ideal 'pyrochlore bands' can exist in real materials and how to have those close to the Fermi level. We find that the simple model used in the literature does not apply to the bands at the Fermi level in real pyrochlore materials. However, surprisingly, certain oxide compounds which have oxygen orbitals inside the pyrochlore tetrahedra do exhibit near-ideal pyrochlore bands near the Fermi level. We explain this observation by a generalized tight-binding model including the oxygen orbitals. We further classify all known pyrochlore materials based on their crystal structure, band structure, and chemical characteristics and propose materials to study in future experiments.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Defect Engineering for Advanced Thermoelectric Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials offer a promising pathway to directly convert waste heat to electricity. However, achieving high performance remains challenging due to intrinsic trade-offs between electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, which are further complicated by the presence of defects. This review explores how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming thermoelectric materials design. Advanced ML approaches including deep neural networks, graph-based models, and transformer architectures, integrated with high-throughput simulations and growing databases, effectively capture structure-property relationships in a complex multiscale defect space and overcome the curse of dimensionality. This review discusses AI-enhanced defect engineering strategies such as composition optimization, entropy and dislocation engineering, and grain boundary design, along with emerging inverse design techniques for generating materials with targeted properties. Finally, it outlines future opportunities in novel physics mechanisms and sustainability, highlighting the critical role of AI in accelerating the discovery of thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence and atomic-scale mechanisms of reduced dislocation mobility in an inorganic semiconductor under illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photo-plasticity in semiconductors, wherein their mechanical properties such as strength, hardness and ductility are influenced by light exposure, has been reported for several decades. Although such phenomena have drawn significant attention for the manufacturability and usage of deformable semiconductor devices, their underlying mechanisms are not well understood due to the lack of direct evidence. Here we provide experimental observation and atomic insights into the reduced mobility of dislocations in zinc sulfide, as a model material, under light. Using photo-nanoindentation and transmission electron microscopy, we observe that dislocations glide shorter distances under light than those in darkness and there are no apparent deformation twins in both conditions. By atomic-scale simulations, we demonstrate that the decreased dislocation mobility is attributed to the increased Peierls stress for dislocation motion and enhanced stress fields around dislocation cores due to photoexcitation. This study improves the understanding of photo-plastic effects in inorganic semiconductors, offering the opportunities for modulating their mechanical properties using light.</description>

      <title>Lithium-ion dynamics in synthetic quartz studied via the NMR of implanted $^{8}$Li$^{+}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report $\beta$-detected nuclear magnetic resonance ($\beta$-NMR) measurements of implanted $^{8}$Li$^{+}$ in a synthetic single crystal of $\alpha$-SiO$_2$ (quartz). At 6.55 Tesla, the spectrum is comprised of a large amplitude broad resonance and a quadrupolar multiplet that is only revealed by an RF comb excitation. The quadrupole splitting is surprisingly small, increases with temperature, and provides information on the implantation site. Supercell density functional theory calculations show that the small EFG is consistent with an in-channel interstitial site (Wyckoff 3$a$). The spin-lattice relaxation is unexpectedly fast and strongly temperature dependent with a diffusive peak above 200 K and a second more prominent relaxation peak at lower temperature. Analysis of the diffusive relaxation yields an activation barrier 178(43) meV for the isolated Li$^{+}$, in the range of other measurements and calculations. To account for many of the other features of the data, it is suggested that some of the implanted ions trap an electron forming the neutral Li$^{0}$, which is stable over a narrow range of temperatures.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Constrained Anomalous Transport in the Altermagnetic Material CuX$_2$ (X=F,Cl)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently discovered, altermagnetism represents a third class of collinear magnets. These materials exhibit zero net magnetization, similar to antiferromagnets, but display anomalous transport properties resembling those of ferromagnets. Altermagnetic materials manifest various anomalous electronic transport phenomena, including the anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Nernst effect, and anomalous thermal Hall effect. Additionally, they exhibit magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday effects, previously considered exclusive to ferromagnetic materials. These anomalous transport phenomena are constrained by symmetry, as revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, an effective model-based approach to verify these symmetry constraints remains unavailable. In this Letter, we construct a $k\cdot p$ model for $d$-wave altermagnets CuX$_2$ (X=F,Cl) using spin space group representations and apply it to calculate the anomalous Hall effect. The symmetry-imposed transport properties predicted by the model are in agreement with the DFT results, providing a foundation for further investigation into symmetry-restricted transport phenomena in altermagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Limited-angle x-ray nano-tomography with machine-learning enabled iterative reconstruction engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing challenge in tomography is the 'missing wedge' problem, which arises when the acquisition of projection images within a certain angular range is restricted due to geometrical constraints. This incomplete dataset results in significant artifacts and poor resolution in the reconstructed image. To tackle this challenge, we propose an approach dubbed Perception Fused Iterative Tomography Reconstruction Engine, which integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) with perceptional knowledge as a smart regularizer into an iterative solving engine. We employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers to optimize the solution in both physics and image domains, thereby achieving a physically coherent and visually enhanced result. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using various experimental datasets obtained with different x-ray microscopy techniques. All show significantly improved reconstruction even with a missing wedge of over 100 degrees - a scenario where conventional methods fail. Notably, it also improves the reconstruction in case of sparse projections, despite the network not being specifically trained for that. This demonstrates the robustness and generality of our method of addressing commonly occurring challenges in 3D x-ray imaging applications for real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-pressure mechanical-motion switching of ferroelectric polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching, achieved by mechanical forces, enables the storage of stress information in ferroelectrics, and holds promise for human-interfacing applications. The prevailing mechanical approach is locally induced flexoelectricity with large strain gradients. However, this approach usually requires huge mechanical pressures, which greatly impedes device applications. Here, we report an approach of using triboelectric effect to mechanically, reversibly switch ferroelectric polarization across {\alpha}-In2Se3 ferroelectric memristors. Through contact electrification and electrostatic induction effects, triboelectric units are used to sensitively detect mechanical forces and generate electrical voltage pulses to trigger {\alpha}-In2Se3 resistance switching. We realize multilevel resistance states under different mechanical forces, by which a neuromorphic stress system is demonstrated. Strikingly, we achieve the reversal of {\alpha}-In2Se3 ferroelectric polarization with a record-low mechanical pressure of ~ 10 kPa, and even with tactile touches. Our work provides a fundamental but pragmatic strategy for creating mechanical-tactile ferroelectric memory devices.</description>

      <title>Screening effect of a magnetically soft shell of single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possible manifestations of magnetic screening effects were theoretically investigated for a particle with a ferromagnetic single-domain core and a magnetically soft shell. The exact solution of the Laplace equation gave analytical formulas for the magnetic field created by the particle placed in a uniform external magnetic field. The system of non-interacting randomly oriented particles was investigated in the Langevin model. The effects of the shell on individual and thermodynamically averaged magnetic properties of the particles were described in a single way using the screening factor A. The screening effects are appeared in a decrease in: (i) the demagnetization factor of the particle core; (ii) the total dipole moment and, accordingly, the external magnetic field created by the particle; (iii) the effective magnetic moment in isothermal magnetization curves and in the Curie law. The magnetically soft shell of the particle also changes the behavior of the particle system in high magnetic fields: the magnetization does not reach saturation, and the differential magnetic susceptibility tends to a non-zero value.</description>

      <title>Rapid Vapor-Assisted Solution Process of Metal-Organic Chalcogenides for High-Performance Light-Emitting Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic chalcogenides (MOCs), robust crystalline assemblies composed of coinage metals, chalcogens and organic ligands, are typically synthesized via prolonged, high temperature tarnishing of vacuum-deposited metal films with organochalcogen precursors. The prolonged exposure to high temperatures and the necessity for direct vacuum deposition of silver can induce damage to the underlying films, posing significant challenges to the fabrication of optoelectronic devices, despite their cost-effectiveness and chemical robustness. This study introduces vapor-assisted solution processing, a novel chemical vapor deposition method, enabling remarkably rapid fabrication of luminescent MOC films. Furthermore, the first MOC-based light-emitting diodes (MOCLEDs) are realized, achieving an external quantum efficiency (EQE) approaching 0.1% and electroluminescence peaking at 633 nm. These results highlight the potential of MOCs as next-generation emitters for displays and solid-state lighting. This work offers a promising fabrication strategy and insights for advancing MOCLEDs and expanding their optoelectronic potential.</description>

      <title>Interplay of canted antiferromagnetism and nematic order in Mott insulating Sr2Ir1-xRhxO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sr2IrO4 is one of the prime candidates for realizing exotic quantum spin orders owing to the subtle combination of spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation. Sensitive local magnetization measurement can serve as a powerful tool to study these kinds of systems with multiple competing spin orders since the comprehensive study of the spatially-varying magnetic responses provide crucial information of their energetics. Here, using sensitive magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements and spin Hamiltonian model calculations, we show that Sr2IrO4 has non-trivial domain structures which cannot be understood by conventional antiferromagnetism. This unconventional magnetic response exhibits broken symmetry along the Ir-O-Ir bond direction and is enhanced upon spin-flip transition or Rh-doping. Our analysis, based on possible stacking patterns of spins, shows that introduction of an additional rotational-symmetry breaking is essential to describe the magnetic behavior of Sr2Ir1-xRhxO4, providing strong evidence for a nematic hidden order phase in this highly correlated spin-orbit Mott insulator.</description>

      <title>Advancing atom probe tomography capabilities to understand bone microstructures at the near-atomic scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bone structure is generally hierarchically organized into organic (collagen, proteins,...), inorganic (hydroxyapatite (HAP)) components. However, many fundamental mechanisms of the biomineralization processes such as HAP formation, the influence of trace elements, the mineral-collagen arrangement, etc., are not clearly understood. This is partly due to the analytical challenge of simultaneously characterizing the three-dimensional (3D) structure and chemical composition of biominerals in general at the nanometer scale, which can, in principle be achieved by atom probe tomography (APT). Yet, the hierarchical structures of bone represent a critical hurdle for APT analysis in terms of sample yield and analytical resolution, particularly for trace elements, and organic components from the collagen appear to systematically get lost from the analysis. Here, we applied in-situ metallic coating of APT specimens within the focused ion beam (FIB) used for preparing specimens, and demonstrate that the sample yield and chemical sensitivity are tremendously improved, allowing the analysis of individual collagen fibrils and trace elements such as Mg and Na. We explored a range of measurement parameters with and without coating, in terms of analytical resolution performance and determined the best practice parameters for analyzing bone samples in APT. To decipher the complex mass spectra of the bone specimens, reference spectra from pure HAP and collagen were acquired to unambiguously identify the signals, allowing us to analyze entire collagen fibrils and interfaces at the near-atomic scale. Our results open new possibilities for understanding the hierarchical structure and chemical heterogeneity of bone structures at the near-atomic level and demonstrate the potential of this new method to provide new, unexplored insights into biomineralization processes in the future.</description>

      <title>Dramatic reduction in thermal conductivity by high-density dislocations in SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decreasing thermal conductivity is important for designing efficient thermoelectric devices. Traditional engineering strategies have focused on point defects and interface design. Recently, dislocations as line defects have emerged as a new tool for regulating thermal conductivity. In ceramics-based thermoelectric materials, the key challenge lies in achieving sufficiently high-density dislocations to effectively scatter phonons, as the typical dislocation density in ceramics after bulk deformation is constrained to 10 to the power of 12 per square meter. In this work, we adopted the mechanical imprinting method and achieved a dislocation density of 10 to the power of 15 per square meter in single-crystal SrTiO3, which is known for its room-temperature plasticity and acts as a promising material for thermoelectric applications. Using the time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) method, we measured about a 50% reduction in thermal conductivity over a broad temperature range (80 to 400 K) with the engineered high-density dislocations. These results suggest that tuning dislocations could offer a new path to minimizing thermal conductivity for engineering thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Evidence of spin-phonon-charge coupling in quasi-one-dimensional Ising spin chain system $\alpha$-CoV$_2$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-one-dimensional Ising spin chain system $\alpha$-CoV$_2$O$_6$ is considered to exhibit fascinating magnetic properties at lower temperatures. We comprehensively study magnetic properties and lattice dynamics using a combination of x-ray diffraction (XRD), DC magnetization, specific heat, temperature-dependent XRD and Raman scattering measurements, along with the theoretical charge density map calculations. The DC magnetization and specific heat confirm the antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range order (LRO) at Neel temperature T$_N$ = 15 K as well as the short-range ordering (SRO) below 100 K. Temperature-dependent Raman measurement has been performed in the temperature range of 5 K to 180 K, revealing spin-phonon coupling (SPC) below 100 K, which is well above the T$_N$ and is attributed to SRO. The SPC is calculated for different vibrational modes. The temperature-dependent XRD supports the key finding of magnetoelastic coupling at T$_N$, which is strongly correlated to the magnetoelectric phenomena. The renormalization of Raman modes and lattice anomalies near T$_N$ illustrate spin-lattice coupling via magnetoelastic and spin-phonon interactions leading to the interplay between spin, charge, and phonon degrees of freedom in $\alpha$-CoV$_2$O$_6$. The presence of spin-charge coupling is confirmed by the theoretical charge density maps, which show that the formation of electric dipoles between the Co and O atoms in the AFM state results from the p-d hybridization.</description>

      <title>Observation of giant remnant polarization in ultrathin AlScN at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of wurtzite ferroelectrics opens new frontiers in polar materials, yet their behavior at cryogenic temperatures remains unexplored. Here, we reveal unprecedented ferroelectric properties in ultrathin (10 nm) Al$_{0.68}$Sc$_{0.32}$N (AlScN) at cryogenic temperatures where the properties are fundamentally distinct from those of conventional oxide ferroelectrics. At 12 K, we demonstrate a giant remnant polarization exceeding 250 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ -- more than twice that of any known ferroelectric -- driven by an enhanced c/a ratio in the wurtzite structure. Our devices sustain remarkably high electric fields (~13 MV/cm) while maintaining reliable switching, achieving over 104 polarization reversal cycles at 12 K. Critically, this breakdown field strength approaches that of passive dielectric materials while maintaining ferroelectric functionality. The extraordinary polarization enhancement and high-field stability at cryogenic temperatures contrasts sharply with oxide ferroelectrics, establishing wurtzite ferroelectrics as a distinct class of polar materials with implications spanning fundamental physics to cryogenic non-volatile memory and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>On Tailoring Structural and Optoelectronic Properties of TiO2 Thin Films Synthesized via 'Room' Temperature High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a wide-bandgap semiconductor that has gained increased attention as a cutting-edge material for application in the environmental, energy and biomedical fields. Here we employed High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) to synthesize TiO2 thin films at 'room' temperature (without additional substrate heating), and over a wide range of deposition parameters involving changes in the chamber pressure and relative abundance of oxygen during film growth. This allowed us to tune both the crystal quality and the anatase to rutile polymorph composition; thus tailoring structural, optical and electronic properties of the overall TiO2 thin films. Control over the properties of TiO2 films, as demonstrated here at low temperatures, without adjunct heating, is particularly important when employing temperature-sensitive substrates often encountered in next-generation applications and devices.</description>

      <title>Kernel Learning Assisted Synthesis Condition Exploration for Ternary Spinel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning and high-throughput experimentation have greatly accelerated the discovery of mixed metal oxide catalysts by leveraging their compositional flexibility. However, the lack of established synthesis routes for solid-state materials remains a significant challenge in inorganic chemistry. An interpretable machine learning model is therefore essential, as it provides insights into the key factors governing phase formation. Here, we focus on the formation of single-phase Fe$_2$(ZnCo)O$_4$, synthesized via a high-throughput co-precipitation method. We combined a kernel classification model with a novel application of global SHAP analysis to pinpoint the experimental features most critical to single phase synthesizability by interpreting the contributions of each feature. Global SHAP analysis reveals that precursor and precipitating agent contributions to single-phase spinel formation align closely with established crystal growth theories. These results not only underscore the importance of interpretable machine learning in refining synthesis protocols but also establish a framework for data-informed experimental design in inorganic synthesis.</description>

      <title>Low-Moment Semiconducting Properties of Quaternary Heusler Alloy CoRuTiSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate structural, magnetic and transport properties of CoRuTiSn equiatomic quaternary Heusler alloy. CoRuTiSn was synthesized by arc-melt technique. The room temperature powder XRD pattern was analyzed, and it was found that CoRuTiSn has a tetragonal crystal structure. Magnetic measurements show non-zero but small hysteresis indicating CoRuTiSn as a soft ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of ~200 K. The magnetic moment determined from magnetization data is found to be 0.84 {\mu}B/f.u. at 4 K, which is close to the value, calculated using first principles calculations. Electrical resistivity decreases with temperatures, indicating semiconducting nature of CoRuTiSn. Hall effect measurements show anomalous behavior, consistent with the ferromagnetic nature of the sample. The low moment ferromagnetic semiconducting nature of CoRuTiSn could make this material promising for semiconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Defects and Impurity Properties of VN precipitates in ARAFM Steels: Modelling using a Universal Machine Learning Potential and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VN precipitates used to strengthen ARAFM steels for fusion applications, have been shown to undergo dissolution under high Fe ion irradiation doses of 100 dpa at dose rates of 10^-3 dpa/s at 600 C. Here, point defects and solute substitutions have been studied using atom probe tomography (APT), universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs), and density functional theory. Through a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), APT, and atomic scale calculations, N-vacancies and substitutional Cr are found to be present in VN precipitates prior to irradiation. Ternary convex hulls were calculated for ten VNX (X=Cr, Fe, C, Si, Mn, W, Ta, B, S, P) systems with an uMLIP. These calculations predict Fe, P, Mn, and Si to be unstable solutes in the VN precipitate. Therefore, Fe, P, Mn and Si implantation via collision cascades is found to be a possible mechanism driving dissolution of VN.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Engineering for Controlled Phase Transitions in CrN(111) Epitaxial Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase transition in CrN epitaxial films is substantially suppressed by epitaxial constraint. Here, we propose that nitrogen (N) vacancies can be taken as a knob to regulate the phase transition of CrN(111) epitaxial films. To validate this concept, a series of CrN(111) films with controlled N concentrations (approximately from 0.0 to 5.0 at.%) were epitaxially grown on Al2O3(0001) substrates. Experimental characterization reveals that higher N vacancy concentrations significantly facilitate the out-of-plane contraction of the films at 273 K (0.8%), reaching up to 60% of the contraction magnitude of CrN powders (1.2%) without compromising the stability and reproducibility of the phase transition. Reducing N vacancy concentrations diminishes the lattice contraction, lowers the phase transition temperature to 193 K, and triggers a metallic to insulator transition in electrical behavior. First-principles calculations corroborate these findings, showing that N vacancies decrease the internal tensile stress within triangular Cr atomic layers, which enhances the out-of-plane contraction, elevates phase transition temperatures, and promotes bandgap closure. These results establish N vacancies as a critical factor governing phase transition dynamics in CrN systems and provide a practical strategy for successively engineering thermally responsive phase transitions in CrN films, advancing their potential for functional device applications.</description>

      <title>Grid-Free Evaluation of Phonon-Limited Electronic Relaxation Times and Transport Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Present calculations of electrical transport properties of materials require evaluations of electron-phonon coupling constants on dense predefined grids of electron and phonon momenta and performing the sums over these momenta. In this work, we present the methodology for calculation of carrier relaxation times and electrical transport properties without the use of a predefined grid. The relaxation times are evaluated by integrating out the delta function that ensures energy conservation and performing an average over the angular components of phonon momentum. The charge carrier mobility is then evaluated as a sum over appropriately sampled electronic momenta. We illustrate our methodology by applying to the Fr{\"o}hlich model and to a real semiconducting material ZnTe. We find that rather accurate results can be obtained with a modest number of electron and phonon momenta, on the order of one hundred each, regardless of the carrier effective mass.</description>

      <title>Plasticity Encoding and Mapping during Elementary Loading for Accelerated Mechanical Properties Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding metal plasticity captured from high-resolution digital image correlation (DIC) can be leveraged to predict a wide range of monotonic and cyclic macroscopic properties of metallic materials. To capture the spatial heterogeneity of plasticity that develops in metals, latent space features describing plasticity of a small region are spatially mapped across a large field of view while maintaining the same spatial relationships as the experimental measurements. Latent space feature maps capture the complexity and heterogeneity of metal plasticity as a low-dimensional representation. These feature maps are then used to train a convolutional neural network-based model to predict monotonic and cyclic macroscopic properties. The approach is demonstrated on a large set of face-centered cubic metals, enabling rapid and accurate property prediction. The effects of hyperparameters and training strategies are analyzed, and the extension of the proposed approach to a broader range of metallic materials and loading conditions is discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing Rate-Dependent Liquid Shear Viscosity Using Combined Machine Learning and Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately measuring liquid dynamic viscosity across a wide range of shear rates, from the linear-response to shear-thinning regimes, presents significant experimental challenges due to limitations in resolving high shear rates and controlling thermal effects. In this study, we integrated machine learning (ML) with non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations to address these challenges. A supervised artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed to predict viscosity as a function of shear rate, normal pressure, and temperature, effectively capturing the complex interplay among these variables. The model reveals distinct trends in shear viscosity, characterized by the shear-thinning exponent, and highlights non-monotonic behavior in the radius of gyration components, reflecting molecular morphological changes driven by rate-dependent volume expansion. Notably, temperature effects diminish at higher shear rates, where molecular alignment and spacing dominate the response to shear. By implementing the 'fix npt/sllod' command in LAMMPS, we achieve precise constant-pressure control in NEMD simulations, ensuring accurate representation of system dynamics. This study demonstrates the potential of ML-enhanced NEMD for efficient and accurate viscosity prediction, providing a robust framework for future research in complex fluid dynamics and material design.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast decoupling of polarization and strain in ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental understanding of the interplay between lattice structure, polarization and electrons is pivotal to the optical control of ferroelectrics. The interaction between light and matter enables the remote and wireless control of the ferroelectric polarization on the picosecond timescale, while inducing strain, i.e., lattice deformation. At equilibrium, the ferroelectric polarization is proportional to the strain, and is typically assumed to be so also out of equilibrium. Decoupling the polarization from the strain would remove the constraint of sample design and provide an effective knob to manipulate the polarization by light. Here, upon an above-bandgap laser excitation of the prototypical ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$, we induce and measure an ultrafast decoupling between polarization and strain that begins within 350 fs, by softening Ti-O bonds via charge transfer, and lasts for several tens of picoseconds. We show that the ferroelectric polarization out of equilibrium is mainly determined by photoexcited electrons, instead of the strain. This excited state could serve as a starting point to achieve stable and reversible polarization switching via THz light. Our results demonstrate a light-induced transient and reversible control of the ferroelectric polarization and offer a pathway to control by light both electric and magnetic degrees of freedom in multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning and Data-Driven Methods in Computational Surface and Interface Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale design of surfaces and interfaces is essential for modern technologies like organic LEDs, batteries, fuel cells, superlubricating surfaces, and heterogeneous catalysis. However, these systems often exhibit complex surface reconstructions and polymorphism, with properties influenced by kinetic processes and dynamic behavior. A lack of accurate and scalable simulation tools has limited computational modeling of surfaces and interfaces. Recently, machine learning and data-driven methods have expanded the capabilities of theoretical modeling, enabling, for example, the routine use of machine-learned interatomic potentials to predict energies and forces across numerous structures. Despite these advances, significant challenges remain, including the scarcity of large, consistent datasets and the need for computational and data-efficient machine learning methods. Additionally, a major challenge lies in the lack of accurate reference data and electronic structure methods for interfaces. Density Functional Theory, while effective for bulk materials, is less reliable for surfaces, and too few accurate experimental studies on interface structure and stability exist. Here, we will sketch the current state of data-driven methods and machine learning in computational surface science and provide a perspective on how these methods will shape the field in the future.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Framework Integrating Large Language Models and Generative AI for Accelerated Metamaterial Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials, renowned for their exceptional mechanical, electromagnetic, and thermal properties, hold transformative potential across diverse applications, yet their design remains constrained by labor-intensive trial-and-error methods and limited data interoperability. Here, we introduce CrossMatAgent--a novel multi-agent framework that synergistically integrates large language models with state-of-the-art generative AI to revolutionize metamaterial design. By orchestrating a hierarchical team of agents--each specializing in tasks such as pattern analysis, architectural synthesis, prompt engineering, and supervisory feedback--our system leverages the multimodal reasoning of GPT-4o alongside the generative precision of DALL-E 3 and a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion XL model. This integrated approach automates data augmentation, enhances design fidelity, and produces simulation- and 3D printing-ready metamaterial patterns. Comprehensive evaluations, including CLIP-based alignment, SHAP interpretability analyses, and mechanical simulations under varied load conditions, demonstrate the framework's ability to generate diverse, reproducible, and application-ready designs. CrossMatAgent thus establishes a scalable, AI-driven paradigm that bridges the gap between conceptual innovation and practical realization, paving the way for accelerated metamaterial development.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Spectroscopy of Chiral Charge Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic interactions can give rise to novel charge density waves with unconventional ground states. Recent experiments report evidence for a chiral charge density wave (CDW) that breaks time-reversal symmetry in the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb or Cs). Theoretical analyses propose a topologically nontrivial loop current phase that spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry as the favorable CDW ground state. However, spectroscopic insights into the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ compounds are still missing and conflicting experimental results question the presence of a loop current phase. We employed individual magnetic atoms as local quantum sensors to examine the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Our spectroscopic measurements show that the magnetic moment of Co induces a spatially-localized low-energy state in the CDW phase. The distinct spectral signatures of this state are consistent with theoretical expectations for the quasiparticle excitation of a loop current order parameter, while control experiment rule out alternative scenario. Our work provides unique insights into the ground state of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and introduces a novel method to examine other topological states, such as the fractional Chern insulators, with the STM.</description>

      <title>Theory for Lattice Relaxation in Marginal Twist Moir\'es</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin moir\'e materials behave like elastic membranes where at very small twist angles, the van der Waals adhesion energy much exceeds the strain energy. In this ``marginal twist" regime, regions with low adhesion energy expand, covering most of the moir\'e unit cell, while all the unfavorable energy configurations shrink to form topological defects linked by a periodic network of domain walls. We find analytical expressions that successfully capture this strong-coupling regime for both the triangular soliton network and the honeycomb soliton network matching predictions from LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulations, and numerical solutions of continuum elasticity theory. There is an emergent universality where the theory is characterized by a single twist-angle dependent parameter. Our formalism is essential to understand experiments on a wide-range of materials of current interest including twisted bilayer graphene, both parallel and antiparallel stacked tWSe2 and tMoTe2, and any other twisted homobilayer with the same stacking symmetry.</description>

      <title>Light's symmetry, asymmetry, and their role in nonlinear optics and ultrafast phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of symmetries is extremely useful across science. In Physics, symmetries are used to derive conservation laws and selection rules for transitions in interacting systems. In the early days of nonlinear optics (NLO), symmetries were used to formulate a set of rules for photonic processes according to the medium's symmetries that are reflected in the NLO coefficient tensor. While this approach was believed to be complete and closed, the field has recently reignited as multi-color ultrashort laser pulses with tailored polarization and spatiotemporal structures become standard in NLO. A more complete theory has been recently emerging, which aims to incorporate all possible dynamical degrees of freedom of light: spin and orbital angular momentum, spatial structure, time-dependent polarizations, temporal envelopes, etc., in addition to the symmetries of the medium. This theoretical development is also accompanied by experimental advances that rely on tailored light beams that can now be generated with ever-increasing complexity, including topologies in real and a variety of synthetic dimensions, carrying poly-chromatic carrier waves, time-dependent varying angular momenta, local-chirality, and more. The nonlinear interactions between light fields with unique symmetries (or asymmetries) and matter is especially appealing, since that holds the key for developing new ultrafast spectroscopies with sub-femtosecond resolution, for exerting exact control over matter, and improving our fundamental understanding of how light and matter interact. We review these recent advances in this expanding field, focusing on the theory, its implications, and seminal experiments. We aim to establish a comprehensive database of symmetries and selection rules governing NLO light-matter interactions within the emerging new formalism, and invite the scientific community to contribute to this effort.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal basis approach to fractional Chern physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fractional Chern insulator is thought to emerge from the competition between one-particle band topology and strong repulsive interactions. As an attempt to study lattice models of fractional Chern insulators, we introduce a biorthogonal basis constructed from coherent-like states on the von Neumann lattice. Focusing on the fact that this basis is diagonal to the vortex attachment in the infinite-volume limit, we convert the original fermions into composite fermions by applying a two-dimensional Jordan-Wigner transformation to the creation and annihilation operators of the biorthogonal basis. Furthermore, we apply the Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation to handle the interaction Hamiltonian of composite fermions. Due to the biorthogonal nature, the representation of the new Hamiltonian is no longer Hermitian, which implies that the introduction of the approximation does not guarantee the reality of the energy spectrum. In fact, there are many self-consistent solutions with complex spectra. Nevertheless, we numerically find that it is possible to construct a self-consistent solution where the band dispersion is nearly real and the ground-state energy is lower than in other solutions.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional composite magnet realizing record-high transverse thermoelectric generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18019v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Permanent magnets are used in various products and essential for human society. If omnipresent permanent magnets could directly convert heat into electricity, they would lead to innovative energy harvesting and thermal management technologies. However, achieving such "multifunctionality" has been difficult due to poor thermoelectric performance of conventional magnets. In this work, we develop a multifunctional composite magnet (MCM) that enables giant transverse thermoelectric conversion while possessing permanent magnet features. MCM comprising alternately and obliquely stacked SmCo$_{5}$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_{3}$ multilayers exhibits an excellent transverse thermoelectric performance at room temperature by optimizing its anisotropic structure. Owing to the extremely low interfacial electrical and thermal resistivities, the experimentally determined figure of merit $z_{\rm xy}T$ reaches 0.20 close to the analytically calculated ideal value. The MCM-based thermopile module generates 204 mW in maximum at a temperature difference of 152 K, whose power density normalized by heat transfer area and temperature gradient is not only record-high among transverse thermoelectric modules but also comparable to that of commercial thermoelectric modules utilizing the Seebeck effect. The multifunctionality of our MCM provides unprecedented opportunities for energy harvesting and thermal management everywhere permanent magnets are currently used.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Torque-Assisted Detection of the Canted Magnetization Phase in a CoTb-Based Ferrimagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferrimagnets have the potential to play a key role in spintronics due to their high stability, low energy consumption, and rapid magnetic state switching. These characteristics are typically observed in ferrimagnetic materials near magnetic or angular compensation states. Near the magnetic compensation point, an external field can disrupt the collinearity between the sublattices, leading to aligned magnetic projections. In this work, a violation of antiferromagnetic ordering is detected by a change in the direction of the effective field induced by spin-orbit torque, without altering the dominance type. In the studied W-Co70Tb30-Ru structure, the canted phase region is observed near room temperature under external fields of approximately 0.1 T. Using macrospin simulations and analytical derivations, a correlation is established between anisotropy, interlattice exchange interaction, and the presence of the canted phase region.</description>

      <title>On the interplay of electronic and lattice screening on exciton binding in two-dimensional lead halide perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use path integral Monte Carlo to study the energetics of excitons in layered, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites in order to elucidate the relative contributions of dielectric confinement and electron-phonon coupling. While the dielectric mismatch between polar perovskite layers and non-polar ligand layers significantly increases the exciton binding energy relative to their three dimensional bulk crystal counterparts, formation of exciton polarons attenuates this effect. The contribution from polaron formation is found to be a non-monotonic function of the lead halide layer thickness, which is clarified by a general variational theory. Accounting for both of these effects provides a description of exciton binding energies in good agreement with experimental measurements. By studying isolated layers and stacked layered crystals of various thicknesses, with ligands of varying polarity, we provide a systematic understanding of the excitonic behavior of this class of materials and how to engineer their photophysics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal symmetries can enforce all bands of a material to be topological, a property that is commonly referred to as ``supertopology". Here, we determine the symmetry-enforced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ supertopologies of non-magnetic centrosymmetric materials with weak and strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). For weak (i.e., negligible) SOC, crystal symmetries can enforce Dirac nodal lines protected by a $\pi$-Berry phase, while for strong SOC, crystal symmetries can give rise to nontrival weak $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologies in 2D subplanes of the 3D Brillouin zone. We catalogue all centrosymmetric space groups whose symmetries enforce these $\mathbb{Z}_2$ supertopologies. Suitable material realizations are identified and experimental signatures of the supertopologies, such as quantum spin Hall states, are being discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-stoichiometry in SnS: How it affects thin-film morphology and electrical properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tin sulfide (SnS) has garnered much attention as a promising material for various applications, including solar cells and thermoelectric devices, owing to its favorable optical and electronic properties and the abundant and nontoxic nature of its constituent elements. Herein, we investigated the effect of non-stoichiometry on the morphology and electrical properties of SnS thin films. Using a unique sputtering technique with a sulfur plasma supply, SnS films with precise sulfur content control, [S]/([Sn] + [S]) (xS) ranging from 0.47 to 0.51, were fabricated. Systematic characterization revealed that non-stoichiometry on the S-rich side led to a marked increase in the carrier density of p-type conduction, which was attributed to the formation of intrinsic acceptor-type defects. In contrast, non-stoichiometry on the S-poor side hardly affects the p-type electrical properties, apparently because of the self-compensation between the intrinsic acceptor- and donor-type defects. In addition, non-stoichiometry has been identified as the cause of thin-film morphological changes, with non-stoichiometric films exhibiting rough and porous surfaces. Achieving a stoichiometric composition results in smooth and dense thin-film morphologies, which are crucial for optimizing SnS thin films for device applications. These findings underscore the importance of compositional control for tailoring the morphology and electrical behavior of SnS, paving the way for more efficient SnS-based devices.</description>

Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon microspheres feature a pronounced phononic peak around 2000 cm-1 when they are thermally excited by means of a blue laser. This phononic signature corresponds to vibrational modes of silicon-hydrogen bonds and its emitted light can be coupled to Mie modes defined by the spherical cavity. The signal is apparently quite stable at moderate excitation intensities although there appeared some signs pointing to hydrides bonds reconfiguration and even hydrogen emission. Above a certain excitation threshold, a phase change from amorphous to poly-crystalline silicon occurs that preserves the good structural quality of the microspheres.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Nuclear and Magnetic Structures of Wolframite-Type MgReO4 and ZnReO4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilized high-pressure methods to synthesize the oxides AReO$4$ (A=Zn, Mg) and characterized their crystal structures as monoclinic wolframite-type. By combining muon spin spectroscopy ($\mu^+$SR) with DFT calculations for muon stopping sites, we identify two possible magnetic spin structures for both compounds: $\Gamma_3$ with the propagation vector $\mathbf{k} = (0,1/2,0)$ and $\Gamma_4$ with $\mathbf{k} = (0,0,0)$. In both cases, the magnetic moments are canted from the principal axes within the $ac$-plane. The ordered moment of the proposed structures is $\mathbf{0.29(5)~\mu\mathrm{B}}$ for $\Gamma_3$ and $\mathbf{0.25(8)~\mu_\mathrm{B}}$ for $\Gamma_4$. The low moment is consistent with the absence of a magnetic contribution to the neutron powder diffraction (NPD) spectra. Bond valence sum (BVS) analysis supports the oxidation state of Re being Re$^{6+}$ in the compounds, and we suggest that a combination of $t_\mathrm{2g}$ orbital splitting due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and $d$-$p$ orbital hybridization is responsible for the strongly suppressed ordered magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Dirac surface states, multiorbital dimerization and superconductivity in Nb- and Ta-based A15 compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using first-principle calculations, we investigate the electronic, topological and superconducting properties of Nb$_3$X (X = Ge, Sn, Sb) and Ta$_3$Y (Y = As, Sb, Bi) A15 compounds. We demonstrate that these compounds host Dirac surface states which are related to a nontrivial Z$_2$ topological value. The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) splits the eightfold degenerate R point close to the Fermi level enhancing the amplitude of the spin Hall conductance. Indeed, despite the moderate spin-orbit of the Nb-compounds, a large spin Hall effect is also obtained in Nb$_3$Ge and Nb$_3$Sn compounds. We show that the Coulomb interaction opens the gap at the R point thus making more evident the occurrence of Dirac surface states. We then investigate the superconducting properties by determining the strength of the electron-phonon BCS coupling. The evolution of the critical temperature is tracked down to the 2D limit indicating a reduction of the transition temperature which mainly arises from the suppression of the density of states at the Fermi level. Finally, we propose a minimal tight-binding model based on three coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains with t$_{2g}$ Ta- and Nb-orbitals reproducing the spin-orbit splittings at the R point among the $\pi$-bond bands in this class of compounds. We separate the kinetic parameters in $\pi$ and $\delta$-bonds, in intradimer and interdimer hoppings and discuss their relevance for the topological electronic structure. We point out that Nb$_3$Ge might represent a Z$_2$ topological metal with the highest superconducting temperature ever recorded.</description>

      <title>Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is inherently quantum or classical is essential for developing accurate models and optimizing experimental designs. We investigate this question in the context of polaritonic rotational-vibrational spectra and report a new feature, the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the usual primary resonant polariton splitting that arises from light-matter entanglement. Through ab-initio calculations of HCl molecules and a corresponding model system coupled to a cavity, we demonstrate that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule case and follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary resonant polariton splitting. This finding reveals a novel mechanism to tune a quantum feature using a classical one, offering new insights into the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.</description>
