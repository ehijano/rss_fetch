      <title>Exploring the $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ interaction via femtoscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very recently the Wood-Saxon (WS) type interaction in the single-folding potential approach are constructed to simulate the $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ potentials. One set of the $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ potentials are based on the first principle HAL QCD $\phi{\text -}N $ interactions in $^{4}S_{3/2}$ channel, and in another set, the $\phi$-meson-nucleus potentials were calculated by employing the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. By utilizing these two set of $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ potentials, the two-particle momentum correlation of $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ in high-energy heavy ion collisions is explored. The numerical results show that the correlation functions at small source size (high density nuclear medium) depends on the employed potential model. Also, the correlation functions are obtained within the Lednicky-Lyuboshits (LL) formalism. For small source size, it is found that, the LL formula returns significantly different values due to the large interaction range of the $\phi{\text -}\alpha $ potential.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic matter pieces together the hyperon puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matter composed of hyperons has been hypothesized to occur in neutron stars at densities slightly above the nuclear saturation density and in many descriptions gives rise to a significant softening in the equation of state (EoS). This softening would be at odds with the constraints from neutron star observations and ab initio nuclear matter computations at low density. This inconsistency is known as the hyperon puzzle. We show that Quarkyonic Matter models, which take into account the quark substructure of baryons, can mitigate the hyperon puzzle. We demonstrate two important consequences of the quark substructure effects. First, the hyperon threshold is shifted to a higher density as neutrons preoccupy the phase space for down quarks, preventing the emergence of hyperons at low energy. Secondly, the softening in the EoS becomes mild even above the hyperon threshold density because only little phase space is available for low-energy hyperons; increasing hyperon density quickly drives hyperons into the relativistic regime. In this work, we illustrate these two effects for a matter composed of charge-neutral baryons, using the ideal dual Quarkyonic (IdylliQ) model for three flavors. This model incorporates the Quarkyonic duality and allows us to manifestly express the quark Pauli blocking constraints in terms of the baryon occupation probability. The extension to neutron star matter is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Possibility of quantum Hall effect in neutron star environment: A chiral model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high baryon density and strong magnetic fields are expected in peripheral collisions in heavy-ion collision experiments, such as the upcoming CBM experiment at FAIR in Germany and NICA in Russia. Such densities are also likely in the core of massive neutron stars, possibly with mixed quark-hadron phases. We employed the chiral effective model to obtain the constituent quark mass in this non-perturbative QCD regime. A quantized version of conductivity and resistivity is found reliable in the quantum domain of low density and high magnetic fields. Landau quantization gives rise to phenomena similar to SdH oscillations and quantum Hall effect in this regime. We have used a density-dependent magnetic field to observe SdH-type oscillations and the possibility of the quantum Hall effect in the interior of neutron stars where the magnetic field varies as a function of the baryon density. Our results indicate the possibility of observing the quantum Hall effect in a neutron star environment as well as in heavy-ion collision of CBM and NICA experiments.</description>

      <title>Ab initio nuclear shape coexistence and emergence of island of inversion around $N=20$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a nuclear ab initio framework based on chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions to investigate shape coexistence and the degradation of the $N=20$ magic number in both even-even and odd-even neutron-rich nuclei. The quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, combined with the in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG), is employed to compute their low-lying states. This approach successfully reproduces the coexistence of weakly and strongly deformed states at comparable energies, providing a natural explanation for the emergence of the $N=20$ island of inversion through the IMSRG evolution of the chiral Hamiltonian. The results highlight the essential roles of both dynamic and static collective correlations in reproducing the ordering of nuclear states with distinct shapes. This work represents a significant advance in the application of ab initio methods to the intricate phenomenon of shape coexistence in medium-mass nuclei.</description>

      <title>No-quenching baseline for energy loss signals in oxygen-oxygen collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform computations of inclusive jet, and semi-inclusive jet-hadron cross sections for minimum bias oxygen-oxygen collisions at RHIC and LHC collision energies. We compute the no-quenching baseline for the jet nuclear modification factor $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and jet-, and hadron-triggered semi-inclusive nuclear modification factors $I_\mathrm{AA}$. We do this with state-of-the-art nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs), next-to-leading-order matrix elements, parton shower, and hadronization. We observe deviations from unity due to cold-nuclear matter effects, even without quenching. We demonstrate that the parton distribution uncertainties constitute a significant obstacle in detecting energy loss in small collision systems. Hadron-triggered observables are particularly sensitive to uncertainties due to correlations between the trigger and analyzed particles. For jet-triggered $I_\mathrm{AA}$, there exists a kinematic window in which nPDF, scale, shower, and hadronization uncertainties cancel down to percent level, overcoming a major limiting factor for energy loss discovery in small systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy is Elastic Cross Section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present universal relations between entanglement entropy, which quantifies the quantum correlation between subsystems, and the elastic cross section, which is the primary observable for high energy particle scattering, by employing a careful formulation of wave packets for the incoming particles. For 2-to-2 elastic scattering with no initial entanglement and subdividing the system along particle labels, we show that both the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies in the final states are directly proportional to the elastic cross section in unit of the transverse size for the initial wave packets, which is then interpreted as the elastic scattering probability. The relations do not depend on the underlying dynamics of the quantum field theory and are valid to all orders in coupling strengths. Furthermore, computing quantum correlations between momentum and non-kinematic data leads to entanglement entropies expressed as various semi-inclusive elastic cross sections. Our result gives rise to a novel ``area law'' for entanglement entropy in a two-body system.</description>

      <title>Dilepton production from moaton quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase diagram of QCD may contain a moat regime in a large region of temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu\neq0$. A moat regime is characterized by quasiparticle moatons (pions) whose energy is minimal at nonzero spatial momentum. At $\mu\neq 0$, higher mass dimension operators play a critical role in a moat regime. At dimension six, there are nine possible gauge invariant couplings between scalars and photons. For back-to-back dilepton production, only one operator contributes, which significantly enhances production near a moat threshold. This enhancement is an experimental signature of moatons.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Anisotropy Scaling Functions for Identified Particle and Anti-Particle Species across Beam Energies: Insights into Baryon Junction Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the beam energy dependence of azimuthal anisotropy scaling functions for mesons and baryons in Pb+Pb and Au+Au collisions, spanning \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}\) from 7.7 GeV to 5.02 TeV. Scaling functions were derived from species-dependent \(v_2(p_T, \text{cent})\) measurements to explore the interplay between radial flow, hadronic re-scattering, and baryon junction effects. The resulting scaling functions unify the anisotropy data across different species, revealing the underlying collective behavior. Results demonstrate that baryon junctions significantly enhance baryon \(v_n\) at low \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}\), where the baryon chemical potential (\(\mu_B\)) is large, leading to a substantial baryon--anti-baryon anisotropy difference that diminishes with increasing \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}\). The non-monotonic behavior observed in the specific shear viscosity (\(\eta/s\)) and the radial flow parameters for anti-baryons suggests a change in the system's expansion dynamics near \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 39\) GeV, potentially influenced by the critical point of the QCD phase diagram, as well as the combined effects of baryon junctions, hadronic re-scattering, and properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). These findings provide new constraints and insights into baryon transport, the influence of baryon junction contributions, and the equation of state (EOS) and transport coefficients for baryon-rich matter.</description>

      <title>Nucleon-charmonium interactions from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a realistic lattice QCD study on low-energy $N$-$J/\psi$ and $N$-$\eta_c$ interactions based on (2+1) flavor configurations with nearly physical pion mass $m_\pi=146$ MeV. The interactions, extracted from the spacetime correlations of nucleon and charmonium system by using the HAL QCD method, are found to be attractive in all distances and possess a characteristic long-range tail consistent with the two-pion exchange potential. The resulting $S$-wave scattering lengths are $0.30(2)\left(^{+0}_{-2}\right)$ fm, $0.38(4)\left(^{+0}_{-3}\right)$ fm, and $0.21(2)\left(^{+0}_{-1}\right)$ fm for spin-$3/2$ $N$-$J/\psi$, spin-$1/2$ $N$-$J/\psi$, and spin-$1/2$ $N$-$\eta_c$, respectively. Our results are orders of magnitude larger than those from the photoproduction experiments assuming the vector meson dominance. Our findings may provide deeper understanding of the nonperturbative QCD phenomena ranging from the origin of nucleon mass to the in-medium $J/\psi$ mass modification as well as the properties of hidden-charm pentaquark states.</description>

      <title>Spin Polarized Quasi-particle in Off-equilibrium Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is usually believed that physics in off-equilibrium state characterized by hydrodynamic gradient can be equivalently studied using equilibrium state with suitable metric perturbation. We scrutinize this assumption using chiral kinetic theory in curved space, focusing on spin response to hydrodynamic gradient. Two effects of metric perturbation have been identified: one is to change particle motion by scattering it off the metric fields, which does capture spin response to hydrodynamic gradient, but is limited by kinematic condition in the scattering picture. The other is the genuine effect of off-equilibrium state, which is realizable by mapping the equilibrium state in curved space to flat space through a suitable frame choice. It lifts the kinematic condition in the spin response to hydrodynamic gradient. We classify off-equilibrium effect on spin polarization into modifications of (i) spectral function; (ii) distribution function; (iii) KMS relation. While the last two have been studied using chiral kinetic theory, the first one is usually ignored in kinetic description. We perform a detailed analysis on the first one, finding the radiative correction to spectral function leads to a polarized quasi-particle. The degeneracy of spin responses to different hydrodynamic sources at tree-level is also lifted by radiative correction.</description>

      <title>Transient spin modes from relaxational axial kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of spin mode by solving the axial kinetic equations under the relaxation time approximation in the presence of dissipative sources. We find transient spin modes in response to electric field with spacetime inhomogeneity, fluid acceleration and shear. To the lowest order in spatial momentum $k$, we find the responses to electric field and acceleration can be interpreted as retarded response to temporal variations of magnetic field and vorticity respectively. The response to shear occurs at $O(k^2)$ and can be reduced to retarded response to spatial variation of vorticity. Beyond lowest order, the responses to all three sources are non-local with branch cut in the dispersions. We argue that the non-locality is a consequence of the quasi-particle picture underlying the kinetic description. We also analyze spin transport equation taking into account spin response to temporal and spatial variations of vorticity. We find the corrections turn the original first order spin transport equation into a third order one (or a second order one in the homogeneous limit). The change in order of transport equation is a consequence of non-local nature of the responses, suggesting possible breakdown of gradient expansion in spin hydrodynamics for microscopic theories with quasi-particles.</description>

      <title>Comparing matching prescriptions between pre-equilibrium and hydrodynamic models in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art simulations of high-energy nuclear collisions rely on hybrid setups, involving in particular a pre-equilibrium stage to let the system evolve from a far-from-equilibrium initial condition towards a near-equilibrated state after which fluid dynamics can be applied meaningfully. A known issue is the mismatch between the equation of state in the fluid-dynamical evolution and the effective one in the previous stage, which leads to discontinuities at the interface between the two models. Here we introduce a new matching prescription at this interface, based on the entropy, and we compare it with the standard one relying on local energy conservation. We study the behavior of various quantities at the switching time between the models and investigate a number of final-state hadronic observables. For the latter, we show that they are not modified significantly by the choice of matching prescription, provided an appropriate normalization is chosen for the initial state. In turn, our approach reduces sizeably the ratio of bulk over thermodynamic pressure at the beginning of the fluid-dynamical stage.</description>

      <title>QCD Predictions for Meson Electromagnetic Form Factors at High Momenta: Testing Factorization in Exclusive Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first lattice QCD computation of pion and kaon electromagnetic form factors, $F_M(Q^2)$, at large momentum transfer up to 10 and 28 $\mathrm{GeV}^2$, respectively. Utilizing physical masses and two fine lattices, we achieve good agreement with JLab experimental results at $Q^2 \lesssim 4~\mathrm{GeV}^2$. For $Q^2 \gtrsim 4~\mathrm{GeV}^2$, our results provide $\textit{ab-initio}$ QCD benchmarks for the forthcoming experiments at JLab 12 GeV and future electron-ion colliders. We also test the QCD collinear factorization framework utilizing our high-$Q^2$ form factors at next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbation theory, which relates the form factors to the leading Fock-state meson distribution amplitudes. Comparisons with independent lattice QCD calculations using the same framework demonstrate, within estimated uncertainties, the universality of these nonperturbative quantities.</description>

      <title>QCD phase diagram in the $T-eB$ plane for varying pion mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of a varying pion mass on the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram in the presence of an external magnetic field, aiming to understand it, for the first time, using Nambu\textendash Jona-Lasinio like effective models. We compare results from both its local and nonlocal versions. In both cases, we find that the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) near the crossover is eliminated with increasing pion mass, while the decreasing trend of crossover temperature with increasing magnetic field persists for pion mass values at least up to $440$ MeV. Thus, the models are capable of capturing qualitatively the results found by lattice QCD (LQCD) for heavy (unphysical) pions. The key feature in the models is the incorporation of the effect of a reduction in the coupling constant with increasing energy. Along with reproducing the IMC effect, it enables models to describe the effects of heavier current quark masses without introducing additional parameters. For the local NJL model, this agreement depends on how the parameters of the model are fit at the physical point. In this respect, the nonlocal version, which, due to its formulation, automatically exhibits the IMC effect around the crossover region, captures the physics more naturally. We further use the nonlocal framework to determine the pion mass beyond which the IMC effect around the transition region does not exist anymore.</description>
