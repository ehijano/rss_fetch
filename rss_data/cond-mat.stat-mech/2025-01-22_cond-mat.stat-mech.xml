      <title>Evaluating Gaussianity of heterogeneous fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous diffusion processes are prevalent in various fields, including the motion of proteins in living cells, the migratory movement of birds and mammals, and finance. These processes are often characterized by time-varying dynamics, where interactions with the environment evolve, and the system undergoes fluctuations in diffusivity. Moreover, in many complex systems anomalous diffusion is observed, where the mean square displacement (MSD) exhibits non-linear scaling with time. Among the models used to describe this phenomenon, fractional Brownian motion (FBM) is a widely applied stochastic process, particularly for systems exhibiting long-range temporal correlations. Although FBM is characterized by Gaussian increments, heterogeneous processes with FBM-like characteristics may deviate from Gaussianity. In this article, we study the non-Gaussian behavior of switching fractional Brownian motion (SFBM), a model in which the diffusivity of the FBM process varies while temporal correlations are maintained. To characterize non-Gaussianity, we evaluate the kurtosis, a common tool used to quantify deviations from the normal distribution. We derive exact expressions for the kurtosis of the considered heterogeneous anomalous diffusion process and investigate how it can identify non-Gaussian behavior. We also compare the kurtosis results with those obtained using the Hellinger distance, a classical measure of divergence between probability density functions. Through both analytical and numerical methods, we demonstrate the potential of kurtosis as a metric for detecting non-Gaussianity in heterogeneous anomalous diffusion processes.</description>

      <title>Driving a Quantum Phase Transition at Arbitrary Rate: Exact solution of the Transverse-Field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the crossing of the quantum phase transition in the transverse-field Ising model after modulating the magnetic field at an arbitrary rate, exploring the critical dynamics from the slow to the sudden quench regime. We do so by analyzing the defect density, the complete kink number distribution, and its cumulants upon completion of a linearized quench. Our analysis relies on the diagonalization of the model using the standard Jordan-Wigner and Fourier transformations, along with the exact solution of the time evolution in each mode in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. The free-fermion nature of the problem dictates that the kink number distribution is associated with independent and distinguishable Bernoulli variables, each with a success probability $p_k$. We employ a combination of convergent and asymptotic series expansions to characterize $p_k$ without restrictions on the driving rate. When the latter is approximated by the Landau-Zener formula, the kink density is described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and higher-order cumulants follow a universal power-law behavior, as recently predicted theoretically and verified in the laboratory. By contrast, for moderate and sudden driving protocols, the cumulants exhibit a nonuniversal behavior that is not monotonic on the driving rate and changes qualitatively with the cumulant order. The kink number statistics remain sub-Poissonian for any driving rate, as revealed by an analysis of the cumulant rations that vary nonmonotonically from the sudden to the slow-driving regime. Thanks to the determination of $p_k$ for an arbitrary rate, our study provides a complete analytical understanding of kink number statistics from the slow driving regime to the sudden quench limit.</description>

      <title>Centenary progress from the Nernst theorem to the Nernst statement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is found from textbooks that there are the different versions of the schematic diagram related to the Nernst equation, and consequently, it leads to some discussion related to the Nernst equation and the discovery of other meaningful schematic diagrams never appearing in literature. It is also found that through the introduction of a new function, the schematic diagram of the Nernst equation in the isothermal process of any thermodynamic system can be generated in a unified way and that the Nernst equation can be re-obtained from the experimental data of low-temperature chemical reactions without any artificial additional assumptions. The results obtained here show clearly that the centenary progress from the Nernst theorem to the Nernst statement is completed.</description>

      <title>The stochastic porous medium equation in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the porous medium equation (PME) in one space dimension in presence of additive non-conservative white noise, and interpreted as a stochastic growth equation for the height field of an interface. We predict the values of the two growth exponents $\alpha$ and $\beta$ using the functional RG. Extensive numerical simulations show agreement with the predicted values for these exponents, however they also show anomalous scaling with an additional "local" exponent $\alpha_{\rm loc}$, as well as multiscaling originating from broad distributions of local height differences. The stationary measure of the stochastic PME is found to be well described by a random walk model, related to a Bessel process. This model allows for several predictions about the multiscaling properties.</description>

      <title>Power-efficiency trade-off for finite-time quantum harmonic Otto heat engine via phase-space approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic constraints impose a trade-off between power and efficiency in heat engines, preventing the simultaneous achievement of high power and high efficiency. For classical microscopic engines, explicit inequalities have been discovered, demonstrating the inherent inevitability of this power-efficiency trade-off. However, extensions of these results to quantum engines have so far been limited to cases of slow operation. In this study, we derive a power-efficiency trade-off relation for a paradigmatic quantum engine operating within a finite time, specifically the Otto cycle of a quantum harmonic oscillator. By utilizing a phase-space approach based on quasi-probability representations, we establish a universal trade-off relation applicable to arbitrary time-dependent protocols during the adiabatic processes. Our results reveal that the power of the quantum engine vanishes as the efficiency approaches the quantum mechanical efficiency bound, which is stricter than the Carnot bound. Furthermore, we identify the conditions under which the upper bound is attained, which indicate maximum power is achieved when the generation of quantum coherence is reduced, and the difference in time durations of the isochoric processes increases. These findings are validated through numerical calculations, which confirm their applicability across various types of protocols for heat engine cycles.</description>

      <title>Influence of coupling symmetries and noise on the critical dynamics of synchronizing oscillator lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the synchronization process in lattices of self-sustained (phase and limit-cycle) oscillators displays universal scale-invariant behavior previously studied in the physics of surface kinetic roughening. The type of dynamic scaling ansatz which is verified depends on the randomness that occurs in the system, whether it is columnar disorder (quenched noise given by the random assignment of natural frequencies), leading to anomalous scaling, or else time-dependent noise, inducing the more standard Family-Vicsek dynamic scaling ansatz, as in equilibrium critical dynamics. The specific universality class also depends on the coupling function: for a sine function (as in the celebrated Kuramoto model) the critical behavior is that of the Edwards-Wilkinson equation for the corresponding type of randomness, with Gaussian fluctuations around the average growth. In all the other cases investigated, Tracy-Widom fluctuations ensue, associated with the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation for rough interfaces. Two questions remain to be addressed in order to complete the picture, however: 1) Is the atypical scaling displayed by the sine coupling preserved if other coupling functions satisfying the same (odd) symmetry are employed (as suggested by continuum approximations and symmetry arguments)? and 2) how does the competition between both types of randomness (which are expected to coexist in experimental settings) affect the nonequilibrium behavior? We address the latter question by numerically characterizing the crossover between thermal-noise and columnar-disorder criticality, and the former by providing evidence confirming that it is the symmetry of the coupling function that sets apart the sine coupling, among other odd-symmetric couplings, due to the absence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Relaxation times under pulsed ponderomotive forces and the Central Limit Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relaxation time of a plasma which is perturbed by means of a time-dependent pulsed force. This time pulse is modelled using a Gaussian superposition. During such a pulse two forces are considered: An inhomogeneous oscillating electric force and the corresponding ponderomotive force. The evolution of such an ensemble is driven by the Boltzmann Equation, and the perturbed population is described by a power-law distribution function. In this work, as a new feature, instead the usual techniques the transient between both distributions is analysed using the Central Limit Theorem. This technique, together with the ad hoc solved equation of motion of the charges under this particular system of pulsed forces, allows to find the corresponding expressions relating the time pulse with the relaxation times and the dynamic conditions. Furthermore, numerical estimates are also presented. As a result, we show a persistence effect of excitation at high frequencies, when the initial excitation pulse has already ended. The concatenation of such successive pulses could be of interest, for example, in experimental applications with pulsed lasers.</description>

      <title>Quantum trajectories and Page-curve entanglement dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider time dynamics of entanglement entropy between a filled fermionic system and an empty reservoir. We consider scenarios (i) where the system is subjected to a dephasing mechanism and the reservoir is clean, thereby emulating expansion of effectively interacting fermions in vacuum, and (ii) where both the system and the reservoir are subjected to dephasing and thereby enabling us to address how the entanglement between the part of the effectively interacting system and its complement evolves in time. We consider two different kinds of quantum trajectory approaches, namely stochastic unitary unraveling and quantum state diffusion. For both protocols, we observe and characterize the full Page curve-like dynamics for the entanglement entropy. Depending on the protocol and the setup, we observe very distinct characteristics of the Page curve and the associated Page time and Page value. We also compute the number of fermions leaking to the reservoir and the associated current and shed light on their plausible connections with entanglement entropy. Our findings are expected to hold for a wide variety of generic interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Exact solution to the hydrodynamic equation of quantum lattice gases with dephasing noise via classical run-and-tumble processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The average state dynamics of free fermions subject to random projective measurements of local site occupation numbers is governed by a Lindblad equation with dephasing noise. In the continuous limit, the equation of motion for the correlation matrix is mapped to a hydrodynamic equation for the Wigner function, which takes the form of a linear, nonlocal partial differential equation. As a main result, we derive the analytical solution to the hydrodynamic equation using the quasiparticle picture, showing that the Wigner dynamics emerges from stochastic sampling of classical run-and-tumble processes. As an application, we recover the crossover between ballistic and diffusive transport regimes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of driven systems with explicitly broken detailed balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In systems with detailed balance, the stationary distribution and the equilibrium distribution are identical, creating a clear connection between energetic and entropic quantities. Many driven systems violate detailed balance and still pose a challenge for a consistent thermodynamic interpretation. Even steady-state potentials like entropy or free energy are no longer state variables. Here, we use a framework for systems with broken detailed balance, where Boltzmann entropy can be computed while properly taking constraints on state transitions into account. As an illustration, we establish the thermodynamic relations for arbitrarily driven sample space-reducing processes that are non-equilibrium but show steady states. We demonstrate that, despite explicitly broken detailed balance, it remains feasible to define and unambiguously interpret the effective thermodynamic potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning method for a class of non-Markov systems; our approach extends the actor-critic framework given by Rose et al. [New J. Phys. 23 013013 (2021)] for obtaining scaled cumulant generating functions characterizing the fluctuations. The actor-critic is implemented using neural networks; a particular innovation in our method is the use of an additional neural policy for processing memory variables. We demonstrate results for current fluctuations in various memory-dependent models with special focus on semi-Markov systems where the dynamics is controlled by nonexponential interevent waiting time distributions.</description>

      <title>Frozonium: Freezing Anharmonicity in Floquet Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering is a powerful method that can be used to modify the properties of interacting many-body Hamiltonians via the application of periodic time-dependent drives. Here we consider the physics of an inductively shunted superconducting Josephson junction in the presence of Floquet drives in the fluxonium regime and beyond, which we dub the frozonium artificial atom. We find that in the vicinity of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency, the many-body dynamics can be tuned to that of an effectively linear bosonic oscillator, with additional nonlinear corrections that are suppressed in higher powers of the drive frequency. By analyzing the inverse participation ratios between the time-evolved frozonium wavefunctions and the eigenbasis of a linear oscillator, we demonstrate the ability to achieve a novel dynamical control using a combination of numerical exact diagonalization and Floquet-Magnus expansion. We discuss the physics of resonances between quasi-energy states induced by the drive, and ways to mitigate their effects. We also highlight the enhanced protection of frozonium against external sources of noise present in experimental setups. This work lays the foundation for future applications in quantum memory and bosonic quantum control using superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Ionic Associations and Hydration in the Electrical Double Layer of Water-in-Salt Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water-in-Salt-Electrolytes (WiSEs) are an exciting class of concentrated electrolytes finding applications in energy storage devices because of their expanded electrochemical stability window, good conductivity and cation transference number, and fire-extinguishing properties. These distinct properties are thought to originate from the presence of an anion-dominated ionic network and interpenetrating water channels for cation transport, which indicates that associations in WiSEs are crucial to understanding their properties. Currently, associations have mainly been investigated in the bulk, while little attention has been given to the electrolyte structure near electrified interfaces. Here, we develop a theory for the electrical double layer (EDL) of WiSEs, where we consistently account for the thermoreversible associations of species into Cayley tree aggregates. The theory predicts an asymmetric structure of the EDL. At negative voltages, hydrated Li$^+$ dominate and cluster aggregation is initially slightly enhanced before disintegration at larger voltages. At positive voltages when compared to the bulk, clusters are strictly diminished. Performing atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the EDL of WiSE provides EDL data for validation and bulk data for parameterization of our theory. Validating the predictions of our theory against MD showed good qualitative agreement. Furthermore, we performed electrochemical impendence measurements to determine the differential capacitance of the studied LiTFSI WiSE and also found reasonable agreement with our theory. Overall, the developed approach can be used to investigate ionic aggregation and solvation effects in the EDL, which amongst other properties, can be used to understand the pre-cursers for solid-electrolyte interphase formation.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity of 3C-SiC from configuration space sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cubic silicon carbide phonon thermal conductivity has been calculated using anharmonic phonon analysis. The atomic interaction model was built using displacement-force data obtained with the High Efficiency Configuration Space Sampling (HECSS) technique and density functional theory calculated forces. In the new version of HECSS we replaced the Markov chain scheme of Metropolis-Hastings Monte-Carlo with weighting of the final sampling according to the target distribution. This increased the efficiency of the method and allowed to use -- with appropriate weight -- all generated and ab-initio evaluated samples. The quality of the proposed method is confirmed by the accuracy with which the experimental results taken from the literature were reproduced.</description>

      <title>Entropy and singular-value moments of products of truncated random unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Products of truncated unitary matrices, independently and uniformly drawn from the unitary group, can be used to study universal aspects of monitored quantum circuits. The von Neumann entropy of the corresponding density matrix decreases with increasing length $L$ of the product chain, in a way that depends on the matrix dimension $N$ and the truncation depth $\delta N$. Here we study that dependence in the double-scaling limit $L,N\rightarrow\infty$, at fixed ratio $\tau=L\delta N/N$. The entropy reduction crosses over from a linear to a logarithmic dependence on $\tau$ when this parameter crosses unity. The central technical result is an expression for the singular-value moments of the matrix product in terms of the Erlang function from queueing theory.</description>

      <title>Steady state and mixing of two run-and-tumble particles interacting through jamming and attractive forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of two run-and-tumble particles on the real line subjected to an attractive interaction potential and jamming interactions, which prevent the particles from crossing. We provide the explicit invariant measure, a useful tool for studying clustering phenomena in out-ofequilibrium statistical mechanics, for different tumbling mechanisms and potentials. An important difference with invariant measures of equilibrium systems are Dirac masses on the boundary of the state space, due to the jamming interactions. Qualitative changes in the invariant measure depending on model parameters are also observed, suggesting, like a growing body of evidence, that run-andtumble particle systems can be classified into close-to-equilibrium and strongly out-of-equilibrium models. We also study the relaxation properties of the system, which are linked to the timescale at which clustering emerges from an arbitrary initial configuration. When the interaction potential is linear, we show that the total variation distance to the invariant measure decays exponentially and provide sharp bounds on the decay rate. When the interaction potential is harmonic, we give quantitative exponential bounds in a Wasserstein-type distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ABP systems, phase separation is accompanied by the emergence of vapor bubbles within liquid domains. Using large-scale particle-based simulations, we study the stochastic dynamics of these bubbles and find that most nucleate, grow, and dissolve within liquid domains. We show that their area dynamics can be described by a Langevin equation with a constant negative drift and noise proportional to the perimeter, fully characterizing bubble area and lifetime statistics. Additionally, we develop a lattice gas model that captures the morphological properties, including the decrease in bubble asphericity with increasing area. These findings provide new insights into phase separation in active matter and highlight limitations in current continuum theories.</description>

      <title>Green's Function Approach to Josephson Dot Dynamics and Application to Quantum Mpemba Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Green's function approach for the nonequilibrium dynamics of multi-level quantum dots coupled to multiple fermionic reservoirs in the presence of a bosonic environment. Our theory is simpler than the Keldysh approach and goes beyond scattering state constructions. In concrete terms, we study Josephson junctions containing a quantum dot and coupled to an electromagnetic environment. In the dot region, spin-orbit interactions, a Zeeman field, and in principle also Coulomb interactions can be included. We then study quantum Mpemba effects, assuming that the average phase difference across the Josephson junction is subject to a rapid quench. For a short singlechannel junction, we show that both types of quantum Mpemba effects allowed in open quantum systems are possible. We also study an intermediate-length junction, where spin-orbit interactions and a Zeeman field are included. Again quantum Mpemba effects are predicted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results for the cosmic non-linear density-fluctuation power spectrum based on the analytical formalism developed in [1] which allows us to study cosmic structure formation based on Newtonian particle dynamics in phase-space. This framework provides a field-theory approach to a perturbative solution of the BBGKY-hierarchy where the resulting loop-expansion of the theory introduces a natural truncation criterion. We show that we are able to reproduce structure growth on large scales $k \leq 0.2 \mathrm{h}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to very high precision while on small and intermediate scales we find deviations of the order of $10\%$ from current numerical simulations. The results strongly suggest that a significant improvement may be achieved by restructuring the perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Squeezing generation crossing a mean-field critical point: Work statistics, irreversibility and critical fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical consequences of quantum phase transitions on thermodynamical quantities, such as work statistics and entropy production, is one of the most intriguing aspect of quantum many-body systems, pinpointing the emergence of irreversibility to critical features. In this work, we investigate the critical fingerprints appearing in these key thermodynamical quantities for a mean-field critical system undergoing a finite-time cycle, starting from a thermal state at a generic inverse temperature. In contrast to spatially extended systems, the presence of a mean-field critical point in a finite-time cycle leads to constant irreversible work even in the limit of infinitely slow driving. This links with the fact that a slow finite-time cycle results in a constant amount of squeezing, which enables us to derive analytical expressions for the work statistics and irreversible entropy, depending solely on the mean-field critical exponents and the functional form of the control parameter near the critical point. We find that the probability of observing negative work values, corresponding to negative irreversible entropy, is inversely proportional to the time the system remains near to the critical point, and this trend becomes less pronounced the lower the temperature of the initial thermal state. Finally, we determine the irreversibility traits under squeezing generation at zero-temperature using the relative entropy of coherence.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnets from higher $SU(N)$ representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general formalism for deriving the thermodynamics of ferromagnets consisting of "atoms" carrying an arbitrary irreducible representation of $SU(N)$ and coupled through long-range two-body quadratic interactions. Using this formalism, we derive the thermodynamics and phase structure of ferromagnets with atoms in the doubly symmetric or doubly antisymmetric irreducible representations. The symmetric representation leads to a paramagnetic and a ferromagnetic phase with transitions similar to the ones for the fundamental representation studied before. The antisymmetric representation presents qualitatively new features, leading to a paramagnetic and two distinct ferromagnetic phases that can coexist over a range of temperatures, two of them becoming metastable. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems of atoms with reduced symmetry in their interactions compared to the fundamental case.</description>

      <title>Repulsive thermal van der Waals interaction in multi-species asymmetric electrolytes driven by external electric fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well established that the long-range component of the thermal van der Waals interaction between two semi-infinite dielectrics becomes short-range when an electrolyte is present between them, this is the well known phenomenon of screening. In Phys. Rev. Lett, 133, 238002 (2024) it was shown that for a binary symmetric electrolyte, an electric field parallel to the dielectric boundaries disrupts screening and a long-range thermal repulsive interaction appears. At large applied fields this long-range repulsive interaction can be explained by the fact that the cations and anions have differing average drifts moving in opposite directions, leading to the correlation of charge density fluctuations between the two species to decouple. Here we extend these results to binary electrolytes which are asymmetric as well as electrolytes with more than two ionic species.</description>

      <title>Freezing in flat monolayers of soft spherocylinders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lamellar or smectic phases often have an intricate intralamellar structure that remains scarcely understood from a microscopic viewpoint. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of volume exclusion and electrostatic repulsion on the phase transitions of a flat membrane of soft spherocylinders. With increasing rod packing, we identify nematic and solid phases and find that the nematic-crystal phase transition happens at a uniform packing fraction ($\eta_c \approx 0.82$), independent of the spherocylinder aspect ratio. This value is considerably higher than the well-known critical freezing transition of a hard disk fluid ($\eta_c \approx 0.7$) to which one could naively map a system of near-parallel rods with co-planar mass centers. We attribute this difference to a non-vanishing residual orientational entropy per rod. Our findings are corroborated by a simple theory based on a simple microscopic density functional theory of freezing of a two-dimensional rod fluid. Introduction of electrostatic interactions between the rods reduces the lateral compressibility of the monolayer fluid but keeps the positional order unhindered, which in turn maintains the packing fraction at the nematic-crystal transition. The strength of the orientational fluctuations of the individual rods in our membranes exhibits a density scaling that differs from 3D bulk smectics. Our findings contribute to a qualitative understanding of liquid crystal phase stability in strong planar confinement and engage with recent experimental explorations involving nanorods on 2D substrates.</description>

      <title>Metamaterials that learn to change shape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning to change shape is a fundamental strategy of adaptation and evolution of living organisms, from bacteria and cells to tissues and animals. Human-made materials can also exhibit advanced shape morphing capabilities, but lack the ability to learn. Here, we build metamaterials that can learn complex shape-changing responses using a contrastive learning scheme. By being shown examples of the target shape changes, our metamaterials are able to learn those shape changes by progressively updating internal learning degrees of freedom -- the local stiffnesses. Unlike traditional materials that are designed once and for all, our metamaterials have the ability to forget and learn new shape changes in sequence, to learn multiple shape changes that break reciprocity, and to learn multistable shape changes, which in turn allows them to perform reflex gripping actions and locomotion. Our findings establish metamaterials as an exciting platform for physical learning, which in turn opens avenues for the use of physical learning to design adaptive materials and robots.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous phase transition of feature detection in lateral predictive coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain adopts the strategy of lateral predictive coding (LPC) to construct optimal internal representations for salient features in input sensory signals to reduce the energetic cost of information transmission. Here we consider the task of distinguishing a non-Gaussian signal by LPC from $(N-1)$ Gaussian background signals of the same magnitude, which is intractable by principal component decomposition. We study the emergence of feature detection function from the perspective of statistical mechanics, and formulate a thermodynamic free energy to implement the tradeoff between energetic cost $E$ and information robustness. We define $E$ as the mean $L_1$-norm of the internal state vectors, and quantify the level of information robustness by an entropy measure $S$. We demonstrate that energy--information tradeoff may induce a discontinuous phase transition of the optimal matrix, from a very weak one with $S \approx 0$ to a functional LPC system with moderate synaptic weights in which a single unit responds selectively to the input non-Gaussian feature with high signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A microscopic vision is presented of a Dual Model of Liquids from a solid picture. Among the novelties of this model is that it provides quantitative expressions of various extensive thermophysical properties. The introduction of the statistical number of excited degrees of freedom (DoF) allows bypassing the problem of other dual models which are sometimes unable to correctly reproduce the expressions for those thermophysical quantities showing deviations due to the activation or deactivation of internal DoF. The interpretation of the relaxation times is given, their Order of Magnitude calculated and the way in which these times are involved in the different phases of the collective dynamics of liquids is discussed. A comparison is provided with results obtained in the frame of another phononic model of liquids, as well as with the predictions for the viscoelastic transition regions and with systems exhibiting kgap. In the last part of the paper, theoretical insights and experiments are suggested as potential directions for future research and development.</description>

Abstract: Random exchanges of energy arise naturally in stochastic systems. As a consequence, apparent violations of the second law of thermodynamics can occur, as it holds true on average. Here we investigate the occurrence of these apparent violations -- termed free lunches -- in a quantum-classical system comprised of levitated nanoparticles exchanging energy via the Coulomb interaction. We consider different initial states for the quantum system, and how these exert work and fluctuations upon the classical particle affecting the probability of free lunches. With that, we initiate the study of hybrid quantum-classical systems through the lens of stochastic thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1807.06744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open classical systems with balanced, separated gain and loss, called PT-symmetric systems, have been extensively studied over the past decade. Here, we investigate the properties of a uniform, harmonic chain with spatially separated viscous loss and stochastic gain that are only statistically balanced. We show that such a "split Langevin" bath leads to either the absence of thermalization or non-equilibrium steady states with inhomogeneous temperature profile, both of which are understood in terms of normal modes of the chain. With a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain, a canonical model with topological edge modes, we show that the steady-state properties reflect the topological phase of the underlying chain. We also show that nonlinearity stabilizes the amplifying modes in a harmonic chain, thereby leading to thermalization irrespective of the gain and loss locations. Our results expand the pool of possible realizations of non-Hermitian models to the stochastic domain.</description>

Abstract: We perform a statistical and geometrothermodynamic analysis of three different models of magnetic materials, namely, the translational free model, the spin model, and the mean-field model. First, we derive the fundamental equation for each model, which is then used as input to compute the metrics of the corresponding equilibrium spaces. Analyzing the corresponding geometrothermodynamic curvatures, we conclude that they can be used to describe thermodynamic interaction, stability conditions, and the phase transition structure of the modeled substances. In all the cases, we reproduce their well-known behavior close to the Curie temperature. Moreover, in the case of the model with spin, we found a curvature singularity which corresponds to a novel transition, where a particular response function diverges, indicating the presence of a second order phase transition, according to Ehrenfest classification.</description>

We consider a one-dimensional Ising model with ferromagnetic mean-field interactions and short-range nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings which can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. Despite the relative simplicity of the model, our calculations in the microcanonical ensemble reveal a rich phase diagram. The comparison with the corresponding phase diagram in the canonical ensemble shows the presence of phase transition points and lines which are different in the two ensembles. As an example, in a region of the phase diagram where the canonical ensemble shows a critical point and a critical end point, the microcanonical ensemble has an additional critical point and also a triple point. The regions of ensemble inequivalence typically occur at lower temperatures and at larger absolute values of the competing couplings. The presence of two free parameters in the model allows us to obtain a fourth-order critical point, which can be fully characterized by deriving its Landau normal form.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Effects of Disorder on Current Fluctuations in the Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore how the disorder impacts the current fluctuations in the symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP) within a heterogeneous environment. First, we analyze the SSEP with a defect site under the periodic boundary conditions. We derive the exact expression for the second moment of the current and observe deviations from that of the homogeneous system. Notably, the second moment of the current shows asymmetric density dependence around a density of 1/2 and surpassing that of the homogeneous system in the low-density region. Furthermore, based on the finding from the SSEP with a defect site, we present an approximate derivation of the second moment of the current in the SSEP on a quenched random energy landscape using a partial-mean-field approach. The second moment of the current is heavily influenced by the energy landscape, revealing unique effects arising from the interplay between the heterogeneous environment and the many-body system. Our findings provide valuable insights that can be applied to control current fluctuations in systems involving the interactions of many particles, such as biological transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After Helmholtz, the mechanical foundation of thermodynamics included the First Law $d E = \delta Q + \delta W$, and the first part of the Clausius heat theorem $\delta Q^\text{rev}/T = dS$. The resulting invariance of the entropy $S$ for quasistatic changes in thermally isolated systems invites a connection with Noether's theorem (only established later). In this quest, we continue an idea, first brought up by Wald in black hole thermodynamics and by Sasa $\textit{et al.}$ in various contexts. We follow both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks, and emphasize the role of Killing equations for deriving a First Law for thermodynamically consistent trajectories, to end up with an expression of ``heat over temperature'' as an exact differential of a Noether charge.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of metric tensor in thermodynamic geometry in terms of relaxation timescales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometrical methods are extensively applied to thermodynamics including stochastic thermodynamics. In the case of slow-driving linear response regime, a geometrical framework, known as thermodynamic geometry, is established. The key of this framework is the thermodynamic length characterized by a metric tensor defined on the space of controlling variables. As the metric tensor is given in terms of the equilibrium time-correlation functions of the thermodynamic forces, it contains the information of timescales, which may be useful for analyzing the performance of heat engines. In this paper, we show that the metric tensor for underdamped Langevin dynamics can be decomposed in terms of the relaxation times of a system itself, which govern the timescales of the equilibrium time-correlation functions of the thermodynamic forces. As an application of the decomposition of the metric tensor, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve Carnot efficiency at finite power by taking the vanishing limit of relaxation times without breaking trade-off relations between efficiency and power of heat engines in terms of thermodynamic geometry.</description>

      <title>Performance of Domain-Wall Encoding in Digital Ising Machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To tackle combinatorial optimization problems using an Ising machine, the objective function and constraints must be mapped onto a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model. While QUBO involves binary variables, combinatorial optimization problems frequently include integer variables, which require encoding by binary variables. This process, known as binary-integer encoding, includes various methods, one of which is domain-wall encoding - a recently proposed approach. Experiments on a quantum annealing machine have demonstrated that domain-wall encoding outperforms the commonly used one-hot encoding in terms of objective function value and the probability of obtaining the optimal solution. In a digital Ising machine, domain-wall encoding required less computation time to reach optimal solutions compared to one-hot encoding. However, its practical effectiveness in digital Ising machines remains unclear. To address this uncertainty, the performance of one-hot and domain-wall encoding methods was evaluated on a digital Ising machine using the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). The comparison focused on the dependency of penalty coefficient and sensitivity to computation time. Domain-wall encoding demonstrated a higher feasible solution rate when relative penalty coefficients for the two constraint terms were adjusted, a strategy not commonly used in previous studies. Additionally, domain-wall encoding obtained higher performance practical evaluation metrics for QKPs with large knapsack capacities compared to one-hot encoding. Furthermore, it was observed to be more sensitive to computation time than one-hot encoding.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates a system of three entangled qubits within the XXX model, subjected to an external magnetic field in the $z$-direction and incorporating an anisotropy term along the $y$-axis. We explore the thermodynamics of the system by calculating its magnetic susceptibility and analyzing how this quantity encodes information about entanglement. By deriving rigorous bounds for susceptibility, we demonstrate that their violation serves as an entanglement witness. Our results show that anisotropy enhances entanglement, extending the temperature range over which it persists. Additionally, by tracing over the degrees of freedom of two qubits, we examine the reduced density matrix of the remaining qubits and find that its entropy under the influence of the magnetic field can be mapped to an effective thermal bath at $(B,K) &gt; 0$ K.</description>

Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the integrability and nonintegrability of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model with a uniaxial anisotropic field, which includes the Heisenberg model and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. It is rigorously shown that all systems, except for the known integrable systems, are nonintegrable, meaning that they do not have nontrivial local conserved quantities. In particular, this result guarantees the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model, which is a fundamental assumption for quantum many-body scarring. Furthermore, we give simple necessary conditions for integrability in an extended model of the bilinear-biquadratic model with anisotropic interactions. Our result has accomplished a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the correlations between the position of a tagged tracer and the density of surrounding bath particles is crucial for understanding tracer diffusion in interacting particle systems, and for characterizing the response properties of the bath. We address this problem analytically for both hard-core and soft-core interactions, using minimal yet paradigmatic models in $d$ spatial dimensions. In both cases, we derive analytical expressions for the spatial correlation profiles in the reference frame of the tracer. We reveal unexpected universal features in their large-distance behavior, characterized by power-law tails with exponents that depend solely on the spatial dimensionality of the system. Beyond these simple models, we demonstrate the robustness of our results across different regimes using particle-based numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Inter-Event Time Power Laws in Heterogeneous Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic behavior of spin reversal events in the dilute Ising model, focusing on the influence of static disorder introduced by pinned spins. Our Monte Carlo simulations reveal that in a homogeneous, defect-free system, the inter-event time (IET) between local spin flips follows an exponential distribution, characteristic of Poissonian processes. However, in heterogeneous systems where defects are present, we observe a significant departure from this behavior. At high temperatures, the IET exhibits a power-law distribution resulting from the interplay of spins located in varying potential environments, where defect density influences reversal probabilities. At low temperatures, all site classes converge to a unique power-law distribution, regardless of their potential, leading to distinct critical exponents for the high- and low-temperature regimes. This transition from exponential to power-law behavior underscores the critical response features of magnetic systems with defects, suggesting analogies to glassy dynamics. Our findings highlight the complex mechanisms governing spin dynamics in disordered systems, with implications for understanding the universal aspects of relaxation in glassy materials.</description>

      <title>Locally Interacting Lattice Bosons: Clustering Theorem, Low-Density Condition and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In statistical and quantum many-body physics, the correlation function is a fundamental quantity, especially for lattice models described by local Hamiltonians. Away from the phase-transition point, correlation function typically satisfies the clustering property, meaning that the correlation concentrates at short ranges while decays rapidly (exponentially) at long distances. Though the clustering property has been extensively studied for spin and fermion systems, whether a similar result holds for boson systems remains a long-standing open problem. The essential difficulty lies in the infinite Hilbert-space dimension of a boson, in stark contrast to the finite dimension of a spin or fermion. This work is devoted to establishing the boson counterpart of the clustering of correlations at high temperatures, focusing primarily on the canonical Bose-Hubbard model. As a byproduct, we rigorously justify the low-boson-density assumption for the Gibbs state of the Bose-Hubbard type. This assumption is often invoked as a preliminary requirement for proving various rigorous results, including the boson Lieb-Robinson bound. Building on the results above, we show that, at high temperature, the specific heat density can be bounded from above by a constant, and the boson thermal area law holds true. Our achievement is based on the imaginary-time interaction picture, which is expected to have much broader applications to other open problems concerning bosons in statistical and quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Mean first-passage time at the origin of a run-and-tumble particle with periodic forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11601v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle on a half-line with an absorbing target at the origin. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between two opposite values at Poisson-distributed times. The position of the particle evolves according to an overdamped Langevin dynamics with a spatially-periodic force field such that every point in a given period interval is accessible to the particle. The survival probability of the particle satisfies a backward Fokker--Planck equation, whose Laplace transform yields systems of equations for the moments of the first-passage time of the particle at the origin. The mean first-passage time has already been calculated assuming that the particle exits the system almost surely. We calculate the probability that the particle reaches the origin in a finite time, given its initial position and velocity. We obtain an integral condition on the force, under which the particle has a non-zero survival probability. The conditioned average of the first-passage time at the origin (over the trajectories that reach the origin) is obtained in closed form, both in the latter case and in the case of almost-sure exit. As an application, we consider a piecewise-constant force field that alternates periodically between two opposite values. In the limit where the period is short compared to the mean free path of the particle, the exit probability and the mean first-return time at the origin coincide with the values obtained in the case of an effective constant drift, which we calculate explicitly.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Spin Systems: History of the Emergence of a Modern Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1977, G\'erard Toulouse has proposed a new concept termed as "frustration" in spin systems. Using this definition, several frustrated models have been created and studied, among them we can mention the Villain's model, the fully frustrated simple cubic lattice, the antiferromagnetic triangular lattice. The former models are systems with mixed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds, while in the latter containing only an antiferromagnetic interaction, the frustration is caused by the lattice geometry. These frustrated spin systems have novel properties that we will review in this paper. One of the striking aspects is the fact that well-established methods such as the renormalization group fail to deal with the nature of the phase transition in frustrated systems. Investigations of properties of frustrated spin systems have been intensive since the 80's. I myself got involved in several investigations of frustrated spin systems soon after my PhD. I have learned a lot from numerous discussions with G\'erard Toulouse. Until today, I am still working on frustrated systems such as skyrmions. In this review, I trace back a number of my works over the years on frustrated spin systems going from exactly solved 2D Ising frustrated models, to XY and Heisenberg 2D and 3D frustrated lattices. At the end I present my latest results on skyrmions resulting from the frustration caused by the competition between the exchange interaction and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction under an applied magnetic field. A quantum spin-wave theory using the Green's function method is shown and discussed.</description>

Abstract: We present a classical kinetically constrained model of interacting particles on a triangular ladder, which displays diffusion and jamming and can be treated by means of a classical-quantum mapping. Interpreted as a theory of interacting fermions, the diffusion coefficient is the inverse of the effective mass of the quasiparticles which can be computed using mean-field theory. At a critical density \r{ho} = 2/3, the model undergoes a dynamical phase transition in which exponentially many configurations become jammed while others remain diffusive. The model can be generalized to two dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We propose a theoretical model that incorporates both a time-varying stochastic field and thermal noise in a two-state system. In analyzing data from numerical simulations, we adopt a detailed microscopic approach that goes beyond the standard calculation of the order parameter. Specifically, we measure the probability distribution of the magnetization as a function of temperature and field strength, and compute the time required for the system to jump from one ordered state to the other. These measurements enable us to probe various ordered states in the system and investigate the symmetry breaking and symmetry restoring phenomena underlying the observed phase behavior.</description>

Abstract: Over the past century, the Boltzmann entropy has been widely accepted as the standard definition of entropy for an isolated system. However, it coexists with controversial alternatives, such as the Gibbs entropy. These definitions, including the Boltzmann entropy, exhibit certain inconsistencies, both mathematically and thermodynamically. To address this challenge, we introduce the estimation theory in statistical inference into the study of thermodynamics and statistical physics for finite-sized systems. By regarding the finite-sized system as a thermometer used to measure the temperature of the heat reservoir, we show that optimal estimation of temperature yields the corresponding entropy formula for an isolated system. In the single-sample case, optimal estimation of inverse temperature (or temperature) corresponds to the Boltzmann entropy (or Gibbs entropy). These different definitions of entropy, rather than being contradictory, apply to optimal estimation of different parameters. Furthermore, via the Laplace transform, we identify a complementarity between estimation of temperature and system's energy, a concept suggested by Niels Bohr. We also correct the energy-temperature uncertainty relation, as expressed by the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, in the large-$N$ limit. In the multiple-sample case, we generalize the definitions of both Boltzmann entropy and Gibbs entropy to achieve optimal estimation of temperature, revealing the tight connection between statistical inference and Terrell Hill's nanothermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Knot Entropy Conjecture states that the exponential growth rate of the number of $n$-edge lattice polygons with knot-type $K$ is the same as that for unknot polygons. Moreover, the next order growth follows a power law in $n$ with an exponent that increases by one for each prime knot in the knot decomposition of $K$. We provide the first proof of this conjecture by considering knots and non-split links in tube $\mathbb{T}^*$, an $\infty \times 2\times 1$ sublattice of the simple cubic lattice. We establish upper and lower bounds relating the asymptotics of the number of $n$-edge polygons with fixed link-type in $\mathbb{T}^*$ to that of the number of $n$-edge unknots. For the upper bound, we prove that polygons can be unknotted by braid insertions. For the lower bound, we prove a pattern theorem for unknots using information from exact transfer-matrices. This work provides new knot theory results for 4-plats and new combinatorics results for lattice polygons. Connections to modelling polymers such as DNA in nanochannels are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Influence of density-dependent diffusion on pattern formation in a refuge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11638v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a nonlocal generalization of the Fisher-KPP equation, which incorporates logistic growth and diffusion, for a single species population in a viable patch (refuge). In this framework, diffusion plays an homogenizing role, while nonlocal interactions can destabilize the spatially uniform state, leading to the emergence of spontaneous patterns. Notably, even when the uniform state is stable, spatial perturbations, such as the presence of a refuge, can still induce patterns. These phenomena are well known for environments with constant diffusivity. Our goal is to investigate how the formation of winkles in the population distribution is affected when the diffusivity is density-dependent. Then, we explore scenarios in which diffusivity is sensitive to either rarefaction or overcrowding. We find that state-dependent diffusivity affects the shape and stability of the patterns, potentially leading to either explosive growth or fragmentation of the population distribution, depending on how diffusion reacts to changes in density.</description>

      <title>Disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models: Integrability and a precursor of chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13154v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times, resembling that of quantum chaotic systems, such as those with disorder or external kick terms, despite their large $N$ behavior differing from that of typical chaotic systems. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.</description>

      <title>Dephasing Enabled Fast Charging of Quantum Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a universal method to obtain fast charging of a quantum battery by a driven charger system using controlled, pure dephasing of the charger. While the battery displays coherent underdamped oscillations of energy for weak charger dephasing, the quantum Zeno freezing of the charger energy at high dephasing suppresses the rate of transfer of energy to the battery. Choosing an optimum dephasing rate between the regimes leads to a fast charging of the battery. We illustrate our results with the charger and battery modeled by either two-level systems or harmonic oscillators. Apart from the fast charging, the dephasing also renders the charging performance more robust to detuning between the charger, drive, and battery frequencies for the two-level systems case.</description>

      <title>Evolving disorder and chaos enhances the wave speed of elastic waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Static or frozen disorder, characterised by spatial heterogeneities, influences diverse complex systems, encompassing many-body systems, equilibrium and nonequilibrium states of matter, intricate network topologies, biological systems, and wave-matter interactions. While static disorder has been thoroughly examined, delving into evolving disorder brings increased intricacy to the issue. An example of this complexity is the observation of stochastic acceleration of electromagnetic waves in evolving media, where noisy fluctuations in the propagation medium transfer effective momentum to the wave. Here, we investigate elastic wave propagation in a one-dimensional heterogeneous medium with diagonal disorder. We examine two types of complex elastic materials: one with static disorder, where mass density randomly varies in space, and the other with evolving disorder, featuring random variations in both space and time. Our results indicate that evolving disorder enhances the propagation speed of Gaussian pulses compared to static disorder. Additionally, we demonstrate that the enhanced speed effect also occurs when the medium evolves chaotically rather than randomly over time. The latter establishes that evolving randomness is not a unique prerequisite for observing the enhanced transport of wavefronts, introducing the concept of chaotic speed enhancement of waves in complex media.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body scars with unconventional superconducting pairing symmetries via multibody interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework to construct model Hamiltonians that have unconventional superconducting pairing states as exact energy eigenstates, by incorporating multibody interactions (i.e., interactions among more than two particles). The multibody interactions are introduced in a form of the local density-density coupling in such a way that any pair configuration in real space has a constant interaction energy by canceling the two-body and multibody interactions. Our approach is applicable to both spinless and spinful models in any spatial dimensions and on any bipartite lattices, facilitating an exhaustive extension of Yang's $s$-wave $\eta$-pairing state to various other unconventional pairing symmetries ($p$-wave, $d$-wave, $f$-wave, etc.). Particularly, the constructed eigenstates have off-site pairs with finite center-of-mass momentum, which leads to superconducting states with either even-parity and spin-triplet or odd-parity and spin-singlet symmetry. We verify that the two-dimensional spinful Hubbard model on a square lattice with the multibody interactions has the spin-triplet $d$-wave pairing state as an energy eigenstate, which can be regarded as a quantum many-body scar state as evidenced from the numerical analysis of the pair correlation function, entanglement entropy, and level statistics. We also discuss other examples, including spin-triplet $f$-wave pairing states on a honeycomb lattice and spin-singlet $p$-wave pairing states in a one-dimensional chain. These findings open up the possibility of realizing nonequilibrium unconventional superconductivity in a long-lived manner protected against thermalization.</description>

      <title>Quasispins of vacancy defects and their interactions in disordered antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vacancy defects in disordered magnetic materials are known to act as effective spins, ``quasispins'', in response to an external magnetic field. In the dilute limit, the contributions of such ``quasispins'' to the magnetic susceptibility $\chi_\text{vac}(T)\propto N_\text{vac}/T$ are singular in the limit of low temperatures $T$ and match those of free spins. With increasing the density of vacancies, their interactions may become essential. Motivated by frustrated and quasi-one-dimensional magnetic materials, we study analytically quasispins and their interactions in a generic system that has short-range antiferromagnetic order and lacks long-range order. We predict that if the vacancy defect does not disrupt the short-range antiferromagnetic order around it, the quasispin value matches the value of spins of the magnetic atoms in the material, and the correlators of the quasispins of different vacancies match the spin-spin correlators in the vacancy-free material. We confirm our conclusions by exact calculations for Ising chains with nearest-neighbour and next-to-nearest-neighbour interactions. We also compute the first virial correction to the susceptibility of a magnetic material due to the interactions of vacancy quasispins.</description>

      <title>Sign problem in tensor network contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower complexity. This raises the question how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias towards positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the entries become predominantly positive; this can be seen as a tensor network manifestation of the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. Its performance is governed by the amount of correlations (entanglement) in the tensor network. Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy (i.e., from a volume law to a boundary law scaling of entanglement) occurs already for a slight bias towards a positive mean, and the earlier the larger the bond dimension is. This is in contrast to both expectations and the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction. We gain further insight into this early transition from the study of an effective statmech model. Finally, we investigate the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor network wavefunctions, i.e., PEPS, where we find that the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation which maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary law entanglement scaling, but also suggests new approaches towards PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.</description>

      <title>Improved models for ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas using quantum phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09998v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, improvements are introduced into the current models of the ideal Fermi gas and the ideal Bose gas by incorporating the quantum nature of phase space, directly linked to the uncertainty principle. These improved models leverage the recently developed concepts of quantum phase space and phase space representation of quantum mechanics. The Hamiltonian operator for a gas particle and its eigenstates are first determined, and quantum statistical mechanics is used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas. 
  Analytic expressions for thermodynamic quantities - including the grand canonical potential, particle number, internal energy, Von Neumann entropy, and pressure are derived, alongside the corresponding thermodynamic equations of state for both bosons and fermions. These corrections are particularly significant at low temperatures and in confined volumes, where quantum effects such as shape and size become prominent. The results also establish a direct link between thermodynamic functions and the quantum statistical variances of momenta. 
  Importantly, the improved models recover well-known classical relations of the ideal gas in the high-temperature and large-volume limits, ensuring consistency with classical physics. By addressing quantum corrections and their thermodynamic implications, this work provides a foundation for further applications in nanoscale systems, quantum gases, low-temperature physics, utra-cold physics and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Entangling power, gate typicality, and measurement-induced phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When subject to a non-local unitary evolution, qubits in a quantum circuit become increasingly entangled. Conversely, measurements applied to individual qubits lead to their disentanglement from the collective system. The extent of entanglement reduction depends on the frequency of local projective measurements. A delicate balance emerges between unitary evolution, which enhances entanglement, and measurements which diminish it. In the thermodynamic limit, there is a phase transition from volume law entanglement to area law entanglement at a critical value of measurement frequency. This phenomenon, occurring in hybrid quantum circuits with both unitary gates and measurements, is termed as measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We study the behavior of MIPT in circuits comprising of two qubit unitary gates parameterized by Cartan decomposition. We show that the entangling power and gate typicality of the two-qubit local unitaries employed in the circuit can be used to explain the behavior of global bipartite entanglement the circuit can sustain. When the two qubit gate throughout the circuit is the identity and measurements are the sole driver of the entanglement behavior, we obtain analytical estimate for the entanglement entropy that shows remarkable agreement with numerical simulations. We also find that the entangling power and gate typicality enable the classification of the two-qubit unitaries by different universality classes of phase transitions that can occur in the hybrid circuit. For all unitaries in a particular universality class, the transition from volume to area law of entanglement occurs with same exponent that characterizes the phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06083v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements have revealed new links between information geometry and classical stochastic thermodynamics, particularly through the Fisher information (FI) with respect to time. Recognizing the non-uniqueness of the quantum Fisher metric in Hilbert space, we exploit the fact that any quantum Fisher information (QFI) can be decomposed into a metric-independent incoherent part and a metric-dependent coherent contribution. We demonstrate that the incoherent component of any QFI can be directly linked to entropic acceleration, and for GKSL dynamics with local detailed balance, to the rate of change of generalised thermodynamic forces and entropic flow, paralleling the classical results. Furthermore, we tighten a classical uncertainty relation between the geometric uncertainty of a path in state space and the time-averaged rate of information change and demonstrate that it also holds for quantum systems. We generalise a classical geometric bound on the entropy rate for far-from-equilibrium processes by incorporating a non-negative quantum contribution that arises from the geometric action due to coherent dynamics. Finally, we apply an information-geometric analysis to the recently proposed quantum-thermodynamic Mpemba effect, demonstrating this framework's ability to capture thermodynamic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Geometric Formula for 2d Ising Zeros: Examples &amp; Numerics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11109v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A geometric formula for the zeros of the partition function of the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model was recently proposed in terms of the angles of 2d triangulations embedded in the flat 3d space. Here we proceed to an analytical check of this formula on the cubic graph, dual to a double pyramid, and provide a thorough numerical check by generating random 2d planar triangulations. Our method is to generate Delaunay triangulations of the 2-sphere then performing random local rescalings. For every 2d triangulations, we compute the corresponding Ising couplings from the triangle angles and the dihedral angles, and check directly that the Ising partition function vanishes for these couplings (and grows in modulus in their neighborhood). In particular, we lift an ambiguity of the original formula on the sign of the dihedral angles and establish a convention in terms of convexity/concavity. Finally, we extend our numerical analysis to 2d toroidal triangulations and show that the geometric formula does not work and will need to be generalized, as originally expected, in order to accommodate for non-trivial topologies.</description>

Abstract: Recent experimental advances in nanofluidics have allowed to explore ion transport across molecular-scale pores, in particular for iontronic applications. Two dimensional nanochannels -- in which a single molecular layer of electrolyte is confined between solid walls -- constitute a unique platform to investigate fluid and ion transport in extreme confinement, highlighting unconventional transport properties. In this work, we study ionic association in 2D nanochannels, and its consequences on non-linear ionic transport, using both molecular dynamics simulations and analytical theory. We show that under sufficient confinement, ions assemble into pairs or larger clusters in a process analogous to a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, here modified by the dielectric confinement. We further show that the breaking of pairs results in an electric-field dependent conduction, a mechanism usually known as the second Wien effect. However the 2D nature of the system results in non-universal, temperature-dependent, scaling of the conductivity with electric field, leading to ionic coulomb blockade in some regimes. A 2D generalization of the Onsager theory fully accounts for the non-linear transport. These results suggest ways to exploit electrostatic interactions between ions to build new nanofluidic devices.</description>

Abstract: We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problems of determining whether a given set is a good or bad approximation to a $t$-design. We show that this problem is in $\textsf{PP}$ for any constant $t$ and is $\textsf{PP}$-hard for $t=1,2$ and $3$. Remarkably, this remains true even when the set is promised to be either exponentially close to or no closer than a constant to a $1$-design, particularly illustrating that, while unitary and state designs are powerful information resources, it is inherently hard to determine their properties. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable amplitude of Sondheimer oscillations in thin cadmium crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decades ago, Sondheimer discovered that the electric conductivity of metallic crystals hosting ballistic electrons oscillates with magnetic field. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field with the period proportional to the sample thickness, have been understood in a semi-classical framework. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thickness varying between 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m. When the magnetic field is sufficiently large or the sample sufficiently thick, the amplitude of oscillation falls off as $B^{-4}$ as previously reported. In contrast, the ten first oscillations follow a $B^{-2.5}e^{-B/B_0}$ field dependence and their amplitude is set by the quantum of conductance, the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. This expression is in disagreement with what was predicted in semi-classical scenarios, which neglect Landau quantization. We argue that the classical/quantum crossover occurs at accessible magnetic fields for states whose Fermi wave-vector is almost parallel to the magnetic field. As a consequence, the intersection between the lowest Landau tube and flat toroids on the Fermi surface induced by confinement give rise to oscillations with a periodicity identical to the semi-classical one. A rigorous theoretical account of our data is missing.</description>

      <title>Deep Boundary Perturbations at a Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore an unconventional class of problems in the study of (quantum) critical phenomena, termed "deep boundary criticality". Traditionally, critical systems are analyzed with two types of perturbations: those uniformly distributed throughout the bulk, which can significantly alter the bulk criticality by triggering a nontrivial bulk renormalization group flow, and those confined to a boundary or subdimensional defect, which affect only the boundary or defect condition. Here, we go beyond this paradigm by studying quantum critical systems with boundary perturbations that decay algebraically (following a power law) into the bulk. By continuously varying the decay exponent, such perturbations can transition between having no effect on the bulk and strongly influencing bulk behavior. We investigate this regime using two prototypical models based on (1+1)D massless Dirac fermions. Through a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, we uncover exotic scaling laws in simple observables and observe qualitative changes in model behavior as the decay exponent varies.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole gauge theory: anti-Higgs mechanism and elastic dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the duality between elasticity and fracton gauge theory, we study an extension of the gauge group that includes the quadrupole moment. Remarkably, we find that spontaneous breaking of the quadrupole symmetry increases the number of massless excitations. This result appears to challenge the well-established paradigm, according to which gauge fields acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism, and the would-be Goldstone bosons are rendered massive. We refer to this phenomenon as the anti-Higgs mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the quadrupole gauge theory is dual to an exotic class of elastic systems, which we dub incompressible crystals. The anti-Higgs mechanism in the dual theory corresponds to a phase transition from the incompressible crystal state to an ordinary (compressible) solid.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Structural Transitions in Fluids with Competing Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores how competing interactions in the intermolecular potential of fluids affect their structural transitions. This study employs a versatile potential model with a hard core followed by two constant steps, representing wells or shoulders, analyzed in both one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) systems. Comparing these dimensionalities highlights the effect of confinement on structural transitions. Exact results are derived for 1D systems, while the rational function approximation is used for unconfined 3D fluids. Both scenarios confirm that when the steps are repulsive, the wavelength of the oscillatory decay of the total correlation function evolves with temperature either continuously or discontinuously. In the latter case, a discontinuous oscillation crossover line emerges in the temperature--density plane. For an attractive first step and a repulsive second step, a Fisher--Widom line appears. Although the 1D and 3D results share common features, dimensionality introduces differences: these behaviors occur in distinct temperature ranges, require deeper wells, or become attenuated in 3D. Certain features observed in 1D may vanish in 3D. We conclude that fluids with competing interactions exhibit a rich and intricate pattern of structural transitions, demonstrating the significant influence of dimensionality and interaction features.</description>

      <title>Streamlined Krylov construction and classification of ergodic Floquet systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Krylov construction to periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems using the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Compared to other approaches, our method works faster and maps any quantum dynamics to a one-dimensional tight-binding Krylov chain, which is efficiently simulated on both classical and quantum computers. We also suggest a classification of chaotic and integrable Floquet systems based on the asymptotic behavior of Krylov chain hopping parameters (Verblunsky coefficients). We illustrate this classification with random matrix ensembles, kicked top, and kicked Ising chain.</description>

      <title>Structural Changes and Percolation Transition in Networks after Aging Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In social networking services, users constantly change, and the network structure changes simultaneously. As the network structure changes, so does the word-of-mouth within it. To study how information transfer on the network changes with the aging of the network, we investigated the relation of the structure and the percolation in the aged networks. We first prepared the Bianconi-Barab\'{a}si model as the initial network and observed the time evolution of its properties by repeatedly deleting and adding nodes. We introduced two tunable parameters, the deleting parameter $\alpha$ and the adding parameter $\beta$, and observed the aging behavior for the various parameter sets. We found that the network did not reach its steady state depending on the parameters. We also found that when the network is stable, there is a parameter region where the degree distribution changes from power-law to exponential decay. We performed the percolation analyses and found that the behavior of the percolation probability changes simultaneously with changes in the network's structure. This study is expected to help control network structure in steady-state aged networks.</description>

      <title>Annealed mean-field epidemiological model on scale-free networks with a mitigating factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An annealed version of the quenched mean-field model for epidemic spread is introduced and investigated analytically and assisted by numerical calculations. The interaction between individuals follows a prescription that is used to generate a scale-free network, and we have adjusted the number of connections to produce a sparse network. Specifically, the model's behavior near the infection threshold is examined, as well as the behavior of the stationary prevalence and the probability that a connection between individuals encounters an infected one. We found that these functions display a monotonically increasing dependence on the infection rate. Subsequently, a modification that mimics the mitigation in the probability of encountering an infected individual is introduced, following an old idea rooted in the Malthus-Verhulst model. We found that this modification drastically changes the probability that a connection meets an infected individual. However, despite this change, it does not alter the monotonically increasing behavior of the stationary prevalence.</description>
