      <title>Robustness of topological magnons in disordered arrays of skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of disorder on the robustness of topological magnon states of two-dimensional ferromagnetic skyrmions is investigated. It is diagnosed by evaluating a real space topological invariant, the bosonic Bott index (BI). The disorder simultaneously breaks the axially symmetric shape and the crystalline ordering of the skyrmions array. The corresponding magnonic fluctuations and band spectrum are determined in terms of magnetic field and strength of disorder. We observe the closing of the existing band gaps as the individual skyrmions start to occupy random positions. The analysis reveals that topological states (TSs) persist beyond the perturbative limit when skyrmions reach the glassy phase. In addition, the localization of topologically protected edge states is weakened by the disordered skyrmion structure with increasing localization length. Our findings shed light on the physical understanding of the coexistence of disordered magnetic textures and their topological spin fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Subgap states in semiconductor-superconductor devices for quantum technologies: Andreev qubits and minimal Majorana chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, experimental advances have made it possible to achieve an unprecedented degree of control over the properties of subgap bound states in hybrid nanoscale superconducting structures. This research has been driven by the promise of engineering subgap states for quantum applications, which includes Majorana zero modes predicted to appear at the interface of superconductor and other materials, like topological insulators or semiconductors. In this chapter, we revise the status of the field towards the engineering of quantum devices in controllable semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures. We begin the chapter with a brief introduction about subgap states, focusing on their mathematical formulation. After introducing topological superconductivity using the Kitaev model, we discuss the advances in the search for Majorana states over the last few years, highlighting the difficulties of unambiguously distinguish these states from nontopological subgap states. In recent years, the precise engineering of bound states by a bottom-up approach using quantum dots has led to unprecedented experimental advances, including experimental demonstrations of an Andreev qubits based on a quantum dot Josephson junction and a minimal Kitaev chain based on two quantum dots coherently coupled by the bound states of an intermediate superconducting segment. These experimental advances have revitalized the field and helped to understand that, far from being a disadvantage, the presence of subgap bound states can be exploited for new qubit designs and quantum coherence experiments, including Majorana-based qubits.</description>

      <title>Sensing quantum vacuum fluctuations with non-Gaussian electronic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistics of electron transport in a tunnel junction is affected by fluctuations of its voltage bias, which modulates the probability for electrons to cross the junction. We exploit this phenomenon to provide a direct measurement of quantum vacuum fluctuations in the microwave domain of a resistor placed at ultra-low temperature: we show that the amplified vacuum fluctuations are correlated with the noise generated by the junction to contribute to a third moment of detected voltage fluctuations. This experiment constitutes an absolute measurement of noise, not affected by the unavoidable noise added by the detection setup.</description>

      <title>Quantum graph models for transport in filamentary switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of metallic nanofilaments bridging two electrodes across an insulator is a mechanism for resistive switching. Examples of such phenomena include atomic synapses, which constitute a distinct class of memristive devices whose behavior is closely tied to the properties of the filament. Until recently, experimental investigation of the low-temperature regime and quantum transport effects has been limited. However, with growing interest in understanding the true impacts of the filament on device conductance, comprehending quantum effects has become crucial for quantum neuromorphic hardware. We discuss quantum transport resulting from filamentary switching in a narrow region where the continuous approximation of the contact is not valid, and only a few atoms are involved. In this scenario, the filament can be represented by a graph depicting the adjacency of atoms and the overlap between atomic orbitals. Using quantum graphs, we calculate the scattering amplitude of charge carriers on this graph and explore the interplay between filamentary formation and quantum transport effects.</description>

      <title>Noise-Tolerance of Majorana Teleportation in Mesoscopic Topological Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate teleportation interference associated with the non-local character of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) as a probe of MZMs focusing on the tolerance of teleportation against disturbances, such as inhomogeneous potentials at junctions and disorder. We develop a method for calculating non-local conductance in mesoscopic topological superconductors with fixed parity. In the trivial phase, the non-local conductance exhibits the $h/2e$-periodicity, while in the topological phase with fixed parity, it exhibits the $h/e$-periodicity, indicative of Majorana teleportation. We find that the $h/e$-periodicity is stable against changes in inhomogeneous potential structures and disorder. These results imply that MZMs can cause teleportation interference even in the presence of disturbances, leading to a clear distinction between the trivial and topological phases.</description>

      <title>On activation in solid ionic electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic conductivity in solid electrolytes is commonly expected to exhibit Arrhenius dependence on temperature, determined by a well-defined activation energy. Consequently, a standard approach involves calculating this energy using quasi-static methods and using the Arrhenius form to extrapolate the numerical results from one temperature range to another. Despite the ubiquity of this Arrhenius-based modeling, disagreements frequently arise between theory and experiment, and even between different theoretical studies. By considering a tractable minimal model, we elucidate the reason behind the breakdown of the Arrhenius conductivity form. This breakdown is driven by non-trivial phase-space boundaries between conducting and non-conducting regimes, and depends on the kinetic properties of the system.</description>

      <title>Control of proton transport and hydrogenation in double-gated graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene's basal plane can function as a perfectly selective barrier permeable to protons but impermeable to all ions and gases, stimulating its use in applications such as membranes, catalysis and isotope separation. Protons can also chemically adsorb on graphene and hydrogenate it, inducing a conductor-insulator transition intensely explored in graphene electronic devices. However, both processes face energy barriers that in the case of proton transport motivate strategies to accelerate it, such as introducing vacancies, incorporating catalytic metals or chemically functionalising the lattice, but these can compromise other properties like ion selectivity or mechanical stability. Here we show that independent control of the electric field E~V nm-1 and charge carrier density n~10^14 cm-2 in double gated graphene allows decoupling proton transport from lattice hydrogenation and can accelerate proton transport such that it approaches the limiting electrolyte current in our devices. Proton transport and hydrogenation can be driven selectively with precision and robustness that enables proton-based logic-and-memory graphene devices with orders-of-magnitude on-off ratios. Our results show that field effects can accelerate and decouple electrochemical processes in double-gated 2D crystals and demonstrate the possibility of mapping such processes as a function of E and n - a fundamentally different technique to study 2D electrode-electrolyte interfaces.</description>

      <title>Size-induced Exchange Bias in Single-phase CoO Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report EB in single-phase CoO nanoparticles, where two magnetic phases naturally emerge as the crystallite size decreases from 34.6 to 10.8 nm. The N\'eel temperature (TN) associated with antiferromagnetic ordering decreases monotonically with the reduction in crystallite size, highlighting the significant influence of size effects. The 34.6 nm nanoparticles exhibit magnetization irreversibility between zero field cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) states below TN. This irreversibility appears well above TN with further reduction in size, resulting in the absence of true paramagnetic regime which indicates the occurrence of an additional magnetic phase. The frequency-dependent ac-susceptibility in 10.8 nm nanoparticles suggests slow dynamics of disordered surface spins above TN, coinciding with the establishment of long-range order in the core. The thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) and isothermoremanent magnetization (IRM) curves suggest a core-shell structure: the core is antiferromagnetic, and the shell consists of disordered surface spins causing ferromagnetic interaction. Hence, the exchange bias in these CoO nanoparticles results from the exchange coupling between an antiferromagnetic core and a disordered shell that exhibits unconventional surface spin characteristics.</description>

      <title>Topological states constructed by two different trivial quantum wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological states of the two-leg and three-leg ladders formed by two trivial quantum wires with different lattice constants are theoretically investigated. For the symmetric nearest-neighbor intra-chain hopping two-leg ladder, the inversion symmetry topological insulator phase with two degenerate topological edge states appears. When the inversion symmetry is broken, the topological insulators with one or two topological edge states of different energies and topological metals with edge states embedded in the bulk states could emerge dependent on the filling factor. The topological origin of these topological states in the two-leg ladders is the topological properties of the Chern insulators and Chern metals. According to the arrangement of two trivial quantum wires, we construct two types of three-leg ladders. Each type of the three-leg ladder could be divided into one trivial subspace and one topological nontrivial subspace by unitary transformation. The topological nontrivial subspace corresponds to the effective two-leg ladder model. As the filling factor changes, the system could be in topological insulators or topological metals phases. These rich topological states in the two-leg and three-leg ladders could be confirmed by current experimental techniques.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Band Structure and Orbital Character of a $\pi$-Conjugated 2D Graphdiyne-Based Organometallic Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphdiyne-based carbon systems generate intriguing layered sp-sp$^2$ organometallic lattices, characterized by flexible acetylenic groups connecting planar carbon units through metal centers. At their thinnest limit, they can result in two-dimensional (2D) organometallic networks exhibiting unique quantum properties and even confining the surface states of the substrate, which is of great importance for fundamental studies. In this work, we present the on-surface synthesis of a highly crystalline 2D organometallic network grown on Ag(111). The electronic structure of this mixed honeycomb-kagome arrangement - investigated by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy - reveals a strong electronic conjugation within the network, leading to the formation of two intense electronic band-manifolds. In comparison to theoretical density functional theory calculations, we observe that these bands exhibit a well-defined orbital character that can be associated with distinct regions of the sp-sp$^2$ monomers. Moreover, we find that the halogen by-products resulting from the network formation locally affect the pore-confined states, causing a significant energy shift. This work contributes to the understanding of the growth and electronic structure of graphdiyne-like 2D networks, providing insights into the development of novel carbon materials beyond graphene with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>SQUID oscillations in PbTe nanowire networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network structures by semiconductor nanowires hold great promise for advanced quantum devices, especially for applications in topological quantum computing. In this study, we created networks of PbTe nanowires arranged in loop configurations. Using shadow-wall epitaxy, we defined superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) using the superconductor Pb. These SQUIDs exhibit oscillations in supercurrent upon the scanning of a magnetic field. Most of the oscillations can be fitted assuming a sinusoidal current-phase relation for each Josephson junction. Under certain conditions, the oscillations are found to be skewed, suggesting possible deviation from a sinusoidal behavior. Our results highlight the potential of PbTe nanowires for building complex quantum devices in the form of networks.</description>

      <title>Overlapping Top Gate Electrodes based on Low Temperature Atomic Layer Deposition for Nanoscale Ambipolar Lateral Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present overlapping top gate electrodes for the formation of gate defined lateral junctions in semiconducting layers as an alternative to the back gate/top gate combination and to the split gate configuration. The optical lithography microfabrication of the overlapping top gates is based on multiple layers of low-temperature atomic layer deposited hafnium oxide, which acts as a gate dielectric and as a robust insulating layer between two overlapping gate electrodes exhibiting a large dielectric breakdown field of &gt; 1E9 V/m. The advantage of overlapping gates over the split gate approach is confirmed in model calculations of the electrostatics of the gate stack. The overlapping gate process is applied to Hall bar devices of mercury telluride in order to study the interaction of different quantum Hall states in the nn', np, pn and pp' regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising candidates to improve the thermal conductivity of nano-composites. The main obstacle to these applications is the extremely high thermal boundary (Kapitza) resistance between the CNTs and their matrix. In this theoretical work our goal is to maximize the heat flux through the CNT by functionalizing the CNT ends. We use a Landauer approach to calculate and optimize the energy flux from a soft to a hard material in one dimension through a connecting continuous medium of varying elasticity and density. The transmission probability of phonons through the system is calculated both numerically and analytically. We find that over 90% of the maximum heat flux into CNT is possible for 1nm length of the intermediate material at room temperature (300K).</description>

      <title>Bright-Dark Exciton Interplay Evidenced by Spin Polarization in CdSe/CdMnS Nanoplatelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) colloidal nanocrystals demonstrate remarkable magneto-optical properties. However, the behavior of circular polarization of their emission in high magnetic fields remains unclear. We measure magneto-optical properties of colloidal CdSe/CdMnS nanoplatelets in high magnetic fields up to 30 T and at cryogenic temperatures. The degree of circular polarization of photoluminescence demonstrates non-monotonous behavior in a magnetic field. In low magnetic fields, the polarization degree is positive, due to an exchange interaction of excitons with localized spins of magnetic Mn ions. The exchange interaction is strong enough to overcome the intrinsic Zeeman splitting, which provides negatively polarized emission in nonmagnetic CdSe/CdS nanoplatelets. After reaching a maximum the polarization degree starts to decrease and reverses the sign to negative in high magnetic fields. The critical magnetic field, in which the sign is reversed, increases when temperature is elevated. We develop a model, which explains this behavior by an interplay of bright and dark exciton recombination.</description>

      <title>Direct transition from a fractional quantum anomalous Hall state to a smectic state with the same Hall conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent developments in twisted MoTe_2 and rhombohedral multilayer graphene have generated widespread attention to the general features of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, including their possible coexistence with and transition to various symmetry breaking charge ordered states. These attentions are pushing forward our knowledge of the relation between the topological order in FQAH states and the Landau-type of symmetry breaking order such as the 1D smectic electronic liquid crystal and 2D charge-density-wave (CDW) solid. Although the transitions from topological states to symmetry breaking states with trivial topology have been discussed, the road from one topological ordered state to another with the same Hall conductance coexisting with Landau order has not been found. Here we show the intriguing evidence that the FQAH to FQAH Smectic (FQAHS) transition is robustly realizable in the archetypal correlated flat Chern-band model at filling {\nu} = 2/3. This transition is novel in that: i) the FQAHS acquires the same fractional Hall conductance as FQAH, which cannot be explained by mean-field band folding. The formation of smectic order can be viewed as perturbation around the transition point, and thus, do not destroy or change the original topology; ii) the charge excitation remains gapped across the transition although the neutral gap is closed at transition point; and iii) the transition is triggered by the softening of roton mode with the same wave vector as the smectic order. Our discovery opens countless new possibilities, both theoretical and experimental, in the fast-growing field of robust fractional Chern insulators.</description>

Abstract: The mass production and the practical number of cryogenic quantum devices producible in a single chip are limited to the number of electrical contact pads and wiring of the cryostat or dilution refrigerator. It is, therefore, beneficial to contrast the measurements of hundreds of devices fabricated in a single chip in one cooldown process to promote the scalability, integrability, reliability, and reproducibility of quantum devices and to save evaluation time, cost and energy. Here, we use a cryogenic on-chip multiplexer architecture and investigate the statistics of the 0.7 anomaly observed on the first three plateaus of the quantized conductance of semiconductor quantum point contact (QPC) transistors. Our single chips contain 256 split gate field effect QPC transistors (QFET) each, with two 16-branch multiplexed source-drain and gate pads, allowing individual transistors to be selected, addressed and controlled through an electrostatic gate voltage process. A total of 1280 quantum transistors with nano-scale dimensions are patterned in 5 different chips of GaAs heterostructures. From the measurements of 571 functioning QPCs taken at temperatures T= 1.4 K and T= 40 mK, it is found that the spontaneous polarisation model and Kondo effect do not fit our results. Furthermore, some of the features in our data largely agreed with van Hove model with short-range interactions. Our approach provides further insight into the quantum mechanical properties and microscopic origin of the 0.7 anomaly in QPCs, paving the way for the development of semiconducting quantum circuits and integrated cryogenic electronics, for scalable quantum logic control, readout, synthesis, and processing applications.</description>

      <title>All-optical scanning vector magnetometry based on fine and hyperfine interactions in spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ centers in silicon carbide</title>

Abstract: The possibility of using axial spin color centers with $S=3/2$, oriented along the hexagonal $c$ axis in a silicon carbide (SiC) wafer, has been demonstrated for all-optical measurement of projection of the external magnetic field coinciding with the $c$ axis of the crystal, and the polar and azimuthal angles of the external measured magnetic field at room and significantly higher temperatures. A distinctive feature of spin centers in SiC, in which optically induced spin alignment is carried out, is the presence of a unique system of spin levels in a magnetic field, caused by fine structure interaction and hyperfine interaction with the $^{29}$Si nuclei and there is a wide range of level anticrossings (LACs), leading to an exceptionally strong change in photoluminescence in the region of LAC and the dependence of the LAC spectrum on the orientation of the external measured magnetic field, which made it possible to develop the all-optical vector magnetometry method. Such measurements do not require microwave radiation, it is possible to use single spin center for the all-optical vector magnetometry. The proposed magnetometer is based on an external magnetic field cancellation scheme, which leads to a LAC spectrum observed in a zero external magnetic field, called its reference spectrum, by maintaining a local region of zero magnetic field at the site of optical excitation of spin centers. 4H-SiC plate is placed on the scanning stage of a confocal microscope inside the Helmholtz coils. Sensitivity to a constant magnetic field for $z$ component of the magnetic field ${B}_{z}$ is better than $0.1\mu$T$/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ in a volume of $1\times10^{-8}$mm$^{3}$ at room temperature. The sensitivity of determining the angles polar and azimuthal is determined by the sensitivity to determining the perpendicular component of the magnetic field, which is better than $5~\mu$T$/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$.</description>

      <title>Open reaction-diffusion systems: bridging probabilistic theory across scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying numbers of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. This establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.</description>

      <title>Local probe of bulk and edge states in a fractional Chern insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is a prime example of topological quantum many-body phenomena, arising from the interplay between strong electron correlation, topological order, and time reversal symmetry breaking. Recently, a lattice analog of FQHE at zero magnetic field has been observed, confirming the existence of a zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI). Despite this, the bulk-edge correspondence -- a hallmark of FCI featuring an insulating bulk with conductive edges -- has not been directly observed. In fact, this correspondence has not been visualized in any system for fractional states due to experimental challenges. Here we report the imaging of FCI edge states in twisted MoTe2 by employing a newly developed modality of microwave-impedance microscopy. By tuning the carrier density, we observe the system evolving between metallic and FCI states, the latter of which exhibits insulating bulk and conductive edges as expected from bulk-boundary correspondence. We also observe the evolution of edge states across the topological phase transition from an incompressible Chern insulator state to a metal and finally to a putative charge ordered insulating state as a function of interlayer electric field. The local measurement further reveals tantalizing prospects of neighboring domains with different fractional orders. These findings pave the way for research into topologically protected 1D interfaces between various anyonic states at zero magnetic field, such as topological entanglement entropy, Halperin-Laughlin interfaces, and the creation of non-abelian anyons.</description>

      <title>Pressure-tuned many-body phases through $\Gamma$-K valleytronics in moir\'e bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides have revealed a variety of strongly correlated phenomena. To theoretically explore their origin, we combine here ab initio calculations with correlated model approaches to describe and study many-body effects in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ under pressure. We find that the interlayer distance is a key factor for the electronic structure, as it tunes the relative energetic positions between the K and the $\Gamma$ valleys of the valence band maximum of the untwisted bilayer. As a result, applying uniaxial pressure to a twisted bilayer induces a charge-transfer from the K valley to the flat bands in the $\Gamma$ valley. Upon Wannierizing moir\'e bands from both valleys, we establish the relevant tight-binding model parameters and calculate the effective interaction strengths using the constrained random phase approximation. With this, we approximate the interacting pressure-doping phase diagram of WSe$_2$ moir\'e bilayers using self-consistent mean field theory. Our results establish twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ as a platform that allows the direct pressure-tuning of different correlated phases, ranging from Mott insulators, charge-valley-transfer insulators to Kondo lattice-like systems.</description>

      <title>Pauli blockade catalogue and three- and four-particle Kondo effect in bilayer graphene quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pauli blockade is a fundamental quantum phenomenon that also serves as a powerful tool for qubit manipulation and read-out. While most systems exhibit a simple even-odd pattern of double-dot Pauli spin blockade due to the preferred singlet pairing of spins, the additional valley degree of freedom offered by bilayer graphene greatly alters this pattern. Inspecting bias-triangle measurements at double-dot charge degeneracies with up to four electrons in each dot reveals a much richer double-dot Pauli blockade catalogue with both spin and/or valley blockade. In addition, we use single-dot Kondo effect measurements to substantiate our understanding of the three- and four-particle state spectra by analyzing their magnetic field dependence. With high controllability and reported long valley- and spin-relaxation times, bilayer graphene is a rising platform for hosting semiconductor quantum dot qubits. A thorough understanding of state spectra is crucial for qubit design and manipulation, and the rich Pauli blockade catalogue provides an abundance of novel qubit operational possibilities and opportunities to explore intriguing spin and valley physics.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of tritium adsorption on graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we report on studies of graphene exposed to tritium gas in a controlled environment. The single layer graphene on a $\textrm{SiO}_2$/Si substrate was exposed to 400 mbar of $\textrm{T}_2$ for a total time of $\approx$ 55 h. The resistivity of the graphene sample was measured $\textit{in situ}$ during tritium exposure using the Van der Pauw method. We found that the sheet resistance increases by three orders of magnitude during the exposure, suggesting significant chemisorption of tritium. After exposure, the samples were characterised $\textit{ex situ}$ via spatio-chemical mapping with a confocal Raman microscope, to study the effect of tritium on the graphene structure (tritiation yielding T-graphene), as well as the homogeneity of modifications across the whole area of the graphene film. The Raman spectra after tritium exposure were comparable to previously observed results in hydrogen-loading experiments, carried out by other groups. By thermal annealing we also could demonstrate, using Raman spectral analysis, that the structural changes were largely reversible. Considering all observations, we conclude that the graphene film was at least partially tritiated during the tritium exposure, and that the graphene film by and large withstands the bombardment by electrons from the $\beta$-decay of tritium, as well as by energetic primary and secondary ions.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity of macroporous graphene aerogel measured using high resolution comparative infrared thermal microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene aerogel (GA) is a promising material for thermal management applications across many fields due to its lightweight and thermally insulative properties. However, standard values for important thermal properties, such as thermal conductivity, remain elusive due to the lack of reliable characterization techniques for highly porous materials. Comparative infrared thermal microscopy (CITM) is an attractive technique to obtain thermal conductance values of porous materials like GA, due to its non-invasive character, which requires no probing of, or contact with, the often-delicate structures and frameworks. In this study, we improve upon CITM by utilizing a higher resolution imaging setup and reducing the need for pore-filling coating of the sample (previously used to adjust for emissivity). This upgraded setup, verified by characterizing porous silica aerogel, allows for a more accurate confirmation of the fundamental thermal conductivity value of GA while still accounting for the thermal resistance at material boundaries. Using this improved method, we measure a thermal conductivity below 0.036 W/m$\cdot$K for commercial GA using multiple reference materials. These measurements demonstrate the impact of higher resolution thermal imaging to improve accuracy in low density, highly porous materials characterization. This study also reports thermal conductivity for much lower density (less than 15 mg/cm$^3$) GA than previously published studies while maintaining the robustness of the CITM technique.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase Transition due to Feedback-induced Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The traditional dynamical phase transition refers to the appearance of singularities in an observable with respect to a control parameter for a late-time state or singularities in the rate function of the Loschmidt echo with respect to time. Here, we study the many-body dynamics in a continuously monitored free fermion system with conditional feedback under open boundary conditions. We surprisingly find a novel dynamical phase transition from a logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy to an area-law scaling as time evolves. The transition, which is noticeably different from the conventional dynamical phase transition, arises from the competition between the bulk dynamics and boundary skin effects. In addition, we find that while quasidisorder or disorder cannot drive a transition for the steady state, a transition occurs for the maximum entanglement entropy during the time evolution, which agrees well with the entanglement transition for the steady state of the dynamics under periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Magnus Expansion and Fer Expansion Approaches Revisited to Investigate the Chemical Shift Anisotropy During the Triple Oscillating Field Technique Irradiation in Solid-State NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Floquet-Magnus and Fer expansion schemes were introduced in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in 2011 and 2006, respectively. Key features of the Floquet magnus expansion are its ability to account for the calculations developed in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space instead of an infinite-dimensional space within the Floquet theory as well as its use of its distinguishable function from other theories such as average Hamiltonian theory, Floquet theory, and Fer expansion, which facilitates the evaluation of the spin behavior in between the stroboscopic observation points. This article focuses on revisiting the Floquet-Magnus and Fer expansion approaches and applying both methods to calculate the effective Hamiltonians and propagators, which control the spin system evolution during the Triple Oscillating Field Technique radiation experiment (TOFU). The TOFU pulse sequence is an important technique that was shown to avoid the dipolar truncation problem and form a new basis for accurate distance measurement by solid-state NMR. We take advantage of the interaction frequencies and the time modulation arising from the TOFU pulse sequence allowing selective recoupling of specific terms in the Hamiltonian that fulfill determined specific conditions. The work presented unifies and generalizes existing results of the Floquet-Magnus and Fer expansions and delivers illustrations of novel springs that boost previous applications that are based on the classical information. We believe that the revisited approaches of this work and the derived expressions can serve as useful information and numerical tools for time evolution in time-resolved spectroscopy, quantum control, and open system quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms provide a potential strategy for solving computational problems that are intractable by classical means. Computing the topological invariants of topological matter is one central problem in research on quantum materials, and a variety of numerical approaches for this purpose have been developed. However, the complexity of quantum many-body Hamiltonians makes calculations of topological invariants challenging for interacting systems. Here, we present two quantum circuits for calculating Chern numbers of two-dimensional quantum matter on quantum computers. Both circuits combine a gate-based adiabatic time-evolution over the discretized Brillouin zone with particular phase estimation techniques. The first algorithm uses many qubits, and we analyze it using a tensor-network simulator of quantum circuits. The second circuit uses fewer qubits, and we implement it experimentally on a quantum computer based on superconducting qubits. Our results establish a method for computing topological invariants with quantum circuits, taking a step towards characterizing interacting topological quantum matter using quantum computers.</description>
