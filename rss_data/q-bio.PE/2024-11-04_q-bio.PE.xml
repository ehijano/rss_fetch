      <title>Global bifurcation in a virus, defective genomes, satellite RNAs tripartite system: breakdown of a coexistence quasi-neutral curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of wild-type (wt) RNA viruses and their defective viral genomes (DVGs) have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. This research has paid special attention to the interference effects of DVGs on wt accumulation, transmission, disease severity, and induction of immunological responses. This subject is currently a highly active. However, viral infections involving wt, DVGs and other subviral genetic elements, like viral RNA satellites (satRNAs) have received scarce attention. Satellites are molecular parasites genetically different from the wt virus, which exploit the products of the latter for their own replication in as much as DVGs do, and thus they need to coinfect host cells along with the wt virus to complete their replication cycle. Here, we analyze a mathematical model describing the initial replication phase of a wt virus producing DVGs and coinfecting with a satRNA. The model has three different dynamical regimes depending upon the wt replication rate ($\alpha$), the fraction of DVGs produced during replication ($\omega$), and the replication rate of the satRNA ($\beta$): ($i$) full extinction when $\beta &gt; \alpha (1 - \omega)$; ($ii$) a bistable regime with full coexistence governed by a quasi-neutral curve of equilibria and full extinction when $\beta = \alpha (1 - \omega)$; and ($iii$) a scenario of bistability separating full extinction from wt-DVGs coexistence with no satRNA when $\beta &lt; \alpha (1 - \omega)$. The transition from scenarios ($i$) to ($iii$) occurs through the creation and destruction of a quasi-neutral curve of equilibria in a global bifurcation that we name as \textit{quasi-neutral nullcline confluence} (QNC) bifurcation: at the bifurcation value, two nullcline hypersurfaces coincide, giving rise to the curve of equilibria.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary accumulation modelling in AMR: machine learning to infer and predict evolutionary dynamics of multi-drug resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can we understand and predict the evolutionary pathways by which bacteria acquire multi-drug resistance (MDR)? These questions have substantial potential impact in basic biology and in applied approaches to address the global health challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Here, we review how a class of machine learning approaches called evolutionary accumulation modelling (EvAM) may help reveal these dynamics using genetic and/or phenotypic AMR datasets, without requiring longitudinal sampling. These approaches are well-established in cancer progression and evolutionary biology, but currently less used in AMR research. We discuss how EvAM can learn the evolutionary pathways by which drug resistances and AMR features are acquired as pathogens evolve, predict next evolutionary steps, identify influences between AMR features, and explore differences in MDR evolution between regions, demographics, and more. We demonstrate a case study on MDR evolution in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, providing links to some approaches for implementation.</description>

      <title>Simplifying and Characterizing DAGs and Phylogenetic Networks via Least Common Ancestor Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rooted phylogenetic networks, or more generally, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), are widely used to model species or gene relationships that traditional rooted trees cannot fully capture, especially in the presence of reticulate processes or horizontal gene transfers. Such networks or DAGs are typically inferred from genomic data of extant taxa, providing only an estimate of the true evolutionary history. However, these inferred DAGs are often complex and difficult to interpret. In particular, many contain vertices that do not serve as least common ancestors (LCAs) for any subset of the underlying genes or species, thus lacking direct support from the observed data. In contrast, LCA vertices represent ancestral states substantiated by the data, offering important insights into evolutionary relationships among subsets of taxa. To reduce unnecessary complexity and eliminate unsupported vertices, we aim to simplify a DAG to retain only LCA vertices while preserving essential evolutionary information.
  In this paper, we characterize $\mathrm{LCA}$-relevant and $\mathrm{lca}$-relevant DAGs, defined as those in which every vertex serves as an LCA (or unique LCA) for some subset of taxa. We introduce methods to identify LCAs in DAGs and efficiently transform any DAG into an $\mathrm{LCA}$-relevant or $\mathrm{lca}$-relevant one while preserving key structural properties of the original DAG or network. This transformation is achieved using a simple operator ``$\ominus$'' that mimics vertex suppression.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fermi's Paradox using an Intragalactic Colonization Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore Fermi's Paradox via a system of differential equations and using simulations of dispersal and interactions between competing interplanetary civilizations. To quantify the resources and potentials of these worlds, three different state variables representing population, environment, and technology, are used. When encounters occur between two different civilizations, the deterministic Lanchester Battle Model is used to determine the outcome of the conflict. We use the Unity engine to simulate the possible outcomes of colonization by different types of civilizations to further investigate Fermi's question.
  When growth rates of population, technology and nature are out of balance, planetary civilizations can collapse. If the balance is adequate, then some civilizations can develop into dominating ones; nevertheless, they leave large spatial gaps in the distribution of their colonies. The unexpected result is that small civilizations can be left in existence by dominating civilizations in a galaxy due to those large gaps. Our results provide some insights into the validity of various solutions to Fermi's Paradox.</description>

      <title>Optimal screening strategies in the control of an infectious disease: a case of the COVID-19 in a population with age structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw an increase in demand for epidemiological mathematical models. The goal of this work is to study the optimal control for an age-structured model as a strategy of quarantine of infected people, which is done via Pontryagin's maximum principle. Since quarantine campaigns are not just a matter of public health, also posing economic challenges, the optimal control problem does not simply minimize the number of infected individuals. Instead, it jointly minimizes this number and the economic costs associated to the campaigns, providing data that can help authorities make decisions when dealing with epidemics. The controls are the quarantine entrance parameters, which are numerically calculated for different lengths of isolation. The best strategies gives a calendar that indicates when the isolation measures can be relaxed, and the consequences of a delay in the start of the quarantine are analyzed by presenting the reduction in the number of deaths for the strategy with optimal control compared to a no-quarantine landscape.</description>

      <title>The importance of sampling design for unbiased estimation of survival using joint live-recapture and live resight models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13414v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Survival is a key life history parameter that can inform management decisions and life history research. Because true survival is often confounded with permanent and temporary emigration from the study area, many studies must estimate apparent survival (i.e., probability of surviving and remaining inside the study area), which can be much lower than true survival for highly mobile species. One method for estimating true survival is the Barker joint live-recapture/live-resight (JLRLR) model, which combines capture data from a study area (hereafter the capture site) with resighting data from a broader geographic area. This model assumes that live resights occur throughout the entire area where animals can disperse to and this assumption is often not met in practice. Here we use simulation to evaluate survival bias from a JLRLR model under study design scenarios that differ in the site selection for resights: global, random, fixed including the capture site, and fixed excluding the capture site. Simulation results indicate that fixed designs that included the capture site showed negative survival bias, whereas fixed designs that excluded the capture site exhibited positive survival bias. The magnitude of the bias was dependent on movement and survival, where scenarios with high survival and frequent movement had minimal bias. In effort to help minimize bias, we developed a multistate version of the JLRLR and demonstrated reductions in survival bias compared to the single-state version for most designs. Our results suggest minimizing bias can be accomplished by: 1) using a random resight design when feasible and global sampling is not possible, 2) using the multistate JLRLR model when appropriate, 3) including the capture site in the resight sampling frame when possible, and 4) reporting survival as apparent survival if fixed sites are used for resight with the single state JLRLR model.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary dynamics with random payoff matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty, characterised by randomness and stochasticity, is ubiquitous in applications of evolutionary game theory across various fields, including biology, economics and social sciences. The uncertainty may arise from various sources such as fluctuating environments, behavioural errors or incomplete information. Incorporating uncertainty into evolutionary models is essential for enhancing their relevance to real-world problems. In this perspective article, we survey the relevant literature on evolutionary dynamics with random payoff matrices, with an emphasis on continuous models. We also pose challenging open problems for future research in this important area.</description>
