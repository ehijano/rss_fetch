      <title>The Shapley value and the strength of weak players in Big Boss games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Big Boss Games represent a specific class of cooperative games where a single veto player, known as the Big Boss, plays a central role in determining resource allocation and maintaining coalition stability. In this paper, we introduce a novel allocation scheme for Big Boss games, based on two classical solution concepts: the Shapley value and the $\tau$-value. This scheme generates a coalitionally stable allocation that effectively accounts for the contributions of weaker players. Specifically, we consider a diagonal of the core that includes the Big Boss's maximum aspirations, the $\tau$-value, and those of the weaker players. From these allocations, we select the one that is closest to the Shapley value, referred to as the Projected Shapley Value allocation (PSV allocation). Through our analysis, we identify a new property of Big Boss games, particularly the relationship between the allocation discrepancies assigned by the $\tau$-value and the Shapley value, with a particular focus on the Big Boss and the other players. Additionally, we provide a new characterization of convexity within this context. Finally, we conduct a statistical analysis to assess the position of the PSV allocation within the core, especially in cases where computing the Shapley value is computationally challenging.</description>

      <title>Optimal Modified Feedback Strategies in LQ Games under Control Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Game-theoretic approaches and Nash equilibrium have been widely applied across various engineering domains. However, practical challenges such as disturbances, delays, and actuator limitations can hinder the precise execution of Nash equilibrium strategies. This work explores the impact of such implementation imperfections on game trajectories and players' costs within the context of a two-player linear quadratic (LQ) nonzero-sum game. Specifically, we analyze how small deviations by one player affect the state and cost function of the other player. To address these deviations, we propose an adjusted control policy that not only mitigates adverse effects optimally but can also exploit the deviations to enhance performance. Rigorous mathematical analysis and proofs are presented, demonstrating through a representative example that the proposed policy modification achieves up to $61\%$ improvement compared to the unadjusted feedback policy and up to $0.59\%$ compared to the feedback Nash strategy.</description>

      <title>Efficient Lower Bounding of Single Transferable Vote Election Margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The single transferable vote (STV) is a system of preferential proportional voting employed in multi-seat elections. Each ballot cast by a voter is a (potentially partial) ranking over a set of candidates. The margin of victory, or simply 'margin', is the smallest number of ballots that need to be manipulated to alter the set of winners. Knowledge of the margin of an election gives greater insight into both how much time and money should be spent on auditing the election, and whether uncovered mistakes throw the election result into doubt -- requiring a costly repeat election -- or can be safely ignored without compromising the integrity of the result. Lower bounds on the margin can also be used for this purpose, in cases where exact margins are difficult to compute. There is one existing approach to computing lower bounds on the margin of STV elections, while there are multiple approaches to finding upper bounds. In this paper, we present improvements to this existing lower bound computation method for STV margins. The improvements lead to increased computational efficiency and, in many cases, to the algorithm computing tighter (higher) lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Reducing the Class-Dependent Effects of Data Augmentation with A Two-Player Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data augmentation is widely applied and has shown its benefits in different machine learning tasks. However, as recently observed, it may have an unfair effect in multi-class classification. While data augmentation generally improves the overall performance (and therefore is beneficial for many classes), it can actually be detrimental for other classes, which can be problematic in some application domains. In this paper, to counteract this phenomenon, we propose CLAM, a CLAss-dependent Multiplicative-weights method. To derive it, we first formulate the training of a classifier as a non-linear optimization problem that aims at simultaneously maximizing the individual class performances and balancing them. By rewriting this optimization problem as an adversarial two-player game, we propose a novel multiplicative weight algorithm, for which we prove the convergence. Interestingly, our formulation also reveals that the class-dependent effects of data augmentation is not due to data augmentation only, but is in fact a general phenomenon. Our empirical results over five datasets demonstrate that the performance of learned classifiers is indeed more fairly distributed over classes, with only limited impact on the average accuracy.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Games: A Framework for Bounded Perception in Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In everyday life, we frequently make coarse-grained judgments. When we say that Olivia and Noah excel in mathematics, we disregard the specific differences in their mathematical abilities. Similarly, when we claim that a particular automobile manufacturer produces high-quality cars, we overlook the minor variations among individual vehicles. These coarse-grained assessments are distinct from erroneous or deceptive judgments, such as those resulting from student cheating or false advertising by corporations. Despite the prevalence of such judgments, little attention has been given to their underlying mathematical structure. In this paper, we introduce the concept of coarse-graining into game theory, analyzing games where players may perceive different payoffs as identical while preserving the underlying order structure. We call it a Coarse-Grained Game (CGG). This framework allows us to examine the rational inference processes that arise when players equate distinct micro-level payoffs at a macro level, and to explore how Nash equilibria are preserved or altered as a result. Our key findings suggest that CGGs possess several desirable properties that make them suitable for modeling phenomena in the social sciences. This paper demonstrates two such applications: first, in cases of overly minor product updates, consumers may encounter an equilibrium selection problem, resulting in market behavior that is not driven by objective quality differences; second, the lemon market can be analyzed not only through objective information asymmetry but also through asymmetries in perceptual resolution or recognition ability.</description>
