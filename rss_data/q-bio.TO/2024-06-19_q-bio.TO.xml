      <title>Thrombogenic Risk Assessment of Transcatheter Prosthetic Heart Valves Using a Fluid-Structure Interaction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12156</link>

Abstract: Prosthetic heart valve interventions such as TAVR have surged over the past decade, but the associated complication of long-term, life-threatening thrombotic events continues to undermine patient outcomes. Thus, improving thrombogenic risk analysis of TAVR devices is crucial. In vitro studies for thrombogenicity are typically difficult to perform. However, revised ISO testing standards include computational testing for thrombogenic risk assessment of cardiovascular implants. We present a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) approach for assessing thrombogenic risk of prosthetic heart valves.
  An FSI framework was implemented via the incompressible computational fluid dynamics multi-physics solver of the Ansys LS-DYNA software. The numerical modeling approach for flow analysis was validated by comparing the derived flow rate of the 29-mm CoreValve device from benchtop testing and orifice areas of commercial TAVR valves in the literature to in silico results. Thrombogenic risk was analyzed by computing stress accumulation (SA) on virtual platelets seeded in the flow fields via Ansys EnSight. The integrated FSI-thrombogenicity methodology was subsequently employed to examine hemodynamics and thrombogenic risk of TAVR devices with two approaches: 1) engineering optimization and 2) clinical assessment.
  Our methodology can be used to improve the thromboresistance of prosthetic valves from the initial design stage to the clinic. It allows for unparalleled optimization of devices, uncovering key TAVR leaflet design parameters that can be used to mitigate thrombogenic risk, in addition to patient-specific modeling to evaluate device performance. This work demonstrates the utility of advanced in silico analysis of TAVR devices that can be utilized for thrombogenic risk assessment of other blood recirculating devices.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks in Histopathology: Emerging Trends and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Histopathological analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has seen a surge in the utilization of deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, CNNs often fall short in capturing the intricate spatial dependencies inherent in WSIs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a promising alternative, adept at directly modeling pairwise interactions and effectively discerning the topological tissue and cellular structures within WSIs. Recognizing the pressing need for deep learning techniques that harness the topological structure of WSIs, the application of GNNs in histopathology has experienced rapid growth. In this comprehensive review, we survey GNNs in histopathology, discuss their applications, and exploring emerging trends that pave the way for future advancements in the field. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of GNNs and their potential applications in histopathology. Leveraging quantitative literature analysis, we identify four emerging trends: Hierarchical GNNs, Adaptive Graph Structure Learning, Multimodal GNNs, and Higher-order GNNs. Through an in-depth exploration of these trends, we offer insights into the evolving landscape of GNNs in histopathological analysis. Based on our findings, we propose future directions to propel the field forward. Our analysis serves to guide researchers and practitioners towards innovative approaches and methodologies, fostering advancements in histopathological analysis through the lens of graph neural networks.</description>
