      <title>Stablecoin Runs and Disclosure Policy in the Presence of Large Sales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stablecoins have historically depegged due from par to large sales, possibly of speculative nature, or poor reserve asset quality. Using a global game which addresses both concerns, we show that the selling pressure on stablecoin holders increases in the presence of a large sale. While precise public knowledge reduces (increases) the probability of a run when fundamentals are strong (weak), interestingly, more precise private signals increase (reduce) the probability of a run when fundamentals are strong (weak), potentially explaining the stability of opaque stablecoins. The total run probability can be decomposed into components representing risks from large sales and poor collateral. By analyzing how these risk components vary with respect to information uncertainty and fundamentals, we can split the fundamental space into regions based on the type of risk a stablecoin issuer is more prone to. We suggest testable implications and connect our model's implications to real-world applications, including depegging events and the no-questions-asked property of money.</description>

      <title>Many learning agents interacting with an agent-based market model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07393v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics and the interactions of multiple reinforcement learning optimal execution trading agents interacting with a reactive Agent-Based Model (ABM) of a financial market in event time. The model represents a market ecology with 3-trophic levels represented by: optimal execution learning agents, minimally intelligent liquidity takers, and fast electronic liquidity providers. The optimal execution agent classes include buying and selling agents that can either use a combination of limit orders and market orders, or only trade using market orders. The reward function explicitly balances trade execution slippage against the penalty of not executing the order timeously. This work demonstrates how multiple competing learning agents impact a minimally intelligent market simulation as functions of the number of agents, the size of agents' initial orders, and the state spaces used for learning. We use phase space plots to examine the dynamics of the ABM, when various specifications of learning agents are included. Further, we examine whether the inclusion of optimal execution agents that can learn is able to produce dynamics with the same complexity as empirical data. We find that the inclusion of optimal execution agents changes the stylised facts produced by ABM to conform more with empirical data, and are a necessary inclusion for ABMs investigating market micro-structure. However, including execution agents to chartist-fundamentalist-noise ABMs is insufficient to recover the complexity observed in empirical data.</description>

      <title>Limit Order Book Dynamics and Order Size Modelling Using Compound Hawkes Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08927v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hawkes Process has been used to model Limit Order Book (LOB) dynamics in several ways in the literature however the focus has been limited to capturing the inter-event times while the order size is usually assumed to be constant. We propose a novel methodology of using Compound Hawkes Process for the LOB where each event has an order size sampled from a calibrated distribution. The process is formulated in a novel way such that the spread of the process always remains positive. Further, we condition the model parameters on time of day to support empirical observations. We make use of an enhanced non-parametric method to calibrate the Hawkes kernels and allow for inhibitory cross-excitation kernels. We showcase the results and quality of fits for an equity stock's LOB in the NASDAQ exchange and compare them against several baselines. Finally, we conduct a market impact study of the simulator and show the empirical observation of a concave market impact function is indeed replicated.</description>
