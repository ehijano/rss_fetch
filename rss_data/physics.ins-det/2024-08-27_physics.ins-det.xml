      <title>Lowering threshold of NaI(Tl) scintillator to 0.7 keV in the COSINE-100 experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: COSINE-100 is a direct dark matter search experiment, with the primary goal of testing the annual modulation signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA, using the same target material, NaI(Tl). In previous analyses, we achieved the same 1 keV energy threshold used in the DAMA/LIBRA's analysis that reported an annual modulation signal with 11.6$\sigma$ significance. In this article, we report an improved analysis that lowered the threshold to 0.7 keV, thanks to the application of Multi-Layer Perception network and a new likelihood parameter with waveforms in the frequency domain. The lower threshold would enable a better comparison of COSINE-100 with new DAMA results with a 0.75 keV threshold and account for differences in quenching factors. Furthermore the lower threshold can enhance COSINE-100's sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Sequential-Scanning Dual-Energy CT Imaging Using High Temporal Resolution Image Reconstruction and Error-Compensated Material Basis Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has been widely used to obtain quantitative elemental composition of imaged subjects for personalized and precise medical diagnosis. Compared with DECT leveraging advanced X-ray source and/or detector technologies, the use of the sequential-scanning data acquisition scheme to implement DECT may make a broader impact on clinical practice because this scheme requires no specialized hardware designs and can be directly implemented into conventional CT systems. However, since the concentration of iodinated contrast agent in the imaged subject varies over time, sequentially scanned data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally inconsistent. As existing material basis image reconstruction approaches assume that the data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally consistent, the violation of this assumption results in inaccurate quantification of material concentration. In this work, we developed sequential-scanning DECT imaging using high temporal resolution image reconstruction and error-compensated material basis image generation, ACCELERATION in short, to address the technical challenge induced by temporal inconsistency of sequentially scanned data sets and improve quantification accuracy of material concentration in sequential-scanning DECT. ACCELERATION has been validated and evaluated using numerical simulation data sets generated from clinical human subject exams and experimental human subject studies. Results demonstrated the improvement of quantification accuracy and image quality using ACCELERATION.</description>

      <title>Geometric Artifact Correction for Symmetric Multi-Linear Trajectory CT: Theory, Method, and Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For extending CT field-of-view to perform non-destructive testing, the Symmetric Multi-Linear trajectory Computed Tomography (SMLCT) has been developed as a successful example of non-standard CT scanning modes. However, inevitable geometric errors can cause severe artifacts in the reconstructed images. The existing calibration method for SMLCT is both crude and inefficient. It involves reconstructing hundreds of images by exhaustively substituting each potential error, and then manually identifying the images with the fewest geometric artifacts to estimate the final geometric errors for calibration. In this paper, we comprehensively and efficiently address the challenging geometric artifacts in SMLCT, , and the corresponding works mainly involve theory, method, and generalization. In particular, after identifying sensitive parameters and conducting some theory analysis of geometric artifacts, we summarize several key properties between sensitive geometric parameters and artifact characteristics. Then, we further construct mathematical relationships that relate sensitive geometric errors to the pixel offsets of reconstruction images with artifact characteristics. To accurately extract pixel bias, we innovatively adapt the Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) algorithm, commonly used in sound processing, for our image registration task for each paired symmetric LCT. This adaptation leads to the design of a highly efficient rigid translation registration method. Simulation and physical experiments have validated the excellent performance of this work. Additionally, our results demonstrate significant generalization to common rotated CT and a variant of SMLCT.</description>

      <title>Low-cost demonstration of the Zeeman effect: From qualitative observation to quantitative experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zeeman effect, a fundamental quantum phenomenon, demonstrates the interaction between magnetic fields and atomic systems. While precise spectroscopic measurements of this effect have advanced significantly, there remains a lack of simple, visually accessible demonstrations for educational purposes. Here, we present a low-cost experiment that allows for direct visual observation of the Zeeman effect. Our setup involves a flame containing sodium (from table salt) placed in front of a sodium vapor lamp. When a magnetic field is applied to the flame, the shadow cast by the flame noticeably lightens, providing a clear, naked-eye demonstration of the Zeeman effect. Furthermore, we conduct two quantitative experiments using this setup, examining the effects of varying magnetic field strength and sodium concentration. This innovative approach not only enriches the experimental demonstration for teaching atomic physics at undergraduate and high school levels but also provides an open platform for students to explore the Zeeman effect through hands-on experience.</description>

      <title>Mechanical design concept version 2.0 for the miniBeBe subsystem of the Multi-Purpose Detector at the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design of the mechanical structure of the miniBeBe detector, a subsystem of the Multi-Purpose Detector, soon to enter into operation at the Nuclotron based Ion Collider fAcility of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The miniBeBe detector was designed and is currently being developed by the MexNICA Collaboration to contribute to the level-zero trigger of the Time of Flight. The mechanical structure meets the requirements of minimizing the material budget and be free of ferromagnetic materials, without compromising its robustness. The design also allows easy module replacement for maintenance and overall removal at the end of the first stage of the experiment, without affecting the rest of the subsystems, to leave room for the installation of the Inner Tracking System. In addition, a Finite Element Method analysis of the mechanical components under load was performed. Based on this analysis, it was determined that the design meets the space constraints within the Multi-Purpose Detector, as well as a deformation of less than 1 mm with overall stress of less than 2 MPa, such that no material used in the design is at risk of mechanical failure during operation. A cooling system heat transfer analysis was performed showing that the detector Silicon Photo-Multipliers can be kept within a temperature range of 19$^{\circ}$C to 23$^{\circ}$C, which is adequate for their optimal performance.</description>
