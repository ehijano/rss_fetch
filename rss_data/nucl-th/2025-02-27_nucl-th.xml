      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo Calculations of neutron-$\alpha$ Scattering via an Integral Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear physics seeks to describe both bound and unbound states within a unified predictive framework. While coordinate-space Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods have successfully computed bound states for systems with $A \leq 12$, their application to unbound states remains limited. In this work, we extend the QMC approach to enable a broader range of unbound-state calculations. Our method infers long-range amplitudes in the wave function from integrals over the short-range interaction region. By evaluating these integrals using Green's Function Monte Carlo wave functions with the Argonne $v_{18}$ potential, we accurately reproduce existing results for neutron-alpha scattering. This approach provides a systematic pathway for studying more complex nuclear systems, including coupled-channel scattering and the effects of three-nucleon forces. It serves as a powerful tool for advancing $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations in nuclear reactions, paving the way for a unified framework that consistently describes both bound and scattering states within a single theoretical approach.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Calculations of the Carbon and Oxygen Isotopes: Energies, Correlations, and Superfluid Pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform \textit{ab initio} nuclear lattice calculations of the neutron-rich carbon and oxygen isotopes using high-fidelity chiral interactions. We find good agreement with the observed binding energies and compute correlations associated with each two-nucleon interaction channel. For the isospin $T=1$ channels, we show that the dependence on $T_z$ provides a measure of the correlations among the extra neutrons in the neutron-rich nuclei. For the spin-singlet S-wave channel, we observe that any paired neutron interacts with the nuclear core as well as its neutron pair partner, while any unpaired neutron interacts primarily with only the nuclear core. For the other partial waves, the correlations among the extra neutrons grow more slowly and smoothly with the number of neutrons. These general patterns are observed in both the carbon and oxygen isotopes and may be universal features that appear in many neutron-rich nuclei.</description>

      <title>Forbidden non-unique $\beta^{-}$ transitions and $g_A$-sensitive electron spectral-shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we have done a systematic study of beta decay properties such as electron spectral-shapes, shape factors, and log$ft$ values for the higher forbidden non-unique $\beta^{-}$ transitions in the mass region A = 85-123. We have performed the nuclear shell model (SM) calculations to explore the sensitivity of the electron spectral-shapes for different axial coupling constants $g_{A}=0.8-1.27$. The effective interactions GWBXG, G-matrix, SNET and SN100PN are used for different model spaces. In the present work, we have computed the electron spectral-shapes of $^{93}$Zr, $^{135}$Cs, $^{85}$Br, $^{85}$Br, $^{97}$Zr, $^{101}$Mo, $^{115}$Cd, $^{117}$Cd, $^{119}$In and $^{123}$Sn by constraining the small relativistic nuclear matrix element from conserved vector-current hypothesis (CVC). In the present study, we have found that the electron spectral-shapes are strongly dependent on $g_{A}$ except second forbidden non-unique $\beta^{-}$ transition $^{93}$Zr.</description>

      <title>Deuteron-Deuteron Interaction and Correlation Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between deuterons ($d$-$d$) is pivotal for comprehending the characteristics of certain light nuclei through the perspective of the deuteron cluster and achieving precise reproduction of $d$-$d$ fusion cross sections. In this work, we construct a new set of $d$-$d$ interactions by fitting the phase shifts using potentials parameterized in a Woods-Saxon shape. Then, the correlation functions are calculated with the obtained potential and compared with the recent measurements by the STAR collaboration. We find that the $d$-$d$ phase shifts and the correlation functions are internally consistent, confirming the feasibility of determining the $d$-$d$ interaction by the correlation functions. In addition, our fitted $d$-$d$ interactions validate the existence of bound states in the $^1S_0$ channel, which, along with the repulsive interaction in $^5S_2$, leads to the observed suppression in the measured correlation function. Moreover, we demonstrate that the $P$-wave contribution of the correlation functions cannot be neglected.</description>

      <title>Rescattering effects on spin-interference for $\rho^{0}$ photoproduction in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements by various experiments in ultra-peripheral collisions have observed spin-interference in $\rho^{0}$ photoproduction, marking a breakthrough in Fermi-scale quantum interference experiments. Building on this, STAR extended the measurement to hadronic heavy-ion collisions, where significant rescattering effects on $\rho^{0}$ mesons were expected. In this study, we investigate how these rescattering effects influence the measurement of spin-interference. By embedding $\rho^{0}$ mesons produced via photoproduction, modeled by the Vector Meson Dominance model, into the Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics framework, we estimate the impact on the $\cos2\phi$ and $\cos4\phi$ modulations, where $\phi$ is the angle between $\rho^{0}$ and one of the daughters' ($\pi^{\pm}$) transverse momentum. The results indicate a significant suppression of the $\cos2\phi$ modulation, while the $\cos4\phi$ modulation remains largely unaffected, which provides insight for understanding the difference due to rescattering effects between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions for $\rho^{0}$ photoproduction in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Firewall boundaries and mixed phases of rotating quark matter in linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rigidly rotating body in unbounded space is usually considered a pathological system since it leads to faster-than-light velocities and associated breaches of causality. However, numerical results on chiral symmetry breaking in rotating plasmas of interacting fermions reveal surprisingly close correspondence in predictions between rigorous bounded and formal unbounded approaches. Within the mean-field approach, we adopt three consecutive levels of approximation to the ground state of the system that feature a uniform (model 1), weakly-inhomogeneous (model 2) and fully inhomogeneus (model 3) condensates. Models 1 and 2 that do not take into account spatial gradients of the condensate, show agreement with the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. Model 3 exhibits a deviation from the Tolman-Ehrenfest prediction due to the appearance of a new energy scale set by the inhomogeneity of the ground state. Its boundary conditions are fixed by imposing regularity at the rotation axis and by demanding the global minimization of the grand potential. We dub the latter as ``firewall boundary conditions,'' translating into the requirement of vanishing condensate on the light cylinder, which follows from the fact that the system state formally diverges at the light cylinder. In all models, we present the phase diagram of the system and point out that in models 2 and 3, the system resides either in a chirally-restored phase, or in a mixed phase that possesses spatially-separated chirally-restored and chirally-broken phases.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium Polarization Kinetic Equation from Open Quantum Systems and Effective Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of polarization phenomena in relativistic heavy ion collisions have aroused a great interest in understanding dynamical spin evolution of the QCD matter. In particular, the spin alignment signature of $J/\psi$ has been recently observed in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC, which may infer nontrivial spin transport of quarkonia in quark gluon plasmas. Motivated by this, we study the spin-dependent in-medium dynamics of quarkonia by using the potential nonrelativistic QCD (pNRQCD) and the open quantum system framework. By applying the Markovian approximation and Wigner transformation, we systematically derive the Boltzmann transport equation for vector quarkonia with polarization dependence in the quantum optical limit. As opposed to the previous study for the spin-independent case where the collision terms depend on chromoelectric correlators, the new kinetic equation incorporates gauge invariant correlators of chromomagnetic fields that determine the recombination and dissociation terms with polarization dependence at the order we are working in the multipole expansion. In the quantum Brownian motion limit, the Lindblad equation with new transport coefficients defined in terms of the chromomagnetic field correlators have also been derived. Our formalism is generic and valid for both weakly-coupled and strongly-coupled quark gluon plasmas. It may be further applied to study spin alignment of vector quarkonia in heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Implications of {\sigma}-cut potential on Antikaon condensates in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of neutron stars with antikaon condensation in the framework of the Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) model with a $\sigma$-cut potential. The well-known RMF models, TM1 and TM1e, are used to analyze the structure and composition of neutron stars. The antikaon condensation part of the equation of state (EoS) is constrained from the experimental data of K$^{-}$ atomic and kaon-nucleon scattering. The $\sigma$-cut potential, which is known to make the EoS stiffer at high densities, is modulated by a free parameter $f_{s}$. Our present analysis suggests that one can obtain neutron star configurations heavier than 2$M_{\odot}$ with antikaon condensates in most cases for $f_{s}$ = 0.6. The antikaon phase transition is a second-order for $f_{s}$ = 0.6 for both TM1 and TM1e parameter sets. The calculated global properties of neutron stars with antikaon condensates i.e., mass and radius seem to be in resonable agreement with other theoretical and observational data.</description>

      <title>A hybrid model for multi-particle production and multi-fragment emission in electron-nucleus collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To present a prediction of the multi-particle production and multi-fragment emission in electron-nucleus ($eA$) collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), a simple hybrid model which is based on the multi-source thermal model and the ideal gas model is proposed in this article. According to the hybrid model, some statistical laws such as the two-component Erlang distribution and others are presented, which means a two-source production. These statistical laws are hopeful to describe the bulk properties of multiple particles produced in the scattering of electron-nucleon ($eN$) and multiple fragments emitted in the fragmentation of excited residual nucleus. Although both the scattering and fragmentation can occur in $eA$ collisions at the EIC, their two-sources are different. In $eN$ scattering, the multiple particles come from the soft excitation and hard scattering processes respectively, which are classified as two different types of events. In nuclear fragmentation, the multiple fragments come from the cold and hot sources which exist in the same excited nucleus.</description>

      <title>Proper Effective Temperature and Order Parameters in Relativistic Non-Equilibrium Steady States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the concept of temperature in non-equilibrium steady states. Using the D3-D5 model of gauge/gravity duality, we investigate spontaneous symmetry breaking in a relativistic (2+1)-dimensional defect moving at constant velocity within a (3+1)-dimensional heat bath. We find that the dependence of the order parameter on both the heat bath temperature and the defect velocity can be captured by a single variable -- the proper effective temperature -- for the moving defect. Our results suggest that the proper effective temperature is an essential parameter for a class of relativistic non-equilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Chiral Representation of the Nucleon Mass at Leading Two-loop Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the nucleon mass in a manifestly relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory up to the leading two-loop order. Through dimensional counting analysis, we perform the chiral expansion and verify the validity of the extended-on-mass-shell scheme at the two-loop level. As a result, we obtain the complete chiral representation of the nucleon mass up to $\mathcal{O}(p^5)$, which preserves the original analytic properties and satisfies the correct power counting. The obtained chiral result is well-suited for chiral extrapolation and provides an excellent description of lattice QCD data across a broad range of pion masses. We find that the $\mathcal{O}(p^5)$ contribution is small, approximately $10$ MeV, and varies only mildly with increasing pion mass, demonstrating good convergence of the nucleon mass up to pion masses of about 350 MeV at two-loop order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Bayesian analyses of heavy ion collision data have established a non-trivial temperature dependence of the shear and bulk viscosity per entropy. Motivated by this, we consider higher derivative corrections to realistic, bottom-up holographic models of quark-gluon plasma based on five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton theories and determine the dilaton potentials in the higher derivative terms by matching the Bayesian analyses. A byproduct of our analysis is the bulk viscosity that follows from the holographic V-QCD theory. Higher derivative corrections when treated perturbatively lead to tension with existing data. We investigate possible resolutions.</description>

      <title>Chiral vortical conductivities and the moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the chiral vortical conductivities, as well as the orbital and spin moment of inertia of a charged, chiral, and rigidly rotating free Fermi gas. To this purpose, we begin by calculating the vacuum expectation values of a vector and axial vector current using the free fermion propagator in this medium. This propagator is derived by employing the Fock-Schwinger method based on the solutions of the Dirac equation in the presence of rotation and finite axial chemical potential. We present a complete derivation of these solutions. We demonstrate that in the first approximation, the chiral vortical conductivity associated with the vector current is proportional to the product of the vector and axial chemical potentials. In contrast, the chiral vortical conductivity related to the axial vector current depends on the temperature, the vector, and the axial vector chemical potential squares. We use the relation between the axial vector current and the angular momentum density associated with spin to determine the spin and the orbital moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas in a charged and chirally imbalanced medium separately. In addition, we compute the total moment of inertia by utilizing the methods presented in the first part of the paper and show that the orbital moment of inertia of a free fermion gas vanishes.</description>

      <title>Topological Susceptibility in the Superconductive Phases of Quantum Chromodynamics: a Dyson-Schwinger Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test non-perturbative gluon propagators recently studied in the literature, by computing the topological susceptibility, $\chi$, of the superconductive phases of Quantum Chromodynamics at high density. We formulate the problem within the High-Density Effective Theory, and use the 2-particle irreducible formalism to compute the effective potential of the dense phases. We focus on superconductive phases with two and three massless flavors. Within this formalism, we write a Dyson-Schwinger equation in the rainbow approximation for the anomalous part of the quark propagator in the superconductive phases, in which the non-perturbative gluon propagator plays its role. We complete the model by adding a $U(1)_A$-breaking term whose coupling is fixed perturbatively at large quark chemical potential. We then use the effective potential to compute $\chi$ in the superconductive phases. We finally discuss implications of the results for the axion mass in superdense phases of Quantum Chromodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We have addressed here the problem of calculating the correlation function of a stable particle with a resonance, in particular one resonance that qualifies as a molecular state of two components. The formalism used requires to evaluate the scattering matrix of the stable particle with the molecule, a nuclear problem which we address by means of the fixed center approximation. We have applied the method to the interaction of a proton with the $f_1(1285)$ resonance, presently under investigation by the ALICE collaboration, where the $f_1(1285)$ is taken as a $K^*\bar{K}-\bar{K}^*K$ molecule. We find that the $p ~ f_1(1285)$ interaction develops a resonance state below the $p ~ f_1(1285)$ threshold, which leads to a depletion in the $p ~ f_1(1285)$ correlation function for small values of the proton momentum. The discussion presented shows that these type of studies can provide much information on the nature of some resonances and the existence of three-body bound states involving mesons and baryons.</description>

      <title>Work and heat exchanged during sudden quenches of strongly coupled quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How should one define thermodynamic quantities (internal energy, work, heat, etc.) for quantum systems coupled to their environments strongly? We examine three (classically equivalent) definitions of a quantum system's internal energy under strong-coupling conditions. Each internal-energy definition implies a definition of work and a definition of heat. Our study focuses on quenches, common processes in which the Hamiltonian changes abruptly. In these processes, the first law of thermodynamics holds for each set of definitions by construction. However, we prove that only two sets obey the second law. We illustrate our findings using a simple spin model. Our results guide studies of thermodynamic quantities in strongly coupled quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Spin correlation in two-proton emission from $^6$Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical evaluation of spin correlation in the two-proton ($2p$) radioactive emission. The three-body model of $^{6}$Be with the proton-proton interaction, which is adjusted to reproduce the experimental energy release, is utilized. Time-dependent calculation is performed to compute the coupled-spin state of the emitted two protons. The spin-correlation function $S$ as the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) indicator is evaluated as $|S| \cong 2.65$. Namely, the $2p$-spin correlation beyond the limit of local-hidden-variable (LHV) theory is suggested. This correlation is sensitive to the proton-proton interaction. The short-lived (broad-width) $2p$~state has the weaker spin correlation. In parallel, the core-proton interactions do not harm this correlation during the time-dependent decaying process. The CHSH measurement can be a novel probe into the effective nuclear interaction inside finite systems. Two-proton emitters can provide a testing field for identical-particle entanglement.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Bogoliubov many-body perturbation theory: closed-form constraint on the average particle number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bogoliubov many-body perturbation theory (BMBPT) relying on the breaking of U(1) global gauge symmetry has been recently formulated and applied to extend the applicability of standard perturbation theory to ab initio calculations of atomic nuclei away from shell closures. So far, practical applications have been limited to second-order calculations due to the lack of a generic algorithm to constrain the average particle number of the symmetry-broken state. This limitation is presently lifted and a general BMBPT formalism is presented that allows to constrain the particle-number expectation value at arbitrary order P. The constraint can be incorporated in closed form by solving a polynomial equation of degree P-1. The numerical procedure is illustrated through BMBPT(3) calculations of calcium isotopes using a nuclear Hamiltonian derived within chiral effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Frozen and $\beta$-equilibrated $f$ and $p$ modes of cold neutron stars: nuclear metamodel predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the chemical re-equilibration timescale is sufficiently long, the normal and quasi-normal mode frequencies of neutron stars should be calculated in the idealized limit that the internal composition of each fluid element is fixed over the oscillation period. However, many studies rely on a barotropic equation of state, which implicitly overlooks potential out-of-$\beta$-equilibrium effects. To investigate possible biases arising from this assumption, we calculate the non-radial fundamental ($f$) and first pressure ($p_1$) modes for a wide range of neutron star structures, each governed by different nucleonic equations of state. This ensemble is generated using the metamodel technique, a phenomenological framework that incorporates constraints from experimental nuclear physics and chiral effective field theory. The metamodel also provides the internal composition of $\beta$-equilibrated $npe\mu$ matter, allowing us to calculate oscillation modes beyond those supported by a purely barotropic fluid. Thus, we systematically assess the impact of assuming a barotropic equation of state across various equations of state and provide a distribution of expected $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequencies that may be detectable by next-generation gravitational wave interferometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-perturbative {\it ab initio} calculations of infinite nuclear matter using In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (IMSRG) method is developed in this work, which enables calculations with chiral two and three-nucleon forces at N$^2$LO and N$^3$LO. Results from the many-body perturbation theory at different orders and coupled-cluster theory are also presented for comparison. It is shown that different many-body approaches lead to obvious discrepancies with a harder nuclear interaction for both pure neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter. This work provides a novel alternative infrastructure for future studies of dense nuclear matter and strongly-correlated many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Kaon Modification in Pion Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kaon properties in thermal pion-nucleon medium are studied. The dense pion-nucleon medium is produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. The consideration is based on the chiral nucleon-kaon-pion Lagrangian. It is found that the pion medium does not produce a substantive contribution but enhances the effect of the baryon matter. Numerical estimate shows that this enhancement factor induced by the pion medium does not exceed 5% at the freeze-out stage of heavy-ion collisions, i.e. it is small. However, the impact of this enhancement can be higher in actual nuclear collisions because the effect of the in-medium (anti)kaon modification is accumulated during the (anti)kaon evolution before the freeze-out when the pion density is higher.</description>

      <title>Hybrid stars with large quark cores within the parity doublet model and modified NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the parity doublet model (PDM) for hadronic matter and a modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model for quark matter, we investigate the potential existence of two- and three-flavor quark matter in neutron star cores. Both models respect chiral symmetry, and a sharp first-order phase transition is implemented via Maxwell construction. We find stable neutron stars with quark cores within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. Typical neutron stars with masses around $1.4 \ M_\odot$ may possess deconfined quark matter in their centers. The hybrid star scenario with a two-flavor quark core offers enough parameter space to allow the neutron stars with large quark cores exceeding $\sim 1\ M_\odot$, and allow the early deconfinement position before $2\ \rho_0$, where $\rho_0$ is the nuclear saturation density. The observations of gravitational wave event GW170817 suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600\ \rm MeV$ in the PDM for scenarios involving three-flavor quark matter cores. The maximum mass of the hybrid star with a quark core is found to be approximately $2.2\ M_\odot$ for both two- or three-flavor quark matter in their centers.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the forward-backward asymmetry in $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03495v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the $C$-odd radiative corrections to $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$ in a dispersive formalism, concentrating on the leading pion-pole contribution in the virtual box diagrams. In particular, we show how the effect of a general pion vector form factor in the loop integral can be incorporated in a model-independent way and how the cancellation of infrared singularities proceeds in this case. The numerical results, dominated by the infrared enhanced contributions, indicate significant corrections beyond scalar QED, essentially confirming recent findings in generalized vector-meson-dominance models.</description>

      <title>The causal structure of the quark propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the causal structure of the quark propagator with the spectral DSE. The spectral gap equation is solved with the input of the spectral representation of the gluon and a causal STI-construction for the quark-gluon vertex. The latter includes a potential infrared enhancement of the vertex strength of the classical tensor structure that accommodates for the physical strength of chiral symmetry breaking. We find a critical vertex strength, below which the quark has a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation. While the nature of the first singularity does not change above the critical strength, we find that the quark propagator features at least two additional pairs of complex conjugate poles that are located approximately at the sum of quark pole mass and peak position of the quark-gluon coupling. These additional poles lead to violations of causality, if they persist in $S$-matrix elements. While the vertex strength of the classical tensor structure in full QCD is below the critical one, that of commonly used vertex models, which rely solely on the classical vertex structure, is typically above it. Finally, we discuss how these additional poles could be avoided in full QCD, where part of chiral symmetry breaking is generated by the other tensor structures in the quark-gluon vertex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars, representing the older neutron star population, are believed to have undergone a prolonged period of dark matter accumulation, resulting in a higher dark matter content. Their extreme rotation makes them unique laboratories for studying rapidly rotating neutron stars admixed with dark matter. In this work, we model uniformly rotating neutron stars with a dark matter component that rotates independently from the baryon matter, allowing for the investigation of both co-rotating and counter-rotating scenarios. We examine the impact of dark matter rotation on the macroscopic properties of neutron stars, including the mass-radius relation, the mass-shedding Keplerian limit, and moments of inertia, for various dark matter particle masses and total fractions, considering both core and halo distributions. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of how dark matter influences the equilibrium properties of rotating neutron stars, offering new insights into the astrophysical implications of self-interacting dark matter.</description>
