      <title>The dynamical memory of tidal stellar streams: Joint inference of the Galactic potential and the progenitor of GD-1 with flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar streams offer one of the most sensitive probes of the Milky Way`s gravitational potential, as their phase-space morphology encodes both the tidal field of the host galaxy and the internal structure of their progenitors. In this work, we introduce a framework that leverages Flow Matching and Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) to jointly infer the parameters of the GD-1 progenitor and the global properties of the Milky Way potential. Our aim is to move beyond traditional techniques (e.g. orbit-fitting and action-angle methods) by constructing a fully Bayesian, likelihood-free posterior over both host-galaxy parameters and progenitor properties, thereby capturing the intrinsic coupling between tidal stripping dynamics and the underlying potential. To achieve this, we generate a large suite of mock GD-1-like streams using our differentiable N-body code \textsc{\texttt{Odisseo}}, sampling self-consistent initial conditions from a Plummer sphere and evolving them in a flexible Milky Way potential model. We then apply conditional Flow Matching to learn the vector field that transports a base Gaussian distribution into the posterior, enabling efficient, amortized inference directly from stream phase-space data. We demonstrate that our method successfully recovers the true parameters of a fiducial GD-1 simulation, producing well-calibrated posteriors and accurately reproducing parameter degeneracies arising from progenitor-host interactions. Flow Matching provides a powerful, flexible framework for Galactic Archaeology. Our approach enables joint inference on progenitor and Galactic parameters, capturing complex dependencies that are difficult to model with classical likelihood-based methods.</description>

      <title>On the magnetic field evolution of interplanetary coronal mass ejections from 0.07 to 5.4 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central question for understanding interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) physics and improving space weather forecasting is how ICMEs evolve in interplanetary space. We have updated one of the most comprehensive in situ ICME catalogs to date, which now includes 1976 events from 11 space missions covering over 34 years, from December 1990 to August 2025. We have combined existing catalogs including magnetic obstacles and identified and added boundaries of an additional 807 (40.8%) events ourselves. With this catalog, we demonstrate the most extensive analysis to date of total ICME magnetic field values as a function of heliocentric distance. Parker Solar Probe has observed 6 ICMEs at $&lt; 0.23$ au (until April 2025), and Solar Orbiter and BepiColombo have added more events near 0.3~au, bridging the major observational gap towards the solar corona. Our main result is that a single power law can describe the evolution of the mean total magnetic field (exponent value of $k=-1.57$) and maximum field ($k=-1.53$) in the magnetic obstacle (MO), from 0.07 to 5.4 au. Extending the power law to the solar photosphere reveals a strong inconsistency with magnetic field magnitudes observed in the quiet Sun and active regions by 2 and 4 orders of magnitude, respectively. We introduce a multipole-type power law with two exponents, $k_1=-1.57$, and $k_2=-6$, relating the ICME magnetic field magnitude to an average solar active region field strength. These results present important observational constraints for the evolution of ICMEs from the Sun to the heliosphere.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Heat Flux in Quasi-Parallel Collisionless Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12423</link>

Abstract: Collisionless plasma shocks are a common feature of many space and astrophysical systems and are sources of high-energy particles and non-thermal emission, channeling as much as 20\% of the shock's energy into non-thermal particles. The generation and acceleration of these non-thermal particles have been extensively studied, however, how these particles feed back on the shock hydrodynamics has not been fully treated. This work presents the results of self-consistent hybrid particle-in-cell simulations that show the effect of self-generated non-thermal particle populations on the nature of collisionless, quasi-parallel shocks. They contribute to a significant heat flux density upstream of the shock. Non-thermal particles downstream of the shock leak into the upstream region, taking energy away from the shock. This increases the compression ratio, slows the shock down, and flattens the non-thermal population's spectral index for lower Mach number shocks. We incorporate this into a revised theory for the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions that include this effect and it shows excellent agreement with simulations. The results have the potential to explain discrepancies between predictions and observations in a wide range of systems, such as inaccuracies of predictions of arrival times of coronal mass ejections and the conflicting radio and x-ray observations of intracluster shocks.
  These effects will likely need to be included in fluid modeling to accurately predict shock evolution.</description>

      <title>Enhanced magnetostrophic waves with magnetic field orthogonal to the rotation axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an isolated Gaussian velocity vortex perturbation in an otherwise quiescent, electrically conducting, and rotating fluid permeated by a uniform magnetic field $\bf{B}$. Studies suggest a presence of strong azimuthal wave motions on the timescale of centuries within the Earth's liquid outer core at higher latitudes. To understand these long-period oscillations, we focus on magnetostrophic waves, a slow component of magnetic-Coriolis waves with $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned with the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, which replicate the field lines in the azimuthal direction. We present an analytical solution to the magnetic-Coriolis wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. Later, with numerical solution, we validate our analytical estimates and show that magnetostrophic waves travel relatively faster along the magnetic field when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$ compared with the case when both are aligned. The study confirms that with a magnetic field $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned to the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, wave vectors satisfying the condition $\bf{\Omega}\cdot\bf{k} \approx 0$, travel with Alfv\'en velocities along the magnetic field lines as a component of inertial-Alfv\'en waves. The timescales on which Alfv\'en waves travel are relatively short, and it is also less likely that inertial-Alfv\'en waves will be sustained inside the core at higher latitudes \citep{Davidson2017}. This study shows that, excluding the inertial-Alfv\'en waves contribution ($k_z\neq 0$), there exists intensified magnetostrophic wave propagation when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$, which can explain the strong periodic oscillations on the time scales of centuries along the azimuthal field at higher latitudes. Results show persistence of the magnetostrophic waves despite the lower Lehnert number $Le$, suggesting the plausible existence of a low-intensity azimuthal magnetic field in the Earth's core.</description>
