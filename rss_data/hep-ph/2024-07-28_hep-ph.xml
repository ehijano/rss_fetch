      <title>Regge trajectories for the triply heavy bottom-charm baryons in the diquark picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the explicit form of the Regge trajectory relations for the triply heavy bottom-charm baryons, which can be applied to investigate both the $\lambda$-mode excited states and the $\rho$-mode excited states. We estimate the masses of the $\lambda$-excited states and the $\rho$-excited states. The results are in agreement with other theoretical predictions. Both the $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories are discussed. Moreover, the behaviors of the $\lambda$- and $\rho$-trajectories for various baryons are discussed. It is shown that both the $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories for baryons are concave downwards in the $(M^2,\,x)$ plane. The Regge trajectories for the light baryons are approximately linear and become concave as the masses of the light constituents are considered.</description>

      <title>A complete survey of RGE induced leptogenesis in flavor symmetry scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature, motivated by the observed peculiar neutrino mixing pattern and a preliminary experimental hint for maximal Dirac CP phase (i.e., $\delta \sim 3\pi/2$), a lot of flavor and CP symmetries have been proposed to help us understand and explain these experimental results. However, for some flavor-symmetry scenarios (see section~3.1), the leptogenesis mechanism is prohibited to work as usual. To tackle this problem, in this paper we have made an exhausitive study on the possibility that the renormalization group evolution effect may induce a successful leptogenesis for these particular scenarios. Our study provides some complementarities to the previous related studies in Refs. [26, 27, 28] (see section~3.2).</description>

      <title>Collider and astrophysical signatures of light scalars with enhanced $\tau$ couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond Standard Model scenarios addressing the flavor puzzle and the hierarchy problem generally predict dominant new physics couplings with fermions of the third generation. In this Letter, we explore the collider and astrophysical signatures of new light scalar and pseudoscalar particles dominantly coupled to the $\tau$-lepton. The best experimental prospects are expected at Belle II through the $e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-\gamma\gamma$, $\tau^+\tau^-\gamma$, $3\gamma$, mono-$\gamma$ processes, and the $\tau$ anomalous magnetic moment. The correlated effects in these searches can unambiguously point toward the underlying new physics dynamics. Moreover, we study astrophysics bounds - especially from core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers - finding them particularly effective and complementary to collider bounds. We carry out this program in the well-motivated context of axion-like particles as well as generic CP-even and CP-odd particles, highlighting possible ways to discriminate among them.</description>

      <title>Complete Gravitational-Wave Spectrum of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-temperature plasma in the solar interior generates stochastic gravitational waves (GWs). Due to its significance as the primary source of high-frequency GWs in the solar system, we reexamine this phenomenon highlighting some physical processes, including the contribution of macroscopic hydrodynamic fluctuations. Our analysis builds upon several studies of axion emission from the Sun, particularly in relation to the treatment of plasma effects. Similar to many well-motivated Early Universe signals, we find that the resulting GW spectrum is several orders of magnitude below the current sensitivities of axion helioscopes such as (Baby)IAXO.</description>

      <title>Tetraquarks at large $M$ and large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tetraquarks in large $N$ QCD with heavy quarks, in the domain where non-relativistic quantum mechanics offers an adequate approximation. Within the regime of validity of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we systematically study and explicitly construct tetraquark states. At leading order in the $1/N$ expansion, the bound spectrum consists of free mesons, while the $1/N$ corrections give rise to a Born-Oppenheimer potential that can bind the mesons into tetraquarks. We find two different types of tetraquarks, each endowed with distinct color-spatial wavefunctions. These states arise in the presence of an $\mathcal{O}(N)$ mass hierarchy between the quarks and the antiquarks. We provide a quantitative argument indicating that only for such a hierarchy is the ground state of the system a tetraquark. We discuss what the extrapolation of our results to realistic values of the parameters may imply for the QCD tetraquark states.</description>

      <title>Do neutrinos bend? Consequences of an ultralight gauge field as dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ultralight gauge boson could address the missing cosmic dark matter, with its transverse modes contributing to a relevant component of the galactic halo today. We show that, in the presence of a coupling between the gauge boson and neutrinos, these transverse modes affect the propagation of neutrinos in the galactic core. Neutrinos emitted from galactic or extra-galactic supernovae could be delayed by $\delta t = \left(10^{-8}\textrm{--}10^1\right)$\,s for the gauge boson masses $m_{A'} = \left(10^{-23}\textrm{--}10^{-19}\right)$\,eV and the coupling with the neutrino $g= 10^{-27}\textrm{--}10^{-20}$. While we do not focus on a specific formation mechanism for the gauge boson as the dark matter in the early Universe, we comment on some possible realizations. We discuss model-dependent current bounds on the gauge coupling from fifth-force experiments, as well as future explorations involving supernovae neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Photon-likeness of hadron showers and impact of Lorentz boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the probability of proton-induced air showers at $E&gt;10$\,EeV being misidentified as photon-induced due to neutral pions receiving a major part of the primary energy in the first interaction, thereby enhancing the electromagnetic shower component by their $\pi^0 \to \gamma \gamma$ decay. Using CORSIKA simulations, we demonstrate the relevance of this effect at EeV energies. However, the probability for such photon-like events drops down strongly at the highest energies due to the increasing probability of Lorentz boosted $\pi^0$'s suffering hadronic interactions before decay. Different hadronic interaction models suggest that photon-like hadronic events may be observed at current UHECR observatories. A quantitative comparison of the observed number of background events found in recent photon searches published by the Pierre Auger Collaboration allows us conclude that the hypothesis of upwards fluctuations of $\pi^0$-production alone is insufficient to explain the data.</description>

      <title>Polarization of recoil electrons for testing time reversal violation in neutrino elastic scattering on polarized electron target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Possible symmetry breaking tests with respect to the time inversion in the elastic scattering of neutrinos on polarized electrons are considered, assuming that the incoming neutrino beam is either longitudinally or transversely polarized, and both momentum and polarization of recoil electrons are observed. In the process, in addition to the standard interaction, the exotic scalar, pseudoscalar and tensor interactions can participate. Due to the nonstandard interactions, different types of triple products in the cross section may appear. We consider several experiments in which mixed products built of the recoil electron polarization and two other vector quantities (incoming neutrino momentum, its polarization, polarization of the electron target and outgoing electron momentum) can be identified. The observation of these effects would unambiguously indicate noninvariance under time reversal and the presence of exotic interactions.</description>

      <title>Ordinary and exotic mesons in the extended Linear Sigma Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended Linear Sigma Model (eLSM) is a hadronic model based on the global symmetries of QCD and the corresponding explicit, anomalous, and spontaneous breaking patterns. In its basic three-flavor form, its mesonic part contains the dilaton/glueball as well as the nonets of (pseudo)scalar and (axial-)vector mesons, thus chiral symmetry is linearly realized. In the chiral limit and neglecting the chiral anomaly, only one term -- within the dilaton potential -- breaks dilatation invariance. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is implemented by a generalization of the Mexican-hat potential, with explicit symmetry breaking responsible for its tilting. The overall mesonic phenomenology up to 2 GeV is in agreement with the PDG compilation of masses and decay widths. The eLSM was enlarged to include other conventional quark-antiquark nonets (pseudovector and orbitally excited vector mesons, (axial-)tensor mesons, etc.), as well as two nonets of hybrid mesons, the lightest one with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{-+}$ not allowed for $\bar{q}q$ objects such as the resonance $\pi_1(1600)$ and the recently discovered $\eta_1(1855)$. In doing so, different types of chiral multiplets are introduced: heterochiral and homochiral multiplets, which differ in the way they transform under chiral transformations. Moreover, besides the scalar glueball, the tensor, the pseudoscalar and the vector glueballs were coupled to the eLSM: the scalar $f_0(1710)$ turns out to be mostly gluonic, the tensor glueball couples strongly to vector mesons, and the pseudoscalar glueball couples can be assigned to $X(2370)$ or $X(2600)$. The eLSM contains chiral partners on an equal footing and is therefore well suited for studies of chiral symmetry restoration at nonzero temperature and densities. The QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint were investigated within this framework.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Lorentz invariance violation from the CPT-even SME coefficients through a tensor interaction with cosmological scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous non-standard interactions between neutrinos and scalar fields have been suggested in the literature. In this work, we have outlined the case of tensorial neutrino non-standard interactions with scalar fields, which can be related to the effective CPT-even dimension-4 operators of the Standard Model Extension (SME). Moreover, in this paper, we have mostly analyzed the projected sensitivities to the CPT-even isotropic $c_{\alpha \beta}$ and $Z-$spatial $c_{\alpha \beta}^{ZZ}$ SME coefficients, in the context of a long-baseline experimental configuration. We study the particular case of DUNE and show its sensitivity to this type of new physics. The current IceCube experiment and upcoming neutrino experiments such as KM3NeT, IceCube-Gen2, and GRAND proposals may clarify these classes of neutrino non-standard interactions.</description>

      <title>Gluonic Hidden-charm Tetraquark States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new type of hybrid state, which consists of two valence quarks and two valence antiquarks together with a valence gluon, the gluonic tetraquark states, are investigated. Twenty-four currents of the the gluonic hidden-charm tetraquark states in $[\bar{3}_c]_{c q}\otimes[8_c]_{G}\otimes[3_c]_{\bar{c} \bar{q^\prime}}$ configuration are constructed, and their mass spectrum are evaluated in the framework of QCD sum rules with quantum numbers of $J^P=0^{+}$, $0^{-}$, $1^{-}$, and $1^{+}$. The nonperturbative contributions up to dimension 8 are taken into account. The results indicate that there may be exist 14 gluonic hidden-charm tetraquark states, and their corresponding hidden-bottom partners are also evaluated. The possible production and decay modes of the gluonic tetraquark states are analyzed, which are hopefully measurable in BESIII, BELLEII, PANDA, Super-B, and LHCb experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing exotic long-lived particles from the prompt side using the CONTUR method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method to derive constraints on new physics models featuring exotic long-lived particles using detector-corrected measurements of prompt states is presented. The CONTUR workflow is modified to account for the fraction of long-lived particles which decay early enough to be reconstructed as prompt, making it possible to determine how many of signal events would be selected in the Rivet routines which encapsulate the fiducial regions of dozens of measurements of Standard Model processes by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. New constraints are set on several popular exotic long-lived particle models in the early-decay regime, which is often poorly covered by direct searches. The probed models include feebly-interacting dark matter, hidden sector models mediated by a heavy neutral scalar, dark photon models and a model featuring photo-phobic axion-like particles.</description>

      <title>Next-to-Leading-Order QCD Predictions for the Nucleon Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We accomplish for the first time the next-to-leading-order QCD computations of the leading-twist contributions to the Dirac form factors of both the proton and the neutron by applying the hard-collinear factorization theorem rigorously. The resulting predictions for these baryon form factors indicate that the one-loop perturbative corrections to the hard-gluon-exchange contributions are numerically substantial for a wide range of momentum transfers accessible in the current and forthcoming collider experiments. Including further the (formally) power-suppressed soft contributions due to the celebrated Feynman mechanism, we then perform the state-of-the-art analysis of the Dirac electromagnetic nucleon form factors from first field-theoretical principles, thus allowing for the most robust determinations of the nucleon distribution amplitudes from the direct comparison with the experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>On the implications of the `cosmic calibration tension' beyond $H_0$ and the synergy between early- and late-time new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The `cosmic calibration tension' is a $&gt; 5\sigma$ discrepancy between the cosmological distance ladder built from baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) calibrated by the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM sound horizon ($r_s$) and Type Ia supernovae (SN1a) calibrated instead with the S$H_0$ES absolute magnitude, assuming the distance-duality relationship (DDR) holds. In this work, we emphasize the consequences of this tension beyond the value of the Hubble constant $H_0$, and the implications for physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM. Of utmost importance, it implies a larger physical matter density $\omega_m\equiv \Omega_m h^2$, as both the fractional matter density $\Omega_m$ and $h\equiv H_0/100$ km/s/Mpc are well constrained from late-time data. New physics in the pre-recombination era must thus be able to decrease $r_s$ while either reducing the value of $\Omega_m$, or increasing the value of $\omega_m$. Assuming a $\Lambda$CDM-like primordial power spectrum, this necessarily results in an increase in the clustering amplitude $\sigma_8$. Deviations from $\Lambda$CDM in the late-time expansion history cannot resolve the calibrator tension but can help relax the required shifts to the matter density and $\sigma_8$: it is in that sense that a combination of early and late-time new physics may help alleviate the tension. More precisely, models that modify the pre-recombination expansion history can accommodate the increase in $\omega_m$ without the need for additional modifications. It is those models which only affect recombination that require additional deviations at late-times to be successful. Hence, the `cosmic calibration tension' points either to a targeted modification of the pre-recombination expansion history, or to a broader change affecting multiple cosmic epochs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present new constraints on velocity-independent cross section of keV-scale mass annihilating Dark Matter particles obtained with SRG/ART-XC after 4 full-sky surveys. These constraints are derived from observations of the Milky Way Halo, 33 Local Group spheroidal dwarf (dSph) galaxies and separately for the dSph galaxy Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1. The constraints from the Milky Way Halo are the strongest among others and among all available in literature for this class of Dark Matter models with particle masses from 4 to 15 keV.</description>

      <title>Towards unveiling the large-scale nature of gravity with the wavelet scattering transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first application of the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) in order to constrain the nature of gravity using the three-dimensional (3D) large-scale structure of the universe. Utilizing the Quijote-MG N-body simulations, we can reliably model the 3D matter overdensity field for the f(R) Hu-Sawicki modified gravity (MG) model down to $k_{\rm max}=0.5$ h/Mpc. Combining these simulations with the Quijote $\nu$CDM collection, we then conduct a Fisher forecast of the marginalized constraints obtained on gravity using the WST coefficients and the matter power spectrum at redshift z=0. Our results demonstrate that the WST substantially improves upon the 1$\sigma$ error obtained on the parameter that captures deviations from standard General Relativity (GR), yielding a tenfold improvement compared to the corresponding matter power spectrum result. At the same time, the WST also enhances the precision on the $\Lambda$CDM parameters and the sum of neutrino masses, by factors of 1.2-3.4 compared to the matter power spectrum, respectively. Despite the overall reduction in the WST performance when we focus on larger scales, it still provides a relatively $4.5\times$ tighter 1$\sigma$ error for the MG parameter at $k_{\rm max}=0.2$ h/Mpc, highlighting its great sensitivity to the underlying gravity theory. This first proof-of-concept study reaffirms the constraining properties of the WST technique and paves the way for exciting future applications in order to perform precise large-scale tests of gravity with the new generation of cutting-edge cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Absorbing discretisation effects with a massive renormalization scheme: the charm-quark mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first numerical implementation of the massive SMOM (mSMOM) renormalization scheme and use it to calculate the charm quark mass. Based on ensembles with three flavours of dynamical domain wall fermions with lattice spacings in the range 0.11 -- 0.08 fm, we demonstrate that the mass scale which defines the mSMOM scheme can be chosen such that the extrapolation has significantly smaller discretisation effects than the SMOM scheme. Converting our results to the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme we obtain $\overline{m}_c(3\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.008(13)\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $\overline{m}_c(\overline{m}_c) = 1.292(12)\,\mathrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from a curvature-induced phase transition of a Higgs-portal dark matter sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of interactions between dark matter and the Higgs field opens an exciting connection between cosmology and particle physics, since such scenarios can impact the features of dark matter as well as interfering with the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry. Furthermore, such Higgs-portal models of dark matter should be suitably harmonised with the various epochs of the universe and the phenomenological constraints imposed by collider experiments. At the same time, the prospect of a stochastic gravitational wave background offers a promising new window into the primordial universe, which can complement the insights gained from accelerators. In this study, we examined whether gravitational waves can be generated from a curvature-induced phase transition of a non-minimally coupled dark scalar field with a portal coupling to the Higgs field. The main requirement is that the phase transition is of first order, which can be achieved through the introduction of a cubic term on the scalar potential and the sign change of the curvature scalar. This mechanism was investigated in the context of a dynamical spacetime during the transition from inflation to kination, while also considering the possibility for inducing electroweak symmetry breaking in this manner for a sufficiently low reheating temperature when the Higgs-portal coupling is extremely weak. We considered a large range of inflationary scales and both cases of positive and negative values for the non-minimal coupling, while taking into account the bound imposed by Big Bang Nucleosythesis. The resulting gravitational wave amplitudes are boosted by kination and thus constrain the parameter space of the couplings significantly. Even though the spectra lie at high frequencies for the standard high inflationary scales, there are combinations of parameter space where they could be probed with future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse theories that do not have a de Sitter vacuum and cannot lead to slow-roll quintessence, but which nevertheless support a transient era of accelerated cosmological expansion due to interactions between a scalar $\phi$ and either a hidden sector thermal bath, which evolves as Dark Radiation, or an extremely-light component of Dark Matter. We show that simple models can explain the present-day Dark Energy of the Universe consistently with current observations. This is possible both when $\phi$'s potential has a hilltop form and when it has a steep exponential run-away, as might naturally arise from string theory. We also discuss a related theory of multi-field quintessence, in which $\phi$ is coupled to a sector that sources a subdominant component of Dark Energy, which overcomes many of the challenges of slow-roll quintessence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a dispersion relation that allows to recover the phase of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion from its absolute value above threshold. Compared to alternative approaches building on the phase, this approach builds on experimental input directly accessible at colliders. Employing the precise datasets from the $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$ reaction, we obtain the phase of the electromagnetic form factor up to $2.5$~GeV, well beyond standard dispersive approaches. In addition, we separate the isovector and isoscalar components, that allows to extract the $P$-wave $\pi\pi$ phase shift. We also provide relevant results, including the radius of the form factor and bounds in the spacelike region. Last, but not least, the study assess potential systematic uncertainties from the interpolation method and potential zeros of the form factor.</description>

Abstract: We use the Belle data on the $K^- p$ mass distribution of the $\Lambda_c^+ \to p K^- \pi^+$ reaction near the $\eta \Lambda$ threshold to determine the $\eta \Lambda $ scattering length and effective range. We show that from these data alone we can determine the value of $a$ with better precision than so far determined, and the value of $r_0$ for the first time. The addition of the $K^- p \to \eta \Lambda$ data allows us to improve the precision of these magnitudes, with errors smaller than $15\%$. We also determine with high precision the pole position of the $\Lambda(1670)$.</description>

Abstract: We present quantum kinetic equations for neutrinos and derive Feynman rules for computing scattering rates involving coherent states. Our rules encompass both flavour- and particle-antiparticle coherence and allow writing down the scattering matrix elements and collision integrals with the same intuitive ease as with the usual non-coherent Feynman rules. Our results are useful for computing collision rates that arise routinely in the context of coherently mixing neutrinos with arbitrary masses. We give several explicit examples, including some collision integrals for coherently mixing neutrinos in supernovae.</description>

      <title>Vector Dark Matter from the 5-Dimensional Representation of $SU(2)_{L}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The introduction of electroweak multiplets that transform under any representation of the standard $SU(2)_L$ gauge group suggests the existence of electrically neutral stable particles capable of serving as cold dark matter in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. This paradigm, known as minimal dark matter, has primarily focused on spin-$0$ and spin-$1/2$ particles. We extend this study to the spin-1 case using the 5-dimensional real representation. We address unitarity concerns arising from the model's interactions with electroweak and Higgs fields of the Standard Model, investigating implications for dark matter relic density, direct and indirect detection, including non-perturbative Sommerfeld enhancement for the latter. Collider signatures of the proposed model are also examined. Our findings suggest that the model remains consistent with experimental constraints, particularly for dark matter masses on the order of dozens of TeV, and could potentially be tested using $\gamma$-ray observatories such as CTA.</description>

      <title>Z_5 two-component dark matter in the Type-II seesaw mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Z5 two-component dark matter model within the framework of the Type-II seesaw mechanism. Due to the new annihilation processes related to triplets, the light component cannot necessarily be dominant in the dark matter relic density, which is different from the Z5 two-component dark matter model in the SM. The model is considered to explain the excess of electron-positron flux measured by the AMS-02 Collaborations in this work, which is encouraged by the decay of the triplets arising from dark matter annihilations in the Galactic halo. We discuss the cases of the light and heavy components determining dark matter density within a viable parameter space satisfying relic density and direct detection constraints, and by fitting the antiproton spectrum observed in the PAMELA and AMS experiments, we find that the parameter space is flexible and the electron-positron flux excess can be obtained in both cases with the mass of two dark matter particles being larger than that of the triplets'.</description>

      <title>The Observation of a 95 GeV Scalar at Future Electron-Positron Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Large Electron Positron collider observed an indication for a new Higgs boson with a mass around $95$ GeV-$100$ GeV in 2003. The interest in this excess re-emerged with di-photon ($\approx$95 GeV), $WW$ and $\tau\tau$ signatures obtained by the Large Hadron Collider, leading to a combined global significance of $3.8\sigma$. We perform a feasibility study for discovering such a new scalar at future electron-positron colliders using the recoil-mass method applied to $e^{+} e^{-} \to ZS$ with $Z \rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ and $S \to b \bar{b}$. We employ a Deep Neural Network to enhance the separation between the Standard Model background and the signal, reducing the required integrated luminosity for a discovery by a factor of two to three. As a result, a $SU(2)_L$ singlet Higgs can be observed at a 250 GeV centre-of-mass energy collider and $5~{\rm ab}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity if it has a mixing angle of at least $0.2$ with the Standard Model Higgs. This further strengthens the physics case for future $e^+e^-$ accelerators, like CEPC, CLIC, FCC-ee and ILC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two most favored explanations of the Fermi Galactic Center gamma-ray excess (GCE) are millisecond pulsars and self annihilation of the smooth dark matter halo of the galaxy. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we would like to optimally use all information in the available data, including photon direction and energy information. To date, analyses of the GCE have generally treated directional and energy information separately, or have ignored one or the other completely. Here, we develop a method for analyzing the GCE that relies on simulation-based inference with neural posterior models to jointly analyze photon directional and spectral information while correctly accounting for the spatial and energy resolution of the telescope, here assumed to be the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Our results also have implications for analyses of the diffuse gamma-ray background, which we discuss.</description>

      <title>Transition dynamics in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model: Implications for bound cosmic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the predictions of $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, a novel framework suggesting a rapid anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) vacua transition in the late Universe, on bound cosmic structures. In its simplest version, the cosmological constant, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$, abruptly switches sign from negative to positive, attaining its present-day value at a redshift of ${z_\dagger\sim 2}$. The $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model emerges as a promising solution to major cosmological tensions, particularly the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, as well as other less definite tensions. A key aspect of our investigation is examining the impact of the abrupt $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model on the formation and evolution of bound cosmic structures. We identify three primary influences: (i) the negative cosmological constant (AdS) phase for $z &gt; z_\dagger$, (ii) the abrupt transition marked by a type II (sudden) singularity, leading to an abrupt increase in the universe's expansion rate at $z=z_\dagger$, and (iii) an increased expansion rate in the late universe under a positive cosmological constant for $z &lt; z_\dagger$, compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Utilizing the spherical collapse model, we investigate the non-linear evolution of bound cosmic structures within the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM framework. We find that the virialization process of cosmic structures, and consequently their matter overdensity, varies depending on whether the AdS-dS transition precedes or follows the turnaround. Specifically, structures virialize with either increased or reduced matter overdensity compared to the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM model, contingent on the timing of the transition. Additionally, our results demonstrate that the sudden singularity does not result in the dissociation of bound systems. Despite its profound nature, the singularity exerts only relatively weak effects on such systems, thereby reinforcing the model's viability in this context.</description>

      <title>Breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy in strong lensing mass modeling with weak lensing observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$), a crucial parameter in cosmology, quantifies the expansion rate of the universe so its precise measurement is important to understand the fundamental dynamics of our evolving universe. One of the major limitations of measuring $H_0$ using time-delay cosmography is the presence of the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in the lens mass modeling. We propose and quantitatively assess the use of galaxy-galaxy shear measurements to break the MSD in the strong lensing mass modeling. We use stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles and corresponding covariance matrices from Huang et al. (2022) to constrain the MSD in lens mass modeling with a highly flexible mass profile. Our analyses show that if ideally all galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey can be used to constrain the MSD, we can achieve $\sim 10\%$ precision on the MSD constraint. We forecast that galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from LSST-like surveys can in general constrain the MSD with $\sim 1-3\%$ precision. Furthermore, if we push weak lensing measurements to a lower angular scale of $\sim 0.04$ $\rm Mpc$, a survey like LSST can provide $\sim 1\%$ precision on the MSD constraint, enabling a measurement of $H_0$ at the $1\%$ level. We demonstrate that galaxy-galaxy weak lensing can robustly constrain the MSD independent of stellar kinematics of the deflector, with wide-field survey data alone.</description>

Abstract: We provide evidence for a correspondence between the formation of black holes and the stability of circular null geodesics around the collapsing perturbation. We first show that the critical threshold of the compaction function to form a black hole in radiation is well approximated by the critical threshold for the appearance of the first unstable circular orbit in a spherically symmetric background. We also show that the critical exponent in the scaling law of the primordial black hole mass close to the threshold is set by the inverse of the Lyapunov coefficient of the unstable orbits when a self-similar stage is developed close to criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compile a \emph{Fermi} sample of the \emph{long} GRB observations from 15 years of GBM catalogue with identified redshift, in which the GOLD sample contains 123 long GRBs at $z\le5.6$ and the FULL sample contains 151 long GRBs with redshifts at $z\le8.2$. The Amati relation (the $E_{\rm p,i}$-$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation) are calibrated at $z&lt;1.4$ by a Gaussian Process from the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) with the cosmic chronometers method so that GRBs at high-redshift $z\ge1.4$ can be used to constrain cosmological models via the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. From the cosmology-independent GRBs with the GOLD sample at $z\ge1.4$ and the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at $0.01&lt;z\leq2.3$, we obtain $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.354\pm0.018, H_0 = 73.05\pm0.2\,\rm{km/s/Mpc}$ for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model; $w_0 = -1.22^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$ for the flat $w$CDM model; and $w_{a} = -1.12^{+0.45}_{-0.83}$ for the flat Chevallier-Polarski-Linder model at the 1$\sigma$ confidence level. Our results with the GOLD and FULL sample are almost identical, which are more stringent than the previous results with GRBs.</description>

Abstract: Measuring gravitational interactions on sub-100-$\mu$m length scales offers a window into physics beyond the Standard Model. However, short-range gravity experiments are limited by the ability to position sufficiently massive objects to within small separation distances. Here we propose mass-loaded silicon nitride ribbons as a platform for testing the gravitational inverse square law at separations currently inaccessible with traditional torsion balances. These microscale torsion resonators benefit from low thermal noise due to strain-induced dissipation dilution while maintaining compact size (&lt;100$\,\mu$g) to allow close approach. Considering an experiment combining a 40$\,\mu$g torsion resonator with a source mass of comparable size (130$\,\mu$g) at separations down to 25$\,\mu$m, and including limits from thermomechanical noise and systematic uncertainty, we predict these devices can set novel constraints on Yukawa interactions within the 1-100$\,\mu$m range.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Waves as a probe of the unknown post-inflationary primordial Universe</title>

Abstract: One of the key predictions of the standard inflationary paradigm is the quantum mechanical generation of the transverse and traceless tensor fluctuations due to the rapid accelerated expansion of space, which later constitute a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The amplitude of the (nearly) scale-invariant inflationary tensor power spectrum at large scales provides us with crucial information about the energy scale of inflation in the case of the minimal inflaton coupling to gravity. Furthermore, the spectral energy density, $\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}(f)$, of the GWs at sufficiently small scales (or, large frequencies $f$) serves as an important observational probe of post-inflationary primordial dynamics. In fact, the small-scale spectral tilt, $n_{_{\rm GW}} = \frac{{\rm d}\log{\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}}}{{\rm d}\log{f}}$, of the spectral energy density of GWs is sensitive to the (unknown) post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $w$, of the universe; with a softer EoS ($w &lt; 1/3$) leading to a red tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &lt; 0$, while a stiffer EoS ($w &gt; 1/3$) resulting in a blue tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &gt; 0$. The post-inflationary dynamics, however, is generically expected to be quite complex, potentially involving a number of distinct phases. Hence, in this work, we discuss the possibility of multiple sharp transitions, namely $w_1 \to w_2 \to w_3 \to ... \to w_n$, in the EoS of the post-inflationary universe and compute the corresponding spectral energy density of the inflationary GWs. We explicitly determine the region of the parameter space $\lbrace{ w_1, \, w_2, \, w_3, ..., w_n\rbrace}$ which leads to a potentially detectable signal in the upcoming GW detectors, without violating the current constraints.</description>

      <title>Investigating tidal heating in neutron stars via gravitational Raman scattering</title>

Abstract: We present a scattering amplitude formalism to study the tidal heating effects of nonspinning neutron stars incorporating both worldline effective field theory and relativistic stellar perturbation theory. In neutron stars, tidal heating arises from fluid viscosity due to various scattering processes in the interior. It also serves as a channel for the exchange of energy and angular momentum between the neutron star and its environment. In the interior of the neutron star, we first derive two master perturbation equations that capture fluid perturbations accurate to linear order in frequency. Remarkably, these equations receive no contribution from bulk viscosity due to a peculiar adiabatic incompressibility which arises in stellar fluid for non-barotropic perturbations. In the exterior, the metric perturbations reduce to the Regge-Wheeler (RW) equation which we solve using the analytical Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) method. We compute the amplitude for gravitational waves scattering off a neutron star, also known as gravitational Raman scattering. From the amplitude, we obtain expressions for the electric quadrupolar static Love number and the leading dissipation number to all orders in compactness. We then compute the leading dissipation number for various realistic equation-of-state(s) and estimate the change in the number of gravitational wave cycles due to tidal heating during inspiral in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band.</description>
