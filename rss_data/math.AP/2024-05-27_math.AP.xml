      <title>A singular perturbation approach to the Dirichlet-area minimisation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study both one and two-phase minimisers of the Dirichlet-area energy $$E(v) = \int_{B_1} \vert\nabla v\vert^2 + Per(\{v&gt;0\},B_1).$$ In the two-phase case, we show that the energies $$E_{\varepsilon}(v) = \int_{B_1}\vert\nabla v\vert^2 + \frac{1}{\varepsilon}W\left(\frac{v}{\varepsilon^{1/2}}\right),$$ $\Gamma$-converge to $E$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$, where $W$ is the double well potential extended by zero outside of $[-1,1]$ . As a consequence, we show that bounded local minimisers of $E_{\varepsilon}$ converge to a local minimiser of $E$.</description>

      <title>Remarks on potential mean field games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this expository article, we give an overview of the concept of potential mean field games of first order. We give a new proof that minimizers of the potential are equilibria by using a Lagrangian formulation. We also provide criteria to determine whether or not a game has a potential. Finally, we discuss in some depth the selection problem in mean field games, which consists in choosing one out of multiple Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Quantitative stability of Sobolev inequalities on compact Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantitative stability results for different classes of Sobolev inequalities on general compact Riemannian manifolds. We prove that, up to constants depending on the manifold, a function that nearly saturates a critical Sobolev inequality is quantitatively $W^{1,2}$-close to a non-empty set of extremal functions, provided that the corresponding optimal Sobolev constant satisfies a suitable strict bound. The case of sub-critical Sobolev inequalities is also covered. Finally, we discuss degenerate phenomena in our quantitative controls.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Equations in Weak Oscillatory Thin Domains: Beyond Periodicity with Boundary-Concentrated Reaction Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the limit behavior of a family of solutions of the Laplace operator with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, set in a two-dimensional thin domain which presents weak oscillations on both boundaries and with terms concentrated in a narrow oscillating neighborhood of the top boundary. The aim of this problem is to study the behavior of the solutions as the thin domain presents oscillatory behaviors beyond the classical periodic assumptions,including scenarios like quasiperiodic or almost-periodic oscillations. We then prove that the family of solutions converges to the solution of a 1 dimensional limit equation capturing the geometry and oscillatory behavior of boundary of the domain and the narrow strip where the concentration terms take place. In addition, we include a series of numerical experiments illustrating the theoretical results obtained in the quasiperiodic context.</description>

      <title>A Gluing Problem for a Gauged Hyperbolic PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this project, we study the hyperbolic Abelian Higgs model in dimension $3$ at the critical coupling. The stationary solutions to the two-dimensional version of this equation have been found by Jaffe and Taubes, the so called $N$-vortex configurations. One can consider the space of all $N$-vortex configurations $M_N$ as a smooth Riemannian manifold. Stuart has proved that near the critical coupling regime, the dynamic in dimension $2$ can be approximated by a finite dimensional Hamiltonian system on the moduli space $M_2$, for suitable initial data. In this thesis, we study how to glue the $N$-vortex configurations to construct dynamical solutions in dimension $3$. Namely, we prove that if $q:[0,T)\times \mathbb{R}\to M_N$ is a wave map, then for $\epsilon&gt;0$ small enough, there exists a solution of the Abelian Higgs model in dimension $(1+3)$ on $[0,\frac{T_0}{\epsilon})\times \mathbb{R}^3$ for some $T_0&gt;0$ which is close to $(\phi,\alpha)(.;q(\epsilon t,\epsilon z))$ in terms of $\epsilon$, where $(\phi,\alpha)(.)$ denotes the variables of the corresponding $N$-vortex configuration. Furthermore, the other gauge field variables are small in terms of $\epsilon$. This dissertation has been supervised by Prof. Robert Jerrard.</description>

      <title>New type of solutions for the critical polyharmonic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following critical polyharmonic equation \begin{align*}%\label{abs} ( -\Delta)^m u+V(|y'|,y'')u=u^{m^*-1},\quad u&gt;0, \quad y=(y',y'')\in \mathbb{R}^3\times \mathbb{R}^{N-3},
  \end{align*} where $m^*=\frac{2N}{N-2m}$, $N&gt;4m+1$, $m\in \mathbb{N}^+$, and $V(|y'|,y'')$ is a bounded nonnegative function in $\mathbb{R}^+\times \mathbb{R}^{N-3}$. By using the reduction argument and local Poho\u{z}aev identities, we prove that if $r^{2m}V(r,y'')$ has a stable critical point $(r_0,y_0'')$ with $r_0&gt;0$ and $V(r_0,y_0'')&gt;0$, then the above problem has a new type of solutions, which concentrate at points lying on the top and the bottom circles of a cylinder.</description>

      <title>A blow-up result for the semilinear Euler-Poisson-Darboux-Tricomi equation with critical power nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a blow-up result for a generalized semilinear Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation with polynomially growing speed of propagation, when the power of the semilinear term is a shift of the Strauss' exponent for the classical semilinear wave equation. Our proof is based on a comparison argument of Kato-type for a second-order ODE with time-dependent coefficients, an integral representation formula by Yagdjian and the Radon transform. As byproduct of our method, we derive upper bound estimates for the lifespan which coincide with the sharp one for the classical semilinear wave equation in the critical case.</description>

      <title>On Bobkov-Tanaka type spectrum for the double-phase operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moving from the seminal papers by Bobkov and Tanaka \cite{BT,BT2,BT3} on the spectrum of the $(p,q)$-Laplacian, we analyze the case of the double-phase operator. We characterize the region of parameters in which existence and non-existence of positive solutions occur. The proofs are based on normalization procedures, the Nehari manifold, and the sub-super-solution technique, exploiting Picone-type inequalities and an ad-hoc strong maximum principle. As a byproduct, we give a full description on the spectrum in the case of the $(p,q)$-Laplacian for $p\in(1,2]$.</description>

      <title>Time-periodic solutions to heated ferrofluid flow models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we prove the existence of time-periodic solutions to a model describing a ferrofluid flow heated from below.
  Navier-Stokes equations satisfied by the fluid velocity are coupled to the temperature equation and the magnetostatic equation satisfied by the magnetic potential. The magnetization is assumed to be parallel to the magnetic field and is given by a non-linear magnetization law generalizing the Langevin law. The proof is based on a semi-Galerkin approximation and regularization methods together with the fixed point method.</description>

      <title>A strong approximation in L2 for the solutions of the Maxwell system with highly oscillating periodic coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Maxwell system on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with periodic and highly oscillating coefficients. It is known that the solutions converge in the weak-$\ast$ topology of $L^\infty(0,T;\,L^2(\mathbb{R}^3))$ to the solution of a similar problem with constant coefficients given as the $H$-limits of the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability respectively, i.e. the limit in the sense of the homogenization of linear elliptic equations with varying coefficients. However, it is not true that the elliptic corrector also provides a corrector for the solution of the Maxwell system, i.e. an approximation of the solutions in the strong topology of $L^2$. We shall prove that the oscillations in the space variable also produce oscillations in the time variable. We get a corrector consisting of adding to the elliptic corrector the sum of infinitely plane waves in the fast variable. Note that related results have been previously proved for the wave equation. Our proof is based on the two-scale convergence theory for almost periodic functions. One of the novelties is to show how this contains the classical Block decomposition.</description>

      <title>A finite difference scheme for smooth solutions of the general mKdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the mKdV model of shallow water out-flows. This generalization is a family of equations with nonlinear dispersion terms containing, in particular, KdV, mKdV, Benjamin-Bona-Mahony, Camassa-Holm, and Degasperis-Procesi equations. Nonlinear dispersion, generally speaking, implies instability of classical solutions and wave breaking in a finite time. However, there are special conditions under which the general mKdV equation admits classical solutions that are global in time. We have created an economic finite difference scheme that preserves this property for numerical solutions. To illustrate this we demonstrate some numerical results about propagation and interaction of solitons.</description>

      <title>On a multi-dimensional transport equation with nonlocal velocity and fractional dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate a multi-dimensional transport equation with nonlocal velocity and fractional dissipation.The balance between the nonlinearity and dissipation gives rise to three different cases, namely the subcritical, critical and supercritical ranges. We study those three cases and obtain a set of results containing local well-posedness, global smoothness, eventual regularity and finite-time blowup of smooth solutions.</description>

      <title>Understanding of linear operators through Wigner analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend Wigner's original framework to analyze linear operators by examining the relationship between their Wigner and Schwartz kernels. Our approach includes the introduction of (quasi-)algebras of Fourier integral operators (FIOs), which encompass FIOs of type I and II. The symbols of these operators reside in (weighted) modulation spaces, particularly in Sj\"ostrand's class, known for its favorable properties in time-frequency analysis. One of the significant results of our study is demonstrating the inverse-closedness of these symbol classes.
  Our analysis includes fundamental examples such as pseudodifferential operators and Fourier integral operators related to Schr{\"o}dinger-type equations. These examples typically feature classical Hamiltonian flows governed by linear symplectic transformations $S \in Sp(d, \mathbb{R})$. The core idea of our approach is to utilize the Wigner kernel to transform a Fourier integral operator $ T $ on $ \mathbb{R}^d $ into a pseudodifferential operator $ K$ on $ \mathbb{R}^{2d}$. This transformation involves a symbol $\sigma$ well-localized around the manifold defined by $ z = S w $.</description>

      <title>Global and local existence of solutions for nonlinear systems of time-fractional diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider initial-boundary value problems for two-component nonlinear systems of time-fractional diffusion equations with the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition and non-negative initial values. The main results are the existence of solutions global in time and the blow-up. Our approach involves the truncation of the nonlinear terms, which enables us to handle all local Lipschitz continuous nonlinear terms, provided their sum is less than or equal to zero. By employing a comparison principle for the corresponding linear system, we establish also the non-negativity of the nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>On the control of a simplified k-e model of turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the control of a kind of turbulent flows. We consider a simplified k-e model with distributed controls, locally supported in space. We proof that the system is partially locally null-controllable, in the sense that the velocity field can be driven exactly to zero if the initial state is small enough. The proof relies on an argument where we have concatenated several techniques: fixed-point formulation, linearization, energy and Carleman estimates, local inversion, etc. Ths result can be viewed as a nontrivial step towards the control of turbulent fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the initial-boundary value problem for a pseudo-parabolic equation in magnetic fractional Orlicz-Sobolev spaces. First, by employing the imbedding theorems, the theory of potential wells and the Galerkin method, we prove the existence and uniqueness of global solutions with subcritical initial energy, critical initial energy and supercritical initial energy, respectively. Furthermore, we prove the decay estimate of global solutions with sub-sharp-critical initial energy, sharp-critical initial energy and supercritical initial energy, respectively. Specifically, we need to analyze the properties of $\omega$-limits of solutions for supercritical initial energy. Next, we establish the finite time blowup of solutions with sub-sharp-critical initial energy and sharp-critical initial energy, respectively. Finally, we discuss the convergence relationship between the global solutions of the evolution problem and the ground state solutions of the corresponding stationary problem.</description>

      <title>Quantitative linear nondegeneracy of approximate solutions to strongly competitive Gross-Pitaevskii systems in general domains in $N\geq 1$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider strongly coupled competitive elliptic systems of Gross-Pitaevskii type that arise in the study of two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, in general smooth bounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N\geq 1$. As the coupling parameter tends to infinity, solutions that remain uniformly bounded are known to converge to a segregated limiting profile, with the difference of its components satisfying a limit scalar PDE. Under natural non-degeneracy assumptions on a solution of the limit problem, we show that the linearization of the Gross-Pitaevskii system around a 'sufficiently good' approximate solution does not have a kernel and obtain an estimate for its inverse with respect to carefully chosen weighted norms. Our motivation is the study of the persistence of solutions of the limit scalar problem for large values of the coupling parameter which is known only in two dimensions or if the domain has radial symmetry.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of axially-symmetric solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations in a finite cylinder $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3$. We assume that $v_r$, $v_\varphi$, $\omega_\varphi$ vanish on the lateral boundary $\partial \Omega$ of the cylinder, and that $v_z$, $\omega_\varphi$, $\partial_z v_\varphi$ vanish on the top and bottom parts of the boundary $\partial \Omega$, where we used standard cylindrical coordinates, and we denoted by $\omega =\mathrm{curl}\, v$ the vorticity field. We use estimates and $H^3$ Sobolev estimate on the modified stream function to derive three order-reduction estimates. These enable one to reduce the order of the nonlinear estimates of the equations, and help observe that the solutions to the equations is ``almost regular''. We use the order-reduction estimates to show that the solution to the equations remains regular as long as, for any $p\in (6,\infty)$, $\| v_\varphi \|_{L^\infty_t L^p_x}/\| v_\varphi \|_{L^\infty_t L^\infty_x}$ remains bounded below by a positive number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a survey article based on the content of the plenary lecture given by Jos\'e A. Carrillo at the ICIAM23 conference in Tokyo. It is devoted to produce a snapshot of the state of the art in the analysis, numerical analysis, simulation, and applications of the vast area of aggregation-diffusion equations. We also discuss the implications in mathematical biology explaining cell sorting in tissue growth as an example of this modelling framework. This modelling strategy is quite successful in other timely applications such as global optimisation, parameter estimation and machine learning.</description>

      <title>On the Phragm\'{e}n-Lindel\"{o}f and the superposition principles for the $p$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sub and supersolutions for the $p$-Laplace type elliptic equation of the form $$-\Delta_p u-V|u|^{p-2}u=0\quad\text{in $\Omega$},$$ where $\Omega$ is a radially symmetric domain in ${\mathbb{R}}^N$ and $V(x)\ge 0$ is a continuous potential such that the solutions of the equation satisfy the comparison principle on bounded subdomains of $\Omega$. In this work we establish a superposition principle and then use it to develop a version of a Phragm\'{e}n-Lindel\"{o}f comparison principle in the case $p\ge 2$. Moreover, by applying this principle to the case of Hardy-type potentials we recover and improve a number of known lower and upper estimates for sub and supersolutions.</description>

      <title>A parabolic PDE-based approach to Borell--Brascamp--Lieb inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a new PDE proof for the celebrated Borell--Brascamp--Lieb inequality. Our approach reveals a deep connection between the Borell--Brascamp--Lieb inequality and properties of diffusion equations of porous medium type pertaining to the large time asymptotics and preservation of a generalized concavity of the solutions. We also recover the equality condition in the special case of the Pr\'ekopa--Leindler inequality by further exploiting known properties of the heat equation including the eventual log-concavity and backward uniqueness of solutions.</description>

      <title>Approximation of arbitrarily high-order PDEs by first-order hyperbolic relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for constructing a first-order hyperbolic system whose solution approximates that of a desired higher-order evolution equation. Constructions of this kind have received increasing interest in recent years, and are potentially useful as either analytical or computational tools for understanding the corresponding higher-order equation. We perform a systematic analysis of a family of linear model equations and show that for each member of this family there is a stable hyperbolic approximation whose solution converges to that of the model equation in a certain limit. We then show through several examples that this approach can be applied successfully to a very wide range of nonlinear PDEs of practical interest.</description>

      <title>On the Obstacle Problem in Fractional Generalised Orlicz Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the one and the two obstacles problems for the nonlocal nonlinear anisotropic $g$-Laplacian $\mathcal{L}_g^s$, with $0&lt;s&lt;1$. We prove the strict T-monotonicity of $\mathcal{L}_g^s$ and we obtain the Lewy-Stampacchia inequalities. We consider the approximation of the solutions through semilinear problems, for which we prove a global $L^\infty$-estimate, and we extend the local H\"older regularity to the solutions of the obstacle problems in the case of the fractional $p(x,y)$-Laplacian operator. We make further remarks on a few elementary properties of related capacities in the fractional generalised Orlicz framework, with a special reference to the Hilbertian nonlinear case in fractional Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Positive solutions for a Kirchhoff problem of Brezis-Nirenberg type in dimension four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Kirchhoff problem of Brezis-Nirenberg type in a smooth bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^4$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our approach, novel in this framework and based upon approximation arguments, allows us to cope with the interaction between the higher order Kirchhoff term and the critical nonlinearity, typical of the dimension four. We derive several existence results of positive solutions, complementing and improving earlier results in the literature. In particular, we provide explicit bounds of the parameters $b$ and $\lambda$ coupled, respectively, with the higher order Kirchhoff term and the subcritical nonlinearity, for which the existence of solutions occurs.</description>

Abstract: For any $M, n \geq 2$ and any open set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ we find a smooth, strongly polyconvex function $F\colon \mathbb{R}^{M\times n}\to \mathbb{R}$ and a Lipschitz map $u\colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^M$ that is a weak local minimizer of the energy \[
  \int_{\Omega} F(Du). \] but with nowhere continuous partial derivatives. This extends celebrated results by M\"uller-Sver\'ak and Sz\'ekelyhidi to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Smoothing effects and extinction in finite time for fractional fast diffusions on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonnegative solutions to the Cauchy problem for the Fractional Fast Diffusion Equation on a suitable class of connected, noncompact Riemannian manifolds. This parabolic equation is both singular and nonlocal: the diffusion is driven by the (spectral) fractional Laplacian on the manifold, while the nonlinearity is a concave power makes the diffusion singular, so that solutions lose mass and may extinguish in finite time. Existence of mild solutions follows by nowadays standard nonlinear semigroups techniques, and we use these solutions as the building blocks for a more general class of so-called weak dual solutions, which allow for data both in the usual $L^1$ space and in a larger weighted space, determined in terms of the fractional Green function. We focus in particular on a priori smoothing estimates (also in weighted $L^p$ spaces) for a quite large class of weak dual solutions. We also show pointwise lower bounds for solutions, showing in particular that solutions have infinite speed of propagation. Finally, we start the study of how solutions extinguish in finite time, providing suitable sharp extinction rates.</description>

      <title>Quantitative phase mixing for Hamiltonians with trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove quantitative decay estimates of macroscopic quantities generated by the solutions to linear transport equations driven by a general family of Hamiltonians. The associated particle trajectories are all trapped in a compact region of phase-space and feature a non-degenerate elliptic stagnation point. The analysis covers a large class of Hamiltonians generated by the radially symmetric compactly supported equilibria of the gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system. Working in radial symmetry, our analysis features both the 1+2-dimensional case and the harder 1+1-dimensional case, where all the particles have the same value of the modulus of angular momentum. The latter case is also of importance in both the plasma physics case and two dimensional incompressible fluid flows.</description>

      <title>Some further progress for existence and boundedness of solutions to a two-dimensional chemotaxis-(Navier-)Stokes system modeling coral fertilization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects exerted by the interplay among Laplacian diffusion, chemotaxis cross diffusion and the fluid dynamic mechanism on global existence and boundedness of the solutions. The mathematical model considered herein appears as \begin{align}\left\{ \begin{array}{l} n_t+u\cdot\nabla n=\Delta n-\nabla\cdot( nS(n)\nabla c)-nm,\quad x\in \Omega, t&gt;0, \disp{ c_{ t}+u\cdot\nabla c=\Delta c-c+w},\quad x\in \Omega, t&gt;0, \disp{w_{t}+u\cdot\nabla w=\Delta w-nw},\quad x\in \Omega, t&gt;0,\\ u_t+\kappa(u \cdot \nabla)u+\nabla P=\Delta u+(n+m)\nabla \phi,\quad x\in \Omega, t&gt;0,\\ \nabla\cdot u=0,\quad x\in \Omega, t&gt;0,\\ \end{array}\right.\eqno(KSNF) \end{align} in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ with a smooth boundary, which describes the process of coral fertilization occurring in ocean flow. Here $\kappa\in \mathbb{R}$ is a given constant, $\phi\in W^{2,\infty}(\Omega)$and $S(n) $ is a scalar function satisfies $|S(n)|\leq C_S(1+n)^{-\alpha}$ {for all} $n\geq 0$ with some $C_S&gt;0$ and $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$. It is proved that if either $\alpha&gt;-1,\kappa=0$ or $\alpha\geq-\frac{1}{2},\kappa\in\mathbb{R}$ is satisfied,then for any reasonably smooth initial data, the corresponding Neumann-Neumann-Neumann-Dirichlet initial-boundary problem $(KSNF)$ possesses a globally classical solution. In case of the stronger assumption $\alpha&gt;-1,\kappa = 0$ or $\alpha&gt;-\frac{1}{2},\kappa \in\mathbb{R},$ we moreover show that the corresponding initial-boundary problem admits a unique global classical solution which is uniformly bounded on $\Omega\times(0,\infty)$.</description>

If one of the following cases holds:\\ (i) $N\geq4$ and $\alpha&gt;\frac{4N-4+N\sqrt{2N^2-6N+8}}{2N}$;\\ (ii) $N=3$, $\alpha&gt;2$, for any $\mu&gt;0$ or $\alpha=2$, the index $\mu$ should be suitably big;\\ (iii) $N=2$, $\alpha\geq2$, for any $\mu&gt;0$.\\ Without any restriction on the index $\xi$, for any given suitably regular initial data, the corresponding Neumann initial-boundary problem admits a unique global and bounded classical solution.</description>

      <title>Global existence for wave and beam equations with double damping and a new power nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for wave and beam equations with frictional, viscoelastic damping, and a new power nonlinearity. In addition to the solution and its total energy, we define the following quantity: $$Q[u](t):=\|u_{t}(t,\cdot)+(-\Delta)^{\sigma}u(t,\cdot)\|_{L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})}.$$
  Our aim is to show that the interaction between frictional and viscoelastic damping in a linear model leads to an exponential decay of $Q[u](t)$ as $t\to \infty$. This decay motivates us to define a new power nonlinearity of the form $N[u]:=|u_{t}+(-\Delta)^{\sigma}u|^{p}$. Surprisingly, $N[u]$ can be considered a small perturbation for any $p&gt;1$, in the sense that, the decay estimates of the unique global solution, the total energy and $Q[u](t)$ coincide with those for solutions to the corresponding linear Cauchy problem with vanishing right-hand side.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following nonlocal parabolic equation
  \begin{equation*}
  u_{t}-\Delta u=\left( \int_{\Omega}\frac{|u(y,t)|^{2^{\ast}_{\mu}}}{|x-y|^{\mu}}dy\right) |u|^{2^{\ast}_{\mu}-2}u,\ \text{in}\ \Omega\times(0,\infty),
  \end{equation*}
  where $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$, $0&lt;\mu&lt;N$ and $2^{\ast}_{\mu}=(2N-\mu)/(N-2)$ denotes the critical exponent in the sense of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality. We first introduce the stable and unstable sets for the equation and prove that the problem has a potential well structure. Next, we investigate the global asymptotic behavior of the solutions.
  In particular, we study the behavior of the global solutions that intersect neither with the stable set nor the unstable set.
  Finally, we prove that global solutions have $L^{\infty}$-uniform bound under some natural conditions.</description>

      <title>On the equilibrium solutions in a model for electro-energy-reaction-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-energy-reaction-diffusion systems are thermodynamically consistent continuum models for reaction-diffusion processes that account for temperature and electrostatic effects in a way that total charge and energy are conserved. The question of the long-time asymptotic behavior in electro-energy-reaction-diffusion systems and the characterization of their equilibrium solutions leads to a maximization problem of the entropy on the manifold of states with fixed values for the linear charge and the nonlinear energy functional. As the main result, we establish the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to this constrained optimization problem. Important ingredients in the proof are tools from convex analysis and a reduced version of the Lagrange functional. We also derive the time-dependent PDE system in the framework of gradient systems, and we discuss the relations between stationary states, critical points, and local equilibria.</description>

      <title>Global existence, fast signal diffusion limit, and $L^\infty$-in-time convergence rates in a competitive chemotaxis system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a chemotaxis system that includes two competitive prey and one predator species in a two-dimensional domain, where the movement of prey (resp. predators) is driven by chemicals secreted by predators (resp. prey), called mutually repulsive (resp. mutually attractive) chemotaxis effect. The kinetics for all species are chosen according to the competitive Lotka-Volterra equations for prey and to a Holling type functional response for the predator. Under the biologically relevant scenario that the chemicals diffuse much faster than the individual diffusion of all species and a suitable re-scaling, equations for chemical concentrations are parabolic with slow evolution of coefficient $0&lt;\varepsilon\ll 1$. In the first main result, we show the global existence of a unique classical solution to the system for each $\varepsilon$. Secondly, we study rigorously the so-called fast signal diffusion limit, passing from the system including parabolic equations with the slow evolution to the one with all elliptic equations for chemical concentrations, i.e. the limit as $\varepsilon \to 0$. This explains why elliptic equations can be proposed for chemical concentration instead of parabolic ones with slow evolution. Thirdly, the $L^\infty$-in-time convergence rates for the fast signal diffusion limit are estimated, where the effect of the initial layer is carefully treated. Finally, the differences between the systems with and without the slow evolution, and between the systems with one or two preys are discussed due to numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Global Well-posedness and Convergence Analysis of Score-based Generative Models via Sharp Lipschitz Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish global well-posedness and convergence of the score-based generative models (SGM) under minimal general assumptions of initial data for score estimation. For the smooth case, we start from a Lipschitz bound of the score function with optimal time length. The optimality is validated by an example whose Lipschitz constant of scores is bounded at initial but blows up in finite time. This necessitates the separation of time scales in conventional bounds for non-log-concave distributions. In contrast, our follow up analysis only relies on a local Lipschitz condition and is valid globally in time. This leads to the convergence of numerical scheme without time separation. For the non-smooth case, we show that the optimal Lipschitz bound is O(1/t) in the point-wise sense for distributions supported on a compact, smooth and low-dimensional manifold with boundary.</description>

      <title>On the fundamental theorem of submanifold theory and isometric immersions with supercritical low regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental result in global analysis and nonlinear elasticity asserts that given a solution $\mathfrak{S}$ to the Gauss--Codazzi--Ricci equations over a simply-connected closed manifold $(\mathcal{M}^n,g)$, one may find an isometric immersion $\iota$ of $(\mathcal{M}^n,g)$ into the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ whose extrinsic geometry coincides with $\mathfrak{S}$. Here the dimension $n$ and the codimension $k$ are arbitrary. Abundant literature has been devoted to relaxing the regularity assumptions on $\mathfrak{S}$ and $\iota$. The best result up to date is $\mathfrak{S} \in L^p$ and $\iota \in W^{2,p}$ for $p&gt;n \geq 3$ or $p=n=2$.
  In this paper, we extend the above result to $\iota \in \mathcal{X}$ whose topology is strictly weaker than $W^{2,n}$ for $n \geq 3$. Indeed, $\mathcal{X}$ is the weak Morrey space $L^{p, n-p}_{2,w}$ with arbitrary $p \in ]2,n]$. This appears to be first supercritical result in the literature on the existence of isometric immersions with low regularity, given the solubility of the Gauss--Codazzi--Ricci equations. Our proof essentially utilises the theory of Uhlenbeck gauges -- in particular, Rivi\`{e}re--Struwe's work [Partial regularity for harmonic maps and related problems, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 61 (2008)] on harmonic maps in arbitrary dimensions and codimensions -- and compensated compactness.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a complete inverse optimality study for a linearized tank-liquid system where the liquid is described by the viscous Saint-Venant model with surface tension and possible wall friction. We define an appropriate weak solution notion for which we establish existence/uniqueness results with inputs that do not necessarily satisfy any compatibility condition as well as stabilization results with feedback laws that are constructed with the help of a Control Lyapunov Functional. We show that the proposed family of stabilizing feedback laws is optimal for a certain meaningful quadratic cost functional. Finally, we show that the optimal feedback law guarantees additional stronger stability estimates which are similar to those obtained in the case of classical solutions.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Framework for Partial Differential Equation Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel variational quantum framework for partial differential equation (PDE) constrained design optimization problems. Such problems arise in simulation based design in many scientific and engineering domains. For instance in aerodynamic design, the PDE constraints are the conservation laws such as momentum, mass and energy balance, the design variables are vehicle shape parameters and material properties, and the objective could be to minimize the effect of transient heat loads on the vehicle or to maximize the lift. The proposed framework utilizes the variational quantum linear system (VQLS) algorithm and a black box optimizer as its two main building blocks. VQLS is used to solve the linear system, arising from the discretization of the PDE constraints for given design parameters, and evaluate the design cost/objective function. The black box optimizer is used to select next set of parameter values based on this evaluated cost, leading to nested bi-level optimization structure within a hybrid classical-quantum setting. We present detailed complexity analysis to highlight the potential advantages of our proposed framework over classical techniques. We implement our framework using the PennyLane library, apply it to solve a prototypical heat transfer optimization problem, and present simulation results using Bayesian optimization as the black box</description>

Abstract: The spectral properties of the restricted fractional Dirichlet Laplacian in ${\sf V}$-shaped waveguides are studied. The continuous spectrum for such domains with cylindrical outlets is known to occupy the ray $[\Lambda_\dagger, +\infty)$ with the threshold corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of the cross-sectional problems. In this work the presence of a discrete spectrum at any junction angle is established along with the monotonic dependence of the discrete spectrum on the angle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new type of gradient flow geometries over non-negative and probability measures motivated via a principled construction that combines the optimal transport and interaction forces modeled by reproducing kernels. Concretely, we propose the interaction-force transport (IFT) gradient flows and its spherical variant via an infimal convolution of the Wasserstein and spherical MMD Riemannian metric tensors. We then develop a particle-based optimization algorithm based on the JKO-splitting scheme of the mass-preserving spherical IFT gradient flows. Finally, we provide both theoretical global exponential convergence guarantees and empirical simulation results for applying the IFT gradient flows to the sampling task of MMD-minimization studied by Arbel et al. [2019]. Furthermore, we prove that the spherical IFT gradient flow enjoys the best of both worlds by providing the global exponential convergence guarantee for both the MMD and KL energy.</description>

Abstract: We present a new algorithm for the rigorous integration of the variational equation (i.e. producing $\mathcal C^1$ estimates) for a class of dissipative PDEs on the torus. As an application for some parameter value for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE on the line with odd and periodic boundary conditions we prove the existence of infinite number of homo- and heteroclinic orbits to two periodic orbits. The proof is computer assisted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates interface modes in a square lattice of photonic crystal composed of gyromagnetic particles with $C_{4v}$ point group symmetry. The study shows that Dirac or linear degenerate points cannot occur at the three high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone where two Bloch bands touch. Instead, a touch point at the M-point has a quadratic degeneracy in the generic case. It is further proved that when a magnetic field is applied to the two sides of an interface in opposite directions, two interface modes that are supported along that interface can be bifurcated from the quadratic degenerate point. The results provide a mathematical foundation for the first experiment realization of the integer quantum Hall effect in the context of photonics.</description>

Abstract: In a remarkable series of works, Guo, Phong, Song, and Sturm have obtained key uniform estimates for the Green's functions associated with certain K\"ahler metrics. In this note, we broaden the scope of their techniques by removing one of their assumptions and allowing the complex structure to vary.

      <description>arXiv:2405.17312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we are interested in studying Serrin's overdetermined problems in Riemannian manifolds. For manifolds endowed with a conformal vector field, we prove a Pohozoaev-type identity to show a Serrin's type rigidity result using the P-function approach introduced by Weinberger. We proceed with a conformal change to achieve this goal, starting from a geometric Pohozaev identity due to Schoen. Moreover, we obtain a symmetry result for the associated Dirichlet problem by using a generalized normalized wall shear stress bound.</description>

      <title>Finite Fractal Dimension of uniform attractors for non-autonomous dynamical systems with infinite dimensional symbol space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to find an upper bound for the box-counting dimension of uniform attractors for non-autonomous dynamical systems. Contrary to the results in literature, we do not ask the symbol space to have finite box-counting dimension. Instead, we ask a condition on the semi-continuity of pullback attractors of the system as time goes to infinity. This semi-continuity can be achieved if we suppose the existence of finite-dimensional exponential uniform attractors for the limit symbols. After showing these new results, we apply them to study the box-counting dimension of the uniform attractor for a reaction-diffusion equation, and we find a specific forcing term such that the symbol space has infinite box-counting dimension but the uniform attractor has finite box-counting dimension anyway.</description>

      <title>Weakly coupled Hamilton-Jacobi systems without monotonicity condition: A first step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.04885v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly focus on the existence of the viscosity solutions of \begin{equation*}
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  &amp;H_1(x,Du_1(x),u_1(x),u_2(x))=0,\\
  &amp;H_2(x,Du_2(x),u_2(x),u_1(x))=0.
  \end{aligned}
  \right. \end{equation*} The standard assumption for the above system is called the monotonicity condition, which requires that $H_i$ is increasing in $u_i$ and decreasing in $u_j$ for each $i,j\in\{1,2\}$ and $i\neq j$. In this paper, it is assumed that $H_i$ is either increasing or decreasing in $u_i$, and may be non-monotone in $u_j$. The existence of viscosity solutions is proved when \[\chi:=\sup_{u,v,w\in\mathbb R}\bigg|\frac{\partial_{u_2} H_1(x,0,0,u)}{\partial_{u_1} H_1(x,0,v,w)}\bigg|\cdot \sup_{u,v,w\in\mathbb R}\bigg|\frac{\partial_{u_1} H_2(x,0,0,u)}{\partial_{u_2} H_2(x,0,v,w)}\bigg|&lt;1.\] Then we consider \begin{equation*}
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  &amp;h_1(x,Du_1(x))+\Lambda_1(x)(u_1(x)-u_2(x))=c,\\
  &amp;h_2(x,Du_2(x))+\Lambda_2(x)(u_2(x)-u_1(x))=\alpha(c).
  \end{aligned}
  \right. \end{equation*} It turns out that for each $c\in\mathbb R$, there is a unique constant $\alpha(c)\in\mathbb R$ such that the above system has viscosity solutions. The function $c\mapsto \alpha(c)$ is non-increasing and Lipschitz continuous. In the appendix, the large time convergence of the viscosity solution of evolutionary weakly coupled systems is proved when $\chi&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Connection between a degenerate particle flow model and a free boundary problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.04416v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper a strongly degenerate parabolic equation derived from a density dependent particle flow model is studied. Furthermore, a free boundary problem and its connection to the strongly degenerate parabolic equation is investigated. First, it is shown that the strongly degenerate parabolic equation has a unique global bounded weak solution that converges towards a steady state for large time horizons. Two scenarios might occur: When the average density $\rho_{\infty}$ is larger than a certain critical density $\rho_{cr}$, the steady state coincides with $\rho_{\infty}$ and the convergence rate is exponential in the $L^2$ norm; while in the opposite case $\rho_{\infty}&lt;\rho_{cr}$, the steady state is unknown and the convergence is algebraic in a negative Sobolev seminorm. Further investigations show that for radially symmetric and decreasing initial data, the solution of the strongly degenerate parabolic equation can be constructed by using the solution of a corresponding free boundary problem. Moreover, the global existence of weak solutions to the latter problem is proved. Finally, numerical experiments in two space dimensions are presented, which show that segregation phenomena can appear when the initial average density is smaller than the critical density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a system of inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations that emerge in optical media with a $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity. This nonlinearity, whose local strength is subject to a cusp-shaped spatial modulation, $\chi^{(2)}\sim |x|^{-\alpha}$ where $\alpha &gt; 0$, can be induced by spatially non-uniform poling. Our first step is to establish a vectorial Gagliardo--Nirenberg type inequality related to the system. This allows us to identify the necessary conditions on the initial data that lead to the existence of global in time solutions. By exploiting the spatial decay at infinity of the nonlinearity, we demonstrate the non-radial energy scattering in the mass-supercritical regime for global solutions. These solutions have initial data that lie below a mass-energy threshold, regardless of whether the system is mass-resonant or non-mass resonant. Lastly, we provide the criteria for the existence of non-radial blow-up solutions with mass-critical and mass-supercritical nonlinearities in both mass and non-mass resonance cases.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and finite-time blow-up for the solution of a reaction-diffusion system of semilinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) subjected to a two-dimensional fractional Brownian motion given by
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  du_{1}(t,x)&amp;=&amp;\left[ \Delta_{\alpha}u_{1}(t,x)+\gamma_{1}u_{1}(t,x)+u^{1+\beta_{1}}_{2}(t,x) \right]dt
  &amp;\qquad \ \ +k_{11}u_{1}(t,x)dB^{H}_{1}(t)+k_{12}u_{1}(t,x)dB^{H}_{2}(t),
  du_{2}(t,x)&amp;=&amp;\left[ \Delta_{\alpha}u_{2}(t,x)+\gamma_{2}u_{2}(t,x)+u^{1+\beta_{2}}_{1}(t,x) \right]dt
  &amp;\qquad \ \ +k_{21}u_{2}(t,x)dB^{H}_{1}(t)+k_{22}u_{2}(t,x)dB^{H}_{2}(t),
  \end{eqnarray*}
  for $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d},\ t \geq 0$, along with 
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{array}{ll}
  u_{i}(0,x)=f_{i}(x), &amp;x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}, \nonumber
  \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
  where $\Delta_{\alpha}$ is the fractional power $-(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ of the Laplacian, $0&lt;\alpha \leq 2$ and $\beta_{i}&gt;0,\ \gamma_{i}&gt;0$ and $k_{ij}\geq 0, i,j=1,2$ are constants. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a global weak solution. Under the assumption that $\beta_{1}\geq \beta_{2}&gt;0$ with Hurst index $ 1/2 \leq H &lt; 1,$ we obtain the blow-up times for an associated system of random partial differential equations in terms of an integral representation of exponential functions of Brownian motions. Moreover, we provide lower and upper bounds for the finite-time blow-up of the above system of SPDEs and obtain the upper bounds for the probability of non-explosive solutions to our considered system.</description>

Abstract: We consider a state estimation problem for gas pipeline flow modeled by the one-dimensional barotropic Euler equations. In order to reconstruct the system state, we construct an observer system of Luenberger type based on distributed measurements of one state variable. First, we show the existence of Lipschitz-continuous semi-global solutions of the observer system and of the original system for initial and boundary data satisfying smallness and compatibility conditions for a single pipe and for general networks. Second, based on an extension of the relative energy method we prove that the state of the observer system converges exponentially in the long time limit towards the original system state. We show this for a single pipe and for star-shaped networks.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and stability of abstract thermoelastic delayed systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a stabilization problem of a generalized thermoelastic system (the so called $\alpha-\beta$ system) with delay in a part of the coupled system. For each case, we prove the well-posedness of the corresponding system using semigroup approach, then under some sufficient conditions we establish some results of exponential and polynomial stability of the system through a frequency-domain approach. The results are applied to concrete examples in thermoelasticity.</description>

      <title>A note on double Floquet-Bloch transforms and the far-field asymptotics of Green's functions tailored to periodic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general procedure to study double integrals arising when considering wave propagation in periodic structures. This method, based on a complex deformation of the integration surface to bypass the integrands' singularities, is particularly efficient to estimate the Green's functions of such structures in the far field. We provide several illustrative examples and explicit asymptotic formulae. Special attention is devoted to the pathological cases of degeneracies, such as Dirac conical points for instance.</description>

      <title>Regularity of the free boundaries for the two-phase axisymmetric inviscid fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the seminal paper (Alt, Caffarelli and Friedman, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 282, (1984).), the regularity of the free boundary of two-phase fluid in two dimensions via the so-called ACF energy functional was investigated. It was shown the $C^1$ regularity of the free boundaries and asserted that the two free boundaries coincide under some additional assumptions. Later on the standard technique of Harnack inequality could be applied to improve the regularity to $C^{1,\eta}$. A recent significant breakthrough in the regularity of two-phase fluid is due to De Philippis, Spolaor and Velichkov, who investigated the free boundary of the two-phase fluid with the two-phase functional (De Philippis, Spolaor and Velichkov, Invent. Math., 225, (2021).), and the $C^{1,\eta}$ regularity of the whole free boundaries was given in dimension two. Moreover, the free boundaries of the two-phase fluids do not coincide and the zero level set may process positive Lebesgue measure. In this paper, we consider the free boundaries for the two-phase axisymmetric fluid and show the free boundary is $C^{1,\eta}$ smooth. The Lebesgue measure of the zero level set of may also be positive, and the main difference lies in the degenerate elliptic operator and the free boundary conditions. More precisely, we use partial boundary Harnack inequalities and establish a linearized problem, whose regularity of the solutions implies the flatness decay of the two-phase free boundaries. Then the iteration argument gives the smoothness of the free boundaries.</description>

      <title>Illposedness of incompressible fluids in supercritical Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are strongly illposed in supercritical Sobolev spaces. In the inviscid case, for any $0 &lt; s &lt; \frac{5}{2} $, we construct a $C^\infty_c$ initial velocity field with arbitrarily small $H^{s}$ norm for which the unique local-in-time smooth solution of the 3D Euler equation develops large $\dot{H}^{s}$ norm inflation almost instantaneously. In the viscous case, the same $\dot{H}^{s}$ norm inflation occurs in the 3D Navier-Stokes equation for $0&lt; s &lt; \frac{1}{2} $, where $s = \frac{1}{2}$ is scaling critical for this equation.</description>

      <title>A least-squares Galerkin approach to gradient recovery for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with Cordes coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a conforming finite element method to approximate the strong solution of the second order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with Dirichlet boundary and coefficients satisfying Cordes condition. We show the convergence of the continuum semismooth Newton method for the fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Applying this linearization for the equation yields a recursive sequence of linear elliptic boundary value problems in nondivergence form. We deal numerically with such BVPs via the least-squares gradient recovery of Lakkis &amp; Mousavi [2021, arxiv:1909.00491]. We provide an optimal-rate apriori and aposteriori error bounds for the approximation. The aposteriori error are used to drive an adaptive refinement procedure. We close with computer experiments on uniform and adaptive meshes to reconcile the theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the existence and finite-time blow-up for the solution to a system of semilinear stochastic partial differential equations driven by a combination of Brownian and fractional Brownian motions. Under suitable assumptions, lower and upper bounds for the finite-time blow-up solution are obtained. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a global weak solution to the system. Further, a lower bound for the probability of the finite-time blow-up solution of the considered system is provided by using Malliavin calculus.</description>

      <title>Coercive second-kind boundary integral equations for the Laplace Dirichlet problem on Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new second-kind integral-equation formulations of the interior and exterior Dirichlet problems for Laplace's equation. The operators in these formulations are both continuous and coercive on general Lipschitz domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 2$, in the space $L^2(\Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ denotes the boundary of the domain. These properties of continuity and coercivity immediately imply that (i) the Galerkin method converges when applied to these formulations; and (ii) the Galerkin matrices are well-conditioned as the discretisation is refined, without the need for operator preconditioning (and we prove a corresponding result about the convergence of GMRES). The main significance of these results is that it was recently proved (see Chandler-Wilde and Spence, Numer. Math., 150(2):299-271, 2022) that there exist 2- and 3-d Lipschitz domains and 3-d starshaped Lipschitz polyhedra for which the operators in the standard second-kind integral-equation formulations for Laplace's equation (involving the double-layer potential and its adjoint) $\textit{cannot}$ be written as the sum of a coercive operator and a compact operator in the space $L^2(\Gamma)$. Therefore there exist 2- and 3-d Lipschitz domains and 3-d starshaped Lipschitz polyhedra for which Galerkin methods in $L^2(\Gamma)$ do $\textit{not}$ converge when applied to the standard second-kind formulations, but $\textit{do}$ converge for the new formulations.</description>

      <title>Validated integration of semilinear parabolic PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs) is an essential ingredient for studying the dynamics of the solutions. Indeed, simulations are at the core of scientific computing, but their mathematical reliability is often difficult to quantify, especially when one is interested in the output of a given simulation, rather than in the asymptotic regime where the discretization parameter tends to zero. In this paper we present a computer-assisted proof methodology to perform rigorous time integration for scalar semilinear parabolic PDEs with periodic boundary conditions. We formulate an equivalent zero-finding problem based on a variations of constants formula in Fourier space. Using Chebyshev interpolation and domain decomposition, we then finish the proof with a Newton--Kantorovich type argument. The final output of this procedure is a proof of existence of an orbit, together with guaranteed error bounds between this orbit and a numerically computed approximation. We illustrate the versatility of the approach with results for the Fisher equation, the Swift--Hohenberg equation, the Ohta--Kawasaki equation and the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation. We expect that this rigorous integrator can form the basis for studying boundary value problems for connecting orbits in partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Controlled Schemes for the Eigenvalue Problem of the Radiative Transfer Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The criticality problem in nuclear engineering asks for the principal eigen-pair of a Boltzmann operator describing neutron transport in a reactor core. Being able to reliably design, and control such reactors requires assessing these quantities within quantifiable accuracy tolerances. In this paper we propose a paradigm that deviates from the common practice of approximately solving the corresponding spectral problem with a fixed, presumably sufficiently fine discretization. Instead, the present approach is based on first contriving iterative schemes, formulated in function space, that are shown to converge at a quantitative rate without assuming any a priori excess regularity properties, and that exploit only properties of the optical parameters in the underlying radiative transfer model. We develop the analytical and numerical tools for approximately realizing each iteration step withing judiciously chosen accuracy tolerances, verified by a posteriori estimates, so as to still warrant quantifiable convergence to the exact eigen-pair. This is carried out in full first for a Newton scheme. Since this is only locally convergent we analyze in addition the convergence of a power iteration in function space to produce sufficiently accurate initial guesses. Here we have to deal with intrinsic difficulties posed by compact but unsymmetric operators preventing standard arguments used in the finite dimensional case. Our main point is that we can avoid any condition on an initial guess to be already in a small neighborhood of the exact solution. We close with a discussion of remaining intrinsic obstructions to a certifiable numerical implementation, mainly related to not knowing the gap between the principal eigenvalue and the next smaller one in modulus.</description>

      <title>Extended Flow Matching: a Method of Conditional Generation with Generalized Continuity Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of conditional generation is one of the most important applications of generative models, and numerous methods have been developed to date based on the celebrated flow-based models. However, many flow-based models in use today are not built to allow one to introduce an explicit inductive bias to how the conditional distribution to be generated changes with respect to conditions. This can result in unexpected behavior in the task of style transfer, for example. In this research, we introduce extended flow matching (EFM), a direct extension of flow matching that learns a ``matrix field'' corresponding to the continuous map from the space of conditions to the space of distributions. We show that we can introduce inductive bias to the conditional generation through the matrix field and demonstrate this fact with MMOT-EFM, a version of EFM that aims to minimize the Dirichlet energy or the sensitivity of the distribution with respect to conditions. We will present our theory along with experimental results that support the competitiveness of EFM in conditional generation.</description>

      <title>Flow by Gauss Curvature to the Orlicz Minkowski Problem for q-torsional rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem for torsional rigidity ($2$-torsional rigidity) was firstly studied by Colesanti and Fimiani \cite{CA} using variational method. Moreover, Hu, Liu and Ma \cite{HJ00} also studied this problem by method of curvature flows and obtain the existence of smooth even solutions. In addition, the Minkowski problem for $2$-torsional rigidity was also extended to $L_p$ version and Orlicz version.
  Recently, Hu and Zhang \cite{HJ2} introduced the concept of Orlicz mixed $q$-torsional rigidity and obtained Orlicz $q$-torsional measure through the variational method for $q&gt;1$.Specially, they established the functional Orlicz Brunn-Minkowski inequality and the functional Orlicz Minkowski inequality.
  Motivated by the forgoing works, we can propose the Orlicz Minkowski problem for $q$-torsional rigidity, and then confirm the existence of smooth non-even solutions to the Orlicz Minkowski problem for $q$-torsional rigidity with $q&gt;1$ by method of a Gauss curvature flow.</description>

Abstract: Given a conformal metric with finite total Q-curvature on $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\geq4$, we show that the sign of scalar curvature near infinity control not only the upper bound but also the lower bound of Q-curvature integral which is a new phenomenon. Meanwhile, for general complete non-compact four-manifolds with simple ends, we also obtain similar control of the lower bound of Q-curvature integral.</description>
