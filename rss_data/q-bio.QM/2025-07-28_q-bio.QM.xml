      <title>An Immune Infiltration-Based Risk Scoring System for Prognostic Stratification in Colorectal Adenocarcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with variable patient outcomes despite treatment advances. Traditional prognostic methods based on clinicopathological variables alone do not fully capture the biological complexity of the disease. This study aims to develop a risk scoring system based on genes associated with tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIIC-associated genes) to improve prognostic assessment in CRC.
  Methods: RNA-seq gene expression and clinicopathological data from TCGA-CRC (647 tumor samples, 51 normal tissues) were analyzed to identify differentially expressed TIIC-associated genes through comparison with the CIBERSORTx database. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to screen for prognostic markers. A Gaussian mixture model was applied to cluster prognostic models and select the model with the most robust gene combination. The resulting risk scoring system was validated in an external cohort (GSE39582) and integrated with clinicopathological variables to develop a prognostic nomogram.
  Results: From 128 TIIC-associated genes, an optimal prognostic model comprising CCL8 and TYR was identified. The risk score was calculated as 0.152*Exp(CCL8) - 0.516*Exp(TYR). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed significant survival differences between high-risk and low-risk groups in both TCGA-CRC (p &lt; 0.05) and GSE39582 (p &lt; 0.05). Time-dependent ROC analysis showed AUC values ranging from 0.605 to 0.696 for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival in TCGA-CRC and GSE39582. Multivariate Cox analysis identified TNM_T, TNM_N, and risk score as independent prognostic factors.
  Conclusion: Our risk scoring system based on CCL8 and TYR effectively stratifies CRC patients into distinct prognostic groups and could guide treatment decisions, particularly when integrated with TNM staging in a nomogram.</description>

      <title>The Morpho-Kinetic Landscape of Macrophage Modes During Wound Healing in Zebrafish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macrophages play an essential role in wound healing due to their dynamic nature and functional plasticity, exhibiting highly heterogeneous morpho-kinetic behaviors depending on their activation states. However, quantitative analysis of macrophage behavior in in vivo settings remains limited, largely due to the complexity of their diverse morphologies and motility patterns over time. In this study, we present an analytic workflow to investigate macrophage dynamics in zebrafish. By computing a comprehensive set of morpho-kinetic features, we observe that M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) macrophages exhibit distinct behaviors, such as reduced shape elongation, more directed movement, and less random-like motion in M1 compared to M2 macrophages. Based on these features, we classify macrophages in the transition period into M1-like and M2-like groups. We compare and analyze their behaviors, which allows us to estimate the timing of the phenotypic switch. In addition, macrophages not expressing Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) are located significantly farther from the wound compared to M1 macrophages. While macrophages unstimulated by wound signaling exhibit some M2-like features, they differ notably in shape elongation and migration speed. In summary, this study provides a quantitative analysis of macrophage behavior during wound healing and suggests distinct behavioral landscapes across different macrophage activation states.</description>

      <title>Design of radiotelemetry systems for animal tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the design and implementation of two low-cost, low-weight, radiotelemetry systems to measure the movement of small animals in a dense forest, where satellite positioning systems are unreliable and the attenuation of the vegetation poses several challenges. Both methods use stationary receiving stations that record the signal emitted by a portable transmitter carried by the animal. One of the methods measures the received power, while the other one registers the phase difference received by two-antennas stations. The later overcomes several difficulties that exist in the determination of the distance by the power method. We used our system to record the movement of Dromiciops gliroides, a vulnerable South American marsupial native of the Patagonian Andes, where it plays an important role in the ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Estimating Sensitivity Maps for X-Nuclei Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this research is to estimate sensitivity maps when imaging X-nuclei that may not have a significant presence throughout the field of view. We propose to estimate the coil's sensitivities by solving a least-squares problem where each row corresponds to an individual estimate of the sensitivity for a given voxel. Multiple estimates come from the multiple bins of the spectrum with spectroscopy, multiple times with dynamic imaging, or multiple frequencies when utilizing spectral excitation. The method presented in this manuscript, called the L2 optimal method, is compared to the commonly used RefPeak method which uses the spectral bin with the highest energy to estimate the sensitivity maps. The L2 optimal method yields more accurate sensitivity maps when imaging a numerical phantom and is shown to yield a higher signal-to-noise ratio when imaging the brain, pancreas, and heart with hyperpolarized pyruvate as the contrast agent with hyperpolarized MRI. The L2 optimal method is able to better estimate the sensitivity by extracting more information from the measurements.</description>

      <title>Physiological and Transcriptional Responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to Simulated Lunar and Martian Regolith Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of plant-based bioregenerative life support systems is a central objective in NASA's Moon to Mars strategy. Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism with extensive genomic resources, serves as a key species to investigate plant resilience in extraterrestrial environments. We assessed the physiological and gene expression responses of A. thaliana (Col-0) grown in two off-world regolith simulants: LHS-2 (lunar highlands) and MGS-1 (Martian global). Plants exposed to these substrates exhibited significant reductions in root elongation, biomass, and chlorophyll content, along with elevated anthocyanin levels and transcriptional upregulation of stress-related genes including IRT1, PCS1, SOD1, and JAZ1. Evidence of jasmonic acid pathway activation and auxin signaling suppression suggests metal-induced hormonal misregulation. Our integrated analysis of morphological traits, pigment accumulation, and transcriptomic profiles reveals distinct mineral-specific stress responses, offering critical insights into substrate engineering strategies for future space agriculture.</description>

      <title>Learning Causally Predictable Outcomes from Psychiatric Longitudinal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16629v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge, especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative, clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression and schizophrenia.</description>

      <title>Oligonucleotide selective detection by levitated optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals in sensitive optomechanical experiments. Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were functionalized using ZnCl$_2$ and 25-mers of single-stranded deoxyadenosine and deoxythymidine monophosphate which were optically trapped by a 1550 nm wavelength laser in vacuum. In the optical trap, SiNPs behave as harmonic oscillators, and their oscillation frequency and amplitude can be precisely detected by optical interferometry. The data was compared across particle types, revealing differences in frequency, width and amplitude of peaks with respect to motion of the SiNPs which can be explained by a theoretical model. Data obtained from this platform was analyzed by fitting Lorentzian curves to the spectra. Linear discriminant analysis detected differences between the functionalized and non-functionalized SiNPs. Random forest modeling provided further evidence that the fitted data were different between the groups. Transmission electron microscopy was carried out, but did not reveal any visual differences between the particle types</description>
