      <title>Sobolev and quasiconformal distortion of intermediate dimension with applications to conformal dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distortion of intermediate dimension under supercritical Sobolev mappings and also under quasiconformal or quasisymmetric homeomorphisms. In particular, we extend to the setting of intermediate dimensions both the Gehring--V\"ais\"al\"a theorem on dilatation-dependent quasiconformal distortion of dimension and Kovalev's theorem on the nonexistence of metric spaces with conformal dimension strictly between zero and one. Applications include new contributions to the quasiconformal classification of Euclidean sets and a new sufficient condition for the vanishing of conformal box-counting dimension. We illustrate our conclusions with specific consequences for Bedford--McMullen carpets, samples of Mandelbrot percolation, and product sets containing a polynomially convergent sequence factor.</description>

      <title>Failure of the measure contraction property via quotients in higher-step sub-Riemannian structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the synthetic Ricci curvature lower bound known as the measure contraction property (MCP) for sub-Riemannian structures beyond step two. We show that whenever the distance function is not Lipschitz in charts, the MCP may fail. This occurs already in fundamental examples such as the Martinet and Engel structures.
  Central to our analysis are new results on the stability of the local MCP under quotients by isometric group actions for general metric measure spaces, developed under a weaker variant of the essential non-branching condition which, in contrast with the classical one, is implied by the minimizing Sard property in sub-Riemannian geometry.
  Since the MCP is preserved under blow-ups, we focus on Carnot homogeneous spaces, proving that MCP descends to suitable quotients. As a byproduct, any structure whose tangent at some point admits a quotient to Martinet fails the MCP. We also obtain a computation-free proof that the Grushin plane shares the Heisenberg group's MCP. Applications include a detailed analysis of validity and failure of the MCP for Carnot groups of low dimension.
  Our results suggest a conjecture on the failure of the MCP in presence of Goh abnormal geodesics satisfying the strong generalized Legendre condition.</description>

      <title>Korevaar-Schoen and heat kernel characterizations of Sobolev and BV spaces on local trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Sobolev and BV spaces on local trees which are metric spaces locally isometric to real trees. Such spaces are equipped with a Radon measure satisfying a locally uniform volume growth condition. Using the intrinsic geodesic structure, we define weak gradients and develop from it a coherent theory of Sobolev and BV spaces. We provide two main characterizations: one via Korevaar-Schoen-type energy functionals and another via the heat kernel associated with the natural Dirichlet form. Applications include interpolation results for Besov-Lipschitz spaces, critical exponents computations, and a Nash inequality. In globally tree-like settings we also establish $L^p$ gradient bounds for the heat semigroup.</description>

      <title>Converting non-periodic tilings with Tile(1, 1) into tilings with three types of pentagons, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-periodic tilings with Tile(1, 1) using the substitution method, as presented by Smith et al. in [2] and [3], can be converted into non-periodic tilings with three types of pentagons. When arbitrary replacements are excluded, the resulting non-periodic tilings with three types of pentagons exhibit two patterns. Note that, during the conversion process in this manuscript, the rhombus is not subdivided into smaller similar rhombuses.</description>

      <title>An in-depth study of ball-bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the class of so called `ball-bodies' in ${\mathbb R}^n$, given by intersections of translates of Euclidean unit balls (or, equivalently, summand of the Euclidean ball). We study the class along with the natural duality operator defined on it. The class is naturally linked to many interesting problems in convex geometry, including bodies of constant width and the Knesser-Poulsen conjecture. We discuss old and new inequalities of isoperimetric type and of Santal\'{o} type, in this class. We study the boundary structure of bodies in the class, Carath\'eodory type theorem and curvature relations. We discuss various symmetrizations with relation to this class, and make some first steps regarding problems for bodies of constant width.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and topology of the Hat family of tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered Hat tiling admits a 4-dimensional family of shape deformations, including the 1-parameter family already known to yield alternate monotiles. The continuous hulls resulting from these tilings are all topologically conjugate dynamical systems, and hence have the same dynamics and topology. We construct and analyze a self-similar element of this family called the CAP tiling, and we use it to derive properties of the entire family. The CAP tiling has pure-point dynamical spectrum, which we compute explicitly, and comes from a natural cut-and-project scheme with 2-dimensional Euclidean internal space. All other members of the Hat family, in particular the original version constructed from 30-60-90 right triangles, are obtained via small modifications of the projection from this cut-and-project scheme.</description>

      <title>Proper Minor-Closed Classes of Graphs have Assouad-Nagata Dimension 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic dimension and Assouad-Nagata dimension are measures of the large-scale shape of a class of graphs. Bonamy, Bousquet, Esperet, Groenland, Liu, Pirot, and Scott [J. Eur. Math. Society] showed that any proper minor-closed class has asymptotic dimension 2, dropping to 1 only if the treewidth is bounded. We improve this result by showing it also holds for the stricter Assouad-Nagata dimension. We also characterise when subdivision-closed classes of graphs have bounded Assouad-Nagata dimension.</description>
