      <title>Quantifying A Firm's AI Engagement: Constructing Objective, Data-Driven, AI Stock Indices Using 10-K Filings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01763</link>

Abstract: Following an analysis of existing AI-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs), we reveal the selection criteria for determining which stocks qualify as AI-related are often opaque and rely on vague phrases and subjective judgments. This paper proposes a new, objective, data-driven approach using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify AI stocks by analyzing annual 10-K filings from 3,395 NASDAQ-listed firms between 2011 and 2023. This analysis quantifies each company's engagement with AI through binary indicators and weighted AI scores based on the frequency and context of AI-related terms. Using these metrics, we construct four AI stock indices-the Equally Weighted AI Index (AII), the Size-Weighted AI Index (SAII), and two Time-Discounted AI Indices (TAII05 and TAII5X)-offering different perspectives on AI investment. We validate our methodology through an event study on the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, demonstrating that companies with higher AI engagement saw significantly greater positive abnormal returns, with analyses supporting the predictive power of our AI measures. Our indices perform on par with or surpass 14 existing AI-themed ETFs and the Nasdaq Composite Index in risk-return profiles, market responsiveness, and overall performance, achieving higher average daily returns and risk-adjusted metrics without increased volatility. These results suggest our NLP-based approach offers a reliable, market-responsive, and cost-effective alternative to existing AI-related ETF products. Our innovative methodology can also guide investors, asset managers, and policymakers in using corporate data to construct other thematic portfolios, contributing to a more transparent, data-driven, and competitive approach.</description>

      <title>Empirical Asset Pricing via Ensemble Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an ensemble learning method based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for predicting conditional expected stock returns given stock-level and macro-economic information. Our ensemble learning approach significantly reduces the computational complexity inherent in GPR inference and lends itself to general online learning tasks. We conduct an empirical analysis on a large cross-section of US stocks from 1962 to 2016. We find that our method dominates existing machine learning models statistically and economically in terms of out-of-sample $R$-squared and Sharpe ratio of prediction-sorted portfolios. Exploiting the Bayesian nature of GPR, we introduce the mean-variance optimal portfolio with respect to the prediction uncertainty distribution of the expected stock returns. It appeals to an uncertainty averse investor and significantly dominates the equal- and value-weighted prediction-sorted portfolios, which outperform the S&amp;P 500.</description>
