      <title>Geometric, Variational, and Bracket Descriptions of Fluid Motion with Open Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Lie group geometric framework for the motion of fluids with permeable boundaries that extends Arnold's geometric description of fluid in closed domains. Our setting is based on the classical Hamilton principle applied to fluid trajectories, appropriately amended to incorporate bulk and boundary forces via a Lagrange-d'Alembert approach, and to take into account only the fluid particles present in the fluid domain at a given time. By applying a reduction by relabelling symmetries, we deduce a variational formulation in the Eulerian description that extends the Euler-Poincar\'e framework to open fluids. On the Hamiltonian side, our approach yields a bracket formulation that consistently extends the Lie-Poisson bracket of fluid dynamics and contains as a particular case a bulk+boundary bracket formulation proposed earlier. We illustrate the geometric framework with several examples, and also consider the extension of this setting to include multicomponent fluids, the consideration of general advected quantities, the analysis of higher-order fluids, and the incorporation of boundary stresses. Open fluids are found in a wide range of physical systems, including geophysical fluid dynamics, porous media, incompressible flow and magnetohydrodynamics. This new formulation permits a description based on geometric mechanics that can be applied to a broad class of models.</description>

      <title>Approximation properties of the intermediate $\beta$-expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For fixed $\beta&gt;1$ and $\alpha\in[0,1)$, each $x\in[0,1]$ has an \emph{intermediate $\beta$-expansion} of the form $x=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{c_i-\alpha}{\beta^i}$. Each such expansion produces for the number $x$ a sequence of approximations $\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{c_i-\alpha}{\beta^i}\right)_{n\geq1}$. In this paper we study approximation properties by considering $M(\beta,\alpha)$, the expected value of the corresponding \emph{normalized errors} $(\theta_{\beta,\alpha}^n(x))_{n\geq 1}$, given by $$\theta_{\beta,\alpha}^n(x):=\beta^n\left(x-\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{c_i-\alpha}{\beta^i}\right),\quad n\in\mathbb{N}.$$ We prove that $M(\beta,\alpha)$ is continuous in $\beta$ and $\alpha$, respectively. For a fixed $\beta&gt;\sqrt 2$, by the continuity property, $\mathcal{M_\beta}:=\{M(\beta,\alpha):\alpha\in[0,1)\}=[M_\beta,1-M_\beta]$ where $M_\beta=\min\{M(\beta,\alpha):\alpha\in[0,1)\}$. Taking $\beta$ to be a multinacci number, $M(\beta,\alpha)$ is linear on $[0,1-(\beta))$ and locally linear for Lebesgue a.e. $\alpha\in[1-(\beta),1)$; moreover, whether it is increasing or decreasing depends only on the sign of $T_{\beta,\alpha}^{n-1}(1)-T_{\beta,\alpha}^{n-1}(0)$ where $n=\min\{k:T_{\beta,\alpha}^k(1)-T_{\beta,\alpha}^k(0)=0\}$.</description>

      <title>Characterizing nonuniform hyperbolicity by Mather-type admissibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider linear cocycles acting on Banach spaces which satisfy the assumptions of the multiplicative ergodic theorem. A cocycle is nonuniformly hyperbolic if all Lyapunov exponents are non-zero, which is equivalent to the existence of a tempered exponential dichotomy. We provide an equivalent characterization of nonuniform hyperbolicity in terms of a Mather-type admissibility of a pair of weighted function spaces. As an application we give a short proof of the robustness of tempered exponential dichotomies under small linear perturbation.</description>

      <title>A Class of Countably Covered Two-Dimensional Sofic Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multidimensional sofic shift is called countably covered if it has an SFT cover containing only countably many configurations. In contrast to the one-dimensional setting, not all countable sofic shifts are countably covered. We study a subclass of countable shift spaces and characterize the countably covered sofic shifts among them.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds in non-autonomous quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove upper bounds on outside probabilities for generic non-autonomous Schr\"odinger operators on lattices of arbitrary dimension. Our approach is based on a combination of commutator method originated in scattering theory and novel monotonicity estimate for certain mollified asymptotic observables that track the spacetime localization of evolving states. Sub-ballistic upper bounds are obtained, assuming that momentum vanishes sufficiently fast in the front of the wavepackets. A special case gives a refinement of the general ballistic upper bound of Radin-Simon's, showing that the evolution of wavepackets are effectively confined to a strictly linear light cone with explicitly bounded slope. All results apply to long-range Hamiltonian with polynomial decaying off-diagonal terms and can be extended, via a frozen-coefficient argument, to generic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on lattices.</description>

Abstract: Based on an algebraic point of view and the realization theory developed by Y. Yamamoto, the present paper states a necessary and sufficient criterion, given in the frequency domain, for the $L^q$ approximate controllability in finite time of linear difference delay equations with distributed delays. Furthermore, an upper bound for the minimal time of the $L^q$ approximate controllability is obtained.</description>

      <title>Constructing Linear Operators Using Classical Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a methodology for generating linear operators that approximately represent nonlinear systems of perturbed ordinary differential equations. This is done through the application of classical perturbation theory via the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e expansion, followed by an extension of the space of configuration that guarantees the linear representation of the expanded system of differential equations. To ensure that such a linear representation exists, this paper uses polynomial basis functions. Pseudo-code describing the implementation of the proposed method is listed. The method is applied to the Duffing oscillator as well as to the J2 problem, with and without atmospheric drag, both analyzed using an osculating formulation. Additionally, conditions on the osculating Keplerian elements that produce low-eccentricity frozen orbits are presented, and a modification of the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method is proposed to enable the generation of linear operators that dynamically adapt to changes in the frequency of the motion. Finally, the proposed method is compared with alternatives in the literature.</description>

      <title>A competitive baseline for deep learning enhanced data assimilation using conditional Gaussian ensemble Kalman filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) is a popular technique for data assimilation, with far ranging applications. However, the vanilla EnKF framework is not well-defined when perturbations are nonlinear. We study two non-linear extensions of the vanilla EnKF - dubbed the conditional-Gaussian EnKF (CG-EnKF) and the normal score EnKF (NS-EnKF) - which sidestep assumptions of linearity by constructing the Kalman gain matrix with the `conditional Gaussian' update formula in place of the traditional one. We then compare these models against a state-of-the-art deep learning based particle filter called the score filter (SF). This model uses an expensive score diffusion model for estimating densities and also requires a strong assumption on the perturbation operator for validity. In our comparison, we find that CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF dramatically outperform SF for a canonical problem in high-dimensional multiscale data assimilation given by the Lorenz-96 system. Our analysis also demonstrates that the CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF can handle highly non-Gaussian additive noise perturbations, with the latter typically outperforming the former.</description>

Abstract: We construct a finitely generated group which is not virtually free, yet has decidable snake tiling problem. This shows that either a long-standing conjecture by Ballier and Stein (the characterization of groups with decidable domino problem as those virtually free ones) is false, or a question by Aubrun and Bitar has a positive answer (there exists a group for which the domino and snake problems are of different difficulty).</description>

      <title>A novel agent with formal goal-reaching guarantees: an experimental study with a mobile robot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to be effective and convenient for a number of tasks in robotics. However, it requires the exploration of a sufficiently large number of state-action pairs, many of which may be unsafe or unimportant. For instance, online model-free learning can be hazardous and inefficient in the absence of guarantees that a certain set of desired states will be reached during an episode. An increasingly common approach to address safety involves the addition of a shielding system that constrains the RL actions to a safe set of actions. In turn, a difficulty for such frameworks is how to effectively couple RL with the shielding system to make sure the exploration is not excessively restricted. This work presents a novel safe model-free RL agent called Critic As Lyapunov Function (CALF) and showcases how CALF can be used to improve upon control baselines in robotics in an efficient and convenient fashion while ensuring guarantees of stable goal reaching. The latter is a crucial part of safety, as seen generally. With CALF all state-action pairs remain explorable and yet reaching of desired goal states is formally guaranteed. Formal analysis is provided that shows the goal stabilization-ensuring properties of CALF and a set of real-world and numerical experiments with a non-holonomic wheeled mobile robot (WMR) TurtleBot3 Burger confirmed the superiority of CALF over such a well-established RL agent as proximal policy optimization (PPO), and a modified version of SARSA in a few-episode setting in terms of attained total cost.</description>

      <title>On the periodic decompositions of multidimensional configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $d$-dimensional configurations, that is, colorings of the $d$-dimensional integer grid $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with finitely many colors. Moreover, we interpret the colors as integers so that configurations are functions $\mathbb{Z}^d \to \mathbb{Z}$ of finite range. We say that such function is $k$-periodic if it is invariant under translations in $k$ linearly independent directions. It is known that if a configuration has a non-trivial annihilator, that is, if some non-trivial linear combination of its translations is the zero function, then it is a sum of finitely many periodic functions. This result is known as the periodic decomposition theorem. We prove two different improvements of it. The first improvement gives a characterization on annihilators of a configuration to guarantee the $k$-periodicity of the functions in its periodic decomposition -- for any $k$. The periodic decomposition theorem is then a special case of this result with $k=1$. The second improvement concerns so called sparse configurations for which the number of non-zero values in patterns grows at most linearly with respect to the diameter of the pattern. We prove that a sparse configuration with a non-trivial annihilator is a sum of finitely many periodic fibers where a fiber means a function whose non-zero values lie on a unique line.</description>

Abstract: We use symplectic tools to establish a smooth variant of Franks theorem for a closed orientable surface of positive genus $g$; it implies that a symplectic diffeomorphism isotopic to the identity with more than $2g-2$ fixed points, counted homologically, has infinitely many periodic points. Furthermore, we present examples of symplectic diffeomorphisms with a prescribed number of periodic points. In particular, we construct symplectic flows on surfaces possessing only one fixed point and no other periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Bounded-confidence opinion models with random-time interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In models of opinion dynamics, the opinions of individual agents evolve with time. One type of opinion model is a bounded-confidence model (BCM), in which opinions take continuous values and interacting agents compromise their opinions with each other if those opinions are sufficiently similar. In studies of BCMs, it is typically assumed that interactions between agents occur at deterministic times. This assumption neglects an inherent element of randomness in social systems. In this paper, we study BCMs on networks and allow agents to interact at random times. To incorporate random-time interactions, we use renewal processes to determine social interactions, which can follow arbitrary waiting-time distributions (WTDs). We establish connections between these random-time-interaction BCMs and deterministic-time-interaction BCMs. We find that BCMs with Markovian WTDs have consistent statistical properties on different networks but that the statistical properties of BCMs with non-Markovian WTDs depend on network structure.</description>

      <title>Data-driven model discovery with Kolmogorov-Arnold networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven model discovery of complex dynamical systems is typically done using sparse optimization, but it has a fundamental limitation: sparsity in that the underlying governing equations of the system contain only a small number of elementary mathematical terms. Examples where sparse optimization fails abound, such as the classic Ikeda or optical-cavity map in nonlinear dynamics and a large variety of ecosystems. Exploiting the recently articulated Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, we develop a general model-discovery framework for any dynamical systems including those that do not satisfy the sparsity condition. In particular, we demonstrate non-uniqueness in that a large number of approximate models of the system can be found which generate the same invariant set with the correct statistics such as the Lyapunov exponents and Kullback-Leibler divergence. An analogy to shadowing of numerical trajectories in chaotic systems is pointed out.</description>

      <title>The Lie algebraic structure of colored networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.11419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the computation of the normal form of a colored network vector field, following the semigroup(oid) approach in [19], one would like to be able to say something about the structure of the Lie algebra of linear colored network vector fields. Unlike the purely abstract approach in [10], we describe here a concrete algorithm that gives us the Levi decomposition. If we apply this algorithm to a given subalgebra, it does put the elements in the subalgebra in the block form given by the Levi decomposition, but this need not be the Levi decomposition of the given subalgebra. We show that for $N$-dimensional vector fields with C colors (different functions describing different types of cells in the network) this Lie algebra $net_{C,N}$ is isomorphic to the semidirect sum of a semisimple part, consisting of two simple components $\mathfrak{sl}_C$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_B$, with $B=N-C$, which we write as a block-matrix and a solvable part, consisting of two elements representing the identity $C$ in $c\simeq glC$ and B in $b \simeq glB$, and an abelian algebra $a\simeq\mathfrak{Gr}(C,N)$, the Grassmannian, consisting of the $C$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^N$. The methods in this paper can be immediately applied to study the linear maps of colored networks.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of the elliptic relative equilibria for the restricted N-body problem: two special cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the elliptic relative equilibria of the restricted $N$-body problems, where the $N-1$ primaries form an Euler-Moulton collinear central configuration or a $(1+n)$-gon central configuration. We obtain the symplectic reduction to the general restricted $N$-body problem. For the first case, by analyzing the relationship between this restricted $N$-body problems and the elliptic Lagrangian solutions, we obtain the linear stability of the restricted $N$-body problem by the $\omega$-Maslov index. Via numerical computations, we also obtain conditions of the stability on the mass parameters under $N=4$ and the symmetry of the central configuration. For the second case, there exist three positions $S_1,S_2$ and $S_3$ of the massless body (up to rotations of angle $\frac{2\pi}{n}$). For ${m_0\over m}$ sufficiently large, we show that the elliptic relative equilibria is linearly unstable if the eccentricity $0\le e&lt;e_0$ and the massless body lies at $S_1$ or $S_2$; while the elliptic relative equilibria is linear stability if the massless body lies at $S_3$.</description>

      <title>Takens Theorem for nonautonomous partially hyperbolic dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Takens Theorem for a partially hyperbolic dynamics provides a normal linearization along the center manifold. In this paper, we give the nonautonomous version of Takens Theorem under non-resonance conditions formulated in terms of the dichotomy spectrum. In our proof, one difficulty is to solve homological equations for the normal form theory which involve a center variable, while another difficulty is to find the dichotomy spectrum of a certain matrix cocycle that is block lower triangular. In order to overcome those difficulties, in comparison with the autonomous case, we need an additional term in the (nonautonomous) non-resonance conditions to guarantee certain spectral gap conditions. This additional term disappears naturally in the autonomous case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph covers are a way to describe continuous maps (and homeomorphisms) of a Cantor set, more generally than e.g.\ Bratteli-Vershik systems. Every continuous map on a zero-dimensional compact set can be expressed by a graph cover (e.g.\ non-minimality or aperiodicty are no restrictions). We give a survey on the construction, properties and some special cases of graph covers.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Eddy Identification with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mesoscale eddies are critical in ocean circulation and the global climate system. Standard eddy identification methods are usually based on deterministic optimal point estimates of the ocean flow field. However, uncertainty exists in estimating the flow field due to noisy, sparse, and indirect observations and turbulent flow models. Because of the intrinsic strong nonlinearity in the eddy identification diagnostics, even a small uncertainty in estimating the flow field can cause a significant error in the identified eddies. This paper presents a general probabilistic eddy identification framework that adapts existing identification methods to incorporate uncertainty into the diagnostic, emphasizing the interaction between the uncertainty in state estimation and the nonlinearity in diagnostics for affecting the identification results. The probabilistic eddy identification framework starts by sampling an ensemble of flow realizations from the probabilistic state estimation, followed by applying traditional nonlinear eddy diagnostics to individual realizations. The corresponding eddy statistics are then aggregated from the diagnostic results based on these realizations. The framework is applied to a scenario mimicking the Beaufort Gyre marginal ice zone, where large uncertainty appears in estimating the ocean field using Lagrangian data assimilation with sparse ice floe trajectories. The skills in counting the number of eddies and computing the probability of each eddy event are significantly improved under the probabilistic framework. Notably, incorporating the nonlinear propagation of uncertainty in diagnostics provides a more accurate mean estimate than standard deterministic methods in estimating eddy lifetime. It also facilitates uncertainty quantification in inferring such a crucial dynamical quantity.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we introduce an ergodic optimization problem inspired by information theory, which can be presented informally as follows: given topological dynamical systems $(X, T), (Y, S)$, and a continuous function $f \in C(X \times Y)$, what can be said about the extrema $$\sup_{y \in Y} \inf_{x \in X} \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j = 0}^{k - 1} f \left( T^j x , S^j y \right) ? $$ Our goal in this article is to formalize this problem, present some preliminary results on the topic, and note some remaining open questions in the general theory.</description>

Abstract: Our goal is to show that both the fast and slow versions of the triangle map (a type of multi-dimensional continued fraction algorithm) in dimension $n$ are ergodic, resolving a conjecture of Messaoudi, Noguiera and Schweiger. This particular type of higher dimensional multi-dimensional continued fraction algorithm has recently been linked to the study of partition numbers, with the result that the underlying dynamics has combinatorial implications.</description>

Abstract: We prove inverse theorems for the size of sumsets and the $L^q$ norms of convolutions in the discretized setting, extending to arbitrary dimension an earlier result of the author in the line. These results have applications to the dimensions of dynamical self-similar sets and measures, and to the higher dimensional fractal uncertainty principle. The proofs are based on a structure theorem for the entropy of convolution powers due to M.~Hochman.</description>

      <title>Opinion response functions are key to understanding tipping of social conventions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extent to which committed minorities can overturn social conventions is an active area of research in the mathematical modelling of opinion dynamics. Researchers generally use simulations of agent-based models (ABMs) to compute approximate values for the minimum committed minority size needed to overturn a social convention. In this manuscript, we expand on previous work by studying an ABM's mean-field behaviour using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models and a new tool, opinion response functions. Using these methods allows for formal analysis of the deterministic model which can provide a theoretical explanation for observed behaviours, e.g., coexistence or overturning of opinions. In particular, opinion response functions are a method of characterizing the equilibria in our social model. Our analysis confirms earlier numerical results and supplements them with a precise formula for computing the minimum committed minority size required to overturn a social convention.</description>

Abstract: In the theory of C*-algebras, the Weyl groups were defined for the Cuntz algebras and graph algebras by Cuntz and Conti et al. respectively. In this paper, we introduce and investigate the Weyl groups of groupoid C*-algebras as a natural generalization of the existing Weyl groups. Then we analyse several groups of automorphisms on groupoid C*-algebras. Finally, we apply our results to Cuntz algebras, graph algebras and C*-algebras associated with Deaconu-Renault systems.</description>

      <title>Coherence influx is indispensable for quantum reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Echo state property (ESP) is a fundamental property that allows an input-driven dynamical system to perform information processing tasks. Recently, extensions of ESP to potentially nonstationary systems and subsystems, that is, nonstationary ESP and subset/subspace ESP, have been proposed. In this paper, we theoretically and numerically analyze the sufficient and necessary conditions for a quantum system to satisfy nonstationary ESP and subset/subspace nonstationary ESP. Based on extensive usage of the Pauli transfer matrix (PTM) form, we find that (1) the interaction with a quantum-coherent environment, termed $\textit{coherence influx}$, is indispensable in realizing nonstationary ESP, and (2) the spectral radius of PTM can characterize the fading memory property of quantum reservoir computing (QRC). Our numerical experiment, involving a system with a Hamiltonian that entails a spin-glass/many-body localization phase, reveals that the spectral radius of PTM can describe the dynamical phase transition intrinsic to such a system. To comprehensively understand the mechanisms under ESP of QRC, we propose a simplified model, multiplicative reservoir computing (mRC), which is a reservoir computing (RC) system with a one-dimensional multiplicative input. Theoretically and numerically, we show that the parameters corresponding to the spectral radius and coherence influx in mRC directly correlates with its linear memory capacity (MC). Our findings about QRC and mRC will provide a theoretical aspect of PTM and the input multiplicativity of QRC. The results will lead to a better understanding of QRC and information processing in open quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which the set defined by a M\"obius transformation of positive integers is a set of multiplicative recurrence. A Khinchin-type lower bound is also established. This not only answers a question of Donoso--Le--Moreira--Sun but also strengthens their result. The key input in our proof is Tao's logarithmically averaged correlations of non-pretentious multiplicative functions.</description>
