      <title>Charge-dependent nucleon-nucleon interaction at N$^3$LO in nuclear lattice effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT) is an efficient tool for solving nuclear many-body problems, which takes high-fidelity lattice chiral interactions as input and computes nuclear low-energy observables via quantum Monte Carlo techniques. In this work, we present the first next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) chiral forces on the lattice with the isospin-breaking effects fully taken into account. We focus on both the charge-independence breaking (CIB) and charge-symmetry breaking (CSB) effects. Specifically, we include the isospin-breaking effect from the mass difference between the charged and neutral pions in the one-pion-exchange potential (OPEP), the Coulomb force for the $pp$ interaction and the contribution of two additional charge-dependent contact operators. We also explicitly incorporate the two-pion-exchange potentials which was mostly neglected in previous NLEFT calculations. With these improvements, we are able to accurately reproduce the $np$ and $pp$ scattering phase shifts up to relative momentum $p \sim 200$ MeV as well as the deuteron properties. The construction of these charge-dependent lattice nuclear forces establishes a solid foundation for future high-precision nuclear ab initio calculations within the NLEFT framework.</description>

      <title>In-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections from relativistic ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The in-medium nucleon-nucleon scattering cross section is a pivotal quantity for studying the medium effects of strong interaction, and its precise knowledge is critical for understanding the equation of state for dense matter, intermediate-energy heavy-ion collision dynamics, and related phenomena. In this work, we perform a microscopic investigation of in-medium nucleon-nucleon scattering cross sections, by utilizing the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) theory with the Bonn potential. The fully incorporation of both positive- and negative-energy states in the RBHF solutions allows us to determine the single-particle potentials, the effective G matrix, and the scattering cross section uniquely. The momentum, density, and isospin dependence of the cross section for pp, nn, and np scattering are studied in detail. Our results provide a solid foundation for future parameterization studies of multi-parameter dependency of total scattering cross sections.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for weakly bound two-neutron halo nuclei: corrections from neutron-neutron effective range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an effective field-theoretical approach, we investigate the properties of weakly bound two-neutron halo nuclei (also known as Borromean nuclei) that do not support a low-energy $s$-wave core-neutron resonance. Extending the recently formulated effective field theory for weakly bound Borromean nuclei, we incorporate corrections arising from the effective range of neutron-neutron scattering and evaluate their impact on the mean-square radii and electromagnetic response. In particular, we compute the ratio of the matter and charge radii, the shape of the $E1$ dipole strength function, and the electric polarizability. Our results indicate that these corrections remain numerically small when the two-neutron separation energy of the Borromean nucleus is much less than 1~MeV.</description>

      <title>Relativistic $^3$He light-front wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic light-front (LF) wave function of $^3$He is determined by the three-body LF equation for the Faddeev components in the momentum space. As an interaction, we take the one-meson exchange kernels, without the potential approximation. Within the explicitly covariant formulation of LF dynamics, we calculate the full relativistic $^3$He LF wave function, comprising 32 spin-isospin components. In the non-relativistic domain, five of these components dominate and closely resemble their non-relativistic counterparts. Relativistic effects manifest themselves in deviations in relativistic domain of these components from the non-relativistic ones and in appearance of new components.</description>

      <title>Generalized relativistic second-order dissipative hydrodynamics: coupling different rank tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the formalism of second-order relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics, developed previously using Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator formalism. By employing a second-order expansion of the statistical operator in terms of hydrodynamic gradients, we demonstrate that new second-order terms emerge due to the coupling of two-point quantum correlators between tensors of differing ranks, evaluated at distinct space-time points. Such terms arise because the presence of the acceleration vector in the system allows Curie's theorem, which governs symmetry constraints, to be extended for constructing invariants from tensors of different ranks evaluated at distinct space-time points. The new terms are identified in the context of a complete set of second-order equations governing the shear-stress tensor, bulk-viscous pressure, and charge-diffusion currents for a generic quantum system characterized by the energy-momentum tensor and multiple conserved charges. Additionally, we identify the transport coefficients associated with these new terms and derive the Kubo formulas expressing the second-order transport coefficients through two- and three-point correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Role of the $\delta$ Meson in the Equation of State an Direct Urca Cooling of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct Urca (dUrca) process is a key mechanism driving rapid neutrino cooling in neutron stars, with its baryon density activation threshold determined by the microscopic model for nuclear matter. Understanding how nuclear interactions shape the dUrca threshold is essential for interpreting neutron star thermal evolution, particularly in light of recent studies on exceptionally cold objects. We investigate the impact of incorporating the scalar isovector $\delta$ meson into the neutron star equation of state, which alters the internal proton fraction and consequently affects the dUrca cooling threshold. Since proton superfluidity is known to suppress dUrca rates, we also examine the interplay between the nuclear interaction mediated by the $\delta$ meson and the $^1S_0$ proton pairing gap. We perform a Bayesian analysis using models built within a relativistic mean-field approximation, incorporating constraints from astrophysical observations, nuclear experiments, and known results of \textit{ab initio} calculations of pure neutron matter. We then impose a constraint on the dUrca threshold based on studies of fast-cooling neutron stars. The inclusion of $\delta$ meson expands the range of possible internal compositions, directly influencing the stellar mass required for the central density to reach the dUrca threshold. Furthermore, we observe that the observation of relatively young and cold neutron stars provides insights into $^1S_0$ proton superfluidity in the core of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Chiral Vortical Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the collective modes of chiral matter described by the second-order chiral hydrodynamics, noticing that chiral shear waves (CSWs) may become unstable for momenta above a characteristic scale. In the absence of sufficient dissipation, this instability emerges within the hydrodynamic regime, depending on the interplay between shear viscosity and the anomalous vortical contribution to the stress-energy tensor at second order in hydrodynamic expansion. We show that this instability generates helical flows and name it the {\it chiral vortical instability} (CVI). Alongside the chiral plasma and magnetovortical instabilities, CVI tends to transfer initial microscopic chirality into macroscopic helicities, which combine into a generalized axial charge. We further find that an elementary static Gromeka-Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, corresponding to a CSW at a specific momentum, solves the full nonlinear equations of second-order chiral hydrodynamics, whereas global rotation of a chiral medium is not a solution. This observation supports the relevance of CVI beyond the hydrodynamic regime. Finally, we briefly note that CVI may have multiple phenomenological implications across various systems, including QCD matter produced in heavy-ion collisions and primordial plasma in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Correlation studies of the $^{7}$He excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unbound nucleus $^{7}$He was recently studied in the $^2$H($^{6}$He,$^1$H)$^{7}$He reaction at 29 $A\,$MeV beam energy in Ref.[M.S. Golovkov et al., Phys. Rev. C 109, L061602 (2024)]. The excitation spectrum of $^{7}$He was measured up to $E_T=8$ MeV ($E_T$ is energy above the $^{6}$He-$n$ threshold). Angular distribution for the $^{6}$He-$n$ decay of the $^{7}$He $3/2^-$ ground state can be explained by a strong spin alignment induced by a reaction mechanism. The correlation information for the higher-lying $^{7}$He excitations is available as backward-forward asymmetry for the $^{6}$He-$n$ decay in the $^{7}$He frame. The asymmetry function has an expressed energy profile which may be explained by using quite restrictive assumptions about structure of $^{7}$He excitations or/and peculiarities of the reaction mechanism. In the analysis of [M.S. Golovkov et al., Phys. Rev. C 109, L061602 (2024)] the observation the $s_{1/2}$ state in $^{7}$He is declared with $E_r \approx 2.0$ MeV. Our work is based on the same $^{7}$He data. However, the data analysis was improved and also the data interpretation is substantiated with the detailed PWBA reaction studies and coupled-channel calculations of the $^{7}$He continuous spectrum. The idea of the $s_{1/2}$ resonant state with $E_r \approx 2.0$ is rejected. In addition, the position of the $1/2^-$ state in $^{7}$He is confined to the interval $E_r=2.2-3.0$ MeV, with ``preferred'' value 2.6 MeV. There is indication on the second $3/2^-$ state in the data with $E_r \sim 4.5$ MeV and with the lower resonance energy limit $E_r \gtrsim 3.5$ MeV. Importance and prospects of more detailed correlation studies of $^{7}$He continuum are discussed.</description>

      <title>Search for doubly charmed dibaryons in baryon-baryon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematical investigation of the doubly charmed dibaryon system with quantum numbers $IJ=01$, and strangeness numbers $S=0$, $-2$ and $-4$ in the framework of the chiral quark model. Two resonance states with strangeness numbers $S=-2$ is obtained in the $\Lambda\Omega_{cc}$ scattering channel, which are $\Xi_{cc}^{\ast}\Xi$ with resonance mass 5081 MeV and decay width 0.3 MeV, and the $\Xi_{c}\Xi_{c}^{\ast}$ state with the mass 5213 MeV and decay width 19.8 MeV, respectively. These two predicted charmed dibaryon candidates are worth searching for experimentally. Besides, we would like to emphasize that the multi-channel coupling calculation is important to confirm the existence of multiquark states. The coupling can shift the energy of the resonance, give the width to the resonance and even destroy the resonance. Therefore, to provide the necessary information for experiments to search for exotic hadron states, the coupling calculation between the bound channels and open channels is indispensable.</description>

      <title>Second order fluctuations of conserved charges in external magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first-principles lattice QCD investigation of second-order fluctuations of and correlations among conserved charges -- baryon number (B), electric charge (Q), and strangeness (S) -- in the presence of external magnetic fields. Our study employs lattice simulations of (2+1)-flavor QCD with physical pion masses using highly improved staggered fermions (HISQ) on $48^3 \times 12$ and $32^3 \times 8$ lattices, covering a wide range of magnetic field strengths up to $eB \simeq 0.8$ GeV$ ^2$. We identify clear signals of magnetic field-induced modifications to these fluctuations and correlations, with the baryon-electric charge correlation, $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$, exhibiting particularly strong sensitivity to the magnetic field. To bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables, we implement systematic kinematic cuts that emulate detector acceptances of the STAR and ALICE experiments within the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model and construct proxy observables for fluctuations measurable in heavy-ion collision experiments. Our findings highlight $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ as a promising ``magnetometer" for probing the presence of magnetic fields in QCD matter. Furthermore, we explore experimentally relevant ratios involving $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$, demonstrating their potential in mitigating volume effects and enhancing sensitivity to magnetic fields in collision environments. Additionally, we assess the limitations of the HRG model at strong magnetic fields, revealing deviations that indicate nontrivial modifications to hadronic degrees of freedom. These results offer new insights into the interplay between thermal and magnetic effects in the QCD phase diagram and provide experimentally relevant guidance for the detection of magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy correlation functions and hadron-hadron scattering amplitudes in presence of Coulomb potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the incorporation of Coulomb interactions into femtoscopy correlation functions (CFs) used to probe hadron interactions. Combining strong contact potentials with Coulomb effects, the derived scattering amplitudes and wave functions are used to compute CFs, accounting for both interactions coherently. Next, we analyze the nature of the corrections due to the finite range of the strong interaction, closely linked to off-shell effects, and propose an approximate method to account for them. We show how these corrections turn out to be essential to accurately extract the strong hadron-hadron scattering amplitudes from CF data. We compare the obtained expressions for the CFs with those reported in previous theoretical frameworks. Also, using proton-proton systems as a case study, we obtain a good comparison of our results with previous realistic theoretical calculations and with accurate recent data from the ALICE experiment. The framework enables precise CF calculations without numerical solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, offering a practical tool for femtoscopy analyses involving charged hadrons. In addition, the scheme allows for an easy connection with scattering amplitudes obtained from Effective Field Theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quasi-stationary states in quantum mechanics using the exact WKB analysis as a non-perturbative framework. While previous works focus mainly on stable systems, we explore quasi-stable states such as resonances. As a concrete example, we analyze the inverted Rosen--Morse potential, which exhibits barrier resonance. This model allows exact solutions, enabling a direct comparison with exact WKB predictions. We provide a simple analytic picture of resonance and demonstrate consistency between exact and WKB-based results, extending the applicability of exact WKB analysis to non-polynomial potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational form factor (GFF) of the kaon is investigated in a bottom-up holographic QCD model, in which the strange quark mass breaks the SU(3) flavor symmetry. The probe energy ($Q^2$) dependence of the kaon GFF is explicitly shown and compared to that of the pion. It is presented that our result shows the $1/Q^2$ behavior in the high energy region, which is consistent with the perturbative QCD prediction. The gravitational radius of the kaon is also calculated, and it is found that the result is quite close to that of the pion but slightly smaller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate, to second order in the scattering length between two fermions, the Landau quasiparticle interaction for a low-density mixture of two fermion species with unequal densities at temperature zero. From the Landau parameters we evaluate the energy density and find agreement with the result of Kanno, Prog. Theor. Phys. 44, 813 (1970). The calculations are then extended to the case of two fermion components with different total densities, each with two spin components, a situation of interest in nuclear physics and astrophysics, where the species are neutrons and protons. An interesting finding is that, for low proton concentrations, $x \ll 1$, the leading term in the energy density, beyond the $x^{5/3}$ contribution from the kinetic energy and the $x^2$ one due to the two-body interaction in the mean-field approximation, varies as $x^{7/3} \ln x$. This is to be contrasted with the higher powers of $x$ implicit in many phenomenological energy-density functionals employed in nuclear physics, such as those of the Skyrme type.</description>

      <title>In-medium $\Lambda N$ interactions with leading order covariant chiral hyperon/nucleon-nucleon forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-medium $\Lambda N$ interactions are crucial in hypernuclei and neutron star physics. In this work, we study the in-medium $\Lambda N$ interaction within the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) framework, employing the leading-order covariant chiral hyperon/nucleon-nucleon forces for the first time. We demonstrate that a consistent description of both the experimental cross-section data and the `empirical value' of the $\Lambda$ single-particle potential can be achieved. This contrasts with the majority of studies in the non-relativistic framework, where higher-order two-body chiral forces are typically required. This study offers a new perspective on the in-medium $\Lambda N$ interactions, urgently needed in relativistic \textit{ab initio} hypernuclear physics studies.</description>

      <title>Jet Suppression and Azimuthal Anisotropy from RHIC to LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropies of high-$p_T$ particles produced in heavy-ion collisions are understood as an effect of a geometrical selection bias. Particles oriented in the direction in which the QCD medium formed in these collisions is shorter, suffer less energy loss, and thus, are over-represented in the final ensemble compared to those oriented in the direction in which the medium is longer. In this work we present the first semi-analytical predictions, including propagation through a realistic, hydrodynamical background, of the azimuthal anisotropies for jets, obtaining a quantitative agreement with available experimental data as function of the jet $p_T$, its cone size $R$ and the collisions centrality. Jets are multi-partonic, extended objects and their energy loss is sensitive to substructure fluctuations. This is determined by the physics of color coherence that relates to the ability of the medium to resolve those partonic fluctuations. Namely, color dipoles whose angle is smaller than a critical angle, $\theta_c$, are not resolved by the medium and they effectively act as a coherent source of energy loss. We find that jet azimuthal anisotropies have a specially strong dependence on coherence physics due to the marked length-dependence of $\theta_c$. By combining our predictions for the collision systems and center of mass energies studied at RHIC and the LHC, covering a wide range of typical values of $\theta_c$, we show that the relative size of jet azimuthal anisotropies for jets with different cone-sizes $R$ follow a universal trend that indicates a transition from a coherent regime of jet quenching to a decoherent regime. These results suggest a way forward to reveal the role played by the physics of jet color decoherence in probing deconfined QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Calculation of the correlation, relativistic and QED corrections to the total electron binding energy in atoms and their nuclear charge dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present relativistic many-body calculations of total electron binding energy of neutral atoms up to element $Z=120$. Binding energy for ions may be found by subtracting known ionization potentials. Accuracy of the results for $17&lt;Z \le105$ significantly exceeds that in NIST tables (there are no data for $Z&gt;105$ there). We fit numerical results for binding energies by analytical function of $Z$. We also calculate numerical values and determine dependence on $Z$ of the correlation corrections, Dirac and Breit relativistic corrections and quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Phenomenology of Identified Particle Spectra in Heavy-Ion Collisions at LHC Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the Zubarev approach of the non-equilibrium statistical operator to investigate the enhancement of the low-$p_T$ region of pion spectra, introducing an effective pion chemical potential to describe the overpopulation of low-energy pion states. We test a corresponding freeze-out approach by analyzing the transverse-momentum spectra of identified particles measured recently with high precision by the ALICE Collaboration in Pb+Pb collisions at CERN LHC. A blast-wave model and a blast-wave-based particle generator, coupled to a hadronic transport model, are utilized. Bayesian inference methods are applied to extract the most probable sets of thermodynamic parameters at the chemical freeze-out hypersurface. Both models for the overpopulated pion states, the hadronic transport model and the thermal model with a nonzero pion chemical potential, provide a satisfactory description of the observed pion spectra. However, both approaches contain approximations which can be improved within a systematic nonequilibrium approach. We demonstrate that the introduction of a nonequilibrium pion chemical potential offers an efficient alternative to the conventional explanation of the low-$p_T$ enhancement, typically attributed to resonance decays with subsequent thermalization. A similar discussion holds also for the kaon spectra.</description>

      <title>XTE J1814-338: A potential hybrid star candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent analysis on the properties of the XTE J1814-338 pulsar yielded a small radius value around ~ 7 km. Notably, this estimation is significantly lower compared to the currently inferred values for the radius of neutron stars (as they are derived from both theoretical calculations and corresponding observations). In this paper, we focus on the construction of hybrid equations of state (EOSs) for the possible reconciliation of the exotic XTE J1814-338 properties. Our analysis indicates that an equation of state involving a sufficiently strong phase transition could potentially lead to the explanation of the size and mass of such a compact object. By examining the sign of the $dM/dP_c$ slope, we found that stellar configurations compatible to XTE J1814-338 are only stable for a "stiff" low density phase. For a "soft" hadronic EOS selection the stability of the resulting configurations may not be satisfied in terms of the turning point criterion. However, a complementary analysis, for the radial oscillations of the aforementioned configurations, indicated their stability when a slow phase conversion is considered.</description>

      <title>CP violation in cold dense quark matter and axion effects on the non-radial oscillations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge-conjugation and parity violation in strong interaction for cold dense quark matter is studied with axions of quantum chromodynamic within the three flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model that includes the coupling of axions to quarks. We first calculate the effective potential for axions at finite baryon density and zero temperature including the effects of a first order chiral phase transition. Using the equation of state for quark matter with axions and a hadronic matter equation of state in the ambit of a relativistic mean field theory in quantum hadrodynamics, we discuss the hadron-quark phase transition. Inclusion of axions reduces the critical density for chiral transition. We use a Gibbs construct for the hadron-quark phase transition satisfying the constraints of beta equilibrium and charge neutrality as appropriate for the neutron star matter. The equation of state so obtained is used to investigate the structure of hybrid neutron stars. It is found that with the presence of axions, it is possible to have stable hybrid neutron stars having an inner core of quark matter both in pure quark matter phase as well as in a mixed phase with hyperonic matter along with a outer core of hyperonic matter and is in agreement with modern astrophysical constraints. We also discuss the properties of non-radial oscillations of such hybrid neutron stars. It is observed that the quadrupolar fundamental modes ($f$-modes) for such hybrid neutron stars get substantial enhancements both due to a larger quark core in the presence of axions and from the hyperons as compared to a canonical nucleonic neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Baryon Construction with $\eta^\prime$ Meson Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the low-energy regime, baryons with $N_f \geq 2$ have long been constructed as skyrmions or through bag models, but such constructions for $N_f = 1$ are hindered by the trivial topological structure of the meson field. Recent proposals suggest that one-flavor baryons can instead be interpreted as quantum Hall droplets on the $\eta'$ domain wall, providing a potential link to quark--hadron continuity at high density. In retrospect, the qualitative or semi-qualitative construction of one-flavor baryons on the $\eta'$ domain wall reveals that these baryons can be described as quantum Hall droplets, resembling topological solitons akin to skyrmions. Using an effective theory on the $\eta'$ domain wall, which is conjectured to be the Chern--Simons--Higgs theory, it is discussed that its vortex solution with unit baryon numbers naturally has a spin of $N_c/2$, and thus can be interpreted as a baryon or multi-baryon structure. The particle--vortex duality suggests that quarks carry a fractional topological charge of $1/N_c$ and obey fractional statistics. In terms of chiral bag models, confinement can be attributed to the monopoles confined within the bag, and the vector meson fields on the bag surface are essential for ensuring the correct baryon number in the chiral bag framework, thereby providing deeper insights into baryons as non-trivial topological structures of the meson field. In this paper, we review the progress in this development, with a special focus on the $\eta^\prime$ domain wall dynamics. Naive extensions to $N_f \geq 2$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Identified hadron production at hadron colliders in NNLO QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we calculate for the first time the next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to identified hadron production at hadron colliders. The inclusion of the NNLO correction has an important impact on all observables considered in this work. Higher order corrections reduce scale uncertainty and in almost all cases are moderate. Overall, good perturbative convergence is observed across kinematics and observables. The uncertainty due to missing higher orders is relatively small and, in many cases, smaller than the experimental uncertainty. The largest source of theoretical uncertainty at present is from the knowledge of the non-perturbative parton-to-hadron fragmentation functions (FF), which dwarfs the scale uncertainty in most kinematic ranges. The inclusion of NNLO corrections demonstrates the precision studies potential of this class of observables. To fully realize this potential, however, a new generation of improved fragmentation functions may be needed. The results of the present work will enable global fits of FF with NNLO precision.</description>
