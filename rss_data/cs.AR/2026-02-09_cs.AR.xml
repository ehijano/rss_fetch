      <title>D-Legion: A Scalable Many-Core Architecture for Accelerating Matrix Multiplication in Quantized LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance gains obtained by large language models (LLMs) are closely linked to their substantial computational and memory requirements. Quantized LLMs offer significant advantages with extremely quantized models, motivating the development of specialized architectures to accelerate their workloads. This paper proposes D-Legion, a novel scalable many-core architecture, designed using many adaptive-precision systolic array cores, to accelerate matrix multiplication in quantized LLMs. The proposed architecture consists of a set of Legions where each Legion has a group of adaptive-precision systolic arrays. D-Legion supports multiple computation modes, including quantized sparse and dense matrix multiplications. The block structured sparsity is exploited within a fully-sparse, or partially-sparse windows. In addition, memory accesses of partial summations (psums) are spatially reduced through parallel accumulators. Furthermore, data reuse is maximized through optimized scheduling techniques by multicasting matrix tiles across the Legions. A comprehensive design space exploration is performed in terms of Legion/core granularity to determine the optimal Legion configuration. Moreover, D-Legion is evaluated on attention workloads from two BitNet models, delivering up to 8.2$\times$ lower latency, up to 3.8$\times$ higher memory savings, and up to 3$\times$ higher psum memory savings compared to state-of-the-art work. D-Legion, with eight Legions and 64 total cores, achieves a peak throughput of 135,68 TOPS at a frequency of 1 GHz. A scaled version of D-Legion, with 32 Legions, is compared to Google TPUv4i, achieving up to 2.5$\times$ lower total latency, up to 2.3$\times$ higher total throughput, and up to 2.7$\times$ higher total memory savings.</description>

      <title>The Avatar Cache: Enabling On-Demand Security with Morphable Cache Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sharing of the last-level cache (LLC) among multiple cores makes it vulnerable to cross-core conflict- and occupancy-based attacks. Despite extensive prior work, modern processors still employ non-secure set-associative LLCs. Existing secure LLC designs broadly fall into two categories: (i) randomized and (ii) partitioned. The state-of-the-art randomized design, Mirage, mitigates conflict-based attacks but incurs significant area overhead (20% additional storage) and design complexity. Partitioned LLCs mitigate both conflict- and occupancy-based attacks, but often suffer from large performance overheads (on average over 5% and up to 49%), require OS support in set-based schemes, or face scalability issues in way-based schemes. These factors pose major obstacles to the industrial adoption of secure LLCs. This paper asks whether strong LLC security can be achieved with minimal changes to a conventional set-associative LLC, enabling security only when needed while preserving low performance, power, and area overheads. We propose Avatar, a secure and morphable LLC that supports three modes: non-secure (Avatar-N), randomized secure (Avatar-R), and partitioned secure (Avatar-P), and can switch dynamically between them. Avatar closely resembles a conventional set-associative LLC, facilitating industrial adoption. Avatar-R introduces extra invalid entries and leverages high associativity to provide a strong security guarantee with little capacity loss, achieving only one set-associative eviction per $10^{30}$ years, while incurring 1.5% storage overhead, a 2.7% increase in static power, and a 0.2% slowdown over a 16~MB baseline. Avatar-P mitigates both conflict- and occupancy-based attacks with only a 3% performance overhead, substantially outperforming prior way-based partitioned LLCs. When security is unnecessary, Avatar switches to Avatar-N to maximize performance and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Codes for Metastability-Containing Addition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental task of addition under uncertainty, namely, addends that are represented as intervals of numbers rather than single values. One potential source of such uncertainty can occur when obtaining discrete-valued measurements of analog values, which are prone to metastability. Naturally, unstable bits impact gate-level and, consequently, circuit-level computations. Using Binary encoding for such an addition produces a sum with an amplified imprecision. Hence, the challenge is to devise an encoding that does not amplify the imprecision caused by unstable bits. We call such codes recoverable. While this challenge is easily met for unary encoding, no suitable codes of high rates are known. In this work, we prove an upper bound on the rate of preserving and recoverable codes for a given bound on the addends' combined uncertainty. We then design an asymptotically optimal code that preserves the addends' combined uncertainty. We then discuss how to obtain adders for our code. The approach can be used with any known or future construction for containing metastability of the inputs. We conjecture that careful design based on existing techniques can lead to significant latency reduction.</description>

      <title>A Cost-Effective Near-Storage Processing Solution for Offline Inference of Long-Context LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational and memory demands of large language models for generative inference present significant challenges for practical deployment. One promising solution targeting offline inference is offloading-based batched inference, which extends the GPU's memory hierarchy with host memory and storage. However, it often suffers from substantial I/O overhead, primarily due to the large KV cache sizes that scale with batch size and context window length.
  In this paper, we introduce HILOS, a framework that boosts offline inference throughput using near-storage processing. The core of HILOS is attention near storage, which offloads memory-intensive attention operations to near-storage accelerators, reducing traffic across the system interconnect. Building on attention near storage, HILOS incorporates three additional optimizations. First, cooperative X-cache minimizes KV cache I/O by exploiting available host resources after offloading. Second, delayed KV cache writeback hides storage write latency and mitigates storage write amplification. Finally, a memory-efficient attention accelerator sustains high throughput for long sequences within the resource constraints of NSP devices. We implemented and evaluated HILOS on a real system equipped with 16 SmartSSDs. Compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based inference frameworks, HILOS achieves up to 7.86x throughput while reducing energy consumption by up to 85\%. The source code for HILOS is available at https://github.com/hongsunjang/HILOS.</description>

      <title>FeNN-DMA: A RISC-V SoC for SNN acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising, energy-efficient alternative to standard Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and are particularly well-suited to spatio-temporal tasks such as keyword spotting and video classification. However, SNNs have a much lower arithmetic intensity than ANNs and are therefore not well-matched to standard accelerators like GPUs and TPUs. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are designed for such memory-bound workloads, and here we present a novel, fully-programmable RISC-V-based system-on-chip (FeNN-DMA), tailored to simulating SNNs on modern UltraScale+ FPGAs. We show that FeNN-DMA has comparable resource usage and energy requirements to state-of-the-art fixed-function SNN accelerators, yet it supports more complex neuron models and network topologies, and can simulate up to 16 thousand neurons and 256 million synapses per core. Using this functionality, we demonstrate state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits, Neuromorphic MNIST and Braille tactile classification tasks.</description>
