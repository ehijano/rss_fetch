      <title>The Hardy number and the Bergman number of a planar domain are equal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with functions with a prefixed range and their inclusion in Hardy and weighted Bergman spaces. This idea was originally introduced by Hansen for Hardy spaces, and it was recently taken into weighted Bergman spaces by Karafyllia and Karamanlis. In particular, we improve a theorem of Karafyllia showing that the Hardy and Bergman numbers of any given domain coincide, that is, the Hardy and weighted Bergman spaces to which a function with prefixed range belongs can be related. The main tools in the proofs are the Green function of the domain and its universal covering map.</description>

      <title>Multiplicites and modifications, and singularities associated to blowing down negative vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first present the mixed Hilbert-Samuel multiplicities of analytic local rings over \mathbb{C} as generalized Lelong numbers and further represent them as intersection numbers in the context of modifications. As applications, we give estimates or an exact formula for the multiplicities of isolated singularities that given by the Grauert blow-downs of negative holomorphic vector bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\varphi$ be a holomorphic self map of the bidisc that is Lipschitz on the closure. We show that the composition operator $C_{\varphi}$ is compact on the Bergman space if and only if $\varphi(\overline{\mathbb{D}^2})\cap \mathbb{T}^2=\emptyset$ and $\varphi(\overline{\mathbb{D}^2}\setminus \mathbb{T}^2)\cap b\mathbb{D}^2=\emptyset$.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Log-P-Analytic Functions: Landau-Type Theorems and Their Refinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work begins by introducing the groundbreaking concept of log-p-analytic functions. Following this introduction, we proceed to delineate four distinct formulations of Landau-type theorems, specifically crafted for the domain of poly-analytic functions. Among these, two theorems are distinguished by their exactitude, and a third theorem offers a refinement to the existing work of Abdulhadi and Hajj. Concluding the paper, we present four specialized versions of Landau-type theorems applicable to a subset of bounded log-p-analytic functions, resulting in the derivation of two precise outcomes.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the slice regular M\"obius transformations of the quaternionic unit ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the quaternionic unit ball $\mathbb{B}$, let us denote by $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$ the set of slice regular M\"obius transformations mapping $\mathbb{B}$ onto itself. We introduce a smooth manifold structure on $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$, for which the evaluation(-action) map of $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$ on $\mathbb{B}$ is smooth. The manifold structure considered on $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$ is obtained by realizing this set as a quotient of the Lie group $\mathrm{Sp}(1,1)$, Furthermore, it turns out that $\mathbb{B}$ is a quotient as well of both $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$ and $\mathrm{Sp}(1,1)$. These quotients are in the sense of principal fiber bundles. The manifold $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^4 \times S^3$.</description>

      <title>Invariance of iterated global differential operator for slice monogenic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present the symmetry group of a global slice Dirac operator and its iterated ones. Further, the explicit forms of intertwining operators of the iterated global slice Dirac operator are given. At the end, we introduce a variant of the global slice Dirac operator, which allows functions considered to be defined on the whole Euclidean space. The invariance property and the intertwining operators of this variant of the global slice Dirac operator are also presented.</description>

      <title>Some properties and integral transforms in higher spin Clifford analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rarita-Schwinger equation plays an important role in theoretical physics. Bure\v s et al. generalized it to arbitrary spin $k/2$ in 2002 in the context of Clifford algebras. In this article, we introduce the mean value property, Cauchy's estimates, and Liouville's theorem for null solutions to Rarita-Schwinger operator in Euclidean spaces. Further, we investigate boundednesses to the Teodorescu transform and its derivatives. This gives rise to a Hodge decomposition of an $L^2$ spaces in terms of the kernel space of the Rarita-Schwinger operator and it also generalizes Bergman spaces in higher spin cases. \end{abstract}</description>

      <title>The horocyclic metric on Teichm{\"u}ller spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his paper Minimal stretch maps between hyperbolic surfaces, William Thurston defined a norm on the tangent space to Teichm{\"u}ller space of a hyperbolic surface, which he called the earthquake norm. This norm is obtained by assigning a length to a tangent vector after such a vector is considered as an infinitesimal earthquake deformation of the surface. This induces a Finsler metric on the Teichm{\"u}ller space, called the earthquake metric. This theory was recently investigated by Huang, Ohshika, Pan and Papadopoulos. In the present paper, we study this metric from the conformal viewpoint and we adapt Thurston's theory to the case of Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus with marked points. A complex version of the Legendre transform defined for Finsler manifolds gives an analogue of the Wolpert duality for the Weil-Petersson symplectic form, which establishes a complete analogue of Thurston's theory of the earthquake norm in the conformal setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our first aim of this article is to establish several new versions of refined Bohr inequalities for bounded analytic functions in the unit disk involving Schwarz functions. Secondly, %as applications of these results, we obtain several new multidimensional analogues of the refined Bohr inequalities for bounded holomorphic mappings on the unit ball in a complex Banach space involving higher dimensional Schwarz mappings. All the results are proved to be sharp.</description>

      <title>Nevanlinna Theory on Complete K\"ahler Connected Sums With Non-parabolic Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by invalidness of Liouville property for harmonic functions on the connected sum $\#^\vartheta\mathbb C^m$ with $\vartheta\geq2,$ we study Nevanlinna theory on a complete K\"ahler connected sum
  $$M=M_1\#\cdots\# M_\vartheta$$ with $\vartheta$ non-parabolic ends. Based on the global Green function method, we extend the second main theorem of meromorphic mappings to $M.$ As a consequence, we obtain a Picard's little theorem provided that all $M_j^,s$ have non-negative Ricci curvature, which states that every meromorphic function on $M$ reduces to a constant if it omits three distinct values.In particular, it implies that Cauchy-Riemann equation supports a rigidity of Liouville property as an invariant under connected sums.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of irreducible desingularization of singularities associated to negative vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the irreducible desingularization of a singularity given by the Grauert blow down of a negative holomorphic vector bundle over a compact complex manifold is unique up to isomorphism, and as an application, we show that two negative line bundles over compact complex manifolds are isomorphic if and only if their Grauert blow downs have isomorphic germs near the singularities. We also show that there is a unique way to modify a submanifold of a complex manifold to a hypersurface, namely, the blow up of the ambient manifold along the submanifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on his claims in 1990, Rosenberg conjectured in 1997 that the negative algebraic $K$-groups of C*-algebras are invariant under continuous homotopy. Contrary to his expectation, we prove that such invariance holds for $K_{-1}$ of arbitrary Banach rings by establishing a certain continuity result. We also construct examples demonstrating that similar continuity results do not hold for lower $K$-groups.</description>

      <title>Deforming the weighted-homogeneous foliation, and trivializing families of semi-weighted homogeneous ICIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let X_o be a weighted-homogeneous complete intersection germ in (R^N,o) or (C^N,o), with arbitrary singularities, possibly non-reduced. Take the foliation of the ambient space by weighted-homogeneous real arcs, \ga_s.
  Take a deformation of X_o by higher order terms, X_t. Does the foliation \ga_s deform compatibly with X_t? We identify the ``obstruction locus", \Sigma in X_o, outside of which such a deformation does exist, and possesses exceptionally nice properties.
  Using this deformed foliation we construct a contact trivialization of the family of defining equations by a homeomorphism that is real analytic (resp. Nash) off the origin, differentiable at the origin, whose presentation in weighted-polar coordinates is globally real-analytic (resp. globally Nash), and with controlled Lipschitz/C^1-properties.</description>

      <title>Shift-cyclicity in analytic function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this survey, we consider Banach spaces of analytic functions in one and several complex variables for which: (i) polynomials are dense, (ii) point-evaluations on the domain are bounded linear functionals, and (iii) the shift operators are bounded for each variable. We discuss the problem of determining the shift-cyclic functions in such a space, i.e., functions whose polynomial multiples form a dense subspace. The problem of determining shift-cyclic functions in certain analytic function spaces is known to be intimately connected to some deep problems in other areas of mathematics, such as the dilation completeness problem and even the Riemann hypothesis.
  What makes determining shift-cyclic functions so difficult is that often we need to employ techniques that are specific to the space in consideration. We therefore cover several different function spaces that have frequently appeared in the past such as the Hardy spaces, Dirichlet-type spaces, complete Pick spaces and Bergman spaces. We highlight the similarities and the differences between shift-cyclic functions among these spaces and list some important general properties that shift-cyclic functions in any given analytic function space must share. Throughout this discussion, we also motivate and provide a large list of open problems related to shift-cyclicity.</description>

      <title>Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates uniqueness results for perturbed periodic Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Specifically, we consider operators of the form $H = -\Delta + V + v$, where $\Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian, $V: \mathbb{Z}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a periodic potential, and $v: \mathbb{Z}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ represents a decaying impurity. We establish quantitative conditions under which the equation $-\Delta u + V u + v u = \lambda u$, for $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$, admits only the trivial solution $u \equiv 0$. Key applications include the absence of embedded eigenvalues for operators with impurities decaying faster than any exponential function and the determination of sharp decay rates for eigenfunctions. Our findings extend previous works by providing precise decay conditions for impurities and analyzing different spectral regimes of $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Pressure path metrics on parabolic families of polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be a subfamily of the moduli space of degree $D\ge2$ polynomials defined by a finite number of parabolic relations. Let $\Omega$ be a bounded stable component of $\Lambda$ with the property that all critical points are attracted by either the persistent parabolic cycles or by attracting cycles in $\mathbb C$. We construct a positive semi-definite pressure form on $\Omega$ and show that it defines a path metric on $\Omega$. This provides a counterpart in complex dynamics of the pressure metric on cusped Hitchin components recently studied by Kao and Bray-Canary-Kao-Martone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a generalization of the Bers' simultaneous uniformization theorem in the world of algebraic correspondences. More precisely, we construct algebraic correspondences that simultaneously uniformize a pair of non-homeomorphic genus zero orbifolds. We also present a complex-analytic realization of the Teichm\"uller space of a punctured sphere in the space of correspondences.</description>

      <title>Cartan uniqueness theorem on nonopen sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.07585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cartan's uniqueness theorem does not hold in general for CR mappings, but it does hold under certain conditions guaranteeing extendibility of CR functions to a fixed neighborhood. These conditions can be defined naturally for a wide class of sets such as local real-analytic subvarieties or subanalytic sets, not just submanifolds. Suppose that $V$ is a locally connected and locally closed subset of ${\mathbb{C}}^n$ such that the hull constructed by contracting analytic discs close to arbitrarily small neighborhoods of a point always contains the point in the interior. Then restrictions of holomorphic functions uniquely extend to a fixed neighborhood of the point. Using this extension, we obtain a version of Cartan's uniqueness theorem for such sets. When $V$ is a real-analytic subvariety, we can generalize the concept of infinitesimal CR automorphism and also prove an analogue of the theorem. As an application of these two results we show that, for circular subvarieties, the only automorphisms, CR or infinitesimal, are linear. Please read the erratum attached at the end for a correct definition of the contracting disc hull.</description>

      <title>K-differentials with prescribed singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the local invariants that a meromorphic $k$-differential on a Riemann surface of genus $g \geq 0$ can have for $k \geq 3$. These local invariants include the orders of zeros and poles, as well as the $k$-residues at the poles. We show that for a given pattern of orders of zeros, there exists, with a few exceptions, a primitive holomorphic $k$-differential having zeros of these orders. In the meromorphic case, for genus $g \geq 1$, every expected tuple appears as a configuration of $k$-residues. On the other hand, for certain strata in genus zero, finitely many tuples (up to simultaneous scaling) do not occur as configurations of $k$-residues for a $k$-differential.</description>

      <title>Bounded pluriharmonic functions and holomorphic functions on Teichm\"uller space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the boundary behavior of bounded pluriharmonic functions on the Teichm\"uller space. We will show a version of the Fatou theorem that every bounded pluriharmonic function admits the radial limits along the Teichm\"uller geodesic rays, and a version of the F. and M. Riesz theorem that the radial limit of a non-constant bounded holomorphic function is not constant on any non-null measurable set on the Bers boundary in terms of the pluriharmonic measure. As a corollary, we obtain the non-ergodicity of the action of the Torelli group for a closed surface of genus $g\ge 2$ on the space of projective measured foliations.</description>

      <title>Teodorescu transform for slice monogenic functions and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past few years, the theory of slice monogenic functions has been developed rapidly mainly motivated by the applications to an elegant functional calculus for non-commuting operators. In this article, we introduce the Teodorescu transform in the theory of slice monogenic functions, which turns out to be the right inverse of a slice Cauchy-Riemann operator. The boundednesses of the Teodorescu transform and its derivatives are investigated as well. A Hodge decomposition of the $\mathcal{L}^p$ space and a generalized Bergman projection are introduced at the end as applications.</description>

      <title>Distinguished varieties in a family of domains associated with spectral interpolation and operator theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.16077v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find characterization for the distinguished varieties in the symmetrized polydisc $\mathbb G_n \; (n\geq 2)$ and thus generalize the work [\textit{J. Funct. Anal.}, 266 (2014), 5779 -- 5800] on $\mathbb G_2$ by the author and Shalit. We show that a distinguished variety $\Lambda$ in $\mathbb G_n$ is a part of an algebraic curve, which is a set-theoretic complete intersection, and that $\Lambda$ can be represented by the Taylor joint spectrum of $n-1$ commuting scalar matrices satisfying certain conditions. An $n$-tuple of commuting Hilbert space operators $(S_1, \dots ,S_{n-1},P)$ for which $\Gamma_n=\overline{\mathbb G_n}$ is a spectral set is called a $\Gamma_n$-contraction. To every $\Gamma_n$-contraction $(S_1, \dots ,S_{n-1},P)$ there is a unique operator tuple $(F_1, \dots , F_{n-1})$, called the $\mathcal F_O$-tuple of $(S_1, \dots ,S_{n-1},P)$, satisfying \[ S_i-S_{n-i}^*P=D_PF_iD_P \,,\quad i=1, \dots ,n-1. \] We produce concrete functional model for the pure isometric-operator tuples associated with $\Gamma_n$ and by an application of that model we establish that the $\Gamma_n$-contractions $(S_1, \dots ,S_{n-1},P)$ and $(S_1^*, \dots , S_{n-1}^*,P^*)$ admit normal $\partial \overline{ \Lambda}_{\Sigma}-$dilations for a unique distinguished variety $\Lambda_{\Sigma}$ in $\mathbb G_n$, when $\Lambda_{\Sigma}$ is determined by the $\mathcal F_O$-tuple of $(S_1, \dots ,S_{n-1}, P)$. Further, we show that the dilation of $(S_1^*, \dots ,S_{n-1}^*,P^*)$ is minimal and acts on the minimal unitary dilation space of $P^*$. Also, we show interplay between the distinguished varieties in $\mathbb G_2$ and $\mathbb G_{3}$.</description>

      <title>Minimal isometric dilations and operator models for the polydisc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11391v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For commuting contractions $T_1,\dots ,T_n$ acting on a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ with $T=\prod_{i=1}^n T_i$, we find a necessary and sufficient condition under which $(T_1,\dots ,T_n)$ dilates to commuting isometries $(V_1,\dots ,V_n)$ on the minimal isometric dilation space $T$, where $V=\prod_{i=1}^nV_i$ is the minimal isometric dilation of $T$. We construct both Sch$\ddot{a}$ffer and Sz. Nagy-Foias type isometric dilations for $(T_1,\dots ,T_n)$ on the minimal dilation spaces of $T$. Also, a different dilation is constructed when the product $T$ is a $C._0$ contraction, that is ${T^*}^n \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. As a consequence of these dilation theorems we obtain different functional models for $(T_1,\dots ,T_n)$ in terms of multiplication operators on vectorial Hardy spaces. One notable fact about our models is that the multipliers are analytic functions in one variable. The dilation, when $T$ is a $C._0$ contraction, leads to a conditional factorization of a $T$. Several examples have been constructed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bakker, Brunebarbe, Tsimerman showed in \cite{bakker2022minimal} that the definable structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^n}$ of $\mathbb{C}^n$ is a coherent $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^n}$-module as a sheaf on the site $\underline{\mathbb{C}^n}$, where the coverings are finite coverings by definable open sets. In general, let $\mathcal{K}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. We give another proof of the coherence of $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{K}^n}$ as a sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{K}^n}$-modules on the site $\underline{\mathcal{K}^n}$ using spectral topology on the type space $S_n(\mathcal{K})$. (Here $S_n(\mathcal{K})$ means $S_{2n}(\mathcal{R})$ for some real closed field $\mathcal{R}$.) It also gives an example of how the intuition that sheaves on the type space are the same as sheaves on the site with finite coverings (see \cite[Proposition~3.2]{edmundo2006sheaf}) can be applied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multiplicity-free representations of Lie groups over a quasi-symmetric Siegel domain, with a focus on certain two-step nilpotent Lie groups. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the multiplicity-freeness property to hold. Specifically, we establish the equivalence between the disjointness of irreducible unitary representations realized over the domain, the multiplicity-freeness of the unitary representation on the Bergman space, and the coisotropicity of the group action.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be the free group $F_k$ of $k$ generators, $k \geq 2$, resp. the fundamental group $\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$ of a closed, connnected, orientatble surface of genus $g \geq 2$. We show that the charater variety of irreducible, resp. Zariski dense, Anosov representations of $\Gamma$ into $\SL(n, \C)$ is a complex manifold of (complex) dimension $(k-1)(n^2-1)$, resp. $(2g-2) (n^2-1)$. For $\Gamma=\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$, we also show that these character varieties are holomorphic symplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Black Holes, Complex Curves, and Graph Theory: Revising a Conjecture by Kasner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ratios $\sqrt{8/9}=2\sqrt{2}/3\approx 0.9428$ and $\sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866$ appear in various contexts of black hole physics, as values of the charge-to-mass ratio $Q/M$ or the rotation parameter $a/M$ for Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black holes, respectively. In this work, in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, I relate these ratios with the quantization of the horizon area, or equivalently of the entropy. Furthermore, these ratios are related to a century-old work of Kasner, in which he conjectured that certain sequences arising from complex analysis may have a quantum interpretation. These numbers also appear in the case of Kerr black holes, but the explanation is not as straightforward. The Kasner ratio may also be relevant for understanding the random matrix and random graph approaches to black hole physics, such as fast scrambling of quantum information, via a bound related to Ramanujan graph. Intriguingly, some other pure mathematical problems in complex analysis, notably complex interpolation in the unit disk, appear to share some mathematical expressions with the black hole problem and thus also involve the Kasner ratio.</description>
