      <title>Brownian thermal birefringent noise due to non-diagonal anisotropic photoelastic effect in multilayer coated mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal noise in the mirror coatings limits the accuracy of today's most optical precision measurement experiments. Unlike the more commonly discussed thermal phase noise, the crystalline coating can generate thermal birefringent noise due to its anisotropic nature. In this study, we propose that the non-diagonal anisotropic photoelastic effect induced by the Brownian motion of mirror coating layers may contribute to this noise. Employing a standard model for the coating surface, we calculate the spectrum of the non-diagonal anisotropic Brownian photoelastic(NABP) noise to be $1.2 \times 10^{-11} p_{63} f^{-1/2}/\rm{Hz}^{1/2}$. Further experiments are warranted to validate the influence of this effect and reduce its uncertainty. Our findings highlight that for high-precision experiments involving optical resonant cavities targeting signals imprinted in optical polarizations, this noise could emerge as a limiting factor for experimental sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Mid-Infrared Hyperspectral Microscopy with Broadband 1-GHz Dual Frequency Combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared microscopy is an important tool for biological analyses, allowing a direct probe of molecular bonds in their low energy landscape. In addition to the label-free extraction of spectroscopic information, the application of broadband sources can provide a third dimension of chemical specificity. However, to enable widespread deployment, mid-infrared microscopy platforms need to be compact and robust while offering high speed, broad bandwidth and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this study, we experimentally showcase the integration of a broadband, high-repetition-rate dual-comb spectrometer (DCS) in the mid-infrared range with a scanning microscope. We employ a set of 1-GHz mid-infrared frequency combs, demonstrating their capability for high-speed and broadband hyperspectral imaging of polymers and ovarian tissue. The system covers 1000 $\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ at $\mathrm{\nu_c=2941 \; cm^{-1}}$ with 12.86 kHz spectra acquisition rate and 5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ spatial resolution. Taken together, our experiments and analysis elucidate the trade-off between bandwidth and speed in DCS as it relates to microscopy. This provides a roadmap for the future advancement and application of high-repetition-rate DCS hyperspectral imaging.</description>

      <title>Sub-millisecond electric field sensing with an individual rare-earth doped ferroelectric nanocrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of electrical signals within neuronal assemblies is crucial to unraveling complex brain function. Despite recent advances in employing optically active nanostructures in transmembrane potential sensing, there remains room for improvement in terms of response time and sensitivity. Here, we report the development of such a nanosensor capable of detecting electric fields with a submillisecond response time at the single particle level. We achieve this by using ferroelectric nanocrystals doped with rare earth ions producing upconversion (UC). When such a nanocrystal experiences a variation of surrounding electric potential, its surface charge density changes, inducing electric polarization modifications that vary, via converse piezoelectric effect, the crystal field around the ions. The latter variation is finally converted into UC spectral changes, enabling optical detection of electric potential. To develop such a sensor, we synthesized erbium and ytterbium-doped barium titanate crystals of size $\approx160$ nm. We observed distinct changes in the UC spectrum when individual nanocrystals were subjected to an external field via a conductive AFM tip, with a response time of 100 $\mu$s. Furthermore, our sensor exhibits a sensitivity to electric fields of only 4.8 kV/cm/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$, making possible the time-resolved detection of a neuron action potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed a multilayered self-adaptive absorber/emitter metamaterial, which can smartly switch between a solar absorber and a radiative cooler based on temperature change. The switching capability is facilitated by the phase change material and the structure is optimized by machine learning. Our design not only advances the machine-learning-based development of metamaterials but also has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions and contribute to the goal of achieving carbon neutrality.</description>

Abstract: Time is, figuratively and literally, becoming the new dimension for crystalline matter. As such, rapid recent progress on time-varying media gave rise to the notion of temporal and spatiotemporal crystals. Fundamentally rethinking the role of time, which, in contrast to space exhibits a unique unidirectionality often referred to as the arrow of time, promises a new dimension also for topological physics. Here, we enter the new realm of time and spacetime topology: Firstly, we implement a time-topological time interface state. Secondly, we propose and observe a spacetime-topological event and demonstrate unique features like its limited collapse under disorder and causality-suppressed coupling. The new paradigms of time and spacetime topology unveil a distinctive role of causality and non-Hermiticity in topology and pave the way towards topological spatiotemporal wave control with unique robustness.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Second-Harmonic Generation in Thin-Film Lithium Niobate Bragg Nanocavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order nonlinearity gives rise to many distinctive physical phenomena, e.g., second-harmonic generation (SHG), which plays an important role in fundamental science and various applications. Lithium niobate, one of the most widely used nonlinear crystals, exhibits strong second-order nonlinear effects and electro-optic properties. However, its moderate refractive index and etching sidewall angle limit its capability in confining light into nanoscales, restricting its application in nanophotonics. Here, we exploit nanocavities formed by second-order circular Bragg gratings (CBG), which support resonant anapole modes to achieve highly enhanced SHG in thin film lithium niobate (TFLN). The CBG nanocavity exhibits a record-high normalized conversion efficiency of $1.21\times 10^{-2}\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{GW}$ under the pump intensity of $1.9$ $\mathrm{MW}/\mathrm{cm}^2$. An SHG enhancement of $420,000$ is realized compared to TFLN. In addition to circular CBGs, we also show s- and p-polarization independent SHG in elliptical Bragg nanocavities. This work could inspire studying nonlinear optics at the nanoscale on TFLN as well as other novel photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Hypermultiplexed off-chip hologram by on-chip integrated metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The waveguide-integrated metasurface introduces a novel photonic chip capable of converting guided modes into free-space light. This enables functions such as off-chip beam focusing, steering, and imaging. The challenge lies in achieving hypermultiplexing across diverse parameters, including guided-wave mode type, direction, polarization, and notably, multiple wavelengths. Here, we introduce a comprehensive end-to-end inverse design framework, rooted in a physical model, for the multifunctional design of on-chip metasurfaces. This framework allows for metasurface optimization through a target-field-driven iteration process. We demonstrate a hypermultiplexed on-chip metasurface capable of generating red-green-blue holograms at multiple target planes, with both independent and cooperative control over guided-wave direction. Significantly, the proposed method streamlines the design process utilizing only the positions of meta-atoms as the design variable. We demonstrate 9 independent holographic channels through a combination of wavelength and distance multiplexing. Moreover, by incorporating the excitation direction into the design, the metasurface produces a total of 36 distinct holograms. The robustness of these results against fabrication discrepancies is validated through 3D full-wave electromagnetic simulations, aligning well with advanced manufacturing techniques. Our research presents a universal design framework for the development of multifunctional on-chip metasurfaces, opening up new avenues for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, reflection matrix microscopy (RMM) and advanced image reconstruction algorithms have emerged to address the fundamental imaging depth limitations of optical microscopy in thick biological tissues and complex media. In this study, we introduce significant advancements in reflection matrix processing algorithms, including logical indexing, power iterations, and low-frequency blocking. These enhance the processing speed of aperture synthesis, 3D image reconstruction, and aberration correction by orders of magnitude. Detailed algorithm implementations, along with experimental data, are provided to facilitate the widespread adoption of RMM in various deep-tissue imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Attoliter Mie Void Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional nanophotonic sensing schemes utilize evanescent fields in dielectric or metallic nanoparticles, which confine far-field radiation in dispersive and lossy media. Apart from the lack of a well-defined sensing volume that can be accompanied by moderate sensitivities, these structures suffer from the generally limited access to the modal field, which is key for sensing performance. Recently, a novel strategy for dielectric nanophotonics has been demonstrated, namely, the resonant confinement of light in air. So-called Mie voids created in high-index dielectric host materials support localized resonant modes with exceptional properties. In particular, due to the confinement in air, these structures benefit from the full access to the modal field inside the void. We utilize these Mie voids for refractive index sensing in single voids with volumes down to 100 attoliters and sensitivities on the order of 400 nm per refractive index unit. Taking the signal-to-noise ratio of our measurements into account, we demonstrate detection of refractive index changes as small as 6.9 x 10-4 in a defined volume of just 850 attoliters. The combination of our Mie void sensor platform with appropriate surface functionalization will even enable specificity to biological or other analytes of interest, as the sensing volumes are on the order of cellular signaling chemicals of single vesicles in cellular synapses.</description>

      <title>High Spectral-Efficiency, Ultra-low MIMO SDM Transmission over a Field-Deployed Multi-Core OAM Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-mode multi-core fiber (FM-MCF) based Space-Division Multiplexing (SDM) systems possess the potential to maximize the number of multiplexed spatial channels per fiber by harnessing both the space (fiber cores) and mode (optical mode per core) dimensions. However, to date, no SDM transmissions over field-deployed FM-MCFs in realistic outdoor settings have been reported, which contrasts with SDM schemes demonstrated using single-mode multi-core fibers (SM-MCFs) installed in practical fiber cable ducts. In this paper, we present the successful demonstration of bidirectional SDM transmission over a 5-km field-deployed seven ring-core fiber (7-RCF) with a cladding diameter of 178 ${\mu}$m, achieving a Spectral Efficiency (SE) of 2$\times$201.6 bit/s/Hz. This work establishes a new record for the highest SE attained in SDM demonstrations utilizing field-deployed fiber cables, achieving an approximate 10x increase compared to the SE of reported field-deployed optical fiber cable transmission systems. Notably, these results are realized through the utilization of small-scale modular 4$\times$4 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing with a time-domain equalization (TDE) tap number not exceeding 15, maintaining a complexity per unit capacity comparable to that of MIMO equalization in SDM demonstrations employing weakly coupled SM-MCF cables. These results underscore the significant potential for achieving heightened SE and expanding capacity per individual fiber using SDM techniques in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Machine learning driven high-resolution Raman spectral generation for accurate molecular feature recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through the probing of light-matter interactions, Raman spectroscopy provides invaluable insights into the composition, structure, and dynamics of materials, and obtaining such data from portable and cheap instruments is of immense practical relevance. Here, we propose the integration of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with low-resolution Raman spectroscopy with a portable hand-held spectrometer to facilitate concurrent spectral analysis and compound classification. Portable spectrometers generally have a lower resolution, and the Raman signal is usually buried under the background noise. The GAN-based model could not only generate high-resolution data but also reduced the spectral noise significantly. The generated data was used further to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based model for the classification of organic and pharmaceutical drug molecules. The high-resolution generated Raman data was subsequently used for spectral barcoding for identification of the pharmaceutical drugs. GAN also demonstrated enhanced robustness in extracting weak signals compared to conventional noise removal methods. This integrated system holds the potential for achieving accurate and real-time monitoring of noisy inputs to obtain high throughput output, thereby opening new avenues for applications in different domains. This synergy between spectroscopy and machine learning (ML) facilitates improved data processing, noise reduction, and feature extraction and opens avenues for predictive modeling and automated decision-making using cost-effective portable devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By considering a single lossy three-dimensional cavity mode and using a quasinormal mode expansion for the photonic medium, we show that the frequency-dependence of the coupling between the cavity and its reservoir is dependent on both the cavity contents and the gauge used. For the case of coupling to a single quantum dipole, we identify the form of the spectral density, revealing a $\sim \omega^{-1}$ prefactor scaling, as well as a spatially-dependent contribution. We thus establish the correct quantum form for the cavity-reservoir interaction and show its significant impact on broadband strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Many-body effects on high-harmonic generation in Hubbard ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how many-body effects associated with background spin dynamics control the high-harmonic generation (HHG) in Mott insulators by analyzing the two-leg ladder Hubbard model. Spin dynamics activated by the interchain hopping $t_y$ drastically modifies the HHG features. When two chains are decoupled ($t_y=0$), HHG originates from the dynamics of coherent doublon-holon pairs because of spin-charge separation. With increasing $t_y$, the doublon-holon pairs lose their coherence due to their interchain hopping and resultant spin-strings. Furthermore, the HHG signal from spin-polarons -- charges dressed by spin clouds -- leads to an additional plateau in the HHG spectrum. For large $t_y$, we identify unconventional HHG processes involving $three$ elementary excitations -- two polarons and one magnon. Our results demonstrate the nontrivial nature of HHG in strongly correlated systems, and its qualitative differences to conventional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Rotational Cavity Optomechanics Using Atomic Superfluid in a Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid optomechanical system containing an annularly trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside an optical cavity driven by Lauguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes. Spiral phase elements serve as the end mirrors of the cavity such that the rear mirror oscillates torsionally about the cavity axis through a clamped support. As described earlier in a related system [P. Kumar et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 113601 (2021)], the condensate atoms interact with the optical cavity modes carrying orbital angular momentum which create two atomic side modes. We observe three peaks in the output noise spectrum corresponding to the atomic side modes and rotating mirror frequencies, respectively. We find that the trapped BEC's rotation reduces quantum fluctuations at the mirror's resonance frequency. We also find that the atomic side modes-cavity coupling and the optorotational coupling can produce bipartite and tripartite entanglements between various constituents of our hybrid system. We reduce the frequency difference between the side modes and the mirror by tuning the drive field's topological charge and the condensate atoms' rotation. When the atomic side modes become degenerate with the mirror, the stationary entanglement between the cavity and the mirror mode diminishes due to the suppression of cooling. Our proposal, which combines atomic superfluid circulation with mechanical rotation, provides a versatile platform for reducing quantum fluctuations and producing macroscopic entanglement with experimentally realizable parameters.</description>

      <title>Suppression of noise in separation estimation of optical sources with spatial-mode demultiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial mode demultiplexing was proved to be a successful tool for estimation of the separation between incoherent sources, allowing for sensitivity much below the Rayleigh limit. However, with the presence of measurement's noise, superresolution brought by this technique deteriorates rapidly. On a formal ground, this can be seen in terms of, so called, Rayleigh curse known from direct imaging, which while being absent for ideal spatial mode demultiplexing, goes back in a noisy scenario. In this article, we introduce a procedure to suppress the destructive effect of the noise, proposing a procedure effectively working as an error correction. For noise models given by a random unitary channel generated by a polynomial of creation and annihilation operators, we demonstrate that perfect noise decoupling can be reached by repeating the mode demultiplexers and intervening them by a group of rotations, in the limit of a large number of repetitions and small noise strength. For a special case of displacement noise, our solution is simplified: by using the demultiplexer twice, and interlacing it by a parity operator, given that the noise configuration is frozen between the first and the second step, a perfect decoupling can be achieved. This allows for a recovery of superresolution for a special class of noise generated by displacement operators. Furthermore, for a strong noise correlation between these two steps, our protocol provides an improved measurement resolution.</description>

      <title>Guided Waves in Static Curved Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the propagation of electromagnetic waves in waveguides within static curved spacetimes. We develop a covariant formalism using Hertzian potentials to describe guided electromagnetic modes in spacetimes with metrics that depend on the proper length along the waveguide axis. The Maxwell equations are solved using a Hertzian potential ansatz, resulting in wave equations for TE and TM modes. We analyze the axial and transverse components of the solutions and derive expressions for the cutoff frequency and guide wavelength. The special case of TEM modes is also examined. As an illustrative example, we apply the formalism to radial propagation in Schwarzschild spacetime. This work provides a framework for studying guided electromagnetic waves in curved spacetime geometries, opening up potential applications in precision tests of general relativity and relativistic quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of Polarized Light and Temperature with a Refractive Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we propose a numerical algorithm to compute the intensity and polarization of a polychromatic electromagnetic radiation crossing a medium with graded refractive index and modeled by the Vector Radiative Refractive Transfer Equations (VRRTE). Special attention is given to the case where the refractive index has a discontinuity for which the Fresnel conditions are necessary. We assume that the only spatial variable of interest is the altitude (stratified medium). An algorithm based on iterations of the sources is shown to be monotone and convergent. Numerical examples are given with highly varying absorption coefficient kappa and Rayleigh scattering as in the Earth atmosphere. To study the effect of CO2 in the atmosphere kappa is changed in the frequency ranges where CO2 is absorbing.</description>

Abstract: We report on microlasers based on high-quality micropillars with lasing on whispering-gallery modes. Usage of low-absorbing Al$\scriptsize 0.2$Ga$\scriptsize 0.8$As\Al$\scriptsize 0.9$Ga$\scriptsize 0.1$As distributed Bragg reflectors as well as the smooth pillar sidewalls allows us to realize whispering-gallery modes lasing by excitation and collection of emission in the pillar axis direction. As a result, simultaneous whispering gallery modes lasing (comb-like structure) in the wavelength range of 930-970 nm is observed for 3-7 $\mu$m pillar diameters. Increase the temperature up to 130 K results single-mode lasing for 5 $\mu$m pillars with about 8000 cold cavity quality-factor and 240 $\mu$W estimated threshold excitation power.</description>

      <title>Global calibration of large-scale photonic integrated circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancing maturity of photonic integrated circuit (PIC) fabrication technology enables the high integration of an increasing number of optical components onto a single chip. With the incremental circuit complexity, the calibration of active phase shifters in a large-scale PIC becomes a crucially important issue. The traditional one-by-one calibration techniques encounter significant hurdles with the propagation of calibration errors, and achieving the decoupling of all phase shifters for independent calibration is not straightforward. To address this issue, we propose a machine-learning approach for globally calibrating the large-scale PIC. Our method utilizes a custom network to simultaneously learn the nonlinear phase-current relations for all thermo-optic phase shifters on the PIC by minimizing the negative likelihood of the measurement datasets. Moreover, the reflectivities of all static beamsplitter components can also be synchronizedly extracted using this calibration method. As an example, a quantum walk PIC with a circuit depth of 12 is calibrated, and a programmable discrete-time quantum walk is experimentally demonstrated. These results will greatly benefit the applications of large-scale PICs in photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Spatial Diversity in Earth-to-Satellite Quantum-Classical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being an integral part of the vision of quantum Internet, Earth-to-satellite (uplink) quantum communications have been considered more challenging than their satellite-to-Earth (downlink) counterparts due to the severe channel-loss fluctuations (fading) induced by atmospheric turbulence. The question of how to address the negative impact of fading on Earth-to-satellite quantum communications remains largely an open issue. In this work, we explore the feasibility of exploiting spatial diversity as a means of fading mitigation in Earth-to-satellite Continuous-Variable (CV) quantum-classical optical communications. We demonstrate, via both our theoretical analyses of quantum-state evolution and our detailed numerical simulations of uplink optical channels, that the use of spatial diversity can improve the effectiveness of entanglement distribution through the use of multiple transmitting ground stations and a single satellite with multiple receiving apertures. We further show that the transfer of both large (classically-encoded) and small (quantum-modulated) coherent states can benefit from the use of diversity over fading channels. Our work represents the first quantitative investigation into the use of spatial diversity for satellite-based quantum communications in the uplink direction, showing under what circumstances this fading-mitigation paradigm, which has been widely adopted in classical communications, can be helpful within the context of Earth-to-satellite CV quantum communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the realization and characterization of a novel magic-wavelength nanofiber-based two-color optical dipole trap that allows us to generate a periodic one-dimensional array of trapping sites with a spacing significantly smaller than half of the resonant wavelength of the cesium D2-line. To this end, we launch a blue-detuned partial standing wave and two red-detuned light fields through the nanofiber. We demonstrate the trapping of atoms in the array and characterize the resulting trap configuration by measuring the trap frequencies in three directions and observe good agreement with theoretical predictions. The implementation of this nanofiber-based optical interface with magic trapping wavelengths and sub-$\lambda/2$ spacing is an important step towards the exploration of novel collective radiative effects such as selective radiance in 1D atomic arrays.</description>

Abstract: Neuromorphic (brain-inspired) photonics leverages photonic chips to accelerate artificial intelligence, offering high-speed and energy efficient solutions for use in RF communication, tensor processing, and data classification. However, the limited physical size of integrated photonic hardware limits network complexity and computational capacity. In light of recent advance in photonic quantum technology, it is natural to utilize quantum exponential speedup to scale photonic neural network capacity without increasing the network size. Here we show a combination of classical network layers with trainable continuous variable quantum circuits yields hybrid networks with improved trainability and accuracy. On a classification task, hybrid networks achieve the same performance when benchmarked against fully classical networks that are twice the size. When the bit precision of the optimized networks is reduced through added noise, the hybrid networks still achieve greater accuracy when evaluated at state of the art bit precision. These hybrid quantum classical networks demonstrate a unique route to improve computational capacity of integrated photonic neural networks without increasing the network size.</description>

Abstract: Modelling the inorganic exciton contribution to 2D hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites is essential to understand their properties and screen for new materials. Here, we combine hybrid density functional theory calculations including spin orbit coupling (SOC) with the experimental relationship between the inorganic band gap and exciton binding energy to predict the inorganic exciton energy. For this purpose, we determine a universal exchange parameter for the HSE06 hybrid functional with SOC for lead-based 2D hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. We further identify a relationship that connects PBE calculations to experiment-quality optical gaps and allows us to generalize the exchange mixing parameter other SOC approximations. Our approach opens the path to screen for 2D hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites with optimized spectra, e.g., for new solar cell or light emitting materials.</description>

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI), two notable phenomena are becoming predominant: the exponential growth of large AI model sizes and the explosion of massive amount of data. Meanwhile, scientific research such as quantum computing and protein synthesis increasingly demand higher computing capacities. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the mechanism and functionality of human brains, uses physical artificial neurons to do computations and is drawing widespread attention. Conventional electronic computing has experienced certain difficulties, particularly concerning the latency, crosstalk, and energy consumption of digital processors. As the Moore's law approaches its terminus, there is a urgent need for alternative computing architectures that can satisfy this growing computing demand and break through the von Neumann model. Recently, the expansion of optoelectronic devices on photonic integration platforms has led to significant growth in photonic computing, where photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have enabled ultrafast artificial neural networks (ANN) with sub-nanosecond latencies, low heat dissipation, and high parallelism. Such non-von Neumann photonic computing systems hold the promise to cater to the escalating requirements of AI and scientific computing. In this review, we study recent advancements in integrated photonic neuromorphic systems, and from the perspective of materials and device engineering, we lay out the scientific and technological breakthroughs necessary to advance the state-of-the-art. In particular, we examine various technologies and devices employed in neuromorphic photonic AI accelerators, spanning from traditional optics to PICs. We evaluate the performances of different designs by energy efficiency in operations per joule (OP/J) and compute density in operations per squared millimeter per ...</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a CMOS-foundry-fabricated piezo-optomechanical photonic integrated circuit platform for ultraviolet and blue wavelengths, using alumina waveguides that are strongly mechanically coupled to monolithically integrated aluminum nitride piezoelectric actuators. Low waveguide losses are measured down to at least 320 nm, where we achieve 1.6 dB/cm. This allows us to demonstrate broadband amplitude modulators based on piezoelectrically actuated MEMS cantilever phase-shifters down to 320 nm, with a high extinction ratio of 30 dB. We further demonstrate the versatility of the platform by designing and demonstrating a modulator that can work with high extinction and low loss at 320 nm and 420 nm, simultaneously, demonstrating control of multiple, disparate wavelengths in one device. We also demonstrate narrow-band resonant racetrack modulators with quality factors of 4.7E5 and a tuning rate of 27.5 MHz/V. These results should open doors for a range of novel applications in UV photonics, quantum science, sensing and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>High-rate intercity quantum key distribution with a semiconductor single-photon source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables the transmission of information that is secure against general attacks by eavesdroppers. The use of on-demand quantum light sources in QKD protocols is expected to help improve security and maximum tolerable loss. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a promising building block for quantum communication applications because of the deterministic emission of single photons with high brightness and low multiphoton contribution. Here we report on the first intercity QKD experiment using a bright deterministic single photon source. A BB84 protocol based on polarisation encoding is realised using the high-rate single photons in the telecommunication C-band emitted from a semiconductor QD embedded in a circular Bragg grating structure. Utilising the 79 km long link with 25.49 dB loss (equivalent to 130 km for the direct-connected optical fibre) between the German cities of Hannover and Braunschweig, a record-high secret key bits per pulse of 4.8 * 10^{-5} with an average quantum bit error ratio of ~ 0.65 % are demonstrated. An asymptotic maximum tolerable loss of 28.11 dB is found, corresponding to a length of 144 km of standard telecommunication fibre. Deterministic semiconductor sources therefore challenge state-of-the-art QKD protocols and have the potential to excel in measurement device independent protocols and quantum repeater applications.</description>

      <title>Collective photon emission in solid state environments: Concatenating non-markovian and markovian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective light emission and multi-qubit dynamics of solid-state quantum emitters are affected both by their coupling to the light field and to lattice vibrations. The effect of phonons on quantum emitters is twofold: polaron formation is described by ultrafast non-markovian dynamics, while slower dephasing is well described by exponential decay. Of the two temperature-dependent processes, the effect of the former on the collective emission and the entanglement decay of emitters is usually not modeled, and also the latter is sometimes neglected. Here we propose and compare two methods that are efficient also for several emitters: the first method concatenates the fast and slow phonon dynamics, and the second is the polaron method. For a single quantum emitter, we show that the dynamical equations are identical in both methods, while predictions for two or more emitters also agree very well. Both of our methods incorporate non-markovian dynamics due to phonons demonstrating the temperature sensitivity of the collective photon emission. Utilizing a simplified markovian model instead may not be accurate enough especially for quantum information applications: for example, we show how the markovian model may considerably overestimate the two-emitter concurrence, except at very low temperatures. Our concatenation and polaron methods can be applied to an arbitrary number and type of quantum emitters, and beyond the bulk GaAs environment that we consider here. Especially the concatenation method can take phonon effects into account at the same computational cost as modelling the emitter-photon interaction alone. Finally, we present approximate analytical expressions for the collective emission spectrum for $N$ emitters on a one-dimensional chain.</description>

Abstract: The technique of stimulated emission tomography (SET) provides excellent characterization of SPDC sources of bi-photon states since it increases the average number of photons detected by several orders of magnitude than the traditional coincidence counting method. In a SET experiment, the signal caused by the vacuum fluctuation in SPDC is replaced by a more intense prepared seed with the same mode properties, resulting in an amplification of the corresponding idler. Based on this idea, our experiment uses the difference frequency generation (DFG), a purely classical second-order nonlinear process, to measure the orbital angular momentum (OAM) spectrum of an entangled photon pair produced by a Type-II SPDC crystal. We inject the seed beam at 780 nm with different Laguerre-Gaussian modes together with a pump beam at 405 nm into a Type-II BBO crystal and measure the Laguerre-Gaussian mode distribution of the idler at 842 nm. We observe a strong idler production and good agreement with the theoretical prediction of the OAM spectrum. We expect that this experiment paves the way for the efficient measurement of bi-photon wavefunctions produced by ultra-thin SPDC sources and also the characterization of high-dimensional entangled photon pairs produced in SPDC.</description>

Abstract: The commercially available 4000-Watt continuous-wave Erbium-doped-fiber laser, emitting at the 1567-nanometer wavelength where the atmosphere has high transmission, provides an opportunity for harvesting electric power at remote off the grid locations using a multi-module photovoltaic receiver panel. This paper proposes a 32-element monocrystalline thick-layer Germanium photovoltaic panel for efficient harvesting of a collimated 1.13-meter-diameter beam.The 0.78-meter squared PV panel is constructed from commercial Ge wafers. For incident continuous-wave laser-beam power in the 4000 to 10000 Watt range, our thermal and electrical and infrared simulations predict 660 to 1510 Watts of electrical output at panel temperatures of 350 to 423 Kelvin.</description>

Abstract: High-performance photonic switches are essential for large-scale optical routing for AI large models and Internet of things. Realizing nonvolatility can further reduce power consumption and expand application scenarios. We propose a nonvolatile 2*2 silicon photonic micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) switch compatible with standard silicon photonic foundry processes. The switch employs electrostatic comb actuator to change the air gap of the compact horizontal adiabatic coupler and achieves nonvolatility with centrally-clamped stepped bistable mechanical beams. The photonic switch features a 10s us-scale switching speed and a 10s fJ-scale simulated switching energy within a 100*100 um2 footprint, with &lt;=26 V driving voltages. This 2*2 switch can be used in a variety of topologies for large-scale photonic switches, and its nonvolatility can potentially support future photonic FPGA designs.</description>
