      <title>Eshelby-based homogenization schemes with finite circular cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commonly, for homogenization of fibrous media, fibers are approximated by ellipsoidal inclusions. Indeed, the solution of Eshelby's problem for an ellipsoid is well-known analytically. However, for a cylinder, the analytical solution is not easy to compute, and the internal field is not uniform (which makes the Hill tensor useless). We here propose to give some tools for computing main homogenization schemes based on Eshelby's problem, for finite circular cylinders. This document is also a companion to [1], where homogenization schemes like Dilute Scheme, Mori-Tanaka scheme [2] and Ponte Casta{\~n}eda and Willis scheme [3] are used.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Coupling between Magnetic Gears</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the complex nonlinear coupling of magnetic gears arranged in proximity on a plane. Acknowledging the rich array of geometric and electromagnetic parameters involved, we initiate our exploration with a simplified model. By nondimensionalizing the key variables, we derive a novel nonlinear dynamics framework that abstracts away electromagnetic dependencies. Our approach includes analatic results, numerical simulations and experimental validation, emphasizing two distinct operational modes: free motion and constant driving motion. The findings highlight the intricate behaviors arising from these interactions, contributing to a deeper understanding of magnetic gear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Measurement, self-similarity, and TNT equivalence of blasts from exploding wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced-scale experiments offer a controlled and safe environment for studying the effects of blasts on structures. Traditionally, these experiments rely on the detonation of solid or gaseous explosive mixtures, with only limited understanding of alternative explosive sources. This paper presents a detailed investigation of the blasts produced by exploding aluminum wires for generating shock waves of controlled energy levels. We meticulously design our experiments to ensure a precise quantification of the underlying uncertainties and conduct comprehensive parametric studies.
  We drawn practical relationships of the blast intensity with respect to the stand-off distance and the stored energy levels. The analysis demonstrates self-similarity of blasts with respect to the conventional concept of the scaled distance, a desirable degree of sphericity of the generated shock waves, and high repeatability. Finally, we quantify the equivalence of the reduced-scale blasts from exploding wires with high explosives, including TNT. This experimental setup and the present study demonstrate the high degree of robustness and effectiveness of exploding aluminum wires as a tool for controlled blast generation and reduced-scale structural testing.</description>

      <title>Theoretical foundations of nonlinear electromagneto-mechanical systems: applying Finsler geometry to Kibble Balances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kibble balances are energy-conversion devices currently employed to realize the metrological redefinition of the kilogram unit of mass. The authors, noticing that the literature lacks a fundamental mathematical description of the Kibble balance working principle, propose a differential geometric approach to study general non-linear electromagneto-mechanical systems. Based on the application of Finsler geometry, the mathematical apparatus introduced in the paper is used to analyze the limits of modern Kibble balances, with particular attention to the magnetic design. The authors review the formalism introduced by G. Kron (who proposed a unified theory of electrical machines) and extend it to non-linear systems. Numerical simulations are presented to show the difference between a linear and non-linear analysis of Kibble balance machines, with attention to the hysteretic behaviour of the permanent magnet system.</description>

      <title>The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies based on two incremental collision laws that employ the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis to represent the elastoplastic behavior of the materials of the colliding bodies. These collision laws are the Bouc-Wen-Simon-Hunt-Crossley collision law (BWSHCCL) and the Bouc-Wen-Maxwell collision law (BWMCL). The BWSHCCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with the nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in parallel to a nonlinear displacement-dependent and rate-dependent energy dissipation element. The BWMCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with the nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in series to a linear rate-dependent energy dissipation element. The mathematical models of the collision process are presented in the form of finite-dimensional initial value problems. We show that the models possess favorable analytical properties (e.g., global existence, uniqueness and boundedness of the solutions) under suitable restrictions on the ranges of their parameters. Furthermore, we show that excellent agreement can be achieved between the experimental data and the data from the numerical simulation of the mathematical models across a wide range of initial relative velocities and material properties of the colliding bodies while using parameterizations that are independent of the initial relative velocity.</description>

      <title>Reformulation of Classical Thermodynamics from Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a reformulation of classical equilibrium thermodynamics by replacing the obscure and ambiguous concept of entropy with the clear and intuitive concept of information stored in a thermodynamic system. Specifically, we rewrite the laws of thermodynamics in the mathematical terminology borrowed from information theory with an emphasis on information instead of entropy and on binary logarithm instead of natural one. We also define a modified ideal gas constant denoted as $\mathcal{R}$ that quantifies the energy cost of storing or retrieving a mole of information. Moreover an application to the ideal gas is carried and new insight on the evolution of the system is acquired. This new formulation might serve as a basis to teaching thermodynamics, where one deals with the concept of energy and information both stored in a thermodynamic system and avoids the lack of cognitive representations inherent in the concept of entropy.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures for some dissipative systems from the Jacobi last multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian dynamics describing conservative systems naturally preserves the standard notion of phase-space volume, a result known as the Liouville's theorem which is central to the formulation of classical statistical mechanics. In this paper, we obtain explicit expressions for invariant phase-space measures for certain dissipative systems, namely, systems described by conformal vector fields on symplectic manifolds that are cotangent bundles, contact Hamiltonian systems, and systems of the Li\'enard class with position-dependent damping. The latter class of systems can be described by certain generalized conformal vector fields on the cotangent bundle of the configuration space. The computation of the invariant measures is achieved by calculating the Jacobi last multiplier for the above-mentioned dissipative systems.</description>
