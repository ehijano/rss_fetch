      <title>Separating complexity classes of LCL problems on grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ from the point of view of descriptive set theory, computability theory, and factors of i.i.d. Our results separate various complexity classes that were not previously known to be distinct and serve as counterexamples to a number of natural conjectures in the field.</description>

      <title>A quasianalytic class with weakly smooth germs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [O. Le Gal, J.-P. Rolin. An o-minimal structure which does not admit $C^\infty$ cellular decomposition. In: Ann. Inst. Fourier 59 (2009), pp 543-562], the authors construct an o-minimal structure which does not admit smooth cell-decomposition. We explain in an appendix that their proof of o-minimality is incomplete and we give a complete proof in the main text.</description>

      <title>The rational Gurarii space and its linear isometry group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the linear isometry group of the rational Gurarii space does not have a comeager conjugacy class. This is because the class of partial isometries in rational polyhedral spaces does not have the weak amalgamation property. Our methods demonstrate also that the class of rational polyhedral spaces does not have the Hrushovski property.</description>

      <title>Loops, Inverse Limits and Non-Determinism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an operator on problems in Weihrauch complexity, which we call the inverse limit, and which corresponds to an infinite compositional product. This operation arises naturally whenever one implements algorithms that produce a sequence of results in an infinite loop, using some fixed subroutine. We prove that the corresponding operator is monotone with respect to (strong) Weihrauch reducibility but that it is not a closure operator. One of our findings is that weak K\H{o}nig's lemma is closed under inverse limits, which implies that the class of non-deterministically computable problems is also closed under this operation. Consequently, this class allows for a high degree of flexibility in programming. As our main technical tools, we present an injective version of the recursion theorem and an infinitary version of the so-called independent choice theorem. We also show that, in general, the inverse limit operator is more powerful than the composition of the diamond operator followed by the parallelization operator. However, in many practical scenarios, these compositions yield a result, which coincides with the application of the inverse limit operator. Finally, we discuss the special situation of loops for single-valued problems and for problems on Turing degrees.</description>

      <title>Weihrauch problems as containers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We note that Weihrauch problems can be regarded as containers over the category of projective represented spaces and that Weihrauch reductions correspond exactly to container morphisms. We also show that Bauer's extended Weihrauch degrees and the posetal reflection of containers over partition assemblies are equivalent. Using this characterization, we show how a number of operators over Weihrauch degrees, such as the composition product, also arise naturally from the abstract theory of polynomial functors.</description>

      <title>Twenty years of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, structural Ramsey theory emerged as a new branch of combinatorics. This development came with the isolation of the concepts of the $\mathbf{A}$-Ramsey property and Ramsey class. Following the influential Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il-R\"{o}dl theorem, several Ramsey classes have been identified. In the 1980s Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, inspired by a seminar of Lachlan, discovered a crucial connection between Ramsey classes and Fra\"{\i}ss\'{e} classes and, in his 1989 paper, connected the classification programme of homogeneous structures to structural Ramsey theory. In 2005, Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'{c} revitalized the field by connecting Ramsey classes to topological dynamics. This breakthrough motivated Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il to propose a program for classifying Ramsey classes. We review the progress made on this program in the past two decades, list open problems, and discuss recent extensions to new areas, namely the extension property for partial automorphisms (EPPA), and big Ramsey structures.</description>

      <title>On Ordinal Invariants in Well Quasi Orders and Finite Antichain Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.00428v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ordinal invariants height, length, and width of well quasi orders (WQO), with particular emphasis on width, an invariant of interest for the larger class of orders with finite antichain condition (FAC). We show that the width in the class of FAC orders is completely determined by the width in the class of WQOs, in the sense that if we know how to calculate the width of any WQO then we have a procedure to calculate the width of any given FAC order. We show how the width of WQO orders obtained via some classical constructions can sometimes be computed in a compositional way. In particular, this allows proving that every ordinal can be obtained as the width of some WQO poset. One of the difficult questions is to give a complete formula for the width of Cartesian products of WQOs. Even the width of the product of two ordinals is only known through a complex recursive formula. Although we have not given a complete answer to this question we have advanced the state of knowledge by considering some more complex special cases and in particular by calculating the width of certain products containing three factors. In the course of writing the paper we have discovered that some of the relevant literature was written on cross-purposes and some of the notions re-discovered several times. Therefore we also use the occasion to give a unified presentation of the known results.
  ERRATUM:We incorrectly claimed in Lemma 4.4(1) the formula $o(P\cdot Q)=o(P)\cdot o(Q)$ for wpos $P$ and $Q$ and incorrectly attributed it to Abraham and Bonnet. We incorrectly claimed in 4.4(2) that the formula for $h(P\cdot Q)$ was due to Abraham and Bonnet.</description>

      <title>Model Theory of Hilbert Spaces with a Discrete Group Action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03923v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study expansions of infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces with a unitary representation of a discrete countable group. When the group is finite, we prove the theory of the corresponding expansion is model complete, $\aleph_0$-categorical, $\aleph_0$-stable and SFB. On the other hand, when the group involved is countably infinite, the theory of the Hilbert space expanded by the representation of this group is $\aleph_0$-categorical up to perturbations. Additionally, when the expansion is model complete, we prove that it is $\aleph_0$-stable up to perturbations.</description>

      <title>A Note on Power-OTMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03440v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the computational strength of Power-OTMs, i.e., ordinal Turing machines equipped with a power set operator, and study a notion of realizability based on these machines. When parameters are allowed, these machines are, modulo access to a global well-ordering, equivalent to the Set Register Machines defined by Robert Passmann in \cite{Passmann}, and while most of the results on the realizability of Power-OTMs are analogous to results obtained by Passmann, the settings lead to different results concerning the axiom of choice. As we will see, the computational strength of power-OTMs can, depending on the set-theoretical background, also differ from that of Set Register Machines.</description>

      <title>Topologies of open complemented subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce cs-topologies, or topologies of open complemented subsets, as a new approach to constructive topology that preserves the duality between open and closed subsets of classical topology. Complemented subsets were used successfully by Bishop in his constructive formulation of the Daniell approach to measure and integration. Here we use complemented subsets in topology, in order to describe simultaneously an open set, the first-component of an open complemented subset, together with its given complement as a closed set, the second component of an open complemented subset. We analyse the canonical cs-topology induced by a metric, and we introduce the notion of a modulus of openness for a cs-open subset of a metric space. Pointwise and uniform continuity of functions between metric spaces are formulated with respect to the way these functions inverse open complemented subsets together with their moduli of openness. The addition of moduli of openness in the concept of a complemented open subset, given a base for the cs-topology, makes possible to define the notions of pointwise-like and uniform-like continuity of functions between csb-spaces, that is cs-spaces with a given base.</description>

      <title>On limit models and parametrized noetherian rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20214v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study limit models in the abstract elementary class of modules with embeddings as algebraic objects. We characterize parametrized noetherian rings using the degree of injectivity of certain limit models.
  We show that the number of limit models and how close a ring is from being noetherian are inversely proportional.
  $\textbf{Theorem.}$ Let $n \geq 0$ The following are equivalent.
  1. $R$ is left $(&lt;\aleph_{n } )$-noetherian but not left $(&lt; \aleph_{n -1 })$-noetherian.
  2.The abstract elementary class of modules with embeddings has exactly $n +1$ non-isomorphic $\lambda$-limit models for every $\lambda \geq (\operatorname{card}(R) + \aleph_0)^+$ such that the class is stable in $\lambda$.
  We further show that there are rings such that the abstract elementary class of modules with embeddings has exactly $\kappa$ non-isomorphic $\lambda$-limit models for every infinite cardinal $\kappa$.</description>

      <title>The equational theory of the Weihrauch lattice with (iterated) composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14999v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the equational theory of the Weihrauch lattice with composition and iterations, meaning the collection of equations between terms built from variables, the lattice operations $\sqcup$, $\sqcap$, the composition operator $\star$ and its iteration $(-)^\diamond$ , which are true however we substitute (slightly extended) Weihrauch degrees for the variables. We characterize them using B\"uchi games on finite graphs and give a complete axiomatization that derives them. The term signature and the axiomatization are reminiscent of Kleene algebras, except that we additionally have meets and the lattice operations do not fully distributes over composition. The game characterization also implies that it is decidable whether an equation is universally valid. We give some complexity bounds; in particular, the problem is Pspace-hard in general and we conjecture that it is solvable in Pspace.</description>
