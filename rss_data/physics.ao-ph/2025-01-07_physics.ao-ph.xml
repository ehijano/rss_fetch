      <title>Rotational Flow Dominates Abrupt Seasonal Change in Zonally Asymmetric Tropical Meridional Circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The seasonality of the tropical meridional circulation evolves differently across different regions, governs the onset and retreat of monsoons and migration of tropical precipitation, thereby influencing agricultural productivity and disaster preparedness in the tropics and subtropics. By defining a pseudo meridional overturning streamfunction ({\Psi}pseudo) and defining a new vector-type, dual-component index (ASCI), we diagnose zonally asymmetric abrupt seasonal change (ASC) of tropical meridional circulation. {\Psi}pseudo converges to traditional, meridional overturning streamfunction ({\Psi}m) after being averaged over a zonal circle around any latitude. By applying the Helmholtz decomposition to horizontal velocity fields so as to decompose {\Psi}pseudo into rotational and divergent components, we quantitatively compare the contributions of horizontally rotational and divergent flows to the abrupt seasonal change. We find that the zonal sectors associated with strong deep convection exhibit the most pronounced ASC of tropical meridional circulation, and all of subregions exhibiting ASC contain landmass with low heat inertia. Particularly, in contrast to the case of zonally symmetric Hadley cell, rotational flow, rather than the thermal-direct divergent flow, dominates the zonally asymmetric ASC in the tropics, although the divergent flow also contributes to the ASC over the zonal sectors associated with deep convection. We suggest that the interplay between tropical Rossby-type eddies with extratropical eddies and tropical circulation is essential to the zonally asymmetric ASC of tropical Hadley circulation.</description>

      <title>LWFNet: Coherent Doppler Wind Lidar-Based Network for Wind Field Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate detection of wind fields within the troposphere is essential for atmospheric dynamics research and plays a crucial role in extreme weather forecasting. Coherent Doppler wind lidar (CDWL) is widely regarded as the most suitable technique for high spatial and temporal resolution wind field detection. However, since coherent detection relies heavily on the concentration of aerosol particles, which cause Mie scattering, the received backscattering lidar signal exhibits significantly low intensity at high altitudes. As a result, conventional methods, such as spectral centroid estimation, often fail to produce credible and accurate wind retrieval results in these regions. To address this issue, we propose LWFNet, the first Lidar-based Wind Field (WF) retrieval neural Network, built upon Transformer and the Kolmogorov-Arnold network. Our model is trained solely on targets derived from the traditional wind retrieval algorithm and utilizes radiosonde measurements as the ground truth for test results evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that LWFNet not only extends the maximum wind field detection range but also produces more accurate results, exhibiting a level of precision that surpasses the labeled targets. This phenomenon, which we refer to as super-accuracy, is explored by investigating the potential underlying factors that contribute to this intriguing occurrence. In addition, we compare the performance of LWFNet with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, highlighting its superior effectiveness and capability in high-resolution wind retrieval. LWFNet demonstrates remarkable performance in lidar-based wind field retrieval, setting a benchmark for future research and advancing the development of deep learning models in this domain.</description>

      <title>Analogue Forecast System for Daily Precipitation Prediction Using Autoencoder Feature Extraction: Application in Hong Kong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Hong Kong Observatory, the Analogue Forecast System (AFS) for precipitation has been providing useful reference in predicting possible daily rainfall scenarios for the next 9 days, by identifying historical cases with similar weather patterns to the latest output from the deterministic model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Recent advances in machine learning allow more sophisticated models to be trained using historical data and the patterns of high-impact weather events to be represented more effectively. As such, an enhanced AFS has been developed using the deep learning technique autoencoder. The datasets of the fifth generation of the ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA5) are utilised where more meteorological elements in higher horizontal, vertical and temporal resolutions are available as compared to the previous ECMWF reanalysis products used in the existing AFS. The enhanced AFS features four major steps in generating the daily rain class forecasts: (1) preprocessing of gridded ERA5 and ECMWF model forecast, (2) feature extraction by the pretrained autoencoder, (3) application of optimised feature weightings based on historical cases, and (4) calculation of the final rain class from a weighted ensemble of top analogues. The enhanced AFS demonstrates a consistent and superior performance over the existing AFS, especially in capturing heavy rain cases, during the verification period from 2019 to 2022. This paper presents the detailed formulation of the enhanced AFS and discusses its advantages and limitations in supporting precipitation forecasting in Hong Kong.</description>

      <title>Observations and Theoretical Calculations of 11-Year Cyclic Variations in Lower-Stratospheric Ozone Depletion and Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations and quantitative understanding of spatio-temporary variations in lower-stratospheric ozone and temperature can provide fingerprints for the mechanisms of ozone depletion and play an important role in testing the impact of non-halogen greenhouse gases on the ozone layer in climate models. Here we report from ground-based ozonesonde and satellite-based measurements since the 1960s and 1979 respectively that both lower-stratospheric ozone and temperature display pronounced 11-year cyclic variations over Antarctica and mid-latitudes, while no apparent cyclic variations over the tropics. These observations were unexpected from the chemistry-climate models (CCMs) but predicted by the cosmic-ray-driven electron-induced-reaction (CRE) model of ozone depletion. Remarkably, no-parameter CRE theoretical calculations give the ozone loss vertical profile in perfect agreement with observations at the Antarctic Syowa station and excellently reproduce time-series variations of both lower-stratospheric ozone and temperature in all global regions. Furthermore, the large lower-stratospheric ozone depletion over the tropics in the 1980s and 1990s is also reproduced by CRE calculations. Moreover, CRE calculations exhibit complex phenomena in future trends of lower-stratospheric ozone and temperature, which are strongly affected by the future trends of cosmic-ray fluxes. The latter might even lead to almost no recovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica and no returning to the 1980 level over the tropics by 2100. The results also strikingly demonstrate that both lower-stratospheric ozone and temperature are controlled by cosmic rays and ozone-depleting substances only. This study greatly improves quantitative understanding of ozone depletion and climate in the global lower stratosphere and offers new predictions on future trends.</description>

      <title>LASSE: Learning Active Sampling for Storm Tide Extremes in Non-Stationary Climate Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying tropical cyclones that generate destructive storm tides for risk assessment, such as from large downscaled storm catalogs for climate studies, is often intractable because it entails many expensive Monte Carlo hydrodynamic simulations. Here, we show that surrogate models are promising from accuracy, recall, and precision perspectives, and they "generalize" to novel climate scenarios. We then present an informative online learning approach to rapidly search for extreme storm tide-producing cyclones using only a few hydrodynamic simulations. Starting from a minimal subset of TCs with detailed storm tide hydrodynamic simulations, a surrogate model selects informative data to retrain online and iteratively improves its predictions of damaging TCs. Results on an extensive catalog of downscaled TCs indicate 100% precision in retrieving rare destructive storms using less than 20% of the simulations as training. The informative sampling approach is efficient, scalable to large storm catalogs, and generalizable to climate scenarios.</description>

      <title>Mysterious anomalies in Earth's atmosphere and strongly interacting Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently argued in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} that numerous enigmatic observations remain challenging to explain within the framework of conventional physics. These anomalies include unexpected correlations between temperature variations in the stratosphere, the total electron content of the Earth's atmosphere, and earthquake activity on one hand, and the positions of planets on the other. Decades of collected data provide statistically significant evidence for these observed correlations. The work in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} suggests that these correlations arise from strongly interacting ``streaming invisible matter'' which gets gravitationally focused by the solar system bodies including the Earth's inner mass distribution. Here, we propose that some of these, as well as other anomalies, may be explained by rare yet energetic events involving the so-called axion quark nuggets (AQNs) impacting the Earth. In other words, we identify the ``streaming invisible matter'' conjectured in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} with AQNs, offering a concrete microscopic mechanism to elucidate the observed correlations. It is important to note that the AQN model was originally developed to address the observed similarity between the dark matter and visible matter densities in the Universe \cite{Zhitnitsky:2002qa, Zhitnitsky:2021iwg}, i.e., $\Omega_{\rm DM} \sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ and not explain the anomalies discussed here. Nonetheless, we support our proposal by demonstrating that the intensity and spectral characteristics of AQN-induced events are consistent with the aforementioned puzzling observations.</description>

      <title>AI-powered Digital Twin of the Ocean: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification for Real-time Wave Height Prediction with Deep Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environmental pollution and fossil fuel depletion have prompted the need for renewable energy-based power generation. However, its stability is often challenged by low energy density and non-stationary conditions. Wave energy converters (WECs), in particular, need reliable real-time wave height prediction to address these issues caused by irregular wave patterns, which can lead to the inefficient and unstable operation of WECs. In this study, we propose an AI-powered reliable real-time wave height prediction model that integrates long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for temporal prediction with deep ensemble (DE) for robust uncertainty quantification (UQ), ensuring high accuracy and reliability. To further enhance the reliability, uncertainty calibration is applied, which has proven to significantly improve the quality of the quantified uncertainty. Using real operational data from an oscillating water column-wave energy converter (OWC-WEC) system in Jeju, South Korea, the model achieves notable accuracy (R2 &gt; 0.9), while increasing uncertainty quality by over 50% through simple calibration technique. Furthermore, a comprehensive parametric study is conducted to explore the effects of key model hyperparameters, offering valuable guidelines for diverse operational scenarios, characterized by differences in wavelength, amplitude, and period. These results demonstrate the model's capability to deliver reliable predictions, facilitating digital twin of the ocean.</description>
