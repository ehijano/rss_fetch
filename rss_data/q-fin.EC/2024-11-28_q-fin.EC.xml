      <title>The Impact of Banking Competition on Interest Rates for Household Consumption Loans in the Euro Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of banking competition on interest rates for household consumption loans in the Euro Area from 2014 to 2020. Utilizing a panel data regression approach, we analyze how various factors, including local banking competition, influence the interest rates set by banks across 13 Euro-area countries. Our key independent variable, local banking competition, is measured by the number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults. Control variables include the ECB interest rate, euro exchange rate, real GDP growth rate, inflation rate, unemployment rate, bank business volumes, and country risk. We address potential endogeneity and heterogeneity biases and employ both Fixed Effects and Hausman-Taylor models to ensure robust results. Our findings indicate that higher local banking competition is associated with a slight increase in interest rates for household loans. Additionally, factors such as ECB interest rate, country risk, and euro appreciation significantly affect interest rates. The results offer insights into how competitive dynamics in the banking sector influence borrowing costs for households, providing valuable implications for policymakers and financial institutions in the Euro Area.</description>

      <title>Scale Economies and Aggregate Productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to investigate the link between rising scale economies and stagnating productivity. Our model features heterogeneous firms, imperfect competition, and firm selection. We demonstrate that scale economies generated by fixed costs have distinct impacts on aggregate productivity compared to those driven by returns to scale. Using UK data, we estimate long-run increases in both fixed costs and returns to scale. Our model implies that this should increase aggregate productivity through improved firm selection and resource allocation. However, increasing markups can offset the productivity gain. Higher markups cushion low-productivity firms' revenues, allowing them to survive, and constrain firm output, which limits exploitation of scale economies.</description>

      <title>The Rise and Fall of Ideas' Popularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of contemporary society, the popularity of ideas, opinions, and interests fluctuates rapidly. Traditional dynamical models in social sciences often fail to capture this inherent volatility, attributing changes to exogenous shocks rather than intrinsic features of the system. This paper introduces a novel, tractable model that simulates the natural rise and fall of ideas' popularity, offering a more accurate representation of real-world dynamics. Building upon the SIRS (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered, Susceptible) epidemiological model, we incorporate a feedback mechanism that allows the recovery rate to vary dynamically based on the current state of the system. This modification reflects the cyclical nature of idea adoption and abandonment, driven by social saturation and renewed interest. Our model successfully captures the rapid and recurrent shifts in popularity, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms behind these fluctuations. This approach offers a robust framework for studying the diffusion dynamics of popular ideas, with potential applications across various fields such as marketing, technology adoption, and political movements.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of algorithmic pricing raises concerns of algorithmic collusion. We conduct experiments with algorithmic pricing agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We find that (1) LLM-based agents are adept at pricing tasks, (2) LLM-based pricing agents autonomously collude in oligopoly settings to the detriment of consumers, and (3) variation in seemingly innocuous phrases in LLM instructions ("prompts") may increase collusion. Novel off-path analysis techniques uncover price-war concerns as contributing to these phenomena. Our results extend to auction settings. Our findings uncover unique challenges to any future regulation of LLM-based pricing agents, and black-box pricing agents more broadly.</description>

      <title>A 22 percent increase in the German minimum wage: nothing crazy!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first empirical evidence on the 22 percent increase in the German minimum wage, implemented in 2022, raising it from Euro 9.82 to 10.45 in July and to Euro 12 in October. Leveraging the German Earnings Survey, a large and novel data source comprising around 8 million employee-level observations reported by employers each month, we apply a difference-in-difference-in-differences approach to analyze the policy's impact on hourly wages, monthly earnings, employment, and working hours. Our findings reveal significant positive effects on wages, affirming the policy's intended benefits for low-wage workers. Interestingly, we identify a negative effect on working hours, mainly driven by minijobbers. The hours effect results in an implied labor demand elasticity in terms of the employment volume of -0.2 which only partially offsets the monthly wage gains. We neither observe a negative effect on the individual's employment retention nor the regional employment levels.</description>

      <title>Spatial-temporal evolution characteristics and driving factors of carbon emission prediction in China-research on ARIMA-BP neural network algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: China accounts for one-third of the world's total carbon emissions. How to reach the peak of carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 to ensure the effective realization of the "dual-carbon" target is an important policy orientation at present. Based on the provincial panel data of ARIMA-BP model, this paper shows that the effect of energy consumption intensity effect is the main factor driving the growth of carbon emissions, per capita GDP and energy consumption structure effect are the main factors to inhibit carbon emissions, and the effect of industrial structure and population size effect is relatively small. Based on the research conclusion, the policy suggestions are put forward from the aspects of energy structure, industrial structure, new quality productivity and digital economy.</description>
