      <title>Accelerating Eigenvalue Computation for Nuclear Structure Calculations via Perturbative Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for computing the lowest few eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of a nuclear many-body Hamiltonian represented in a truncated configuration interaction subspace, i.e., the no-core shell model (NCSM). The method uses the hierarchical structure of the NCSM Hamiltonian to partition the Hamiltonian as the sum of two matrices. The first matrix corresponds to the Hamiltonian represented in a small configuration space, whereas the second is viewed as the perturbation to the first matrix. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the first matrix can be computed efficiently. Perturbative corrections to the eigenvectors of the first matrix can be obtained from the solutions of a sequence of linear systems of equations defined in the small configuration space. These correction vectors can be combined with the approximate eigenvectors of the first matrix to construct a subspace from which more accurate approximations of the desired eigenpairs can be obtained. We call this method a Subspace Projection with Perturbative Corrections (SPPC) method. We show by numerical examples that the SPPC method can be more efficient than conventional iterative methods for solving large-scale eigenvalue problems such as the Lanczos, block Lanczos and the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method. The method can also be combined with other methods to avoid convergence stagnation.</description>

      <title>RBMD: A molecular dynamics package enabling to simulate 10 million all-atom particles in a single graphics processing unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a random-batch molecular dynamics (RBMD) package for fast simulations of particle systems at the nano/micro scale. Different from existing packages, the RBMD uses random batch methods for nonbonded interactions of particle systems. The long-range part of Coulomb interactions is calculated in Fourier space by the random batch Ewald algorithm, which achieves linear complexity and superscalability, surpassing classical lattice-based Ewald methods. For the short-range part, the random batch list algorithm is used to construct neighbor lists, significantly reducing both computational and memory costs. The RBMD is implemented on GPU-CPU heterogeneous architectures, with classical force fields for all-atom systems. Benchmark systems are used to validate accuracy and performance of the package. Comparison with the particle-particle particle-mesh method and the Verlet list method in the LAMMPS package is performed on three different NVIDIA GPUs, demonstrating high efficiency of the RBMD on heterogeneous architectures. Our results also show that the RBMD enables simulations on a single GPU with a CPU core up to 10 million particles. Typically, for systems of one million particles, the RBMD allows simulating all-atom systems with a high efficiency of 8.20 ms per step, demonstrating the attractive feature for running large-scale simulations of practical applications on a desktop machine.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic detection of the crystal structures from three-dimensional real-space analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal structure detection from the real-space analysis only is still a big challenge in multiple disciplines due to the absence of exact analytical or computational methods. New types of complex crystal structures seek more involvement of advanced techniques and understandings as well as developing new kinds of machinery. Despite the existence of proper experimental techniques of crystal structure detection, it lacks the exact approach to obtain the complete unit cell information from the three dimensional coordinates only. In this research, we propose an exact prescription to detect the crystal structures in real-space based on the arrangements of the local environment and by searching for the directions of possible translational vectors. The protocol yields good agreements with the experimental results for any simple or complex crystal structures irrespective of the single-component or multi-component systems allowing the complete execution to take a minimal time and computational cost. To the best of our knowledge, this algorithmic prescription can be applied to detect the unit cell of crystal structure and identify the space group across the domains of condensed matter physics and material sciences.</description>

      <title>GRB Progenitor Classification from Gamma-Ray Burst Prompt and Afterglow Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an established classification technique, we leverage standard observations and analyses to predict the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This technique, utilizing support vector machine (SVM) statistics, provides a more nuanced prediction than the previous two-component Gaussian mixture in duration of the prompt gamma-ray emission. Based on further covariance testing from \textit{Fermi}-GBM, \textit{Swift}-BAT, and \textit{Swift}-XRT data, we find that our classification based only on prompt emission properties gives perspective on the recent evidence that mergers and collapsars exist in both long and short GRB populations.</description>

      <title>Understanding chiral charge-density wave by frozen chiral phonon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) is discovered within a wide interval in solids, however, its microscopic nature is still not transparent in most realistic materials, and the recently studied chiral ones with chiral structural distortion remain unclear. In this paper, we try to understand the driving forces of chiral CDW transition by chiral phonons from the electron-phonon coupling scenario. We use the prototypal monolayer 1T-TiSe$_2$ as a case study to unveil the absence of chirality in the CDW transition and propose a general approach, i.e., symmetry-breaking stimuli, to engineer the chirality of CDW in experiments. Inelastic scattering patterns are also studied as a benchmark of chiral CDW (CCDW, which breaks the mirror/inversion symmetry in 2D/3D systems). We notice that the anisotropy changing of Bragg peak profiles, which is contributed by the soft chiral phonons, can show a remarkable signature for CCDW. Our findings pave a path to understanding the CCDW from the chiral phonon perspective, especially in van der Waals materials, and provide a powerful way to manipulate the chirality of CDW.</description>

      <title>Crossed real nodal-line phonons in gold monobromide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetime inversion symmetry can generate intriguing types of spinless excitations in crystalline materials. Here, we propose a topological phase protected by spacetime inversion symmetry - the crossed real nodal line (RNL) in the phonon spectrum of gold monobromide (AuBr). In AuBr, there exist four straight nodal lines, which are linked by a crossed nodal line formed by two lower bands. Remarkably, each adjacent two of the four straight nodal lines is a pair, forming a crossed RNL with nontrivial real Chern number. Such configuration and pairing mode of RNL have never been reported. The crossed RNL exhibits unique surface and hinge states distinguished from that of the conventional RNLs. The symmetry protection and the transformation under the symmetry-preserving strain of the crossed RNL are also investigated. Our results open the door to a new class of topological states, and predict its realization in experimentally synthesized material.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing quantum transport from wave function snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of spin chains by employing principal component analysis (PCA) on data sets of wave function snapshots and examine how information propagates within these data sets. The quantities we employ are derived from the spectrum of the sample second moment matrix, built directly from data sets. Our investigations on several interacting spin chains featuring distinct spin or energy transport reveal that the growth of data information spreading follows the same dynamical exponents as that of the underlying quantum transport of spin or energy. Specifically, our approach enables an easy, data-driven, and importantly interpretable diagnostic to track energy transport with a limited number of samples, which is usually challenging without any assumption on the Hamiltonian form. These observations are obtained at a modest finite size and evolution time, which aligns with experimental and numerical constraints. Our framework directly applies to experimental quantum simulator data sets of dynamics in higher-dimensional systems, where classical simulation methods usually face significant limitations and apply equally to both near- and far-from-equilibrium quenches.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks enable the calculation of turbulence probability distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluid flows has long been a central goal of science and engineering. Yet, even with modern computing technology, accurate simulation of all but the simplest turbulent flow-fields remains impossible: the fields are too chaotic and multi-scaled to directly store them in memory and perform time-evolution. An alternative is to treat turbulence $\textit{probabilistically}$, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Turbulence PDFs are neither chaotic nor multi-scale, but are still challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here we show how to overcome the dimensionality problem by parameterising turbulence PDFs into an extremely compressed format known as a "tensor network" (TN). The TN paradigm enables simulations on single CPU cores that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a $5+1$ dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, respectively, compared to standard finite difference algorithms. A future path is opened towards something heretofore regarded as infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that are useful to describe probabilistically.</description>

      <title>A novel direct Helmholtz solver in inhomogeneous media based on the operator Fourier transform functional calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents novel numerical algorithms based on pseudodifferential operators ($\Psi$DO) for fast, direct solution of the Helmholtz equation in one-, two- and three-dimensional inhomogeneous unbounded media. The proposed approach relies on an Operator Fourier Transform (OFT) representation of $\Psi$DO which frame the problem of computing the inverse Helmholtz operator, with a spatially-dependent wave speed, in terms of two sequential applications of an inverse square root $\Psi$DO. The OFT representation of the action of the square root $\Psi$DO, in turn, can be effected as a superposition of solutions of a pseudo-temporal initial-boundary-value problem for a paraxial equation. The OFT framework offers several advantages over traditional direct and iterative approaches for the solution of the Helmholtz equation. The operator integral transform is amenable to standard quadrature methods and the required pseudo-temporal paraxial equation solutions can be obtained using any suitable numerical method. A specialized quadrature is derived to evaluate the OFT efficiently and an alternating direction implicit method, used in conjunction with standard finite differences, is used to solve the requisite component paraxial equation problems. Numerical studies, in 1, 2, and 3 spatial dimensions, are presented to confirm the expected OFT-based Helmholtz solver convergence rate. In addition, the efficiency and versatility of our proposed approach is demonstrated by tackling nontrivial wave propagation problems, including 2D plane wave scattering from a geometrically complex inhomogeneity, 3D scattering from turbulent channel flow and plane wave transmission through a spherically-symmetric gradient-index acoustic lens. All computations, even the latter lens problem which involves solving the Helmholtz equation with more than one billion complex unknowns, are performed in a single workstation.</description>

      <title>Neuroevolution of Decentralized Decision-Making in N-Bead Swimmers Leads to Scalable and Robust Collective Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many microorganisms are capable of swimming through viscous fluids such as water in order to search for nutrients, swim toward oxygen or light, or to escape from predators. To navigate their environment they often perform large nonreciprocal periodic deformations of their shape, by waving appendages such as cilia or flagella, or by deforming their entire body. Even unicellular organisms are fundamentally made of parts, which need to be cooperatively utilized to allow these creatures to navigate their environment, without using a centralized control mechanism. Here, we investigate the physical implications of decentralized decision-making of the actuators of a generalized N-bead Najafi Golestanian microswimmer, self-propelling via coordinated non-reciprocal swimming strokes. We treat each bead as an artificial neural network-based agent that perceives information about its neighbors and whose actions induce strokes of its adjacent arms. With neuroevolution techniques, we evolve optimal policies for the single-bead decision centers such that the N-bead collective efficiently self-propels as an individual, allowing us to investigate optimal locomotion policies for increasingly large microswimmer bodies. We demonstrate that such decentralized policies are robust and tolerant concerning morphological changes or defects and facilitate cargo transport or drug delivery applications "out of the box", without further optimization. Our approach allows us to train large swimmers ($N=100$ and more), and we show that long-wavelength solutions lead to surprisingly efficient swimming gaits. Our work is of relevance to understand robust locomotion of biological microswimmers, to develop robust artificial microswimmer navigation strategies, and, in a broader conceptional context, for Artificial Life&lt; and in general emergent levels of individuality.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) inspired mixed basis sets for small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success behind many pseudopotential methods such as Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential methods is that these methods are all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips Kleinman and PAW methods we show that there is an all electron formulation. In the all electron formulation there are regular low wavevector basis wave functions and several, specially chosen, high wavevector basis wave functions that are specialized to the atomic environment. Using this as inspiration here we propose a new, PAW method inspired, basis set for small molecules, where we use the recently introduced LO or lo (Localized orbitals) basis set is paired with a Gaussian basis, Gaussian type orbitals (GTO), for a hybrid basis for small molecules. Contracted Gaussian functions are also possible (CGFs). We also show how to extend this idea to Slater basis set, Slater type orbitals (STO), instead of GTO orbitals combined with LO or lo orbitals.</description>
