      <title>Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required to safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarm. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, stimulation is widely used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines classic opinion dynamics with binary phase transition to describe how pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are conceptually meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuees in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to Vicsek model, and it is meaningful to explore complex crowd behavior in social context.</description>

      <title>Coordinating cooperation in stag-hunt game: Emergence of evolutionarily stable procedural rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans are bounded rational at best and this, we argue, has worked in their favour in the hunter-gatherer society where emergence of a coordinated action, leading to cooperation, is otherwise the standard stag-hunt dilemma (when individuals are rational). In line with the fact the humans strive for developing self-reputation by having less propensity to cheat than to be cheated, we observe that the payoff structure of the stag-hunt game appropriately modifies to that of coordination-II game. Subsequently, within the paradigm of evolutionary game theory, we establish that a population -- consisting of procedural rational players (a type of bounded rationality) -- is unequivocally evolutionarily stable against emergence of more rational strategies in coordination-II game. The cooperation is, thus, shown to have been established by evolutionary forces picking less rational individuals.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems on torus related to general Heun equations: phase-lock areas and constriction breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The overdamped Josephson junction in superconductivity theory can be modeled by the family of dynamical systems on the torus, which is known as the RSJ model. This family admits an equivalent description by a family of second-order differential equations: special double confluent Heun equations. In the present paper, we construct two new families of dynamical systems on torus that can be equivalently described by a family of general Heun equations (GHE), with four singular points, and confluent Heun equations, with three singular points. The first family, related to GHE, is a deformation of the RSJ model, which will be denoted by dRSJ. The phase-lock areas of a family of dynamical systems on the torus are those level subsets of the rotation number function that have nonempty interiors. It is known that for the RSJ model, the rotation number quantization effect occurs: phase-lock areas exist only for integer rotation number values. Moreover, each phase-lock area is a chain of domains separated by points. Those separation points that do not lie on the abscissa axis are called constrictions. In the present paper, we study phase-lock areas in the new family dRSJ. The quantization effect remains valid in this family. On the other hand, we show that in the new family dRSJ the constrictions break down.</description>
