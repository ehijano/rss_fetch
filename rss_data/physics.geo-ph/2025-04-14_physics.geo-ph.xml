      <title>Earthquake Declustering Using Supervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthquake catalog declustering is the procedure of separating event clusters from background seismicity, which is an important task in statistical seismology, earthquake forecasting, and probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. Several declustering methods have been introduced in the literature and operate under the supposition that background events occur independently while clusters are triggered by prior events. Here, we test the ability of Supervised Machine Learning (SML) on the declustering problem by leveraging two popular statistical methods. First, the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model is fit to a target catalog and the parameters are used to generate synthetic earthquake data, which replicate the magnitude-space-time seismicity of the target catalog. Next, the Nearest-Neighbour Distance (NND) metrics are computed between each simulated event and used as features to train the SML algorithm. Finally, the trained algorithm is applied to decluster synthetic testing data and then the original target catalog. Our results indicate that SML method performs better than the NND-based and stochastic declustering methods on the test data and makes more nuanced selections of background and clustered events when applied to real seismicity. While the vast majority of the SML technique's predictive power appears to lie within the NND values of the ''first'' nearest-neighbours, a machine learning analysis reveals that predictive accuracy can be improved by additional ''next'' nearest-neighbours and differential magnitude features. The developed approach is applied to seismic catalogs in Southern California and Italy to decluster them.</description>

      <title>Pressure dependence of olivine grain growth at upper mantle conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The grain size of olivine influences mass and heat flux in Earth's upper mantle. We performed annealing experiments on synthetic olivine-pyroxene aggregates (6-13 vol.%) at 1-12 GPa and 1323-1793 K. Grain-size analysis via EBSD reveal an activation volume of $4.8 \times 10^{-6}\ \mathrm{m}^3/\mathrm{mol}$, matching silicon grain-boundary diffusion values. This suggests pressure-driven reduction in olivine growth rates may offset temperature effects at depth, enabling grain-size-sensitive creep at shallower mantle depths than previously modeled.</description>

      <title>CIDR interpolation: an enhanced SSA-based temporal filling framework for restoring continuity in downscaled GRACE(-FO) TWSA products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global total water storage anomaly (TWSA) products derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its Follow-On mission (GRACE-FO) are critical for hydrological research and water resource management. However, persistent data gaps hinder their application in long-term water cycle monitoring. We propose a Correlation-based Iterative and Decompose-Restore (CIDR) interpolation method to address the dual limitations of conventional Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) methods: instability caused by flawed iterative strategy and accuracy degradation due to inadequate denoising. CIDR solves the above issues with two key ways: (i) a correlation-driven iteration stopping rule ensuring the method's overall consistency, and (ii) component-specific interpolation with optimized denoising through a decompose-restore framework. The 0.5{\deg} downscaled GRACE(-FO) TWSA dataset was employed with artificial gaps replicating intra-mission and inter-mission scenarios to evaluate the method's performance. At the grid scale, the global average relative Root Mean Square (rRMS) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) improved by 17.5% and 42.6% compared to the SSA method for intra-mission gaps, and by 18.6% and 27.6% for inter-mission gap interpolation, respectively. In addition, the CIDR method shows a significant improvement over the SSA method within the global basins, with the global basin area-weighted average rRMS improved by 20.3% and 20% for both gaps, respectively. This research is expected to provide an advanced gap-filling method to meet the dual requirements of hydrological and climate research for high spatial resolution and long-term continuous TWSA products, which is universally applicable for other hydrological and geodetic time series.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation; polyhedron reconstruction; 3d scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Not only is the geometry of rock fragments often well approximated by ideal convex polyhedra having few faces and vertices, but these numbers carry vital geophysical information on the fragmentation process. Despite their significance, the identification of the ideal polyhedron has so far been carried out through visual inspection. Here, we present an algorithm capable of performing this task in a reliable manner. The input is a 3D scan of the fragment which is essentially a triangulated polyhedron, which however has often large number of faces and vertices. Our algorithm performs a systematic simplification using the following steps: - Gaussian smoothing is performed on the spherical histogram of the 3D scans faces to identify the most important face orientations. - Planes carrying the faces of the ideal polyhedron are identified as maxima of the smoothed histogram - Polygon is reconstructed using the identified planes - Small faces are removed in a systematic manner We present two versions of the algorithm that we benchmarked the algorithm against a dataset of human measurements on 132 fragments. Beyond identifying the ideal polyhedral approximation for fragments, our method is also capable of tracing backward the shape evolution of rounded pebbles to their origins.</description>

      <title>Multi-MeV electrons observed by CRRES during solar cycle 22</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) observed the response of the Van Allen radiation belts to peak solar activity within solar cycle 22. This study analyses the occurrence and loss timescales of relativistic electrons within the CRRES High Energy Electron Fluxometer (HEEF) dataset, including during several large geomagnetic storms that flooded the slot region with multi-MeV electrons and which allow the first definitive multi-MeV lifetimes to be calculated in this region. The HEEF loss timescales are otherwise broadly in agreement with those from later solar cycles but differences include longer-lasting sub-MeV electrons near the inner region of the outer belt and faster decaying multi-MeV electrons near geosynchronous orbit. These differences are associated with higher levels of geomagnetic activity, a phenomenon that enables the spread in the results to be parameterised accordingly. The timescales generally appear well-bounded by Kp-dependent theoretical predictions but the variability within the spread is however not always well-ordered by geomagnetic activity. This reveals the limits of pitch-angle diffusion in accounting for the decay of elevated electron fluxes following geomagnetic storms.</description>

      <title>Advancing data-driven broadband seismic wavefield simulation with multi-conditional diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse distributions of seismic sensors and sources pose challenges for subsurface imaging, source characterization, and ground motion modeling. While large-N arrays have shown the potential of dense observational data, their deployment over extensive areas is constrained by economic and logistical limitations. Numerical simulations offer an alternative, but modeling realistic wavefields remains computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we develop a multi-conditional diffusion transformer for generating seismic wavefields without requiring prior geological knowledge. Our method produces high-resolution wavefields that accurately capture both amplitude and phase information across diverse source and station configurations. The model first generates amplitude spectra conditioned on input attributes and subsequently refines wavefields through iterative phase optimization. We validate our approach using data from the Geysers geothermal field, demonstrating the generation of wavefields with spatial continuity and fidelity in both spectral amplitude and phase. These synthesized wavefields hold promise for advancing structural imaging and source characterization in seismology.</description>

      <title>Image registration of 2D optical thin sections in a 3D porous medium: Application to a Berea sandstone digital rock image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a systematic image registration approach to align 2D optical thin-section images within a 3D digital rock volume. Using template image matching with differential evolution optimization, we identify the most similar 2D plane in 3D. The method is validated on a synthetic porous medium, achieving exact registration, and applied to Berea sandstone, where it achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.990. With the registered images, we explore upscaling properties based on paired multimodal images, focusing on pore characteristics and effective elastic moduli. The thin-section image reveals 50 % more porosity and submicron pores than the registered CT plane. In addition, bulk and shear moduli from thin sections are 25 % and 30 % lower, respectively, than those derived from CT images. Beyond numerical comparisons, thin sections provide additional geological insights, including cementation, mineral phases, and weathering effects, which are not clear in CT images. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal image registration to improve computed rock properties in digital rock physics by integrating complementary imaging modalities.</description>
