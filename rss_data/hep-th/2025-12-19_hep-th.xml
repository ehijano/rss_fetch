      <title>Sound as a gauge theory and its infrared triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last few decades, there has been a considerable interest on the infrared behavior of various field theories. In particular, the connections between memory effects, asymptotic symmetries, and soft theorems (the ``infrared triangle'') have been explored in much depth within the context of high-energy physics. In this paper, we show how sound also admits an infrared triangle. We consider the linear perturbations of the Euler equations for a barotropic and irrotational fluid and show how low-frequency changes in an acoustic source can lead to lasting displacements of fluid particles. We proceed to write these linear perturbations in terms of a two-form potential -- a Kalb--Ramond field, in the high-energy physics terminology. This phrases linear sound as a gauge theory and thus allows the use of standard techniques to probe the infrared structure of acoustics. We show how the memory effect relates to asymptotic symmetries in this dual formulation, and comment on how these notions can be connected to soft theorems. This exhibits the first example of an infrared triangle in a condensed matter system and provides new pathways to the experimental detection of memory effects.</description>

      <title>On Positive Celestial Geometry: ABHY in the Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Celestial amplitudes are multiple Mellin transforms w.r.t. conformal dimensions. For arbitrary multiplicity $n$ of massless states in sufficiently high space--time dimension $D$ we perform all Mellin integrations and find an associahedron description in celestial space. The latter expresses celestial tree--level $\phi^3$ amplitudes as the canonical forms associated with this positive geometry. This yields a geometric interpretation of celestial amplitudes in terms of the underlying boundary geometry. In particular, distributional support on the celestial sphere is not imposed but arises geometrically. Our universal treatment of Mellin integrals in $D$ dimensions also provides a unified description of celestial amplitudes arising from different bulk theories, including (scalar-scaffolded) gluons and gravitons.</description>

      <title>Quantum microstate counting from Brownian motion: from many-body systems to black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new way to produce infinite families of bases of a quantum system's Hilbert space, as well as methods to find its dimension. These families are constructed via Brownian motions in the Hilbert space, defined using disordered, time-dependent couplings. The dimension spanned by them has zero variance over the ensemble of disordered couplings, and it is determined by certain replica partition functions. We apply these methods to finite dimensional $q$-local systems (spin clusters and SYK) and black holes. For $q$-local systems we find exact expressions at finite $q$, $N$, and $t$, for replica partition functions, together with universal behavior at large times and a semiclassical analysis at large-$N$ in appropriate master field variables. The right Hilbert space dimension is obtained for any time $t&gt;0$, $q&gt;1$ and $N&gt;0$. For black holes, the Brownian motions prepare quantitatively generic ensembles of black hole microstates, and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is universally reproduced by counting those. There the $n$-replica partition functions are constructed by gluing $n$-traversable womrholes at their future and past. This method demonstrates the robustness of black hole microstate counting methods, avoiding several limitations of previous constructions, including the non-genericity of the microstates and associated interiors, implicit statistics of heavy operators, limited microscopic control over overlaps, and the need for specific limits in the calculation.</description>

      <title>Charged black holes in the 1/N expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study some implications of $SU(N)\times U(1)$ theories coupled to gravity in the large-$N$ limit. We find that in theories with quarks transforming as $q\sim (\mathbf{N},1)$, black holes (BH) with charge larger than a critical value approach extremality $(M_{\rm BH}=\sqrt{2} M_{\rm Pl} Q_{\rm BH})$ as they evaporate. This occurs because BHs in this theory can only lose charge by emitting baryons, a process suppressed by a combinatoric factor $e^{-N\log N}$. Once extremality is reached the BH evolution halts for exponentially long times, $\tau_{\rm BH}\gtrsim e^{N\log N}$, without being protected by any symmetry. At times $t\gg\tau_{\rm BH}$ the BH forms a cloud of deconfined quarks around it, a \textit{quark corona}. The quarks are connected to the horizon by strings extending throughout distances that can be much larger than the inverse of the confinement scale, $\Lambda_N^{-1}$. Strikingly, due to energy conservation, these long strings cannot break even for light quarks. These effects can be further enhanced in clockwork-like theories based on Yang-Mills sectors of the type, $SU(N_1)\times SU(N_2)\times ...\times U(1)$. As an application to phenomenology, we give examples where BHs as light as one gram survive until today without evaporating, opening up regions of parameter space for primordial BH dark matter previously excluded by Hawking evaporation. This result relies only on large-$N$ combinatorics and is independent of the radiation mechanism from the BH, particle masses, and confinement scale. The theories we discuss pass non-trivial tests imposed by Swampland conjectures, including completeness of the spectrum as well as the weak gravity conjecture.</description>

      <title>Lanczos Meets Orthogonal Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a direct correspondence between the Lanczos approach and the orthogonal polynomials approach in random matrix theory. In the large-$N$ and continuum limits, the average Lanczos coefficients and the recursion coefficients become equivalent, with the precise mapping $\sqrt{R(x)} = b(1-x)$ and $S(x) = a(1-x)$. As a result, the two formalisms yield identical expressions for the leading density of states. We further analyze the Krylov dynamics associated with the recursion coefficients and show that the orthogonal polynomials admit a natural interpretation as Krylov polynomials. This picture is realized explicitly in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble, where all quantities can be computed analytically.</description>

      <title>On differential operators for scalar-scaffolded gluons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, based on the curve-integral formulation for stringy Tr$\phi^3$ amplitudes, a combinatorial formulation for Yang-Mills amplitudes has been proposed which describes gluons using pairs of scalars and produces the $n$-gluon amplitude from simple kinematical shift of stringy Tr$\phi^3$ amplitudes with $2n$ scalars. It has revealed a variety of new properties and structures even for tree-level gluon amplitudes such as hidden zeros and splits, and in this note we provide another example: we study differential operators acting on Yang-Mills amplitudes with respect to $2n$-scalar kinematic variables, which convert such scalar-scaffolded gluons into scalars. In particular, we find $(n{-}1)$-fold differential operators (using $2n$-scalar variables) that turn the $n$-gluon amplitude into a single planar $\phi^3$ diagram; we then generalize such operators to those that convert $n$ gluons to mixed amplitudes with $r$ scalars and $n{-}r$ gluons (the latter can be viewed as insertions on $\phi^3$ diagrams). We also show that the number of linearly independent mixed amplitudes with $r$ scalars and $n-r$ gluons is given by the number of $\phi^3$ diagrams, the Catalan number $\mathcal{C}_{r-2}$, which can be viewed as a generalization of the ``uniqueness" theorem of gluon amplitudes (with $r=0$). Finally, our construction leads to a planar version of the universal expansion of Yang-Mills amplitudes into a sum of gauge-invariant prefactors built from nested commutators, each accompanied by an mixed amplitude in the natural basis. This formulation significantly reduces the redundancy present in the original expansion.</description>

      <title>Higher-form entanglement asymmetry. Part I. The limits of symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a relative entropy that faithfully diagnoses symmetry breaking in quantum states, possibly within a spatial subregion. In this work, we extend such framework to higher-form symmetries and compute entanglement asymmetry in theories with spontaneously-broken continuous zero- and higher-form symmetries. One of our central results is an entropic Coleman--Mermin--Wagner theorem, for $0$- and $p$-form symmetries, valid also on subregions, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous $p$-form symmetries in spacetime dimensions $d\leq p+2$. Our theorem not only qualifies symmetry breaking, it also quantifies it: spontaneous breaking triggers a nonvanishing entanglement asymmetry that grows monotonically towards the infrared, and counts the number of Goldstone fields. Along the way, we derive standalone results concerning the entanglement entropy of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Unleash $Q$! Cohomology, Localization, and Interpolation in Parisi-Sourlas Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parisi--Sourlas supersymmetric models are known to undergo dimensional reduction; that is, their physics is captured by models in two fewer dimensions. In this work, we revisit dimensional reduction, providing new arguments and reformulating existing proofs in terms of the cohomology of a supercharge $Q$. We obtain three main results. First, we show that the recently developed picture of dimensional reduction via decoupling of operators admits a natural explanation in terms of $Q$-exactness. Second, we provide a new proof of dimensional reduction using the supersymmetric localization argument. Third, we revisit Cardy's ``interpolation'' proof -- which is reminiscent of localization but does not rely on saddle-point methods -- and show that it can be understood as a consequence of deforming the action by a $Q$-exact term. Finally, we show that while existing nonperturbative proofs of dimensional reduction apply only to scalar Lagrangians, our formulation of Cardy's argument extends to any theory with Parisi--Sourlas supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearly Realised Defect Symmetries and Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal defects -- extended objects in conformal field theories -- carry localised excitations inherited from symmetry currents, known as the displacements and tilts. They capture the linear response of the defect to deformations of its shape or of its profile along internal symmetry directions. There is no universal formula for deformations beyond the linear order and this is subject to ambiguities of coordinate choices on coset spaces and scheme dependence in the quantum theory. We analyse the exact match between the two and identify the scheme independent quantities capturing nonlinearly realised symmetries. This leads to universal integral identities for correlation functions in the presence of tilts and displacements. We present several applications of them. We also study possible anomalies, recovering known ones, finding new expressions for them, and uncovering new ones.</description>

      <title>Shockwaves and Time Delays in Einstein-Maxwell Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the shockwave metric in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell effective field theory (EFT) by performing an ultra-relativistic boost of the charged black hole solution accompanied by a rescaling of its mass and charge, including leading order EFT corrections. In contrast to the neutral (Schwarzschild) case, where higher derivative operators leave the shockwave geometry unchanged, we show that electrically charged shockwaves receive nontrivial EFT corrections. We then compute the time delay experienced by a probe photon traversing the resulting charged shockwave. We find that two EFT contributions, the correction to the shockwave geometry and the backreaction induced by the probe photon, are both essential for obtaining a physical time delay that is invariant under field redefinitions of the metric.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a detailed analysis of the disk path integral of timelike Liouville theory, conceived as a tractable and precise toy-model quantum cosmology in two dimensions. Disk path integrals with the insertion of matter field operators, taken along a judiciously chosen complex contour, yield states akin to the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction. Working in the fixed $K$-representation, where $K$ is the trace of the extrinsic curvature, we compute the one-loop wavefunctions and put forward a conjecture for the all-loop expressions. A suitable pairing of Liouville disk path integrals yields a $K$-independent quantity that may form the basis for a well-defined inner product on the space of Euclidean histories. We also consider other ensembles, including one with fixed area, and provide a static patch perspective with a timelike feature.</description>

Abstract: We find a dual description of the supersymmetric $SL(2, \mathbb{C})/SU(2)$ WZW model as a super-winding condensate CFT, which follows simply from the bosonic AdS$_3$ duality found in [arXiv:2104.07233].

      <title>The Use of Torsion in Supergravity Uplifts and Covariant Fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this Thesis is twofold. On the one hand, we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for a maximally supersymmetric supergravity theory in 3D to be a solution of 11D supergravity (but the result is general and also holds for 10D supergravities), with 8 dimensions compactified into a coset space. The used method is based on the formalism of generalised geometry, useful for the study of dualities in string theory and supergravity. The analysis extends the known results to the case in which the duality group of the reduced theory is $E_{8(8)}$, whose generalised geometry is still little understood. On the other hand, we study properties of the so-called covariant fracton gauge theory, computing the BRST cohomology and consistent anomalies, and showing that its solutions describe a specific subsector of an extension of General Relativity, called Moller-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. Covariant fracton theory is the gauge theory of a symmetric rank-2 tensor, invariant under gauge transformations depending on the second derivative of a scalar parameter, and is the Lorentz-covariant extension of the continuous limit of spin-chain theories admitting excitations with reduced mobility (called fractons), due to the conservation of the dipole moment. In both cases, the Weitzenb\"ock torsion plays a crucial r\^ole. The Thesis includes a self-contained review of the main notions needed to understand the original results, comprising, in addition to the already mentioned topics, duality in supergravity theories, the generalised Lie derivative, formulation of eleven-dimensional supergravity suitable to reductions with duality groups given by exceptional Lie groups, salient aspects of three-dimensional gravity, and the BRST formalism for computing anomalies in field theories.</description>

      <title>Anomalies and Parity-Violating Interactions: From Conformal to Thermal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral and conformal anomalies are fundamental phenomena that span multiple disciplines, including high-energy physics, condensed matter theory and cosmology. These anomalies play a crucial role in understanding fundamental interactions and manifest themselves through divergences and traces of correlation functions. In this thesis, we investigate these phenomena within the framework of conformal field theory, elucidating their intricate structure and physical implications. Our primary focus is on the role of conformal Ward identities in fully characterizing parity-odd interactions associated with chiral and conformal anomalies in momentum space. Furthermore, we explore mechanisms that lead to the breaking of conformal invariance, such as finite-temperature and finite-density effects or the presence of a fermion mass, and examine how parity-odd anomalous interactions behave under these conditions. By analyzing these phenomena through the lens of conformal and thermal field theories, we obtain deeper insights into their mathematical structure and their significance across a wide range of physical contexts.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics from the S-matrix reloaded: emergent thermal mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formalism of Dashen, Ma and Bernstein (DMB) expresses the thermal partition function of a system in terms of the S-matrix operator, roughly $Z(\beta) \propto \int dE\, e^{-\beta E}\,\text{Tr}\,\ln S(E),$ where $S$ denotes the full scattering operator on the asymptotic Fock space -- i.e. including all multi-particle sectors -- defined via the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. Recently we have employed this formalism to compute the free energy of flux tubes (essentially a two-dimensional theory of derivatively coupled scalars) and the two-loop $O(\alpha_s)$ QCD thermal free energy. Moving to higher orders, it is well known that at $O(\alpha_s^2)$ in QCD, or e.g. at $O(\lambda^2)$ in $\lambda\phi^4$ theory, the free energy develops IR divergences. These IR divergences are resolved by the screening Debye mass. However, the DMB formalism expresses the free energy in terms of a trace of the S-matrix operator in the vacuum. How, then, does the Debye mass arise in this framework? In this work we address this question, thereby paving the way for higher-order applications of the DMB formalism in relativistic QFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider the construction of the superconformal mechanics that realize $SU(1,1|n)$ and $OSp(6|2)$ symmetries and involve interactions with non-Abelian bosonic currents. If is shown that for $N&gt;4$ supersymmetries the currents involved have to satisfy the algebraic equations. General considerations on methods of solving these equations are given. In the obtained particular solutions currents are expressed in terms of semi-dynamical variables (harmonics), and, on one instance, coordinates and momenta.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Black Hole Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiclassical black hole emission in four spacetime dimensions is studied using a non-local effective action. The field equations that determine the time-dependent renormalized stress tensor are solved numerically for a black hole formed by an ingoing null shock wave, and otherwise smooth initial data. We find that Hawking radiation is generated dynamically near the black hole horizon and freely propagates out to null infinity, resulting in an outgoing energy flux that builds up from zero at early retarded times before the black hole forms. This resolves the long-standing issue of pre-Hawking radiation, suffered by calculations based on a static approximation to the stress tensor in an Unruh state, and paves the way towards four-dimensional black hole evolution with semiclassical back-reaction included.</description>

      <title>Timelike Entanglement Entropy and Renormalization Group Flow Irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study holographic c-theorems based on timelike entanglement entropy and show that a timelike c-function captures irreversible renormalization group (RG) flow. We demonstrate that timelike c-functions are applicable to both relativistic and non-relativistic quantum matter in nematic phases with broken rotational symmetry, and that they remain monotonic even under anisotropic RG flows, thereby passing some of the most stringent consistency tests. Across all classes of theories examined, we find that the null energy condition, thermodynamic stability, and a constraint on an effective spatial dimensionality are jointly sufficient to guarantee monotonicity of the timelike c-function along the RG flow. Moreover, we identify a geometric upper bound on the rate of change of the timelike c-function, which constrains how rapidly effective degrees of freedom can be coarse-grained along the RG flow whenever a timelike c-theorem applies. The applicability of holographic c-theorems is thus extended to highly nontrivial RG flows and points toward a new information-theoretic diagnostic of holographic RG dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trace anomaly and anomaly-induced action are evaluated for the two-dimensional $2D$ vector theory with classical conformal symmetry. Implementing local conformal symmetry while preserving the gauge invariance requires either giving up locality of the classical action or, equivalently, introducing an auxiliary scalar field. The two-dimensional limit in such a theory is singular. However, in the dimensional regularization, the limit $D \to 2$ in the one-loop divergence is smooth. As a result, we arrive at the expression for anomaly, which has a rich general structure, typical for the dimensions $D \geq 4$. For comparison and completeness, we also evaluate anomalies for conformal scalar and fermions, also in the presence of auxiliary external scalars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that quantum field theories in curved spacetime suffer from a number of pathologies, including the inability to relate states on different spatial slices by proper unitary time-evolution operators. In this article, we illustrate this issue by describing the canonical quantisation of a free scalar field in de Sitter space and explicitly demonstrating that the vacuum at a given time slice is unitarily inequivalent to that at any other time. In particular, we find that, if both background and Hamiltonian dynamics are taken into account, this inequivalence holds even for infinitesimally small time steps and not only in the asymptotic time limits.</description>

      <title>The Stretched Horizon Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional general relativity with a positive cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, in the presence of a boundary, $\Gamma$, of finite spatial size. The boundary is located near a cosmological event horizon, and is subject to boundary conditions that fix the conformal class of the induced metric, and, $K$, the trace of the extrinsic curvature along $\Gamma$. The proximity of $\Gamma$ to the horizon is controlled by the dimensionless parameter ${K}{{\Lambda}^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$. We provide an exhaustive analysis of linearised gravitational perturbations for the setup. This is performed both for a $\Gamma$ encasing a portion of the static patch that ends just before the cosmological horizon (pole patch), as well as a $\Gamma$ containing only the region near the cosmological horizon (cosmic patch). In the pole patch, we uncover a layered hierarchy of modes: ordinary normal modes, a novel type of boundary gapless mode, and boundary soft modes of frequency $\omega \approx \pm 2\pi i T_{\text{dS}}$, with $T_{\text{dS}}$ the horizon temperature. Minkowskian behaviour is recovered only for angular momenta $l \gtrsim {K}{{\Lambda}^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$ which can be made parametrically large, thus attenuating previously found growing modes. In the cosmic patch, we uncover sound and shear fluid-dynamical modes that we interpret in terms of a conformal fluid with shear viscosity over entropy density ratio $\tfrac{\eta}{s} = \tfrac{1}{4\pi}$ and vanishing bulk viscosity $\zeta=0$. The fluid dynamical sector is shown to admit a non-linear treatment. We describe a scaling regime in which the stretched horizon gravitational dynamics is dictated by a universal Rindler geometry, independent to the details of the infilling horizon. We briefly discuss quantitative features that distinguish cosmological and black hole horizons away from the Rindler regime.</description>

      <title>Fighting non-locality with non-locality: microcausality and boundary conditions in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In gauge theories, globally charged observables necessarily depend non-locally on the kinematical fields, with this dependence extending to the asymptotic boundary of spacetime. Despite this, we show that a subset of such observables can be consistently regarded as local to the bulk, in a manner that respects microcausality and leaves locality properties of uncharged observables untouched. A sufficient condition for this is to impose kinematically non-local boundary conditions on the large gauge sector of the theory, and to invoke a relational notion of localisation for observables. This reveals a relatively underappreciated link between boundary conditions, and different notions of microcausality and locality. We develop this point through a detailed case study in scalar QED, describing non-local boundary conditions that allow a large family of observables on a codimension-1 bulk surface to be viewed as local to that surface, despite being dressed by asymptotic Wilson lines. We show that this property continues to hold within a perturbative quantisation of the theory, and we argue that this leads to a consistent local net of algebras that includes these charged observables in bulk algebras. We explain how this setup may be understood in terms of a preferred dynamical reference frame for small gauge transformations appearing in the boundary conditions. Many features of the theory (such as microcausality, the vacuum state, and the net of algebras of observables) depend on the choice of this frame, and we briefly discuss some repercussions of this for algebraic formulations of QFT. While our analysis is performed in QED, we expect our results to carry over qualitatively to more complicated theories including gravity.</description>

      <title>The $\mu$-deformed Einstein field equations with $\mu$-dependent effective cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17790v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the $\mu$-deformed Einstein field equations from the generalized thermodynamic functions of the $\mu$-deformed analog of Bose gas model, applying the (adapted) Verlinde's approach. The basic role of deformation parameter is shown: it provides the possibility to vary the value of the cosmological constant. Due to this, we suggest an interesting treatment of the cosmological constant (CC) problem within the framework of $\mu$-deformation. Namely, viewing the derived $\mu$-deformed CC as an effective one and varying the parameter $\mu$ appropriately, we gain the possibility to drastically reduce the CC, so as to get for it the realistic value. The relation to dark matter is of importance.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on 3-forms dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3-forms are natural candidates for describing the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe, as they can inherently reproduce a positive cosmological constant when lacking an evolving potential. When such a potential is present, a 3-form field may exhibit either quintessence-like or phantom-like behaviour. In this paper, we consider a 3-form model with a Gaussian potential, which features stable, ghost-free phantom-like behaviour within its convergence region and leads to an LSBR late-time attractor. We constrain this model observationally by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis employing a comprehensive cosmological dataset, including Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae data, low-$z$ Cepheid calibrators, and DES Y1 large-scale structure observations. We demonstrate that the 3-form model successfully increases the predicted Hubble parameter of CMB and BAO data from $67.89\pm0.36{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ of $\Lambda$CDM model to $68.29^{+0.56}_{-0.61}{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ without fine-tuning of the model parameters, thus reducing the tension with the late-time observation. Furthermore, we verify the sub-dominance of the 3-form field perturbation via both analytical and numerical analyses. Thus, the 3-form field does serve as a promising candidate of phantom-like dark energy from both theoretical and observational points of view.</description>

      <title>Random matrix theory of sparse neuronal networks with heterogeneous timescales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training recurrent neuronal networks consisting of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) units with additive noise for working memory computation slows and diversifies inhibitory timescales, leading to improved task performance that is attributed to emergent marginally stable equilibria [PNAS 122 (2025) e2316745122]. Yet the link between trained network characteristics and their roles in shaping desirable dynamical landscapes remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the Jacobian matrices describing the dynamics near these equilibria and show that they are sparse, non-Hermitian rectangular-block matrices modified by heterogeneous synaptic decay timescales and activation-function gains. We specify a random matrix ensemble that faithfully captures the spectra of trained Jacobian matrices, arising from the inhibitory core - excitatory periphery network motif (pruned E weights, broadly distributed I weights) observed post-training. An analytic theory of this ensemble is developed using statistical field theory methods: a Hermitized resolvent representation of the spectral density processed with a supersymmetry-based treatment in the style of Fyodorov and Mirlin. In this manner, an analytic description of the spectral edge is obtained, relating statistical parameters of the Jacobians (sparsity, weight variances, E/I ratio, and the distributions of timescales and gains) to near-critical features of the equilibria essential for robust working memory computation.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: forecasted constraints on primordial gravitational waves with the expanded array of Small Aperture Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present updated forecasts for the scientific performance of the degree-scale (0.5 deg FWHM at 93 GHz), deep-field survey to be conducted by the Simons Observatory (SO). By 2027, the SO Small Aperture Telescope (SAT) complement will be doubled from three to six telescopes, including a doubling of the detector count in the 93 GHz and 145 GHz channels to 48,160 detectors. Combined with a planned extension of the survey duration to 2035, this expansion will significantly enhance SO's search for a $B$-mode signal in the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background, a potential signature of gravitational waves produced in the very early Universe. Assuming a $1/f$ noise model with knee multipole $\ell_{\rm knee} = 50$ and a moderately complex model for Galactic foregrounds, we forecast a $1\sigma$ (or 68% confidence level) constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of $\sigma_r = 1.2\times10^{-3}$, assuming no primordial $B$-modes are present. This forecast assumes that 70% of the $B$-mode lensing signal can ultimately be removed using high resolution observations from the SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) and overlapping large-scale structure surveys. For more optimistic assumptions regarding foregrounds and noise, and assuming the same level of delensing, this forecast constraint improves to $\sigma_r = 7\times10^{-4}$. These forecasts represent a major improvement in SO's constraining power, being a factor of around 2.5 times better than what could be achieved with the originally planned campaign, which assumed the existing three SATs would conduct a five-year survey.</description>

      <title>Particle Production by Time-Varying Dark Energy and the End of Cosmic Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider various possible consequences of time-varying dark energy due to a quintessence scalar field whose energy density is partially converted to particles as the field evolves down its potential. This particle production acts as a source of thermal friction on the field that can make it difficult to distinguish whether dark energy is due to a radiating field rolling down a steep potential, a purely self-interacting field moving down a flatter potential, or a cosmological constant. By reducing the acceleration of the scalar field, thermal friction increases the amount of accelerated expansion and can cause a sizable bump in the quintessence equation of state. We take special interest in the case where a steep potential rapidly changes from positive to negative as the field evolves, resulting in the end of cosmic expansion and the beginning of contraction. Even in this case, we find that thermal friction lengthens the period of accelerated expansion and consequently delays the end of cosmic expansion, making it challenging to detect the impending transition to contraction using conventional cosmological tests. However, particle production can also provide alternative avenues for detection by generating a background of thermal dark radiation, partly comprised of neutrinos or other particles, whose energy density exceeds the remnant photon energy density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group equations play a central role in effective field theories, both maintaining perturbative control and allowing one to determine the correct low-energy phenomenology. In this work, we complete the one-loop renormalization of the recently developed general effective field theory up to mass dimension six by providing the beta functions for physical fermionic operators. Together with Ref. [1], our results allow one to renormalize any effective theory up to dimension six at one loop using only a group-theoretical calculation.</description>

      <title>Classifying one-dimensional Floquet phases through two-dimensional topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet systems display rich phenomena, such as time crystals, with many-body localisation (MBL) protecting the phases from heating. While several types of Floquet phases have been classified, a unified picture of Floquet MBL is still emerging. Static phases have been fruitfully studied via "symmetry topological field theory" (SymTFT), wherein the universal features of $G$-symmetric systems are elucidated by placing them on the boundary of a topological order of one dimension higher. In this work, we provide a SymTFT approach to classifying $G$-symmetric Floquet MBL phases in 1D, for $G$ a finite Abelian group with on-site unitary action. In the SymTFT, these 1D systems correspond to the boundaries of the quantum double associated to $G$, and the classification naturally arises from considering the Lagrangian subgroups and boundary excitations of the quantum double. The classification covers all known Floquet phases while uncovering others previously unexplored, along with bulk features of phases thought to have only boundary signatures. We refer to the latter phases as "dual" time crystals. For static phases, we show how anyons of the quantum double and (string) order parameters provide a natural and simple interpretation of known classification schemes. By extending our framework to the boundaries of twisted quantum doubles, we uncover a new time-crystalline phase with non-onsite symmetry, which cannot be obtained through local, symmetric Hamiltonian drives. We numerically demonstrate evidence for the absolute stability of this phase, and observe that for open boundary conditions it has greater stability to symmetric perturbations. We finally discuss perspectives on using programmable quantum devices to realise and probe the phases we discuss. Our results show that SymTFT provides a powerful approach to unifying phases and features of Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Universal and Maximal Entanglement Swapping in General Fermionic Gaussian States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring universal entanglement structure in many-body systems is both fundamental and challenging, particularly when the system undergoes non-unitary operations. In this work, we uncover a universal mechanism for realizing maximal entanglement swapping in fermionic Gaussian states subjected to projective Bell measurements. We consider two initially decoupled, half-filled copies of a free-fermion system in arbitrary dimensions and perform post-selective Bell measurements on half of the corresponding sites across the two copies. Remarkably, the post-measurement state factorizes into a product of Bell pairs, establishing maximal interlayer entanglement entirely independent of the initial Gaussian state. We derive this post-measurement state exactly for general particle-number-conserving fermionic Gaussian states, establishing both the validity and universality of the mechanism, with numerical simulations serving as consistency checks. This phenomenon arises from a robust interplay between fermionic statistics and Gaussianity, revealing a distinct fermionic route to measurement-induced maximal entanglement.</description>

      <title>AC Stark effect or time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect for particle on a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of a time-varying solenoidal vector potential for a quantum particle confined to a ring. The setup appears to be a time-varying version of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, but since the particle moves in the presence of fields, it is not strictly an Aharonov-Bohm effect. The results are similar to the ac Stark effect, but with a time-varying electric field coming from the vector potential, rather than the scalar potential. We compare and contrast the present effect with the standard ac Stark effect. The signature of this setup is the generation of quasi-energy sidebands which are observable via spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Hadron Physics Opportunities at FAIR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This White Paper outlines a coordinated, decade-spanning programme of hadron and QCD studies anchored at the GSI/FAIR accelerator complex. Profiting from intense deuteron, proton and pion beams coupled with high-rate capable detectors and an international theory effort, the initiative addresses fundamental questions related to the strong interaction featuring confinement and dynamical mass generation. This includes our understanding of hadron-hadron interactions and the composition of hadrons through mapping the baryon and meson spectra, including exotic states, and quantifying hadron structure. This interdisciplinary research connects topics in the fields of nuclear, heavy-ion, and (nuclear) astro (particle) physics, linking, for example, terrestrial data to constraints on neutron star structure. A phased roadmap with SIS100 accelerator start-up and envisaged detector upgrades will yield precision cross sections, transition form factors, in-medium spectral functions, and validated theory inputs. Synergies with external programmes at international accelerator facilities worldwide are anticipated. The programme is expected to deliver decisive advances in our understanding of non-perturbative (strong) QCD and astrophysics, and high-rate detector and data-science technology.</description>

      <title>Effective metric for binaries in framework of EOB theory to fifth PM order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To establish a self-consistent effective one-body (EOB) theory that describes the dynamical evolution of binary systems based on the post-Minkowskian (PM) approximation, where the Hamiltonian, radiation reaction force, and waveforms are derived from an effective metric, the primary objective is to obtain the effective metric. Given that third generation gravitational wave detectors require at least fifth-order PM accuracy, in this paper we constructed an effective metric in the EOB theory of binaries up to fifth PM order. The effective metric is of type D, allowing for the derivation of decoupled and variable-separable equations for the null tetrad component of the gravitational perturbed Weyl tensor. This presents a basis for us to establish a self-consistent EOB theory up to 5PM order.</description>

      <title>Back-action from inertial and non-inertial Unruh-DeWitt detectors revisited in covariant perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the back-action from a spatially pointlike particle detector on a quantum scalar field, as characterised by the expectation value of the field's stress-energy tensor, without conditioning on a measurement of the detector. First, assuming the field to be initially in a zero-mean Gaussian Hadamard state in a globally hyperbolic spacetime, we evaluate the field's two-point function in second-order perturbation theory by techniques of covariant curved spacetime quantum field theory, which allow a full control of the time and space localisation of the interaction, and do not rely on field mode decompositions or non-local particle countings. The detector's two-point function splits into a deterministic and a fluctuating part, and we show that this split is maintained in the back-action.
  We then specialise to a two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector, prepared in an energy eigenstate, for which the back-action is fully fluctuating. We compute the renormalised stress-energy tensor for a massless scalar field in $(3+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime for a general detector trajectory, using the manifestly causal two-point function. We present explicit analytic and numerical results for an inertial detector and a uniformly linearly accelerated detector, switched on in the asymptotic past. The energy flux into and out of the accelerated detector accounts exactly for the energy gained and lost by the detector in its transitions due to the Unruh effect. The same holds for the outward flux associated with de-excitations of the inertial detector, which has a vanishing excitation rate and no inward flux. A novelty with the accelerated detector is two regions of negative energy density when the detector is initially prepared in its ground state, one near the Rindler horizon that bounds the causal future of the trajectory, the other in the far future of the trajectory.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Propagation in Quantum Field Theory at Short and Long Baselines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a quantum field approach to neutrino oscillations, the neutrino is treated as a propagator, while the external initial and final particle states are described by covariant wave packets. For the asymptotic behavior on short and long macroscopic baselines, the wave packet modified neutrino propagator is expressed through asymptotic series in powers of dimensionless Lorentz and rotation invariant variables. In both regimes, leading-order corrections violate the classical inverse-square law and lead to a decrease in the neutrino-induced event rate. The possibility that the so-called reactor antineutrino anomaly can, at least partially, be explained within this approach is discussed.</description>

      <title>Pseudospectrum and black hole total transmission mode (in)stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Total transmission modes (TTMs) are modes with complex frequencies that propagate across a black hole spacetime without reflection. Recently, it is found that suitably tailored time-dependent scattering can excite these complex modes and suppress the reflected signal for the entire duration of the process, a phenomenon referred to as virtual absorption. Motivated by this, we present the study of the spectrum stability of TTMs using pseudospectrum and condition numbers. We focus on perturbations of $d$-dimensional Tangherlini black holes and recast the TTM problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem by utilizing the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. The results show that TTMs are generically spectrally unstable, with sensitivity increasing for higher overtones, in close analogy with quasinormal modes. A notable exception is a purely imaginary TTM whose pseudospectrum's contours are nearly concentric and whose condition number is orders of magnitude smaller than that of the overtones, indicating enhanced spectral stability. Additionally, we confirm that purely imaginary TTMs occur only for spin $s=2$, whereas genuinely complex TTM families appear only in sufficiently high dimensions, $d \geqslant 8$, extending earlier claims that placed the onset at $d \geqslant 10$.</description>

      <title>Generalized CP from non-invertible selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a framework in which fields are labeled by basis elements of a fusion algebra with non-invertible fusion rules. In particular, we consider the case where fields are labeled by conjugacy classes of a finite group rather than its irreducible representations. When the fusion rules possess a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry identified with charge conjugation, a CP-invariant system can be consistently defined together with parity transformation. Furthermore, it is found that combining group-based flavor symmetries underlying non-invertible selection rules with CP symmetry naturally leads to a generalized CP transformation. We also demonstrate the possibility of spontaneous CP violation in this framework and discuss its implications for Yukawa textures.</description>

      <title>Learning holographic QCD with unflavoured meson spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a neural network framework to predict the five-dimensional background geometry, dilaton potential, and chiral symmetry breaking scalar potential of holographic QCD from unflavored meson mass spectra. The model was trained in a discretized form of the Schr\"odinger-like equation, which resembles a linear moose in ``deconstructed" 5 dimensions with Dirichlet boundary conditions, in contrast to the AdS/DL with ``emergent" space-time. Using the $\rho$, $a_1$, $a_2$, and $f_0$ unflavored mesons and their excitations as training data, the model learns confining effective potentials and computes a dilaton profile that satisfies the null energy condition. The network predicts the IR behavior of dilaton to be in-between linear and quadratic forms. Moreover, the symmetry-breaking bulk potential of the scalar field, $V(X)= k_1 X^3+k_2 X^4$, was computed, and the parameters $k_1$ and $k_2$ predicted to be $\sim - \ 8$ and $\sim 17$ respectively. The deep-learned parameters, metric, and the dilaton profile were then used to predict the pion mass and its spectrum with good accuracy. A Python code, along with the trained models, is provided to facilitate further studies</description>

      <title>The Nontrivial Vacuum Structure of an Extended $t\bar{t}$ BEH (Higgs) Bound State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent reformulation of top-quark condensation for the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson, we introduced an extended internal wave-function, $\phi(r)$. We show how this leads to a manifestly Lorentz invariant formalism, where the absence of ``relative time'' is a gauge invariance of the bilocal field theory. This dictates a novel and nontrivial Lorentz invariant vacuum structure for the BEH boson, the relativistic generalization of a condensed matter state such as a BCS or Bose-Einstein condensate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we show that, in the background of the primordial magnetic field, the CME effect can significantly amplify the chiral chemical potential sourced by the CP violation near the bubble walls during the first-order electroweak phase transition. This effect can lift the generated baryon asymmetry by several orders, and make it possible to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe with a CPV in the fermion sector far beyond the limitation of the electron dipole moment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present novel equivalences in random matrix and tensor models between complex and self-adjoint theories with nontrivial quadratic terms in the action, established through an intermediate field representation. More precisely, we show that the partition functions of certain self-adjoint models and their complex counterparts are different integral representations of the exact same function. A special case of these equivalences takes a form of newly found dually weighted intermediate field representations, which generalize the standard intermediate field representation. We also find indications of an equivalence between real tensor models and self-transpose tensor models.</description>

      <title>A Universal Geometric Framework for Black Hole Phase Transitions: From Multivaluedness to Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed synchronized multivalued behavior in thermodynamic, dynamical, and geometric quantities during the black hole first-order phase transition, which enables a diagnosis from different perspectives, yet its fundamental origin has remained poorly understood. By constructing a unified geometric framework integrating real analysis and covering space theory, we reveal the universal mathematical mechanism behind this phenomenon. We prove that this multivaluedness originates from two non-degenerate critical points in the temperature function $T(r_+)$, where $r_+$ is the horizon radius, which fold the parameter space into a three-sheeted covering structure. As a direct application, we propose that a black hole undergoes a first-order phase transition if and only if its $T(r_+)$ curve has two extrema. Accordingly, we establish a classification scheme, denoted $A1$, $A2$, and $B$ for black holes. This scheme offers a complementary perspective to classifications based on global topological invariants. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for diagnosing phase transitions via multivaluedness and establishes a unified geometric perspective on black hole thermodynamics, chaotic dynamics, and spacetime structure during first-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Field Quantisations in Schwarzschild Spacetime: Theory versus Low-Energy Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-relativistic quantum particles in the Earth's gravitational field are successfully described by the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with Newton's gravitational potential. Particularly, quantum mechanics is in agreement with such experiments as free fall and quantum interference induced by gravity. However, quantum mechanics is a low-energy approximation to quantum field theory. The latter is successful by the description of high-energy experiments. Gravity is embedded in quantum field theory through the general-covariance principle. This framework is known in the literature as quantum field theory in curved spacetime, where the concept of a quantum particle is, though, ambiguous. In this article, we study in this framework how a Hawking particle moves in the far-horizon region of Schwarzschild spacetime by computing its propagator. We find this propagator differs from that which follows from the path-integral formalism -- the formalism which adequately describes both free fall and quantum interference induced by gravity.</description>

      <title>On Non-Minimal Couplings to Gravity and Axion Isocurvature Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For axions present during inflation, it has been shown that a non-minimal coupling $\xi_\sigma$ of the inflaton to gravity worsens isocurvature bounds, while a non-minimal coupling $\xi_\rho$ of the radial Peccei-Quinn field can alleviate them. We analyze the simultaneous presence of both couplings and determine when one effect dominates the other, in both the metric and Palatini formulations of gravity. The two tendencies interpolate smoothly, but introducing a non-minimal inflaton coupling reduces the viable interval of $\xi_\rho$ in which isocurvature bounds can be alleviated while avoiding backreaction on the inflationary dynamics. We illustrate our findings in Palatini Higgs inflation and Starobinsky inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau's two-fluid model of superfluidity ceases to apply in regions where the condensate amplitude exhibits rapid spatial variation, such as vortex cores or in the vicinity of container walls. A recently proposed relativistic Gross-Pitaevskii-type framework treats the condensate as an independent scalar degree of freedom, enabling a controlled analysis of such regimes. We use it to construct stationary superflows close to the superfluid-normal phase boundary, and examine their stability. We obtain an exact expression for Landau's critical velocity and show that the standard Newtonian profiles (such as the near-vortex condensate depletion or the boundary-layer decay) persist unmodified in the relativistic setting. We further analyse a genuinely relativistic configuration in which an accelerated superfluid develops a phase boundary induced by Tolman temperature gradients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that atomic clock measurements provides an exceptionally sensitive Solar System probe of scalar tensor dark energy. By connecting variations in Newton's constant and differential clock drifts to the dynamics of a single dark energy scalar, we derive a direct constraint on the present day equation of state and our results force any locally coupled scalar dark energy into a very slowly rolling regime, giving the strongest bounds on the equation of state parameter. This is independent of potential shape or kinetic structure and rules out broad classes of canonical and non canonical models, leaving only near Lambda CDM behavior or fully decoupled fields as viable late time scalar dark energy, thereby leaving cosmological constant and minimally coupled scalar field models as the most consistent dark energy regimes. We also use results from Lunar Laser Ranging and photon trajectories to further strengthen our the depth of our constraints.</description>

      <title>Impact of Supercooling on Direct Searches for Dark Matter and Gravitational Wave Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An interesting feature of a cosmological phase transition can be a stage of exponential expansion (supercooling). The modified expansion history and the entropy injection at reheating, can affect the final energy fraction of dark matter. In this paper, we revisit the calculation of the freeze-out and freeze-in dynamics, showing additional effects on top of the standard dilution factor if the dark matter production is completed during the supercooling stage. We show for the first time how these effects can be particularly interesting for direct detection, as the parameter space for WIMP-like candidates shifts from excluded to allowed regions, and freeze-in candidates get closer to experimental reach. A phenomenological motivation to consider supercooling is the associated gravitational wave background. The implications of a finite-duration reheating stage, when the equation of state is close to matter-domination, are a peculiar low-frequency spectrum, and its shift to lower frequencies. These effects are a complementary test of the dynamics that we study for dark matter production, and remarkably can link direct detection of dark matter and gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the velocity-dependent one-scale (VOS) model to the case of one cosmic F-string and two D-strings as color flux tubes in pure Spin($4N$) gauge theory. We analytically calculate the scaling string density as a function of the reconnection probabilities, and confirm our results with numerical calculations. We also determine the timescale at which the string density reaches the scaling regime, and find that for certain values of the reconnection probability, the scaling time can become extremely large, by many orders of magnitude. This leads to a characteristic suppression signature of the gravitational-wave signal at high frequencies, which may become observable in the frequency range of future interferometric gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Revival Dynamics from Equilibrium States: Scars from Chords in SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel framework to build quantum many-body scar states in bipartite systems characterized by perfect correlation between the Hamiltonians governing the two sides. By means of a Krylov construction, we build an interaction term which supports a tower of equally-spaced energy eigenstates. This gives rise to finite-time revivals whenever the system is initialized in a purification of a generic equilibrium state. The dynamics is universally characterized, and is largely independent of the specific details of the Hamiltonians defining the individual partitions. By considering the two-sided chord states of the double-scaled SYK model, we find an approximate realization of this framework. We analytically study the revival dynamics, finding rigid motion for wavepackets localized on the spectrum of a single SYK copy. These findings are tested numerically for systems of finite size, showing excellent agreement with the analytical predictions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show how to solve the Dirac equation, $(i\gamma^\mu[\partial_\mu+ieA_\mu(t,{\bf x})]-m)\psi=0$, on a GPU. This is orders of magnitude faster than solving it on CPU and allows us to consider background fields, $A_\mu(t,{\bf x})$, that depend on $2+1$ or even $3+1$ coordinates. Our approach is conveniently implemented using the computational library JAX. We show how to obtain the probabilities of Schwinger and nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production from these solutions using a scattered-wave-function approach and compare the results with the worldline-instanton approximations.</description>

Abstract: The complete set of one-loop anomalous dimensions for general Effective Field Theories (EFTs) is derived using on-shell methods. Combined with previous findings for the bosonic sector, the obtained results conclude the computation of the complete set of leading order Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) in arbitrary gauge EFTs containing scalar and fermion fields. Renormalization effects are consistently taken into account at the order $1/\Lambda^2$ in the new physics scale $\Lambda$ for all renormalizable and non-renormalizable couplings. The obtained template RGEs include operator mixing across different dimensions and are valid for arbitrary gauge groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the derived equivalence between Calabi--Yau mixed branches using the B-brane hemisphere partition function in anomalous gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs). For a family of anomalous $U(2)$ GLSMs, we study the infrared behavior of B-branes under RG flow and the variation of FI parameters in the quantum K\"ahler moduli space. As characterized by the big and small window categories of the GLSM, the RG flow effect is analyzed according to the properties of their B-brane central charges as hemisphere partition functions. The result generalizes the band restriction rules in anomalous abelian GLSMs (Clingempeel--Floch--Romo) to some $U(2)$ models. As an application, we study a family of $U(1)\times U(k)$ models for $k=1,2$, which realize a Fano UV sigma model and two IR phases as mixed branches accompanied by local Calabi--Yau Higgs components. By applying the restriction rules, we establish new derived equivalences between Calabi--Yau varieties from these anomalous models.</description>

      <title>Perturbed symmetric-product orbifold: first-order mixing and puzzles for integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the marginal deformation of the symmetric-product orbifold theory Sym$_N(T^4)$ which corresponds to introducing a small amount of Ramond-Ramond flux into the dual $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ background. Already at first order in perturbation theory, the dimension of certain single-cycle operators is corrected, indicating that wrapping corrections from integrability must come into play earlier than expected. Our results provide a test for integrability computations from the mirror Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz or Quantum Spectral Curve, akin to the computation of the Konishi anomalous dimension in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory. We also discuss a flaw in the original derivation of the integrable structure of the perturbed orbifold. Together, these observations suggest that more needs to be done to correctly identify and exploit the integrable structure of the perturbed orbifold CFT.</description>

      <title>From Symmetry to Structure: Gauge-Invariant Operators in Multi-Matrix Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently the algebraic structure of gauge-invariant operators in multi-matrix quantum mechanics has been clarified: this space forms a module over a freely generated ring. The ring is generated by a set of primary invariants, while the module structure is determined by a finite set of secondary invariants. In this work, we show that the number of primary invariants can be computed by performing a complete gauge fixing, which identifies the number of independent physical degrees of freedom. We then compare this result to a complementary counting based on the restricted Schur polynomial basis. This comparison allows us to argue that the number of secondary invariants must exhibit exponential growth of the form $e^{cN^2}$ at large $N$, with $c$ a constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We justify the applicability of the background subtraction method to both Einstein's gravity and its higher derivative corrections in 5-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetimes, where the corresponding higher derivative corrections to the expression for the ADM mass and angular momentum are also worked out. Then we further apply the background subtraction method to calculate the first order corrected Gibbs free energy by the quadratic curvature terms for the 5-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole, which is in exact agreement with the previous result obtained by the holographic renormalization method. Such an agreement in turn substantiates the applicability of the background subtraction method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate conformal field theories with gauge group $U(N)$ at arbitrary rank $N$, focusing on the role of trace relations in determining the structure of the Hilbert space. Working in the free trace algebra without imposing relations, we identify a class of evanescent states that vanish at finite $N$. Using the Koszul complex of [1], we implement trace relations systematically via ghosts and a fermionic charge $Q_b$. This framework allows us to define and compute transition amplitudes between evanescent and physical states, which we show correspond precisely to ordinary CFT amplitudes analytically continued in $N$. Our results provide a direct algebraic realization of the proposals which realize trace relations in the bulk as over-maximal giant gravitons [1-3] and establish analytic continuation in $N$ as a powerful tool for understanding finite-$N$ effects.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the mixed state entanglement structure through the reflected entropy for disjoint radiation subsystems coupled to a 2d eternal brane world black hole in a time dependent defect AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$ scenario. Utilizing the island prescription and the defect extremal surface (DES) formula, we demonstrate a complex mixed state entanglement structure through the reflected entropy corresponding to distinct entanglement entropy phases. In each case we verify the holographic duality of the reflected entropy with the bulk entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS) and also obtain the Page curves for both the entanglement entropy and the associated reflected entropy phases. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to adjacent radiation subsystems and obtain consistent results using both the island and the DES prescription.</description>

      <title>Boundary Actions and Loop Groups: A Geometric Picture of Gauge Symmetries at Null Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work arXiv:2407.13556, we proposed an extended phase space structure at null infinity accommodating large gauge symmetries for sub$^n$-leading soft theorems in Yang-Mills, via dressing fields arising in the Stueckelberg procedure. Here, we give an explicit boundary action controlling the dynamics of these fields. This allows for a derivation from first principles of the associated charges, together with an explicit renormalization procedure when taking the limit to null and spatial infinity, matching with charges proposed in previous work. Using the language of fibre bundles, we relate the existence of Stueckelberg fields to the notion of extension/reduction of the structure group of a principal bundle, thereby deriving their transformation rules in a natural way, thus realising them as Goldstone-like objects. Finally, this allows us to give a geometric picture of the gauge transformation structure at the boundary, via a loop group coming from formal expansions in the coordinate transversal to the boundary.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity for Open Quantum System: Dissipation and Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Krylov complexity in open quantum systems using Lindblad master equations for bosonic bath models, with particular emphasis on the Caldeira--Leggett model. Krylov complexity is computed from the moments of the two-point function within the standard master equation framework. For the damped harmonic oscillator, the results reveal clear dissipative features in Krylov complexity. In the Caldeira--Leggett model, in the high-temperature limit, we find that Krylov complexity saturates in the full system and reproduces the expected dissipative behavior when the decoherence term is suppressed in the master equation. Conversely, when the dissipative term is suppressed, the contribution from decoherence exhibits the familiar oscillatory dynamics of the coherent system, along with additional novel features. However, Krylov complexity appears insensitive to the onset of decoherence, as no clear distinctive signature is observed. We attribute this to the fact that Krylov complexity is defined in the Krylov basis, which does not coincide with the conventional basis typically used to study decoherence.</description>

      <title>Matching conditions at null infinity in the presence of logarithms: the role of advanced and retarded radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new perspective on the general matching conditions between the future of past null infinity and the past of future null infinity, emphasizing the impact of dominant logarithmic terms in the asymptotic expansion of the fields near null infinity. We explicitly consider the cases of a massless scalar field and of electromagnetism. Key in our derivation is the identification of the physical origin of these logarithms, which are associated with advanced and retarded radiation saturating the finite energy flux condition at null infinity (in a space of functions which is made precise). The matching conditions arise then from the requirement of Coulombic (i.e., $1/r$) behaviour at spatial infinity.</description>

      <title>Variational Method in Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a variational framework for addressing two-dimensional non-integrable quantum field theories through the exact structure of their integrable counterparts. Concentrating on the $\varphi^4$ Landau-Ginzburg model, we use the analytical Vacuum Expectation Values and Form Factors of local operators in the sinh-Gordon theory as the foundation of a variational ansatz. In this way, we obtain controlled estimates of central physical quantities of the $\varphi^4$ theory - such as the finite-volume ground-state energy and the physical mass as a function of the coupling constant. The strengths of the variational methods are leveraged in combination with the Hamiltonian truncation techniques and the LeClair-Mussardo formula, which also allow to probe the accuracy of the variational approximation varying the system size. Within the weak-coupling regime, a detailed numerical analysis reveals the behaviour of the finite-volume spectrum, the ground-state energy, and the elastic part of the scattering matrix, showing how the rigorous machinery of integrable models can serve as a guiding light into the complex landscape of non-integrable quantum field dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Three-Family Supersymmetric Pati-Salam Models from Type IIA Intersecting D6-Branes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing three-family chiral fermion conditions to $I_{ac}=-(3+h)$ and $I_{ac'}=h$, with positive integer $h$, we extend the landscape of three-family ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models in a broader region. Differing from the former investigation with $I_{ac}=-3$ and $I_{ac'}=0$, we do not restrict that the $a$ stack of D6-branes must be parallel to the orientifold image of the $c$-stack along one of the three two-tori. In this investigation, without the simple parallel construction, we find four new classes of supersymmetric Pati-Salam models that are allowed by the extended three generation condition with $I_{ac}=3, I_{ac'}=-6$ and $I_{ac}=-1, I_{ac'}=-2$ through the intersections of $a$- and $c/c'$-branes. Moreover, with the $SU(2)_{L'}$ gauge coupling realized from $SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$ symmetry breaking, the canonical normalization requirement of the gauge kinetic term provides an alternative approach that can be imposed before the renormalization group equation evolution for $SU(2)_{L'}$ gauge coupling. This turns out to be an effective mechanism to realize the string-scale gauge coupling relation, especially for the new supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with large $g_b/g_a$ ratio. We show that this symmetry-breaking modified renormalization group evolution can highly suppress $g_b/g_a$, and finally realizes string-scale gauge coupling relations for the extended supersymmetric Pati-Salam models as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an alternative dimensional reduction that yields an effective theory of dilatons in a two-dimensional de Sitter background. Specifically, by performing an S-wave reduction of higher-dimensional Einstein gravity, we obtain free massless dilatons in the Nariai static patch, and a dynamically evolving dilatons in the past Milne wedge. We then propose a (Nariai) static patch worldsheet formulation in terms of CFTs with SL(2,$\mathbb{R}$) deformed Hamiltonians on the cylinder. A key feature of this construction is that a stretched horizon in the (Nariai) static patch, equipped with an emergent UV boundary condition, acts as a gravitating observer. Using the similar reduction, we have also obtained a Schwarzian action coupled to free massless dilatons in the near horizon near extremal limit of four dimensional charged AdS black holes. The worldsheet description for the same has been proposed and discussed in \cite{Das:2025cuq}. We also comment on how different notions of worldsheet time may themselves be \textit{emergent}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a four-dimensional system composed of a mass-dimension-one fermionic field, also known as Elko, interacting with a real scalar field. Our main objective is to analyze the Casimir effects associated with this system, assuming that both the Elko and scalar fields satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions on two large parallel plates separated by a distance $L$. In this scenario, we calculate the vacuum energy density and its first-order correction in the coupling constants of the theory. Additionally, we consider the mass correction for each field separately, namely the topological mass that arises from the boundary conditions imposed on the fields and which also depends on the coupling constants. To develop this analysis, we use the mathematical formalism known as the effective potential, expressed as a path integral in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Structure of Chern-Simons Graviton Scattering Amplitudes from Topological Graviton Equivalence Theorem and Double Copy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitons naturally acquire topological masses in the 3d topologically massive gravity (TMG) theory that includes the gravitational Chern-Simons term. We present a covariant formulation of the TMG theory by introducing an unphysical dilaton field through the conformal transformation. We conduct the BRST quantization of the covariant TMG theory, which reduces to the conventional TMG in the unitary gauge. We demonstrate that this covariant TMG theory conserves the physical degrees of freedom (DoF) in the massless limit, under which the physical massive graviton becomes an unphysical massless graviton and its physical DoF is converted to the massless dilaton. With these, we newly establish a Topological Graviton Equivalence Theorem (TGRET), which connects each scattering amplitude of physical gravitons to the corresponding dilaton scattering amplitude in the high energy limit. The TGRET provides a general mechanism to guarantee all the large energy cancellations in any massive graviton scattering amplitudes. Applying the TGRET and using the generalized gravitational power counting rule, we prove that the $N$-point massive graviton amplitudes ($N\geqslant 4$) have striking energy cancellations by powers proportional to $\frac{5}{2}N$ ($\frac{7}{2}N$) in the Landau (unitary) gauge. This explains the large energy cancellations of $E^{11}\to E^1$ (Landau gauge) and $E^{12}\to E^1$ (unitary gauge) for the four graviton amplitudes. We compute the four-point graviton (dilaton) amplitudes and explicitly demonstrate the TGRET and these large energy cancellations. With the extended massive double-copy approach, we systematically construct the graviton (dilaton) scattering amplitudesin the TMG theory from the corresponding gauge boson (adjoint scalar) amplitudes in the topologically massive Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Analysis of 4-dimensional Spacetime in Bondi-like Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.10746v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Hamiltonian formulation of gravity in 4-dimensional spacetime under Bondi-like coordinates ${v, r, x^a, a=2, 3}$. In Bondi-like coordinates, the 3-dimensional hypersurface is a null hypersurface and the evolution direction is the advanced time $v$. The internal symmetry group $SO(1,3)$ of the 4-dimensional spacetime is decomposed into $SO(1,1)$, $SO(2)$, and $T^\pm(2)$, whose Lie algebra $so(1,3)$ is decomposed into $so(1,1)$, $so(2)$, $t^\pm(2)$ correspondingly. The $SO(1,1)$ symmetry is very obvious in this kind of decomposition, which is very useful in $so(1,1)$ BF theory. General relativity can be reformulated as the 4-dimensional coframe $(e^I_\mu)$ and connection $({\omega}^{IJ}_\mu)$ dynamics of gravity based on this kind of decomposition in the Bondi-like coordinate system. The coframe consists of 2 null 1-forms $e^-$, $e^+$ and 2 spacelike 1-forms $e^2$, $e^3$. The Palatini action is used. The Hamiltonian analysis is conducted by the Dirac's methods. The consistency analysis of constraints has been done completely. There are 2 scalar constraints and one 2-dimensional vector constraint. The torsion-free conditions are acquired from the consistency conditions of the primary constraints about ${\pi}^\mu_{IJ}$. The consistency conditions of the primary constraints ${\pi}^0_{IJ}=0$ can be reformulated as Gauss constraints. The conditions of the Lagrange multipliers have been acquired. The Poisson brackets among the constraints have been calculated. There are 46 constraints including 6 first class constraints ${\pi}^0_{IJ}=0$ and 40 second class constraints. The local physical degrees of freedom is 2. The integrability conditions of Lagrange multipliers $n_0$, $l_0$, and $e^A_0$ are Ricci identities. The equations of motion of the canonical variables have also been shown.</description>

      <title>Teleparallel gravity at null infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes have been central to recent developments in infrared physics. Gravitational waves reaching the asymptotic boundary reveal an infinite-dimensional symmetry group known as the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group. The vacuum structure breaks this symmetry, giving rise to Goldstone modes that play a pivotal role in the analysis of scattering amplitudes. However, these modes must be added to the phase space of the metric formulation. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of general relativity, teleparallel gravity, which is dynamically equivalent to the standard metric description in the bulk. This framework relies on a tetrad field to encode the gravitational degrees of freedom and a flat connection to represent inertial effects. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose a novel encoding of the Goldstone modes within the flat connection. We examine the implications of this approach in the covariant phase space framework, focusing on the symplectic potential and its connection to the Wald-Zoupas prescription.</description>

      <title>Ultra fast, event-by-event heavy-ion simulations for next generation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel deep generative framework that uses probabilistic diffusion models for ultra fast, event-by-event simulations of heavy-ion collision output. This new framework is trained on UrQMD cascade data to generate a full collision event output containing 26 distinct hadron species. The output is represented as a point cloud, where each point is defined by a particle's momentum vector and its corresponding species information (ID). Our architecture integrates a normalizing flow-based condition generator that encodes global event features into a latent vector, and a diffusion model that synthesizes a point cloud of particles based on this condition. A detailed description of the model and an in-depth analysis of its performance is provided. The conditional point cloud diffusion model learns to generate realistic output particles of collision events which successfully reproduce the UrQMD distributions for multiplicity, momentum and rapidity of each hadron type. The flexible point cloud representation of the event output preserves full event-level granularity, enabling direct application to inverse problems and parameter estimation tasks while also making it easily adaptable for accelerating any event-by-event model calculation or detector simulation.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of density perturbation and gravitational wave production from cosmological first-order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conducted three-dimensional lattice simulations to study the density perturbation and gravitational waves (GWs) during first-order phase transition (FOPT). We find that for phase transition strength $\alpha &gt; 1$, the forward motion of bubble walls becomes the primary source, whereas for $\alpha &lt; 1$, the dominant contribution to the density perturbation comes from the delay of vacuum decay. Additionally, the power spectrum of density perturbations generated by the phase transition exhibits a slope of $k^3$ at small wavenumbers and $k^{-1.5}$ at large wavenumbers. Furthermore, we calculated the GW power spectra, which exhibit the slope of $k^3$ at small wavenumbers and $k^{-2}$ at large wavenumbers. Our numerical simulations confirm that slow PTs can produce PBHs and provide predictions for the GW power spectrum, offering theoretical support for GW detection.</description>

      <title>No Dark Matter Axion During Minimal Higgs Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study minimal versions of Higgs inflation in the presence of a massless QCD axion. While the inflationary energy scale of the metric variant is too high to accommodate isocurvature bounds, it was argued that Palatini Higgs inflation could evade these constraints. We show, however, that an energy-dependent decay constant enhances isocurvature perturbations, implying that axions can at most constitute a tiny fraction $&lt; 10^{-5}$ of dark matter. This conclusion can be avoided in Einstein-Cartan gravity by an additional coupling of the axion to torsion, albeit for a very specific choice of parameters. Analogous constraints as well as the possibility to alleviate them are relevant for all inflationary models with a non-minimal coupling to gravity.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, Trace Anomaly and Confinement in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00176v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate confinement in QCD as an entropic surface phenomenon. Quark and gluon quantum information is localized on a transverse entangling two-sphere of radius $R_{EE}$; at this radius the QCD vacuum -- partitioned by a hadron into interior and exterior regions -- reaches its maximal entanglement entropy. Lattice-QCD determinations of the scalar (trace) gravitational form factors fix both $R_{EE}$ and the transverse trace-anomaly density $\rho_h(R_{EE})$, yielding a parameter-free slope $c_h = 8\pi^2 R_{EE}^2\,\rho_h(R_{EE})$ and a mechanical entropy $S_{EE}(y)=c_h\,y$ that grows linearly with rapidity $y$. The entropy gradient $\partial_R S_{EE}$ changes sign at $R_{EE}$: it pushes colored degrees of freedom outward for $r&lt;R_{EE}$ and pulls them inward for $r&gt;R_{EE}$, thereby localizing them on the codimension-2 entangling two-sphere $\Sigma_\perp = S^2_{R_{EE}}$ (which, in the infinite-momentum frame, projects onto the transverse plane), the 'information wall'. This provides a high-energy (large-$y$) entropic confinement diagnostic that complements -- rather than replaces -- Wilson's area-law criterion, which probes long-distance dynamics near the rest frame ($y\to 0$). Imposing unitarity on an entropic ansatz for the amplitude yields $\sigma(s)\propto y^{\delta}$. World data favor $\delta=2$ for elastic $pp\,(p\bar p)$ scattering and heavy-quark photoproduction, whereas $\phi$ photoproduction favors a softer $\delta=0.387$. All extracted cross sections remain well below the Froissart--Martin bound. These results provide a confinement criterion quantified directly from non-perturbative QCD inputs, unifying the trace anomaly, entanglement entropy, and high-energy scattering within a single quantitative framework.</description>

      <title>Effective Temperature of the FRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17789v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a new definition of temperature for the FRW(Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe, i.e. the effective temperature $T_{eff}:=dE/dS$, where $E$ is the energy and $S$ is the entropy of the FRW universe. Based on this definition, we get the effective temperature for the $N$-dimensional FRW universe in Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity and Lovelock gravity. We find that for the 4-dimensional FRW universe, the effective temperature is always $T_{eff}=1/(4\pi R_A)$, which is exactly the same form with the Hawking temperature of the Schwarzschild black hole. In higher-dimensional FRW universe, the form of the effective temperature depends on the choices of the gravitational theories or the corresponding coupling constants. We also get the free energy of the FRW universe in the three theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>On energy bounds in asymptotically locally AdS spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers positive energy theorems in asymptotically, locally AdS spacetimes. Particular attention is given to spacetimes where conformal infinity has compact, Einstein cross-sections admitting Killing or parallel spinors; a positive energy theorem is derived for such spacetimes in terms of geometric data intrinsic to the cross-section. This is followed by the first complete proofs of the BPS inequalities in (the bosonic sectors of) 4D and 5D minimal, gauged supergravity, including with magnetic fields, provided the Maxwell field is exact. The BPS inequalities are proven for asymptotically AdS spacetimes, but also generalised to the aforementioned class of asymptotically, locally AdS spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic hydrodynamization and quasinormal modes of nonthermal attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonthermal attractors govern the emergent self-similar dynamics of far-from-equilibrium quantum systems, from ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions to cold-atom experiments. Within the framework of adiabatic hydrodynamization, the approach to a nonthermal attractor is described by the decay of excited states of an effective Hamiltonian. Using an exactly solvable kinetic theory -- the longitudinally expanding, overoccupied gluon plasma dominated by small-angle elastic scattering -- we establish a direct correspondence between the eigenmodes of adiabatic hydrodynamization and the quasinormal mode spectrum of the nonthermal attractor. This equivalence suggests a general framework for identifying universal dynamical structures in nonequilibrium systems. As a byproduct, we derive analytic prescaling solutions for strongly longitudinally expanding systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal stress-energy tensor in time-dependent gravitational backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) of a massless quantum scalar field in time-dependent gravitational backgrounds. Starting from its formal expression obtained within the covariant perturbative expansion to lowest order in the curvature, we evaluate the RSET in an arbitrary number of dimensions in terms of coordinate-space distributions. For time-dependent spherically symmetric spacetimes, we derive a multipole expansion and determine its asymptotic behavior. We find that the RSET is locally nonvanishing at null infinity and depends on the detailed dynamics of the collapsing body. However, the total emitted energy vanishes at this order, meaning that the leading contribution does not account for the energy density of the created particles. Nevertheless, by enforcing stress-tensor conservation up to second order in the curvature, we show that the total radiated energy can be extracted from the first-order RSET. Finally, we compute the induced quantum corrections to the metric at large distances, which display several interesting features.</description>

      <title>Equation of the Perfect Fluid in the FRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the equation of state and its properties of the perfect fluid in the $D$-dimensional FRW universe under Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity and Lovelock gravity. In Einstein gravity, we get the equation of state and find that it has no critical point in the $P$-$V$ diagram, but its isothermal lines have minima in the $4$-dimensional case and are always negative in higher dimensions. In Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we get the equation of state and find that it has a critical point in the $5,6,7,8$-dimensional cases with phase transitions above the critical temperature. In Lovelock gravity, we get the equation of state and conditions of the critical points. Our work shows that both the theories of gravity and the dimensions of the FRW universe affect the existence of the critical point of the perfect fluid. Interestingly, if the critical point exists, phase transition always occures above the critical temperature.</description>
