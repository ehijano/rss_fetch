      <title>Long-lived neutron-star remnants from asymmetric binary neutron star mergers: element formation, kilonova signals and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 3D general-relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics simulations of asymmetric binary neutron star mergers producing long-lived neutron stars remnants and spanning a fraction of their cooling time scale. Two binaries with mass ratios of $1.77$ and $1.49$ described by a stiff and a soft microphysical equation of state are considered. The mergers are characterized by significant tidal disruption with neutron rich material forming a massive disc around the remnant. The latter develops a one-armed dynamics that is imprinted in the emitted kilo-Hertz gravitational waves. Angular momentum transport to the disc is initially driven by spiral-density waves and enhanced by turbulent viscosity and neutrino heating on longer timescales. The mass outflows are composed by neutron-rich dynamical ejecta of mass ${\sim}10^{-3}-10^{-2}M_\odot$ followed by a persistent spiral-wave/neutrino-driven wind of ${\gtrsim}10^{-2}M_\odot$ with material spanning a wide range of electron fractions, ${\sim}0.1-0.55$. For the stiff EOS and largest mass ratio binary, tidal dynamical ejecta have fast tails up to velocities ${\sim}0.8$~c. The outflows are further evolved to days timescale using 2D ray-by-ray radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that include an online nuclear network. We find complete $r$-process yields and identify the production of $^{56}$Ni and the subsequent decay chain to $^{56}$Co and $^{56}$Fe. Synthetic kilonova light curves predict an extended (near-) infrared peak a few days postmerger originating from $r$-processes in the neutron-rich/high-opacity ejecta and a UV/optical peak a few hours postmerger originating from weak $r$-processes in the faster ejecta components. Additionally, the fast tail of tidal origin generates kilonova afterglows potentially detectable in radio and X band on a few to ten years timescale. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>The core collapse of a 16.5 M$_{\odot}$ star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the 1D stellar evolution of a 16.5 M$_{\odot}$ zero-age main-sequence star having different initial rotations. Starting from the pre-main-sequence, the models evolve up to the onset of the core collapse stage. The collapse of such a massive star can result in several kinds of energetic transients, such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Supernovae, etc. Using the simulation parameters, we calculate their free-fall timescales when the models reach the stage of the onset of core collapse. Estimating the free-fall timescale is crucial for understanding the duration for which the central engine can be fueled, allowing us to compare the free-fall timescale with the T$_{\rm 90}$ duration of GRBs. Our results indicate that, given the constraints of the parameters and initial conditions in our models, rapidly rotating massive stars might serve as potential progenitors of Ultra-Long GRBs (T$_{\rm 90}$ $&gt;&gt;$ 500 sec). In contrast, the non-rotating or slowly rotating models are more prone to explode as hydrogen-rich Type IIP-like core-collapse supernovae.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of common envelope stage in close binary systems: comparison between Newtonian and modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the important stage in evolution of close binary system namely common envelope phase in framework of various models of modified gravity. The comparison of results between calculations in Newtonian gravity and modified gravity allows to estimate possible observational imprints of modified gravity. Although declination from Newtonian gravity should be negligible we can propose that due to the long times some new effects can appear. We use the moving-mesh code AREPO for numerical simulation of binary system consisting of $\sim M_{\odot}$ white dwarf and a red giant with mass $\sim 2 M_{\odot}$. For implementing modified gravity into AREPO code we apply the method of (pseudo)potential, assuming that modified gravity can be described by small corrections to usual Newtonian gravitational potential. As in Newtonian case initial orbit has to shrink due to the energy transfer to the envelope of a giant. We investigated evolution of common envelope in a case of simple model of modified gravity with various values of parameters and compared results with simulation in frames of Newtonian gravity.</description>

      <title>A Broadband X-ray Investigation of Fast-Spinning Intermediate Polar CTCV J2056-3014</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and NICER X-ray observations of CTCV J2056-3014, a cataclysmic variable (CV) with one of the fastest-spinning white dwarfs (WDs) at P = 29.6 s. While previously classified as an intermediate polar (IP), CJ2056 also exhibits the properties of WZ-Sge-type CVs, such as dwarf novae and superoutbursts. With XMM-Newton and NICER, we detected the spin period up to approximately 2 keV with 7-$\sigma$ significance. We constrained its derivative to |$\dot{P}$| &lt; 1.8e-12 s/s after correcting for binary orbital motion. The pulsed profile is characterized by a single broad peak with approximately 25% modulation. NuSTAR detected a four-fold increase in unabsorbed X-ray flux coincident with an optical flare in November 2022. The XMM-Newton and NICER X-ray spectra in 0.3-10 keV are best characterized by an absorbed optically-thin three-temperature thermal plasma model (kT = 0.3, 1.0, and 4.9 keV), while the NuSTAR spectra in 3-30 keV are best fit by a single-temperature thermal plasma model (kT = 8.4 keV), both with Fe abundance $Z_{Fe}/Z_\odot$ = 0.3. CJ2056 exhibits similarities to other fast-spinning CVs, such as low plasma temperatures, and no significant X-ray absorption at low energies. As the WD's magnetic field strength is unknown, we applied both non-magnetic and magnetic CV spectral models (MKCFLOW and MCVSPEC) to determine the WD mass. The derived WD mass range (M = 0.7-1.0 $M_\odot$) is above the centrifugal break-up mass limit of 0.56 $M_\odot$ and consistent with the mean WD mass of local CVs (M $\approx$ 0.8-0.9 $M_\odot$).</description>

      <title>Decade-long Periodicity Study of 2FHL Blazars with Historical Optical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our recent investigation, we utilized a century's worth of archival optical data to search for a decade-long periodicity from the blazar PG 1553+113, finding a hint of a 22-year period. Building on this foundation, the current study extends our analysis to include 10 blazars from the Fermi Large Area Telescope 2FHL catalog to uncover similar long-term periodic behavior. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we consider the impact of observational limitations, such as temporal gaps and uneven sampling, which could potentially introduce artifacts or false periodic signals. Our analysis reveals that 4 of these blazars (AP Librae, MKN 421, MKN 501, PG 1246+586) exhibit decade-long periods in their optical light curves, albeit 3 of them may be influenced by noise. However, a likely genuine period of approximately 51 $\pm$ 9 yr is identified for MKN 421.</description>

      <title>Local interstellar spectra and solar modulation of cosmic ray proton and Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galactic cosmic rays (GCR) suffer from solar modulation when they propagate through the heliosphere.
  The transfer of the local interstellar spectrum (LIS) to the top-of-atmosphere spectra (TOA) is influenced by solar wind convection, diffusion on the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF), among other factors.
  In this work, we derive the LIS of proton (p) and helium (He) covering energies from a few MeV/n to TeV/n, using a non-parameterization method. The study utilizes monthly AMS-02 data on proton and helium fluxes and their ratio to examine the evolution of solar modulation from May 2011 to May 2017. To improve the fitting, the force-field approximation is modified by assigning different solar modulation potentials for high ( $\phi_h$ ) and low ($\phi_l$ ) energy ranges. A sigmoid function is employed to describe the transition between these energy ranges. The analysis reveals that the break in proton and helium fluxes occurs at the same rigidity value, with a mean of approximately 6 GV and this break is more pronounced during the heliospheric magnetic field reversal period. The $\phi_l$ is close to the result of Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) while the $\phi_h$ is close to the result of neutron monitor (NM) data. Furthermore, the long-term behavior of the p/He ratio is found to naturally arise from the model when considering different Z/A values and the LISs for proton and helium.</description>

      <title>A Simulation Study of Low-Power Relativistic Jets: Flow Dynamics and Radio Morphology of FR-I Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio galaxies are classified into two primary categories based on their morphology: center-brightened FR-I and edge-brightened FR-II. It is believed that the jet power and interactions with the ambient medium govern the deceleration and decollimation of the jet-spine flows, which, in turn, influence this dichotomy. Using high-resolution, three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations, we follow the development of flow structures on sub-kpc to kpc scales in kinetically dominant low-power relativistic jets. We find that the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet spine and the advance speed of the jet head, which depend on the energy injection flux and the jet-to-background density contrast, primarily determine the dynamics and structures of the jet-induced flows. The entrainment of ambient gas and the background density and pressure gradient may also play significant roles. To emulate radio morphology, we produce the synthetic maps of the synchrotron surface brightness for the simulated jets, by employing simple models for magnetic field distribution and nonthermal electron population and considering relativistic beaming effects at different inclination angles. Both the flow structures and radio maps capture the longitudinal and transverse structures of the jet-spine and shear layer, consistent with observations. We also compare different background effects and argue that the loss of pressure confinement beyond the galactic core may be a key factor in the flaring and disruption of FR-I jets. Our results confirm that mildly relativistic jets could explain the one-sidedness or asymmetries with the boosted main jet and deboosted counterjet pairs.</description>

      <title>Diffusive Shock Acceleration Efficiencies for Weak ICM Shocks in the Test Particle Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, weak internal shocks are induced within the hot ICM, while strong accretion shocks arise in the WHIM within filaments, and the warm-cold gas in voids surrounding galaxy clusters. These cosmological shocks are thought to accelerate cosmic ray (CR) protons and electrons via diffusive shock acceleration. Recent advances in particle-in-cell and hybrid simulations have provided deeper insights into the kinetic plasma processes that govern microinstabilities and particle acceleration in collisionless shocks in weakly magnetized astrophysical plasma. In this study, we adopt a thermal-leakage type injection model and DSA power-law distribution functions in the test-particle regime. The CR proton spectrum directly connects to the Maxwellian distribution of protons at the injection momentum $p_{\rm{inj}} = Q_p p_{\rm {th,p}}$. On the other hand, the CR electron spectrum extends down to $p_{\rm{min}}=Q_ep_{\rm{th,e}}$ and is linked to the Maxwellian distribution of electrons. Here, $p_{\rm{th,p}}$ and $p_{\rm{th,e}}$, are the proton and electron thermal momenta, respectively. Moreover, we propose that the postshock gas temperature and the injection parameters, $Q_p$ and $Q_e$ are self-regulated to maintain the test-particle condition, as the thermal energy is gradually transferred to the CR energy. Under these constraints, we estimate the self-regulated values of the temperature reduction factor, $R_T$, and the proton injection parameter, $Q_p$, along with the resulting CR efficiencies, $\eta_p$ and $\eta_e$. We then provide analytical fitting functions for these parameters as functions of the shock Mach number, $M_s$. These fitting formulas may serve as valuable tools for quantitatively assessing the impact of CR protons and electrons, as well as the resulting nonthermal emissions in galaxy clusters and cosmic filaments.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Insights into post-Glitch Dynamics: Model comparison and parameter constraint from decades long observation data of the Crab pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Crab Pulsar has exhibited numerous glitches accompanied by persistent shifts in its spin-down rate. The explanation of the observed persistent shifts remain a challenge. We perform a detailed Bayesian analysis to compare four data-fitting models, ranging from a simple linear model to more complex power-law and logarithmic models, using a dataset of observed glitches and persistent shifts. Our results show the large observed events are difficult to explain by the usually assumed linear model due to starquakes. A particularly notable finding is that the logarithmic model provides the best fit to the observation data but the two power-law models show a close tie to it. Detail differences of these models may be further clarified by the understanding of internal physics of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Flares Associated with Gravitational Waves from Binary Black Hole Mergers in AGN Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) event GW190521, likely originating from a binary black hole (BBH) merger within an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk, is associated with the optical flare ZTF19abanrhr. The remnant BHs from BBH mergers can launch the jet and outflow and then interact with the disk medium, which can be responsible for the associated electromagnetic radiations. In this \textit{letter}, we examine the shock breakout and subsequent cooling emissions from four potential components: the outflow, jet head, jet cocoon, and disk cocoon, all driven by the remnant BH within the AGN disk. Using dynamic models and observational constraints, for GW190521, we identify the parameter space for each component and conclude that either the outflow or the disk cocoon could produce the observed electromagnetic signal, with the disk cocoon requiring more extreme parameters. We present best-fit light curves and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for both components, showing peak emissions in the UV band for the outflow and spanning optical to UV for the disk cocoon.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Supradense Matter from Dissecting Scaled Stellar Structure Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong-field gravity in General Relativity (GR) realized in neutron stars (NSs) renders the Equation of State (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of supradense neutron star (NS) matter to be essentially nonlinear and refines the upper bound for $\phi\equiv P/\varepsilon$ to be much smaller than the Special Relativity (SR) requirement with linear EOSs, where $P$ and $\varepsilon$ are respectively the pressure and energy density of the system considered. Specifically, a tight bound $\phi\lesssim0.374$ is obtained by anatomizing perturbatively the intrinsic structures of the scaled Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations without using any input nuclear EOS. New insights gained from this novel analysis provide EOS-model independent constraints on properties (e.g., density profiles of the sound speed squared $s^2=\d P/\d\varepsilon$ and trace anomaly $\Delta=1/3-\phi$) of cold supradense matter in NS cores. Using the gravity-matter duality in theories describing NSs, we investigate the impact of gravity on supradense matter EOS in NSs. In particular, we show that the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$, radius $R$ and its compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ scale with certain combinations of its central pressure and energy density (encapsulating its central EOS). Thus, observational data on these properties of NSs can straightforwardly constrain NS central EOSs without relying on any specific nuclear EOS-model.</description>

      <title>High-energy gamma-ray and neutrino emissions from interacting supernovae based on radiation hydrodynamic simulations: a case of SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of core-collapse supernovae revealed that the existence of dense circumstellar matter (CSM) around their progenitors is ubiquitous. Interaction of supernova ejecta with such a dense CSM is a potential production sight of high-energy cosmic rays (CRs), gamma-rays, and neutrinos. We estimate the gamma-ray and neutrino signals from SN 2023ixf, a core-collapse supernova occurred in a nearby galaxy M101, which exhibits signatures of the interaction with the confined dense CSM. Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulation model calibrated by the optical and ultraviolet observations of SN 2023ixf, we find that the CRs cannot be accelerated in the early phase because the sharp velocity jump at the shock disappears due to strong radiation pressure. Roughly 4 days after the explosion, the collisionless sub-shock is formed in the CSM, which enables the CR production and leads to gamma-ray and neutrino emissions. The shock sweeps up the entire dense CSM roughly 9 days after the explosion, which ceases the high-energy radiation. Based on this scenario, we calculate the gamma-ray and neutrino signals, which have a peak around 9 days after the explosion. We can constrain the cosmic-ray production efficiency to be less than 30\% by comparing our prediction to the Fermi-LAT data. Future multi-messenger observations with an enlarged sample of nearby supernovae will provide a better constraint on the cosmic-ray production efficiency in the early phases of supernovae.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation Of The Possible Effect Of Tetra-neutron Production On Ternary Fission Yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of including a resonant state of four neutrons in the low-density warm nuclear equation of state, using a relativistic mean-field formalism, where in-medium effects are considered. For that purpose, the abundances of 62 different clusters immersed in a gas of protons and neutrons, are calculated with and without the presence of this resonant tetraneutron state. Ternary fission experiments are environments where not only these clusters can be formed, but also where such thermodynamic conditions of low densities and moderate temperatures can be achieved. The calculated yields of isotopes with and without the tetraneutron included are then compared with experimentally observed ternary fission yields. While the results indicate that the tetraneutron has little effect on yields of other clusters under the existing ternary fission conditions, a possibly observable effect on yields of clusters emitted from the neck region in mid-peripheral heavy ion collisions is clearly suggested.</description>

Abstract: SST-1M is a single-mirror small size Cherenkov telescope prototype developed by a consortium among institutes in Switzerland, Poland, and the Czech Republic. With a 9.42 m$^2$ multi-segment mirror and a 5.6 m focal length, SST-1Ms have a broad 9 degree field of view and aim to detect gamma-rays spanning the energy range of 1 to 300 TeV. The DigiCam camera incorporates a compact Photo-Detector Plane comprising 1296 hexagonal silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels and a fully digital readout and trigger system using a 250 MHz ADC.
  Currently undergoing commissioning at the Ondrejov Observatory in the Czech Republic, two SST-1M telescopes are actively collecting data through observations of astrophysical gamma-ray sources. This presentation provides an overview of the telescope, camera design, and analysis pipeline, including evaluations of the instrument's responses. Preliminary results derived from ongoing observations are presented. A specific focus on data analysis of stereoscopic observations of the Crab Nebula provide insights on the telescope's sensitivity and performances.</description>

Abstract: SST-1M is a prototype of a single-mirror Small Size Telescope developed by a consortium of institutes from Poland, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. With a wide field of view of 9 degrees, SST-1Ms are designed to detect gamma-rays in the energy range between 1 and 300 TeV. The design of the SST-1M follows the Davies-Cotton concept, with a 9.42m2 multi-segment mirror. SST-1M is equipped with DigiCam camera, which features a fully digital readout and trigger system using 250 MHz ADC, and a compact Photo-Detector Plane (PDP) composed of 1296 pixels, each made of a hexagonal light guide coupled to silicone photomultipliers (SiPM).
  Two SST-1M telescopes are currently being commissioned at the Ondrejov Observatory in the Czech Republic, where they are successfully observing Cerenkov events in stereo. This contribution will present an overview of calibration strategies and performance evaluation based on data collected at the observatory.</description>

      <title>The axis of systematic bias in SN~Ia cosmology and implications for DESI 2024 results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative distances between a high-redshift sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), anchored to a low-redshift sample, have been instrumental in drawing insights on the nature of the dark energy driving the accelerated expansion of the universe. A combination (hereafter called SBC) of the SNe~Ia with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) recently indicated deviations from the standard interpretation of dark energy as a cosmological constant. In this paper, we analyse various systematic uncertainties in the distance measurement of SNe~Ia and their impact on the inferred dark energy properties in the canonical Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model. We model systematic effects like photometric calibration, progenitor and dust evolution, and uncertainty in the galactic extinction law. We find that all the dominant systematic errors shift the dark energy inference towards the DESI 2024 results from an underlying $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. A small change in the calibration, and change in the Milky Way dust, can give rise to systematic-driven shifts on $w_0$-$w_a$ constraints, comparable to the deviation reported from the DESI 2024 results. We forecast that the systematic uncertainties can shift the inference of $w_0-w_a$ by a few times the error ellipse for future low- and high-$z$ SN~Ia compilations and hence, it is critical to circumvent them to robustly test for deviations from $\Lambda$. A slider and visualisation tool for quantifying the impact of systematic effects on the fitted cosmological parameters is publicly available at: https://github.com/sdhawan21/DEslider.git</description>

      <title>Eccentric Binary Black Hole Simulations with Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of eccentric orbiting nonspinning black hole binaries. We first make a technical study of the optimal full numerical techniques to apply to these studies. We choose different gauge parameters and Courant factors, $c=dx/dt$, and find an optimal value for it of 0.45. We also find the grid structure and global resolution that optimize accuracy and speed of current computational resources. With these choices we perform a study of the merger times $t_m$ as a function of eccentricity for configurations with comparable orbital energy content and find that they are well represented by the post-Newtonian factor $F(e)=(1+73e^2/24+37e^4/96)/(1-e^2)^{7/2}$ when merger times are normalized to their quasicircular values, i.e. $t_m(e)/t_m\approx F(e)$. We then perform a systematic coverage of five small-medium eccentricities up to $e\sim0.45$ and six mass ratios up to 8.5:1 producing a total of 30 simulations covering up to 25 orbits to merger to further model merger times and as a seed to a forthcoming new systematic catalog of gravitational waveforms from eccentric binary black holes to directly perform parameter estimations of gravitational waves events.</description>

      <title>Standardised formats and open-source analysis tools for the MAGIC telescopes data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruments for gamma-ray astronomy at Very High Energies ($E&gt;100\,{\rm GeV}$) have traditionally derived their scientific results through proprietary data and software. Data standardisation has become a prominent issue in this field both as a requirement for the dissemination of data from the next generation of gamma-ray observatories and as an effective solution to realise public data legacies of current-generation instruments. Specifications for a standardised gamma-ray data format have been proposed as a community effort and have already been successfully adopted by several instruments.
  We present the first production of standardised data from the Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes. We converted $166\,{\rm h}$ of observations from different sources and validated their analysis with the open-source software Gammapy.
  We consider six data sets representing different scientific and technical analysis cases and compare the results obtained analysing the standardised data with open-source software against those produced with the MAGIC proprietary data and software. Aiming at a systematic production of MAGIC data in this standardised format, we also present the implementation of a database-driven pipeline automatically performing the MAGIC data reduction from the calibrated down to the standardised data level.
  In all the cases selected for the validation, we obtain results compatible with the MAGIC proprietary software, both for the manual and for the automatic data productions. Part of the validation data set is also made publicly available, thus representing the first large public release of MAGIC data.
  This effort and this first data release represent a technical milestone toward the realisation of a public MAGIC data legacy.</description>

      <title>Impact of dark boson mediated feeble interaction between dark matter and hadronic matter on $f$-mode oscillation of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the possible presence of dark matter (DM) in neutron stars (NSs) and the structural properties of the DM admixed NSs (DMANSs) in one of our recent works \cite{Guha:2024pnn}. The feeble interaction between the fermionic DM ($\chi$) with the hadronic matter is introduced through a dark scalar ($\phi$) and a dark vector ($\xi$) boson as mediators. The allowed range of the mass of the fermionic DM ($m_{\chi}$), for a particular range of DM Fermi momentum ($k_F^{\chi}$), was obtained in the same work \cite{Guha:2024pnn} with respect to the various astrophysical constraints on the structural properties of compact stars viz. the mass, radius and tidal deformability. The present work is dedicated to the calculation and study of non-radial oscillation of the DMANSs using Cowling approximation. We particularly investigate the effect of presence of DM on the fundamental ($f$) mode oscillation frequencies of the DMANSs utilizing the previously obtained range of $m_{\chi}$ for four different hadronic models. In this work we thoroughly investigate how the individual and combined effects of $m_{\chi}$ and $k_F^{\chi}$ affect the $f$-mode oscillation frequency. Within the framework of our DMANS models, for a particular value of $k_F^{\chi}$, the range of $f_{max}^{DMANS}$ with respect to the allowed range of $m_{\chi}$, is also obtained in the present work for four different hadronic models. Since in the present era, the 1.4 and 2.01 $M_{\odot}$ NSs are of special interest after the detection of GW170817 and PSR J0740+6620, we particularly investigate, for the four hadronic models, the range of $f_{1.4}^{DMANS}$ and $f_{2.01}^{DMANS}$ with respect to the acceptable range of $m_{\chi}$ corresponding to the range of $k_F^{\chi}$.</description>

      <title>Radiative cooling induced coherent maser emission in relativistic plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic plasmas in strong electromagnetic fields exhibit distinct properties compared to classical plasmas. In astrophysical environments, such as neutron stars, white dwarfs, AGNs, and shocks, relativistic plasmas are pervasive and are expected to play a crucial role in the dynamics of these systems. Despite their significance, both experimental and theoretical studies of such plasmas have been limited. Here, we present the first ab initio high-resolution kinetic simulations of relativistic plasmas undergoing synchrotron cooling in a highly magnetized medium. Our results demonstrate that these plasmas spontaneously generate coherent linearly polarised radiation (independently of the electron/positron ratio), in a wide range of parameters, via the electron cyclotron maser instability, with radiative losses altering the saturation of this instability. This enables the plasma to continously amplify coherent radiation for significantly longer durations of time. These findings highlight fundamental differences in the behaviour of relativistic plasmas in strongly magnetized environments and align with astronomical phenomena, such as pulsar emission and Fast Radio Bursts.</description>

Abstract: Ground-based cosmic ray experiments detect cosmic ray mainly by measuring the longitudinal and lateral distribution of secondary particles produced in the extensive air shower (EAS). The EAS of cosmic ray in the knee energy region is simulated via CORSIKA software. Several simulation samples with different energy, composition and zenith angles were carried out to understand the longitudinal development of electron, muon and Cherenkov light in EAS. All the results presented were obtained assuming an observation plane at an altitude of 4400 m a.s.l. The differences of longitudinal development between electron and Cherenkov light were studied, and the reconstruction uncertainty of shower maximum for electron from Cherenkov light was estimated to be 10-15g/cm$^2$ for nuclei above 1 PeV. The performances of energy measurement and the composition discrimination ability based on longitudinal development were studied and compared with that from lateral distribution. It was found that number of electron per depth at its shower maximum has the smallest shower-to-shower fluctuations, but the shower-to-shower fluctuations of electron density measured at observation level was very close to it when the appropriate zenith angle was employed. The shower-to-shower fluctuations of shower maximum for electron is 50-55 g/cm$^2$ for proton, and 20-25 g/cm$^2$ for iron, but the composition discrimination ability between nuclei from muon density measured at observation level is much better than the shower maximum variable from longitudinal development. The hadronic model dependencies of the longitudinal development and lateral distribution were also discussed.</description>

      <title>Self-organization in collisionless, high-$\beta$ turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MHD equations, as a collisional fluid model that remains in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), have long been used to describe turbulence in myriad space and astrophysical plasmas. Yet, the vast majority of these plasmas, from the solar wind to the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, are only weakly collisional at best, meaning that significant deviations from LTE are not only possible but common. Recent studies have demonstrated that the kinetic physics inherent to this weakly collisional regime can fundamentally transform the evolution of such plasmas across a wide range of scales. Here we explore the consequences of pressure anisotropy and Larmor-scale instabilities for collisionless, $\beta \gg 1$ turbulence, focusing on the role of a self-organizational effect known as `magneto-immutability'. We describe this self-organization analytically through a high-$\beta$, reduced ordering of the CGL-MHD equations, finding that it is a robust inertial-range effect that dynamically suppresses magnetic-field-strength fluctuations, anisotropic-pressure stresses, and dissipation due to heat fluxes. As a result, the turbulent cascade of Alfv\'enic fluctuations continues below the putative viscous scale to form a robust, nearly conservative, MHD-like inertial range. These findings are confirmed numerically via Landau-fluid CGL-MHD turbulence simulations that employ a collisional closure to mimic the effects of microinstabilities. We find that microinstabilities occupy a small ($\sim 5\%$) volume-filling fraction of the plasma, even when the pressure anisotropy is driven strongly towards its instability thresholds. We discuss these results in the context of recent predictions for ion-versus-electron heating in low-luminosity accretion flows and observations implying suppressed viscosity in ICM turbulence.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Mass and Radius Measurements of Neutron Stars with Dark Matter Halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high densities of neutron stars (NSs) could provide astrophysical locations for dark matter (DM) to accumulate. Depending on the DM model, these DM admixed NSs (DANSs) could have significantly different properties than pure baryonic NSs, accessible through X-ray observations of rotation-powered pulsars. We adopt the two-fluid formalism in general relativity to numerically simulate stable configurations of DANSs, assuming a fermionic equation of state (EOS) for the DM with repulsive self-interaction. The distribution of DM in the DANS as a halo affects the path of X-rays emitted from hot spots on the visible baryonic surface causing notable changes in the pulse profile observed by telescopes such as NICER, compared to pure baryonic NSs. We explore how various DM models affect the DM mass distribution, leading to different types of dark halos. We quantify the deviation in observed X-ray flux from stars with each of these halos. We identify the pitfalls in interpreting mass and radius measurements of NSs inferred from electromagnetic radiation and constraining the baryonic matter EOS, if these dark halos exist.</description>

Abstract: Recent gamma-ray observations have detected photons up to energies of a few PeV. These highly energetic gamma rays are emitted by the most powerful sources in the Galaxy. Propagating over astrophysical distances, gamma rays might interact with background photons producing electron-positron pairs, then deflected by astrophysical magnetic fields. In turn, these charged particles might scatter through inverse Compton galactic radiation fields, triggering electromagnetic cascades. In this scenario, the characterisation of astrophysical environment in which gamma rays travel, specifically background photons and magnetic fields, is crucial. We explore the impact of propagation effects on observables at Earth by simulating galactic sources emitting gamma rays with energy between $100 \; \text{GeV}$ and $100 \; \text{PeV}$. We analyse the imprint of the galactic environment on observed energy spectra and arrival direction maps, revealing gamma-ray absorption features in the former and ``deflection" of gamma rays in the latter. Specifically, owing to interstellar radiation field spatial distribution and the galactic magnetic field structure, propagation effects on observables are found to be related to the specific gamma-ray source position and to the prompt emission model. Detailed investigations of the propagation effect on galactic gamma rays will improve the robustness of both current and future gamma-ray detections and indirect dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Extracting Astrophysical Information of Highly-Eccentric Binaries in the Millihertz Gravitational Wave Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15413</link>

Abstract: Wide, highly eccentric ($e&gt;0.9$) compact binaries can naturally arise as progenitors of gravitational wave (GW) mergers. These systems are expected to have a significant population in the mHz band, with their GW signals characterized by ``repeated bursts" emitted upon each pericenter passage. In this study, we show that the detection of mHz GW signals from highly eccentric stellar mass binaries in the local universe can strongly constrain their orbital parameters. Specifically, it can achieve a relative measurement error of $\sim 10^{-6}$ for orbital frequency and $\sim 1\%$ for eccentricity (as $1-e$) in most of the detectable cases. On the other hand, the binary's mass ratio, distance, and intrinsic orbital inclination may be less precisely determined due to degeneracies in the GW waveform. We also perform mock LISA data analysis to evaluate the realistic detectability of highly eccentric compact binaries. Our results show that highly eccentric systems could be efficiently identified when multiple GW sources and stationary Gaussian instrumental noise are present in the detector output. This work highlights the potential of extracting the signal of ``bursting'' LISA sources to provide valuable insights into their orbital evolution, surrounding environment, and formation channels.</description>

      <title>Analytic solutions for the linearized first-order magnetohydrodynamics and implications for causality and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the linear-mode analysis performed near an equilibrium configuration in the fluid rest frame with a dynamical magnetic field perturbed on a constant configuration. We develop a simple and general algorithm for an analytic solution search that works on an order-by-order basis in the derivative expansion. This method can be applied to general sets of hydrodynamic equations. Applying our method to the first-order relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, we demonstrate that the method finds a complete set of solutions. We obtain two sets of analytic solutions for the four and two coupled modes with seven dissipative transport coefficients. The former set has been missing in the literature for a long time due to the difficulties originating from coupled degrees of freedom and strong anisotropy provided by a magnetic field. The newly developed method resolves these difficulties. We also find that the small-momentum expansions of the solutions break down when the momentum direction is nearly perpendicular to an equilibrium magnetic field due to the presence of another small quantity, that is, a trigonometric function representing the anisotropy. We elaborate on the angle dependence of the solutions and provide alternative series representations that work near the right angle. This identifies the origin of a discrepancy found in recent works. Finally, we discuss the issues of causality and stability based on our analytic solutions and recent developments in the literature.</description>

      <title>Solar flare observations with the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Radio Neutrino Observatory - Greenland (RNO-G) seeks discovery of ultra-high energy neutrinos from the cosmos through their interactions in ice. The science program extends beyond particle astrophysics to include radioglaciology and, as we show herein, solar observations, as well. Currently seven of 35 planned radio-receiver stations (24 antennas/station) are operational. These stations are sensitive to impulsive radio signals with frequencies between 80 and 700 MHz and feature a neutrino trigger threshold for recording data close to the thermal floor. RNO-G can also trigger on elevated signals from the Sun, resulting in nanosecond resolution time-domain flare data; such temporal resolution is significantly shorter than from most dedicated solar observatories. In addition to possible RNO-G solar flare polarization measurements, the Sun also represents an extremely useful above-surface calibration source.
  Using RNO-G data recorded during the summers of 2022 and 2023, we find signal excesses during solar flares reported by the solar-observing Callisto network and also in coincidence with $\sim$2/3 of the brightest excesses recorded by the SWAVES satellite. These observed flares are characterized by significant time-domain impulsivity. Using the known position of the Sun, the flare sample is used to calibrate the RNO-G absolute pointing on the radio signal arrival direction to sub-degree resolution. We thus establish the Sun as a regularly observed astronomical calibration source to provide the accurate absolute pointing required for neutrino astronomy.</description>

      <title>Unraveling alignment pattern in high-energy particles via transverse momentum disbalance analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis of the relation between the observed alignment of spots in the X-ray films in cosmic ray emulsion experiments and the selection procedure of the highest-energy particles together with the transverse momentum conservation are tested in the framework of the HYDJET++ model. Results show that the high degree of alignment can appear at the reasonable values of transverse momentum disbalance of selected most energetic particles.</description>
