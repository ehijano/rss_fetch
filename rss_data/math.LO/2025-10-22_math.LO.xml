      <title>Definability over $\mathrm B\Sigma^0_2$-models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak M=(M,\mathcal X)$ be a model of $\mathsf{RCA}_0+\text{$\Sigma^0_2$-bounding}$ in which $\Sigma^0_2(A)$-induction fails for some $A\in\mathcal X$. We show that (i) if $\mathfrak M$ is a model of the combinatorial principle Ramsey's Theorem for Pairs, the Cohesive Set Theorem or the Tree Theorem, then there is a $\Delta^0_1(A)$-instance of the principle with no solution in $\mathfrak M$ that is arithmetically definable relative to $A$; and (ii) any set of minimal Turing degree in $\mathfrak M$ that is arithmetically definable relative to $A$ has Turing jump equivalent to $A'$.</description>

      <title>Predicative Ordinal Recursion on the Constructive Veblen Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Leivant's work on absolute predicativism, Bellantoni and Cook in 1992 introduced a structurally restricted form of recursion called predicative recursion. Using this recursion scheme on the inductive structures of natural numbers and binary strings, they provide a structural and machine-independent characterization of the classes of linear-space and polynomial-time computable functions, respectively. This recursion scheme can be applied to any well-founded or inductive structure, and its underlying principle, predicativization, extends naturally to other computational frameworks, such as higher-order functionals and nested recursion.
  In this paper, we initiate a systematic project to gauge the computational power of predicative recursion on arbitrary well-founded structures. As a natural measuring stick for well-foundedness, we use constructive ordinals. More precisely, for any downset $\mathsf{A}$ of constructive ordinals, we define a class $\mathrm{PredR}_{\mathsf{A}}$ of predicative ordinal recursive functions that are permitted to employ a suitable form of predicative recursion on the ordinals in $\mathsf{A}$. We focus on the case that $\mathsf{A}$ is a downset of constructive ordinals below ${\phi}_{{\omega}}({0}) = \bigcup_{k=0}^{\infty} {\phi}_k({0})$, where $\{{\phi}_k\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ are the functions in the Veblen hierarchy with finite index. We give a complete classification of $\mathrm{PredR}_{\mathsf{A}}$ -- for those downsets that contain at least one infinite ordinal -- in terms of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy $\{\mathcal{E}_k\}_{k=2}^{\omega}$. In this way, we extend Bellantoni-Cook's characterization of $\mathcal{E}_2$ (the class of linear-space computable functions) to obtain a machine-independent and structural characterization of the entire Grzegorczyk hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Antichain of ordinals in intuitionistic set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical set theory, the ordinals form a linear chain that we often think of as a very thin portion of the set-theoretic universe. In intuitionistic set theory, however, this is not the case and there can be incomparable ordinals. In this paper, we shall show that starting from two incomparable ordinals, one can construct canonical bijections from any arbitrary set to an antichain of ordinals, and consequently any subset of the given set can be defined using ordinals as parameters. This implies the surprising result that in the theory "$\mathrm{IKP} + {}$there exist two incomparable ordinals", the statements $\mathrm{Ord} \subseteq L$ and $V = L$ are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Undecidability on Diophantine equations over $\mathbb Z[i]$ with $20$ unknowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that Hilbert's Tenth Problem over the Gaussian ring $\mathbb Z[i]=\{a+bi:\ a,b\in\mathbb Z\}$ is undecidable. In this paper we obtain the following further result: There is no algorithm to decide whether an arbitrarily given polynomial equation $P(z_1,\ldots,z_{20})=0$ (with integer coefficients) is solvable over $\mathbb Z[i]$. This improves the previous record involving $52$ variables.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every Polish group with more than two elements admits a non-trivial topological group automorphism. As a consequence, a hypothetical uniquely homogeneous Polish space with more than two points cannot be a semitopological group.</description>

      <title>Connecting the space of marked groups and the space of group operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a connection between two well-studied spaces of countable groups: the space of group operations and the space of marked groups. This connection shows that the two spaces are equivalent in terms of generic properties in the sense of Baire category, which allows us to translate several results from the former setting to the latter. As an application, we give new, shorter proofs of two theorems that concern the generic behavior of compact metrizable abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes are concerned with the existence and the basic properties of the set-theoretic universes for nonstandard analysis, compiled by a beginner in the subject. It assumes a basic background in first-order logic, though the necessary material is revised in Appendix A. Needless to say, none of the material presented here is original, but has been adapted from standard sources.</description>

      <title>Constructive Ordinal Exponentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14542v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cantor's ordinal numbers, a powerful extension of the natural numbers, are a cornerstone of set theory. They can be used to reason about the termination of processes, prove the consistency of logical systems, and justify some of the core principles of modern programming language theory such as recursion. In classical mathematics, ordinal arithmetic is well-studied; constructively, where ordinals are taken to be transitive, extensional, and wellfounded orders on sets, addition and multiplication are well-known. We present a negative result showing that general constructive ordinal exponentiation is impossible, but we suggest two definitions that come close. The first definition is abstract and solely motivated by the expected equations; this works as long as the base of the exponential is positive. The second definition is based on decreasing lists and can be seen as a constructive version of Sierpi\'nski's definition via functions with finite support; this requires the base to have a trichotomous least element. Whenever it makes sense to ask the question, the two constructions are equivalent, allowing us to prove algebraic laws, cancellation properties, and preservation of decidability of the exponential. The core ideas do not depend on any specific constructive set theory or type theory, but a concrete computer-checked mechanization using the Agda proof assistant is given in homotopy type theory.</description>
