      <title>Pattern Formation Beyond Turing: Physical Principles of Mass-Conserving Reaction--Diffusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracellular protein patterns govern essential cellular functions by dynamically redistributing proteins between membrane-bound and cytosolic states, conserving their total numbers. This review presents a theoretical framework for understanding such patterns based on mass-conserving reaction--diffusion systems. The emergence, selection, and evolution of patterns are analyzed in terms of mass redistribution and interface motion, resulting in mesoscale laws of coarsening and wavelength selection. A geometric phase-space perspective provides a conceptual tool to link local reactive equilibria with global pattern dynamics through conserved mass fluxes. The Min protein system of \emph{Escherichia coli} provides a paradigmatic example, enabling direct comparison between theory and experiment. Successive model refinements capture both the robustness of pattern formation and the diversity of dynamic regimes observed \emph{in vivo} and \emph{in vitro}. The Min system thus illustrates how to extract predictive, multiscale theory from biochemical detail, providing a foundation for understanding pattern formation in more complex and synthetic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Correlation and Synchronisation-Enhanced Energy Transfer in Driven-Dissipative Light-Harvesting Dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum synchronisation has recently been proposed as a mechanism for electronic energy transfer in light-harvesting complexes, yet its robustness in the presence of strong vibrational dissipation remains under active investigation. We revisit this process in cryptophyte photosynthetic antennae using the exciton-vibrational dimer model. By comparing the quantum dynamics with classical rate equations for electronic density-matrix populations and vibrational-mode observables, we show how both environment-assisted transfer and coherent-light pumping can sustain significant energy flow despite strong electronic dephasing. Our open quantum systems (OQS) computational treatment highlights the quantum correlations between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom that underpin synchronisation-enhanced transfer efficiency in the driven-dissipative regime, suggesting potential avenues for future investigation of solar energy-transfer mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of Inertial Impact and Propulsive Force in a Eukaryotic Swimmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transduction of force into motion for microswimmers at intermediate Reynolds numbers ($Re \sim 1$), where inertia becomes relevant, is a fundamental problem in active matter. Using the multicellular alga \textit{Volvox} as a model physical system, we perform the first direct measurements that deconvolve a swimmer's inertial impact force from its motor's propulsive force. We discover a $\sim$30 Hz propulsive pulse, the mechanical signature of collective ciliary action. This high-frequency motor output drives a fluctuating velocity in the low-$Re$ \textit{V. carteri}, but is mechanically filtered by the inertia of the larger \textit{V. ferrisii}, resulting in a smooth swimming trajectory. Our work demonstrates that for swimmers beyond the Stokes regime, kinematics are not a direct proxy for the underlying motor dynamics, a foundational assumption in the study of microscopic motility.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Heterogeneity and the Nuclear Mechanome: Towards an Omics-Level Understanding of Nuclear Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cell nucleus is increasingly recognized as a mechanosensitive organelle whose mesoscale mechanical heterogeneity (100 nm 10 um) is inseparable from genome regulation yet remains weakly integrated into systems biology and omics frameworks. Here we synthesize experimental and theoretical advances that define a nuclear mechanome: a multidimensional state of mechanical observables spanning lamins, chromatin, nucleoplasm and condensates, and varying across space, time, and cells. We review how intranuclear gradients, chromatin domains and phase-separated bodies generate viscoelastic, poroelastic and plastic niches that shape transcription, replication, DNA repair, epigenetic metabolism, and clonal selection, with particular emphasis on cancer, laminopathies and ageing. We survey invasive, optical and high throughput mechanophenotyping techniques, together with continuum, shell polymer, mesoscopic and non-equilibrium models, as a toolkit for mechanomic mapping. Finally, we outline a research agenda towards standardized mechanical descriptors, tissue-level mechano multi omic atlases and mechanotherapeutic strategies that explicitly target nuclear mechanotypes as potential biomarkers that can define cellular identity, explain plasticity, and help predict pathological states or the evolution of several diseases.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Graining via Lumping: Exact Calculations and Fundamental Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting broken time-reversibility at micro- and nanoscale is often difficult when experiments offer limited state resolution. We introduce a lumping method that builds an effective semi-Markov model able to reproduce exactly the full entropy-production statistics of the microscopic dynamics. The mean entropy production stays accurate even when hidden current-carrying cycles are merged, though higher-order information can be unavoidably lost. In these cases, we capture violations of fluctuation theorems consistent with experiments, opening a path to novel inference strategies out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Coherence Dispersion and Temperature Scales in a Quantum-Biology Toy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how quantum coherence can scatter among the several off-diagonal elements of an arbitrary quantum state, defining coherence dispersion ($\Delta_{\rm c}$). It turns out that this easily computable quantity is maximized for intermediate values of an appropriate entropy, a prevalent signature of complexity quantifiers across different fields, from linguistics and information science to evolutionary biology. By focusing on out-of-equilibrium systems, we use the developed framework to address a simplified model of cellular energetics, involving remanent coherence. Within the context of this model, the precise energy of 30.5 kJ/mol (the yield of ATP-ADP conversion) causes the temperature range where $\Delta_{\rm c}$ is maximized to be compatible with temperatures for which unicellular life is reported to exist. Low levels of coherence suffice to support this conclusion.</description>

      <title>Morphogenesis of bacterial colonies in liquid crystalline environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural bacterial habitats are often complex fluids with viscoelastic and anisotropic responses to stress; for example, they can take the form of liquid crystals (LCs), with elongated microscopic constituents that collectively align while still retaining the ability to flow. However, laboratory studies typically focus on cells in simple liquids or complex fluids with randomly-oriented constituents. Here, we show how interactions with LCs shape bacterial proliferation in multicellular colonies. Using experiments, we find that in a nematic LC, cells generically form aligned single-cell-wide "chains" as they reproduce. As these chains lengthen, they eventually buckle in a highly localized manner. By combining our measurements with a continuum mechanical theory, we demonstrate that this distinctive morphogenetic program emerges because cells are kept in alignment due to the LC's elasticity; as each chain lengthens, growth-induced viscous stresses along its contour eventually overcome the elasticity of the surrounding nematic, leading to buckling. Our work thus reveals and provides mechanistic insight into the previously-overlooked role of LCs in sculpting bacterial life in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Rethinking massive multiplexing in whispering gallery mode biosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, label-free quantification of multiple analytes in complex biological media remains a major challenge due to limited multiplexing, signal cross-correlations, and inconsistency across sensor samples and measurement runs. We introduce a multiplexed whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) biosensing framework that overcomes these barriers by jointly advancing photonic integration and data analytics. Our glass-chip platform enables massive, parallelized and flexible multiplexing of &gt;10000 microresonators organized into up to 100 sensing channels, with universal and modular chip design and detection hardware, while maintaining loaded Q-factors of 10^6. Our novel hybrid deep-learning framework BioCCF that integrates domain adaptation with cross-channel fusion enables harmonization of responses across sensing chips and extraction of nonlinear correlations in complex mixtures. Using a highly heterogeneous dataset comprising over 200 hours of sensing data acquired from nine chips with different channel configurations, biological replicates, and repeated regeneration cycles, we demonstrate recalibration-free identification of solution (99.3\% accuracy) and quantification of immunoglobulin G components with relative prediction error of 10^-4 under 5 min. The affordability and modularity of the platform enable distributed data acquisition and aggregation into shared repositories, providing a pathway toward continuously improving model generalization, cross-validation and a scalable, community-driven paradigm for biosensing.</description>

      <title>Field-Particle Interactions in Curved Flows for Shape-Asymmetric Active Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that curvatures in general ambient flow profiles can align shape-asymmetric active particles, revealing a previously overlooked competition with externally applied aligning fields. Focusing on the ubiquitous case of channel flows, we then investigate the fundamental consequences of this competition for the dynamics of shape-asymmetric active particles in microchannels in the presence of orienting fields. We find that this interplay gives rise to novel mechanisms for controlling particle dynamics, with potentially broad applications, and suggests exciting possibilities such as active-particle analogs of electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale Simulations of Thrombin Activation and Fibrin Formation in Microvascular and In Vitro Settings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blood coagulation is governed by tightly regulated reaction networks that unfold within a flowing, heterogeneous microvascular environment. Reduced kinetic models of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways have seen limited in vitro validation, and their behavior within spatially resolved flow fields remains largely unexplored. Here, we embed two established reduced networks into a recently proposed mesoscale particle-based framework that resolves fluid momentum transport alongside multispecies advection-diffusion-reaction dynamics. We investigate the initiation phase of coagulation by simulating thrombin formation in microvascular geometries and in vitro assays, and we assess the framework's ability to reproduce thrombin generation curves (TGCs) under physiologically relevant conditions. We further examine how variations in fibrinogen levels - an important determinant of clot structure and a biomarker for inflammation and thrombosis - affect thrombin and fibrin formation. Overall, this study provides a unified computational approach for analysing how biochemical kinetics interact with transport processes, offering insights relevant to thrombosis modeling and blood diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Transmembrane transport of polymer brush-grafted nanoparticles into giant vesicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer brush-grafted nanoparticles have significant application value in fields such as gene therapy and targeted drug delivery. A profound understanding of the interaction mechanisms between these particles and cell membranes represents a critical scientific challenge in biophysics. Using the Self-Consistent Field Theory, this work systematically explores the transmembrane transport of polymer brush-grafted nanoparticles into giant vesicles. The impacts of critical parameters-polymer brush grafting density, nanoparticle size, and giant vesicle membrane thickness-on transport behavior are comprehensively elucidated. The findings reveal two distinct transmembrane transport mechanisms for polymer brush-grafted nanoparticles, which are governed by membrane thickness and grafting density. At high grafting density, the nanoparticles undergo direct transmembrane translocation; at low grafting density, transport occurs via endocytosis. Thermodynamic analysis identifies entropy as the dominant driving force for this process.</description>

      <title>Active Force Dynamics in Red Blood Cells Under Non-Invasive Optical Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) sustain mechanical stresses associated with microcirculatory flow through ATP-driven plasma membrane flickering. This is an active phenomenon driven by motor proteins that regulate interactions between the spectrin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer; it is manifested in RBC shape fluctuations reflecting the cell's mechanical and metabolic state. Yet, direct quantification of the forces and energetic costs underlying this non-equilibrium behavior remains challenging due to the invasiveness of existing techniques. Here, a minimally invasive method that combines bead-free, low-power optical tweezers with high-speed video microscopy was employed to track local membrane forces and displacements in single RBCs during the same time window. This independent dual-channel measurement enabled the construction of a mechano-dynamic phase space for RBCs under different chemical treatments, that allowed for differentiating between metabolic and structural states based on their fluctuation-force signatures. Quantification of mechanical work during flickering demonstrated that membrane softening enhanced fluctuations while elevating energy dissipation. The proposed optical tweezers methodology provides a robust framework for mapping the active mechanics of living cells, enabling precise probing of cellular physiology and detection of biomechanical dysfunction in diseases.</description>

      <title>Marrying critical oscillators with traveling waves shapes nonlinear sound processing in the cochlea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cochlea's capacity to process a broad range of sound intensities has been linked to nonlinear amplification by critical oscillators. However, while the increasing sensitivity of a critical oscillator upon decreasing the stimulus magnitude comes with proportionally sharper frequency tuning and slower responsiveness -- critical slowing down, the observed bandwidth of cochlear frequency tuning and the cochlear response time vary little with sound level. Because the cochlea operates as a distributed system rather than a single critical oscillator, it remains unclear whether criticality can serve as a fundamental principle for cochlear amplification. Here we tackle this challenge by integrating tonopically distributed critical oscillators in a traveling-wave model of the cochlea. Importantly, critical oscillators generically provide spatial buildup of energy gain from energy pumping into the waves and a key nonlinearity. In addition, our nonlinear model accounts for viscoelastic coupling between the oscillators. The model produces, with a single set of parameters, a family of cochlear tuning curves that quantitatively describe experimental data over a broad range of input levels. Overall, the interplay between generic nonlinear properties of local critical oscillators and distributed effects from traveling waves gives rise to a collective nonlinear response that preserves the power-law responsiveness afforded by criticality, but without paying the price of critical slowing down.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As epithelial development or wound closure approaches completion, cell proliferation progressively slows via contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP) - a mechanism understood as being strictly local. Here we report the discovery of inhibition of proliferation through an unanticipated mechanism that is non-local. As a confluent epithelial layer becomes progressively more jammed, two interpenetrating networks emerge: islands of mechanically compressed non-cycling cells percolating within an ocean of mechanically tensed cycling cells. The evolution of the compression network was found to be susceptible to both specific molecular stimulus and to injury-induced unjamming. Yet, in all circumstances, the size of compressed islands followed a power-law distribution that was well-captured by preferential network theory. Together, these findings demonstrate the existence of a network-based inhibition of proliferation (NIP) that is self-organizing and poised in proximity to criticality.</description>

      <title>Tracking large chemical reaction networks and rare events by neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks are widely used to model stochastic dynamics in chemical kinetics, systems biology and epidemiology. Solving the chemical master equation that governs these systems poses a significant challenge due to the large state space exponentially growing with system sizes. The development of autoregressive neural networks offers a flexible framework for this problem; however, its efficiency is limited especially for high-dimensional systems and in scenarios with rare events. Here, we push the frontier of neural-network approach by exploiting faster optimizations such as natural gradient descent and time-dependent variational principle, achieving a 5- to 22-fold speedup, and by leveraging enhanced-sampling strategies to capture rare events. We demonstrate reduced computational cost and higher accuracy over the previous neural-network method in challenging reaction networks, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade network, the hitherto largest biological network handled by the previous approaches of solving the chemical master equation. We further apply the approach to spatially extended reaction-diffusion systems, the Schl\"ogl model with rare events, on two-dimensional lattices, beyond the recent tensor-network approach that handles one-dimensional lattices. The present approach thus enables efficient modeling of chemical reaction networks in general.</description>
