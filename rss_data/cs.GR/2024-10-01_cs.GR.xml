      <title>4Doodle: Two-handed Gestures for Immersive Sketching of Architectural Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18887v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional immersive sketching for content creation and modeling has been studied for some time. However, research in this domain mainly focused on CAVE-like scenarios. These setups can be expensive and offer a narrow interaction space. Building more affordable setups using head-mounted displays is possible, allowing greater immersion and a larger space for user physical movements. This paper presents a fully immersive environment using bi-manual gestures to sketch and create content freely in the virtual world. This approach can be applied to many scenarios, allowing people to express their ideas or review existing designs. To cope with known motor difficulties and inaccuracy of freehand 3D sketching, we explore proxy geometry and a laser-like metaphor to draw content directly from models and create content surfaces. Our current prototype offers 24 cubic meters for movement, limited by the room size. It features infinite virtual drawing space through pan and scale techniques and is larger than the typical 6-sided cave at a fraction of the cost. In a preliminary study conducted with architects and engineers, our system showed a clear promise as a tool for sketching and 3D content creation in virtual reality with a great emphasis on bi-manual gestures.</description>

      <title>Neural Product Importance Sampling via Warp Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving high efficiency in modern photorealistic rendering hinges on using Monte Carlo sampling distributions that closely approximate the illumination integral estimated for every pixel. Samples are typically generated from a set of simple distributions, each targeting a different factor in the integrand, which are combined via multiple importance sampling. The resulting mixture distribution can be far from the actual product of all factors, leading to sub-optimal variance even for direct-illumination estimation. We present a learning-based method that uses normalizing flows to efficiently importance sample illumination product integrals, e.g., the product of environment lighting and material terms. Our sampler composes a flow head warp with an emitter tail warp. The small conditional head warp is represented by a neural spline flow, while the large unconditional tail is discretized per environment map and its evaluation is instant. If the conditioning is low-dimensional, the head warp can be also discretized to achieve even better performance. We demonstrate variance reduction over prior methods on a range of applications comprising complex geometry, materials and illumination.</description>

      <title>Neural-Polyptych: Content Controllable Painting Recreation for Diverse Genres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To bridge the gap between artists and non-specialists, we present a unified framework, Neural-Polyptych, to facilitate the creation of expansive, high-resolution paintings by seamlessly incorporating interactive hand-drawn sketches with fragments from original paintings. We have designed a multi-scale GAN-based architecture to decompose the generation process into two parts, each responsible for identifying global and local features. To enhance the fidelity of semantic details generated from users' sketched outlines, we introduce a Correspondence Attention module utilizing our Reference Bank strategy. This ensures the creation of high-quality, intricately detailed elements within the artwork. The final result is achieved by carefully blending these local elements while preserving coherent global consistency. Consequently, this methodology enables the production of digital paintings at megapixel scale, accommodating diverse artistic expressions and enabling users to recreate content in a controlled manner. We validate our approach to diverse genres of both Eastern and Western paintings. Applications such as large painting extension, texture shuffling, genre switching, mural art restoration, and recomposition can be successfully based on our framework.</description>

      <title>RNG: Relightable Neural Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19702v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown its impressive power in novel view synthesis. However, creating relightable 3D assets, especially for objects with ill-defined shapes (e.g., fur), is still a challenging task. For these scenes, the decomposition between the light, geometry, and material is more ambiguous, as neither the surface constraints nor the analytical shading model hold. To address this issue, we propose RNG, a novel representation of relightable neural Gaussians, enabling the relighting of objects with both hard surfaces or fluffy boundaries. We avoid any assumptions in the shading model but maintain feature vectors, which can be further decoded by an MLP into colors, in each Gaussian point. Following prior work, we utilize a point light to reduce the ambiguity and introduce a shadow-aware condition to the network. We additionally propose a depth refinement network to help the shadow computation under the 3DGS framework, leading to better shadow effects under point lights. Furthermore, to avoid the blurriness brought by the alpha-blending in 3DGS, we design a hybrid forward-deferred optimization strategy. As a result, we achieve about $20\times$ faster in training and about $600\times$ faster in rendering than prior work based on neural radiance fields, with $60$ frames per second on an RTX4090.</description>

      <title>RoCoTex: A Robust Method for Consistent Texture Synthesis with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-texture generation has recently attracted increasing attention, but existing methods often suffer from the problems of view inconsistencies, apparent seams, and misalignment between textures and the underlying mesh. In this paper, we propose a robust text-to-texture method for generating consistent and seamless textures that are well aligned with the mesh. Our method leverages state-of-the-art 2D diffusion models, including SDXL and multiple ControlNets, to capture structural features and intricate details in the generated textures. The method also employs a symmetrical view synthesis strategy combined with regional prompts for enhancing view consistency. Additionally, it introduces novel texture blending and soft-inpainting techniques, which significantly reduce the seam regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>RISE-SDF: a Relightable Information-Shared Signed Distance Field for Glossy Object Inverse Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end relightable neural inverse rendering system that achieves high-quality reconstruction of geometry and material properties, thus enabling high-quality relighting. The cornerstone of our method is a two-stage approach for learning a better factorization of scene parameters. In the first stage, we develop a reflection-aware radiance field using a neural signed distance field (SDF) as the geometry representation and deploy an MLP (multilayer perceptron) to estimate indirect illumination. In the second stage, we introduce a novel information-sharing network structure to jointly learn the radiance field and the physically based factorization of the scene. For the physically based factorization, to reduce the noise caused by Monte Carlo sampling, we apply a split-sum approximation with a simplified Disney BRDF and cube mipmap as the environment light representation. In the relighting phase, to enhance the quality of indirect illumination, we propose a second split-sum algorithm to trace secondary rays under the split-sum rendering framework.Furthermore, there is no dataset or protocol available to quantitatively evaluate the inverse rendering performance for glossy objects. To assess the quality of material reconstruction and relighting, we have created a new dataset with ground truth BRDF parameters and relighting results. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in inverse rendering and relighting, with particularly strong results in the reconstruction of highly reflective objects.</description>

      <title>COLLAGE: Collaborative Human-Agent Interaction Generation using Hierarchical Latent Diffusion and Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework COLLAGE for generating collaborative agent-object-agent interactions by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and hierarchical motion-specific vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs). Our model addresses the lack of rich datasets in this domain by incorporating the knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs to guide a generative diffusion model. The hierarchical VQ-VAE architecture captures different motion-specific characteristics at multiple levels of abstraction, avoiding redundant concepts and enabling efficient multi-resolution representation. We introduce a diffusion model that operates in the latent space and incorporates LLM-generated motion planning cues to guide the denoising process, resulting in prompt-specific motion generation with greater control and diversity. Experimental results on the CORE-4D, and InterHuman datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating realistic and diverse collaborative human-object-human interactions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling complex interactions in various domains, such as robotics, graphics and computer vision.</description>

      <title>Dual Encoder GAN Inversion for High-Fidelity 3D Head Reconstruction from Single Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D GAN inversion aims to project a single image into the latent space of a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), thereby achieving 3D geometry reconstruction. While there exist encoders that achieve good results in 3D GAN inversion, they are predominantly built on EG3D, which specializes in synthesizing near-frontal views and is limiting in synthesizing comprehensive 3D scenes from diverse viewpoints. In contrast to existing approaches, we propose a novel framework built on PanoHead, which excels in synthesizing images from a 360-degree perspective. To achieve realistic 3D modeling of the input image, we introduce a dual encoder system tailored for high-fidelity reconstruction and realistic generation from different viewpoints. Accompanying this, we propose a stitching framework on the triplane domain to get the best predictions from both. To achieve seamless stitching, both encoders must output consistent results despite being specialized for different tasks. For this reason, we carefully train these encoders using specialized losses, including an adversarial loss based on our novel occlusion-aware triplane discriminator. Experiments reveal that our approach surpasses the existing encoder training methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

      <title>SpaceMesh: A Continuous Representation for Learning Manifold Surface Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meshes are ubiquitous in visual computing and simulation, yet most existing machine learning techniques represent meshes only indirectly, e.g. as the level set of a scalar field or deformation of a template, or as a disordered triangle soup lacking local structure. This work presents a scheme to directly generate manifold, polygonal meshes of complex connectivity as the output of a neural network. Our key innovation is to define a continuous latent connectivity space at each mesh vertex, which implies the discrete mesh. In particular, our vertex embeddings generate cyclic neighbor relationships in a halfedge mesh representation, which gives a guarantee of edge-manifoldness and the ability to represent general polygonal meshes. This representation is well-suited to machine learning and stochastic optimization, without restriction on connectivity or topology. We first explore the basic properties of this representation, then use it to fit distributions of meshes from large datasets. The resulting models generate diverse meshes with tessellation structure learned from the dataset population, with concise details and high-quality mesh elements. In applications, this approach not only yields high-quality outputs from generative models, but also enables directly learning challenging geometry processing tasks such as mesh repair.</description>

      <title>Efficient GPU Cloth Simulation with Non-distance Barriers and Subspace Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19272v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper pushes the performance of cloth simulation, making the simulation interactive even for high-resolution garment models while keeping every triangle untangled. The penetration-free guarantee is inspired by the interior point method, which converts the inequality constraints to barrier potentials. We propose a major overhaul of this modality within the projective dynamics framework by leveraging an adaptive weighting mechanism inspired by barrier formulation. This approach does not depend on the distance between mesh primitives, but on the virtual life span of a collision event and thus keeps all the vertices within feasible region. Such a non-distance barrier model allows a new way to integrate collision resolution into the simulation pipeline. Another contributor to the performance boost comes from the subspace reuse strategy. This is based on the observation that low-frequency strain propagation is near orthogonal to the deformation induced by collisions or self-collisions, often of high frequency. Subspace reuse then takes care of low-frequency residuals, while high-frequency residuals can also be effectively smoothed by GPU-based iterative solvers. We show that our method outperforms existing fast cloth simulators by at least one order while producing high-quality animations of high-resolution models.</description>

      <title>Volumetric Homogenization for Knitwear Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents volumetric homogenization, a spatially varying homogenization scheme for knitwear simulation. We are motivated by the observation that macro-scale fabric dynamics is strongly correlated with its underlying knitting patterns. Therefore, homogenization towards a single material is less effective when the knitting is complex and non-repetitive. Our method tackles this challenge by homogenizing the yarn-level material locally at volumetric elements. Assigning a virtual volume of a knitting structure enables us to model bending and twisting effects via a simple volume-preserving penalty and thus effectively alleviates the material nonlinearity. We employ an adjoint Gauss-Newton formulation to battle the dimensionality challenge of such per-element material optimization. This intuitive material model makes the forward simulation GPU-friendly. To this end, our pipeline also equips a novel domain-decomposed subspace solver crafted for GPU projective dynamics, which makes our simulator hundreds of times faster than the yarn-level simulator. Experiments validate the capability and effectiveness of volumetric homogenization. Our method produces realistic animations of knitwear matching the quality of full-scale yarn-level simulations. It is also orders of magnitude faster than existing homogenization techniques in both the training and simulation stages.</description>

      <title>Instant Facial Gaussians Translator for Relightable and Interactable Facial Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose GauFace, a novel Gaussian Splatting representation, tailored for efficient animation and rendering of physically-based facial assets. Leveraging strong geometric priors and constrained optimization, GauFace ensures a neat and structured Gaussian representation, delivering high fidelity and real-time facial interaction of 30fps@1440p on a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile platform.
  Then, we introduce TransGS, a diffusion transformer that instantly translates physically-based facial assets into the corresponding GauFace representations. Specifically, we adopt a patch-based pipeline to handle the vast number of Gaussians effectively. We also introduce a novel pixel-aligned sampling scheme with UV positional encoding to ensure the throughput and rendering quality of GauFace assets generated by our TransGS. Once trained, TransGS can instantly translate facial assets with lighting conditions to GauFace representation, With the rich conditioning modalities, it also enables editing and animation capabilities reminiscent of traditional CG pipelines.
  We conduct extensive evaluations and user studies, compared to traditional offline and online renderers, as well as recent neural rendering methods, which demonstrate the superior performance of our approach for facial asset rendering. We also showcase diverse immersive applications of facial assets using our TransGS approach and GauFace representation, across various platforms like PCs, phones and even VR headsets.</description>
