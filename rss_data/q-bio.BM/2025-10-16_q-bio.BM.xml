      <title>Coder as Editor: Code-driven Interpretable Molecular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution, MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design, laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative human-AI workflows in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Determining the optimal structural resolution of proteins through an information-theoretic analysis of their conformational ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08076v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The choice of structural resolution is a fundamental aspect of protein modelling, determining the balance between descriptive power and interpretability. Although atomistic simulations provide maximal detail, much of this information is redundant to understand the relevant large-scale motions and conformational states. Here, we introduce an unsupervised, information-theoretic framework that determines the minimal number of atoms required to retain a maximally informative description of the configurational space sampled by a protein. This framework quantifies the informativeness of coarse-grained representations obtained by systematically decimating atomic degrees of freedom and evaluating the resulting clustering of sampled conformations. Application to molecular dynamics trajectories of dynamically diverse proteins shows that the optimal number of retained atoms scales linearly with system size, averaging about four heavy atoms per residue--remarkably consistent with the resolution of well-established coarse-grained models, such as MARTINI and SIRAH. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the optimal retained atoms number depends not only on molecular size but also on the extent of conformational exploration, decreasing for systems dominated by collective motions. The proposed method establishes a general criterion to identify the minimal structural detail that preserves the essential configurational information, thereby offering a new viewpoint on the structure-dynamics-function relationship in proteins and guiding the construction of parsimonious yet informative multiscale models.</description>
