      <title>Solving physics-based initial value problems with unsupervised machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Initial value problems -- a system of ordinary differential equations and corresponding initial conditions -- can be used to describe many physical phenomena including those arise in classical mechanics. We have developed a novel approach to solve physics-based initial value problems using unsupervised machine learning. We propose a deep learning framework that models the dynamics of a variety of mechanical systems through neural networks. Our framework is flexible, allowing us to solve non-linear, coupled, and chaotic dynamical systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on systems including a free particle, a particle in a gravitational field, a classical pendulum, and the H\'enon--Heiles system (a pair of coupled harmonic oscillators with a non-linear perturbation, used in celestial mechanics). Our results show that deep neural networks can successfully approximate solutions to these problems, producing trajectories which conserve physical properties such as energy and those with stationary action. We note that probabilistic activation functions, as defined in this paper, are required to learn any solutions of initial value problems in their strictest sense, and we introduce coupled neural networks to learn solutions of coupled systems.</description>

      <title>REMIX SPH -- improving mixing in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations using a generalised, material-independent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present REMIX, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme designed to alleviate effects that typically suppress mixing and instability growth at density discontinuities in SPH simulations. We approach this problem by directly targeting sources of kernel smoothing error and discretisation error, resulting in a generalised, material-independent formulation that improves the treatment both of discontinuities within a single material, for example in an ideal gas, and of interfaces between dissimilar materials. This approach also leads to improvements in capturing hydrodynamic behaviour unrelated to mixing, such as in shocks. We demonstrate marked improvements in three-dimensional test scenarios, focusing on more challenging cases with particles of equal mass across the simulation. This validates our methods for use-cases relevant across applications spanning astrophysics and engineering, where particles are free to evolve over a large range of density scales, or where emergent and evolving density discontinuities cannot easily be corrected by choosing bespoke particle masses in the initial conditions. We achieve these improvements while maintaining sharp discontinuities; without introducing additional equation of state dependence in, for example, particle volume elements; and without contrived or targeted corrections. Our methods build upon a fully compressible and thermodynamically consistent core-SPH construction, retaining Galilean invariance as well as conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. REMIX is integrated in the open-source, state-of-the-art \swift code and is designed with computational efficiency in mind, which means that its improved hydrodynamic treatment can be used for high-resolution simulations without significant cost to run-speed.</description>

      <title>A variational front-tracking method for multiphase flow with triple junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze a variational front-tracking method for a sharp-interface model of multiphase flow. The fluid interfaces between different phases are represented by curve networks in two space dimensions (2d) or surface clusters in three space dimensions (3d) with triple junctions where three interfaces meet, and boundary points/lines where an interface meets a fixed planar boundary. The model is described by the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in the bulk domains, with classical interface conditions on the fluid interfaces, and appropriate boundary conditions at the triple junctions and boundary points/lines. We propose a weak formulation for the model, which combines a parametric formulation for the evolving interfaces and an Eulerian formulation for the bulk equations. We employ an unfitted discretization of the coupled formulation to obtain a fully discrete finite element method, where the existence and uniqueness of solutions can be shown under weak assumptions. The constructed method admits an unconditional stability result in terms of the discrete energy. Furthermore, we adapt the introduced method so that an exact volume preservation for each phase can be achieved for the discrete solutions. Numerical examples for three-phase flow and four-phase flow are presented to show the robustness and accuracy of the introduced methods.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Formulation of Nuclear-Electronic Orbital Ehrenfest Dynamics with Real-time TDDFT for Extended Periodic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Lagrangian-based implementation of Ehrenfest dynamics with nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) theory and real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) for extended periodic systems. In addition to a quantum dynamical treatment of electrons and selected protons, this approach allows for the classical movement of all other nuclei to be taken into account in simulations of condensed matter systems. Furthermore, we introduce a Lagrangian formulation for the traveling proton basis approach and propose new schemes to enhance its application for extended periodic systems. Validation and proof-of-principle applications are performed on electronically excited proton transfer in the o-hydroxybenzaldehyde molecule with explicit solvating water molecules. These simulations demonstrate the importance of solvation dynamics and a quantum treatment of transferring protons. This work broadens the applicability of the NEO Ehrenfest dynamics approach for studying complex heterogeneous systems in the condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Hybrid summary statistics: neural weak lensing inference beyond the power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In inference problems, we often have domain knowledge which allows us to define summary statistics that capture most of the information content in a dataset. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach, where such physics-based summaries are augmented by a set of compressed neural summary statistics that are optimised to extract the extra information that is not captured by the predefined summaries. The resulting statistics are very powerful inputs to simulation-based or implicit inference of model parameters. We apply this generalisation of Information Maximising Neural Networks (IMNNs) to parameter constraints from tomographic weak gravitational lensing convergence maps to find summary statistics that are explicitly optimised to complement angular power spectrum estimates. We study several dark matter simulation resolutions in low- and high-noise regimes. We show that i) the information-update formalism extracts at least $3\times$ and up to $8\times$ as much information as the angular power spectrum in all noise regimes, ii) the network summaries are highly complementary to existing 2-point summaries, and iii) our formalism allows for networks with smaller, physically-informed architectures to match much larger regression networks with far fewer simulations needed to obtain asymptotically optimal inference.</description>

      <title>Wall Modeling of Turbulent Flows with Varying Pressure Gradients Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for developing wall models for large-eddy simulation that is able to capture pressure-gradient effects using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Within this framework, the distributed reinforcement learning agents receive off-wall environmental states including pressure gradient and turbulence strain rate, ensuring adaptability to a wide range of flows characterized by pressure-gradient effects and separations. Based on these states, the agents determine an action to adjust the wall eddy viscosity, and consequently the wall-shear stress. The model training is in situ with wall-modeled large-eddy simulation grid resolutions and does not rely on the instantaneous velocity fields from high-fidelity simulations. Throughout the training, the agents compute rewards from the relative error in the estimated wall-shear stress, which allows the agents to refine an optimal control policy that minimizes prediction errors. Employing this framework, wall models are trained for two distinct subgrid-scale models using low-Reynolds-number flow over periodic hills. These models are validated through simulations of flows over periodic hills at higher Reynolds numbers and flow over the Boeing Gaussian bump. The developed wall models successfully capture the acceleration and deceleration of wall-bounded turbulent flows under pressure gradients and outperform the equilibrium wall model in predicting skin friction.</description>

      <title>A unified moment tensor potential for silicon, oxygen, and silica</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Si and its oxides have been extensively explored in theoretical research due to their technological and industrial importance. Simultaneously describing interatomic interactions within both Si and SiO$_2$ without the use of \textit{ab initio} methods is considered challenging, given the charge transfers involved. Herein, this challenge is overcome by developing a unified machine learning interatomic potentials describing the Si/ SiO$_2$/ O system, based on the moment tensor potential (MTP) framework. This MTP is trained using a comprehensive database generated using density functional theory simulations, encompassing a wide range of crystal structures, point defects, extended defects, and disordered structure. Extensive testing of the MTP is performed, indicating it can describe static and dynamic features of very diverse Si, O, and SiO$_2$ atomic structures with a degree of fidelity approaching that of DFT</description>

      <title>Nanodosimetric investigation of the track structure of therapeutic carbon ion radiation. Part 1: Measurement of ionization cluster size distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center, the track structure of carbon ions of therapeutic energy after penetrating layers of simulated tissue was investigated for the first time. Measurements were conducted with primary carbon ion beams of different energies and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) absorbers of different thicknesses to realize different depths in the phantom along the pristine Bragg peak. Ionization cluster size (ICS) distributions resulting from the mixed radiation field behind the PMMA absorbers were measured using an ion-counting nanodosimeter. Two different measurements were carried out: (i) variation of the PMMA absorber thickness with constant primary carbon ion energy and (ii) combined variation of PMMA absorber thickness and primary carbon ion energy such that the primary carbon ion's energy in the target volume is constant. The data analysis revealed unexpectedly high mean ICS values compared to stopping power calculations and the data measured at lower energies in earlier work. This suggests that in the measurements the primary carbon ion energies behind the PMMA absorber may have deviated considerably from the expected values obtained by the calculations. In addition, the results indicate the presence of a marked contribution of nuclear fragments to the measured ICS distributions, especially if the carbon ion does not cross the target volume.</description>

      <title>A scalable method to model large suspensions of colloidal phoretic particles with arbitrary shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phoretic colloids self-propel thanks to surface flows generated in response to surface gradients (thermal, electrical, or chemical), that are self-induced and/or generated by other particles. Here we present a scalable and versatile framework to model chemical and hydrodynamic interactions in large suspensions of arbitrarily shaped phoretic particles, accounting for thermal fluctuations at all Damkholer numbers. Our approach, inspired by the Boundary Element Method (BEM), employs second-layer formulations, regularised kernels and a grid optimisation strategy to solve the coupled Laplace-Stokes equations with reasonable accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost associated with BEM. As demonstrated by our large-scale simulations, the capabilities of our method enable the exploration of new physical phenomena that, to our knowledge, have not been previously addressed by numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: A path integral method, combined with atomistic spin dynamics simulations, has been developed to calculate thermal quantum expectation values using a classical approach. In this study, we show how to treat Hamiltonians with non-linear terms, that are relevant for describing uniaxial anisotropies and mechanical constraints. These interactions can be expressed solely through quadratic terms of the spin operator along one axis, that can be identified with the quantisation axis.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Electron Dynamics Simulations through Machine Learned Time Propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under various external perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a novel approach to accelerate real time TDDFT based electron dynamics simulations using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules. This method has potential in enabling real-time, on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials with varying experimental parameters.</description>
