      <title>Controlled Zeno-Induced Localization of Free Fermions in a Quasiperiodic Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate measurement-induced localization in a continuously monitored one-dimensional Aubry--Andr\'e--Harper model, focusing on the quantum Zeno regime in which the measurements dominate coherent dynamics. The presence of a quasiperiodic potential renders the problem analytically tractable and enables a controlled study of the interplay between monitoring and disorder. We develop an analytical description based on an instantaneous Schr\"odinger equation with a measurement-induced effective potential constructed self-consistently from individual quantum trajectories, without relying on postselection. In the quantum Zeno regime, an emergent dominant energy scale reduces the problem to a transfer-matrix formulation of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which allows direct computation of the Lyapunov exponent. Complementarily, we extract the localization length numerically from long-time steady-state quantum state diffusion trajectories by reconstructing the intrinsic localized single-particle wave functions and analyzing their spatial decay. These numerical results show quantitative agreement with the effective theory predictions, with controlled corrections of order $J^2/[\lambda^2+(\gamma/2)^2]$ (where $J$ is the hopping amplitude, $\gamma$ the measurement strength, and $\lambda$ the quasiperiodic potential). Our results underscore the connection between the effective non-Hermitian description and the stochastic monitored dynamics, showing the interplay between Zeno-like localization, coherent hopping, and quasiperiodic-disorder-induced localization, while also laying the groundwork for understanding and exploiting measurement-induced localization as a tool for quantum control and state preparation.</description>

      <title>Topological Reorganization and Coordination-Controlled Crossover in Synchronization Onset on Regular Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to global synchronization in coupled dynamical systems is governed by the interplay between coupling strength and structural topology. Although abrupt, first-order-like synchronization transitions have been extensively reported in heterogeneous networks, it is unclear whether comparable accelerated onset behavior can emerge purely from coordination geometry in spatially homogeneous, regular lattices. In this study, we investigate large-scale ($N=10^5$) stochastic Stuart-Landau oscillator networks defined on regular lattices with controlled coordination number. Using topological data analysis (TDA), simplicial-complex characterization, and optimal-transport-based geometric diagnostics, we identify a coordination-controlled crossover in synchronization onset dynamics at approximately $z_{c} \approx 7$ within the class of regular lattices considered. Low-coordination lattices ($z &lt; z_{c}$) exhibit persistent $H_2$ topological features in the dynamical amplitude field that correlate with delayed coherence and surface-limited propagation. In contrast, higher-coordination lattices ($z &gt; z_{c}$) display rapid fragmentation of these features, reduced interface roughness, and predominantly positive Ricci curvature. This is consistent with enhanced path redundancy and improved transport efficiency. In this regime, the global order parameter exhibits accelerated exponential-like growth during the onset stage. Throughout this work, abrupt synchronization refers specifically to this exponential onset behavior rather than to thermodynamic first-order hysteresis. Our results demonstrate that increasing coordination density induces a qualitative reorganization of higher-order topological structure that strongly correlates with synchronization efficiency in regular lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Turing patterns in Matrix-Weighted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-driven instability is a fundamental mechanism underlying pattern formation in spatially extended systems. In almost all existing works, diffusion across the links of the underlying network is modeled through scalar weights, possibly complemented by cross-diffusion terms that are homogeneous across links. In this work, we investigate the emergence of Turing patterns on Matrix Weighted Networks (MWNs), a recently introduced framework in which each edge is associated with a matrix weight. Focusing on the class of coherent MWNs, we provide a novel characterization of coherence in terms of node-dependent orthonormal matrices, showing that link transformations can be written as relative rotations between nodes. This representation allows us to deal with coherent MWNs of any size and to introduce an orthonormal change of variables capable to reduce diffusion on a coherent MWN to diffusion on a standard weighted network with scalar weights. Building on this, we extend the classical Turing instability analysis to MWNs and derive the conditions under which a homogeneous equilibrium of the local dynamics loses stability due to matrix-weighted diffusion. Our results show how network topology, scalar weights, and inter-node transformations jointly shape pattern formation, and provide a constructive framework to analyze and design Turing patterns on matrix-weighted and higher-order networked systems.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Comes at a Cost: Optimal Localisation Against a Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How much work does it cost for a propelled particle to stay localised near a stationary target, defying both thermal noise and a constant flow that would carry it away? We study the control of such a particle in finite time and find optimal protocols for time-dependent swim velocity and diffusivity, without feedback. Accuracy, quantified via the mean squared deviation from the target, and energetic cost turn out to be related by a trade-off, which complements the one between precision and cost known in stochastic thermodynamics. We show that accuracy better than a certain threshold requires active driving, which comes at a cost that increases with accuracy. The optimal protocols have discontinuous swim velocity and diffusivity, switching between a passive drift state with vanishing diffusivity and an active propulsion state. This study highlights how a time-dependent diffusivity enhances optimal control and sets benchmarks for cost and accuracy of artificial self-propelled particles navigating noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Resource-Scalable Fully Quantum Metropolis-Hastings for Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integer linear programming (ILP) remains computationally challenging due to its NP-complete nature despite its central role in scheduling, logistics, and design optimization. We introduce a fully quantum Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for ILP that implements a coherent random walk over the discrete feasible region using only reversible quantum circuits, without quantum-RAM assumptions or classical pre/post-processing. Each walk step is a unitary update that prepares coherent candidate moves, evaluates the objective and constraints reversibly -- including a constraint-satisfaction counter to enforce feasibility -- and encodes Metropolis acceptance amplitudes via a low-overhead linearized rule. At the logical level, the construction uses $\mathcal{O}(n\log_2 N)$ qubits to represent $n$ integer variables over the interval $[-N,\,N-1]$, and the Toffoli-equivalent cost per Metropolis step grows linearly with the total logical qubit count. Using explicit ripple-carry adder constructions, we support linear objectives and mixed equality/inequality constraints. Numerical circuit-level simulations on a broad ensemble of randomly generated instances validate the predicted linear resource scaling and exhibit progressive thermalization toward low-cost feasible solutions under the annealing schedule. Overall, the method provides a coherent, resource-characterized baseline for fully quantum constraint programming and a foundation for incorporating additional quantum speedups in combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation via Neural Network-Driven Importance Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations provide valuable insights into the physical processes governing material behavior. However, their applicability is fundamentally constrained by the limited time scales accessible to brute-force simulations. This bottleneck often stems from complex energy landscapes where the systems stay trapped in metastable states for long periods of time. Yet, the long-term evolution is controlled by the transitions between the metastable states, which are rare events and difficult to observe. We present an importance sampling method designed to accelerate the time scale of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. By employing a bias potential, our approach enhances the sampling of rare transition events while preserving the relative probabilities of distinct transition pathways. The bias potential is represented by a neural network which enables the flexibility needed for high-dimensional systems. We propose a rigorous formulation to obtain the original transition rates between metastable states using transition paths obtained from the biased simulation. We further use a branching random walk (BRW) technique to enhance efficiency and to reduce variance. The proposed methodology is validated on 2-dimensional and 14-dimensional systems, demonstrating its accuracy and scalability.</description>

      <title>When Stein-Type Test Detects Equilibrium Distributions of Finite N-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the probability distribution of finite N-body systems, which maximises the Havrda--Charv\'at entropy, we build a Stein-type goodness-of-fit test. The Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution is exact only in the thermodynamic limit, where the system is composed of infinitely many particles as N approaches infinity. For an isolated system with a finite number of particles, the equilibrium velocity distribution is compact and markedly non-Gaussian, being restricted by the fixed total energy. Using Stein's method, we first obtain a differential operator that characterises the target density. Its eigenfunctions are symmetric Jacobi polynomials, whose orthogonality yields a simple, parameter-free statistic. Under the null hypothesis that the data follows the finite-N distribution, the statistic converges to a chi-squared law, so critical values are available in closed form. Large-scale Monte Carlo experiments confirm exact size control and give a clear picture of the power. These findings quantify how quickly a finite system approaches the classical limit and provide a practical tool for testing kinetic models in regimes where normality cannot be assumed.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz critical points meet Zamolodchikov perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical points of classical and quantum lattice models are often described by scale-invariant Lifshitz theories which are anisotropic in the continuum limit, as characterized by a dynamical critical exponent $z\neq1$. This type of critical behavior can in principle be studied by deforming ordinary $z=1$ conformal field theories (CFTs) by relevant vector operators breaking the rotational/Lorentz symmetry. In this short note, we consider a two-dimensional system of coupled minimal model CFTs $\mathcal{M}_{m,m+1}$ which realizes this perspective in a controlled fashion via Zamolodchikov's large $m$ expansion. The model turns out to exhibit interesting properties, including a manifold of interacting Lifshitz fixed points and emergent rotational symmetry in the infrared.</description>

Abstract: In this work, a convergent low-temperature cluster expansion of the one-dimensional long-range ferromagnetic Ising model with polynomial decay $\alpha\in (1,2]$ is developed; that is, $J(r)=r^{-\alpha}$. As an application, the $n$-point correlations are studied and the two-point correlation is shown to be algebraic with rate of decay exactly $\alpha$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning Gibbs distributions using only sufficient statistics has long been recognized as a computationally hard problem. On the other hand, computationally efficient algorithms for learning Gibbs distributions rely on access to full sample configurations generated from the model. For many systems of interest that arise in physical contexts, expecting a full sample to be observed is not practical, and hence it is important to look for computationally efficient methods that solve the learning problem with access to only a limited set of statistics. We examine the trade-offs between the power of computation and observation within this scenario, employing the Ising model as a paradigmatic example. We demonstrate that it is feasible to reconstruct the model parameters for a model with $\ell_1$ width $\gamma$ by observing statistics up to an order of $O(\gamma)$. This approach allows us to infer the model's structure and also learn its couplings and magnetic fields. We also discuss a setting where prior information about structure of the model is available and show that the learning problem can be solved efficiently with even more limited observational power.</description>

      <title>Topology and edge modes surviving criticality in non-Hermitian Floquet systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of critical points that can host quantized nonlocal order parameters and degenerate edge modes relocate the study of symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs) to gapless regions. In this letter, we reveal gapless SPTs (gSPTs) in systems tuned out-of-equilibrium by periodic drivings and non-Hermitian couplings. Focusing on one-dimensional models with sublattice symmetry, we introduce winding numbers by applying the Cauchy's argument principle to generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ), yielding unified topological characterizations and bulk-edge correspondence in both gapped phases and at gapless critical points. The theory is demonstrated in a broad class of Floquet bipartite lattices, unveiling unique topological criticality of non-Hermitian Floquet origin. Our findings identify gSPTs in driven open systems and uncover robust topological edge modes at phase transitions beyond equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Investigating Disordered Granular Matter via Ordered Geometric Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of occupied volume under progressive fragmentation of granular matter is studied using a purely geometric model. Rather than modeling disorder directly, properties of disordered granular assemblies are investigated by analyzing an associated family of highly ordered reference configurations that provide sharp upper bounds on accessible volume. Grains are idealized as fragments derived from a hypothetical elongated parent prism with square cross section, sequentially sliced and reassembled into configurations that maximize the enclosed volume.
  Analytic expressions are derived for the maximal attainable volume at each fragmentation stage. The volume evolution is non-monotonic: initial fragmentation produces structures whose volume exceeds that of the original object, while further fragmentation leads to monotonic decrease converging to a limiting value of 5/4 times the initial volume, independent of the total number of fragments.
  The model reveals pairs of reassembled configurations built from geometrically indistinguishable building blocks yet enclosing different volumes. These conjugate configurations constitute purely geometric analogues of distinct phases connected by rearrangement-induced transitions. Explicit relations link the idealized construction to experimentally measurable grain parameters. Comparison with experimental data on cylindrical rods shows the predicted upper bound falls within the observed packing density range, demonstrating that the model captures essential geometric features despite its simplicity.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Electroviscous Lift Force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: About forty years ago, it has been predicted that a charged particle, moving parallel to a charged wall in an electrolyte, should experience a lift force that, contrarily to electrostatic forces, is not screened at large distances. Up to now, such electroviscous lift force has not been directly measured. Here, we use Atomic Force Microscopy to directly measure the electroviscous lift force and quantify its dependency with the distance to the wall, the translation velocity or the particle's size. Observing that existing theories exhibit large discrepancies with our experimental observations, we develop an analytical approach combining lubrication theory to a previously introduced formalism for small screening length. The experimentally observed lift forces are in good agreement with our theoretical predictions and reveal, for the first time, a saturation of the lift force for increasing velocities. Altogether, our results characterize, through direct measurements and analytical approach, the properties of electroviscous forces between charged particles in viscous electrolytes in non-equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing energy gap in quantum spin liquids via polarization amplitude</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying whether a many-body ground state is gapped or gapless is a fundamental yet challenging problem, especially in quantum spin liquids. In this work, we develop a gap-diagnostic scheme based on the polarization amplitude defined via a twist operator, evaluated within the infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) framework. As a benchmark, analysis of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain demonstrates that the polarization amplitude clearly distinguishes the gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid from the gapped N\'eel phase. We then extend this framework to infinite cylinders of the spin-$1/2$ XY-$J_\chi$ model on the square lattice. We find that the polarization amplitude sharply detects the transition between the gapless XY phase and the gapped chiral spin liquid phase. These results show that polarization amplitudes provide a strong energy-gap diagnostic in two-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets, including quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The earlier theory [1] of the quantum phase transitions related to the change of the Fermi Surface Topology (FST) is advanced. For such transitions the Fermi surface as a quantum critical manifold determined by the Lee-Yang zeros, the order parameter $\mathcal{P}$ as the $d$-volume of the Fermi sea, and the special FST universality class were introduced in [1]. The exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) $d$-dimensional ($d=1,2,3$) model of interacting fermions is analyzed. We explore the relation between the Lee-Yang zeros, the Luttinger and the plateau (Oshikawa) theorems. The validity of the Luttinger theorem in the HK model is confirmed. It is shown that the order parameter $\mathcal{P}$ and the FST universality class describe the transitions between metal and band/Mott insulators, as well as the Lifshitz and van Hove gapless-to-gapless transitions. The gapless phases are established to be the Landau Fermi liquids (metals). In addition to the conventional paradigm with a continuous order parameter, we apply the homology theory to analyze the FST transitions. They are critical points of the Morse function. To quantify FST we use the Euler characteristic, which is calculated for each phase of the HK model. We claim that the FST universality class is robust with respect to interactions and other model details, under the condition that the critical points are non-degenerate.</description>

      <title>Theory of Steady States for Lindblad Equations beyond Time-Independence: Classification, Uniqueness and Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous and comprehensive classification of the asymptotic behavior of time-quasiperiodic Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equations under the assumption of Hermitian jump operators. Our main contributions are twofold: first, we establish a criterion for the uniqueness of steady states. The criterion is formulated in terms of the algebra generated by the GKSL generators and provides a necessary and sufficient condition when the generators are analytic functions of time. We demonstrate the utility of our criterion through prototypical examples, including quantum many-body spin chains. Second, we extend the concept of strong symmetry for time-dependent GKSL equations by introducing two distinct forms, strong symmetry in the Schr\"odinger picture and that in the interaction picture, and completely classify the asymptotic dynamics with them. More concretely, we rigorously uncover that the strong symmetry in the interaction picture is responsible for non-trivial time-dependent steady states, such as coherent oscillations, whereas that in the Schr\"odinger picture controls the existence of time-independent steady states. This classification not only encompasses established mechanisms underlying non-trivial oscillatory steady states, such as strong dynamical symmetry and Floquet dynamical symmetry, but also reveals symmetry-predicted, time-dependent asymptotic dynamics in a novel class of open quantum systems. Our framework thus provides a rigorous foundation for controlling dissipative quantum systems in a time-dependent manner.</description>

      <title>Deconfinement from Thermal Tensor Networks: Universal CFT signature in (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks offer a sign-problem-free approach to study lattice gauge theories, but extracting precise universal information associated with the deconfinement transition remains challenging. In this work, we study the deconfinement transition of (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories at finite temperature using a thermal tensor network approach, where the partition functions at finite temperature are formulated as three-dimensional tensor networks. These tensor networks are first contracted in the temporal direction, and the subsequent coarse-graining in the spatial directions yields a renormalized transfer matrix, the spectrum of which directly encodes the universal conformal field theory data. In particular, by numerically extracting the central charge and scaling dimensions, we verify that the universality class of the thermal deconfinement transition matches the prediction of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for $N=2,3,5$. Moreover, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_5$ theory at finite temperature exhibits an intermediate phase with an emergent U(1) symmetry. Critical couplings are determined via Gu-Wen ratios and agree with existing Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, extrapolating these critical couplings at finite temperature enables us to determine the deconfinement transition points for $N=2,3$ at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>An Always-Accepting Algorithm for Transition Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a one-way shooting algorithm for transition path sampling that accepts every proposed trajectory yet samples the correct transition path ensemble for systems with overdamped stochastic dynamics. The method is based on two key elements: a procedure to propose trajectories that are always reactive, and a reweighting scheme that corrects for the bias introduced by always accepting the proposed paths. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of transition path sampling by eliminating the cost associated with generating trajectories that are then rejected. We demonstrate the algorithm by investigating the formation of CO$_2$ clathrate hydrates along different reaction mechanisms, showing that the increased efficiency allows proper sampling of the formation of crystalline hydrates at temperatures and pressures that are difficult to access with conventional algorithms.</description>

      <title>Semantic Chunking and the Entropy of Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entropy rate of printed English is famously estimated to be about one bit per character, a benchmark that modern large language models (LLMs) have only recently approached. This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocity as a Generic Mechanism for Demixing in Flocking Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that even weak nonreciprocal alignment leads to large-scale structure formation in flocking mixtures. By combining numerical simulations of a binary Vicsek model and the analysis of coarse-grained continuum equations, we demonstrate that nonreciprocity destabilizes the ordered phase formed by mutually aligning or anti-aligning species in a large part of the phase diagram. For aligning populations, this instability results in one species condensing in a single band that travels within a homogeneous liquid of the other species. When interactions are anti-aligning, both species self-assemble into polar clusters with large-scale chaotic dynamics. In both cases, the emergence of structures is accompanied by the demixing of the two species, despite the absence of repulsive interactions. Our theoretical analysis allows us to elucidate the origin of the instability, and show that it is generic to nonreciprocal flocks.</description>

      <title>Dual thermal pseudocritical features in a spin-1/2 Ising chain with twin-diamond geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the coupled twin-diamond chain, a decorated one-dimensional Ising model motivated by the magnetic structure of $\mathrm{Cu}_{2}(\mathrm{TeO}_{3})_{2}\mathrm{Br}_{2}$. By applying an exact mapping to an effective Ising chain, we obtain the full thermodynamic description of the system through a compact transfer-matrix formulation. The ground-state analysis reveals five distinct phases, including two frustrated sectors with extensive degeneracy. These frustrated regions give rise to characteristic entropy plateaus and separate the ordered phases in the zero-temperature diagram. At low temperatures the model exhibits peculiar sharp yet continuous variations of entropy, magnetization, and response functions, reflecting clear signatures of pseudotransition behavior. The coupled twin-diamond chain thus provides an exactly solvable setting in which competing local configurations and internal frustration lead to pronounced dual pseudocritical features in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Emergent Quantum Walk Dynamics from Classical Interacting Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) can be realized within a purely classical interacting particle system composed of some boxes and a large but finite number of balls, and can, in principle, be implemented in a tabletop experimental setting. The distribution of the balls evolves under stochastic, occupation-dependent update rules at each lattice site, producing quantum-walk dynamics without invoking a wavefunction. The update parameters are fixed by the parameters of coin and shift operations of the DTQW. This framework naturally yields a generalized active spin model and provides a minimal lattice-based microscopic understanding of the emergence of quantum-like dynamics in active matter systems. This interdisciplinary approach connects the classical models to the broad range of applications where DTQWs are successfully employed.</description>

Abstract: We study the universal properties of the Lanczos algorithm applied to finite-size many-body quantum systems. Focusing on autocorrelation functions of local operators and on their infinite-time behaviour at finite size, we conjecture that in the large $n$ limit, the ratios between consecutive Lanczos coefficients should have specific scalings with the size of the lattice that we make precise and that depend on the hydrodynamic tail of the autocorrelation function. The scaling associated with strong or approximate zero-modes is also discussed. We support our conjecture with a numerical study of different models.</description>

      <title>Structure of solutions to continuous constraint satisfaction problems through the statistics of wedged and inscribed spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of random landscapes has long relied on counting stationary points: metastable states and the barriers between them. However, this method is useless for describing flat regions, common in constraint satisfaction problems. We introduce a characterization of flat regions by counting the number of spheres that can be uniquely inserted into them, either by wedging spheres of fixed radius or by inscribing spheres of variable radius. The ratio of these counts constrains the topology of the solution space. We apply this characterization to the spherical perceptron and show the existence of at least two topological regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter denotes a system of particles immersed in an external environment, from which the particles extract energy continuously in order to perform directed motion. Extending the paradigm of active matter to a quantum framework requires an appropriate description of the environment. In this work, we consider a driven quantum particle undergoing noise and dissipation, with external driving exhibiting characteristics of classical activity. We model the non-unitary dynamics with time-local master equations and analyze the particle motion at different time scales for different forms of the master equations, satisfying different criteria. We systematically compare predictions on the dynamics of particle trajectories and thereby we uncover how the particle motion evolves under the interplay of quantum effects, dissipation, and active-like dynamics. These results are essential for guiding possible experiments aimed at realizing quantum analogues of classical active systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Isomorphism of Transformers: A Lagrangian Approach to Attention Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an effective field-theoretic framework for analyzing Transformer attention through a thermodynamic lens. By constructing a Lagrangian on the information manifold equipped with the Fisher metric, we show that, within the Shannon--Boltzmann entropy framework, the Softmax function arises as a stationary solution minimizing a Helmholtz free energy functional. This establishes a formal correspondence between scaled dot-product attention and canonical ensemble statistics. Extending this mapping to macroscopic observables, we define an effective specific heat associated with fluctuations of the attention energy landscape. In controlled experiments on the modular addition task ($p = 19$--$113$), we observe a robust peak in this fluctuation measure that consistently precedes the onset of generalization. While no asymptotic power-law divergence is detected in this finite-depth regime, the reproducible enhancement of energy variance suggests a critical-like crossover accompanying representational reorganization. Our framework provides a unified statistical-mechanical perspective on attention scaling, training dynamics, and positional encoding, interpreting the phenomena as emergent properties of an effective thermodynamic system rather than isolated heuristics. Although the present results indicate finite-size crossover behavior rather than a strict phase transition, they motivate further investigation into scaling limits of deep architectures through fluctuation-based observables.</description>

      <title>Disturbing news about the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion II. Assessing the recombination scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [De Cesare, Rychkov (2025)], we revisited the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion in the $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM), emphasizing the existence of a protected operator which is a closed form with $N-1$ indices. The scaling dimension of this operator stays exactly equal to $N-1$, independently of $\epsilon$. Its existence is problematic for the identification of the NLSM fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ with the Wilson-Fisher fixed point family obtained by analytically continuing from near $d=4$, which does not possess such a protected operator. Multiplet recombination is one scenario discussed in [De Cesare, Rychkov (2025)], which could allow to connect the two families continuously (although not analytically). In this scenario, the protected dimension is lifted at some critical value of $\epsilon$, thanks to the short conformal multiplet of scaling dimension $N-1$ eating a long conformal multiplet of higher scaling dimension. In this followup work, we assess this scenario for the cases $N=3$ and $N=4$. We identify the lowest candidates for the long multiplet which could be eaten, and compute their one-loop anomalous dimensions. We find that at one loop, scaling dimensions of these candidates grow with $\epsilon$, while it should decrease down to $N$ for the recombination to occur. We conclude that multiplet recombination is unlikely.</description>
