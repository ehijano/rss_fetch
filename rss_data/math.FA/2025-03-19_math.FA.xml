      <title>Gelfand-Shilov spaces for extended Gevrey regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider spaces of smooth functions obtained by relaxing Gevrey-type regularity and decay conditions. It is shown that these classes fit well within the general framework of the weighted matrices approach to ultradifferentiable functions. We examine equivalent ways of introducing Gelfand-Shilov spaces related to the extended Gevrey regularity and derive their nuclearity. In addition to the Fourier transform invariance property, we present their corresponding symmetric characterizations. Finally, we consider some time-frequency representations of the introduced classes of ultradifferentiable functions.</description>

      <title>A new functional model for contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a new functional model for completely non-unitary contractions on a Hilbert space. This model is based on the observation that the theory of contractions shares a common geometric basis with the extension theory of symmetric operators recently developed by the author in \cite{wang2024complex}. Compared with the now classical Sz.-Nagy-Foias model and the de Branges-Rovnyak model, ours is intrinsic in the sense that we need not construct a bigger space $H$ including the model space $\mathfrak{H}$ and realize the model operator on $\mathfrak{H}$ as the compression of a minimal unitary dilation on $H$. Our model space $\mathfrak{H}$ is constructed in a canonical and conceptually more direct manner and doesn't depend on the Sz. Nagy-Foias characteristic function explicitly. We also show how a contraction can be constructed from a marked Nevanlinna disc, which is the geometric analogue of the characteristic function.</description>

      <title>Commutants of a certain class of Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major open problem in the Theory of Toeplitz operators on the analytic Bergman space over the unit disk is the characterization of the commutant of a given Toeplitz operator--that is, the set of all bounded Toeplitz operators that commute with it. In this paper, we provide a complete description of bounded Toeplitz operators $T_f$, where the symbol $f$ has a truncated polar decomposition, that commute with a Toeplitz operator whose symbol is the sum of a quasihomogeneous function and a bounded analytic function.</description>

      <title>About an isomorphism between the Beurling algebra with a weight dependent convolution and the $L^1(G)$ group algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Beurling algebra with a weight-dependent convolution and the group algebra $L^1(G)$ are isomorphic. In particular, using this isomorphism, we extend some results of the algebra $\mathscr{L}^1(G,\omega)$ presented in recent articles. As a main result, we explicitly construct the equivalence between unitary representations of the group and non-degenerate $\ast$-representations of this algebra.</description>

      <title>Absolute continuity of polynomially bounded tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absolute continuity of polynomially bounded n-tuples of commuting contractions in a Hilbert space is studied. A necessary and sufficient condition is found in Constantin Apostol's ``weakened $C_{0,\cdot}$ assumption'', asserting the convergence to 0 of the powers of each operator in a specific topology. Kosiek with Octavio considered tuples satisfying the von-Neumann Inequality. We extend their results to a wider class of tuples, where there may be no unitary dilation and the bounding constant may be greater than 1. Our proof uses decompositions of A-measures with respect to bands of measures related to Gleason parts of the polydisc algebra.</description>

      <title>Matrix-weighted bounds in variable Lebesgue spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove boundedness of Calder\'on-Zygmund operators and the Christ-Goldberg maximal operator in the matrix-weighted variable Lebesgue spaces recently introduced by Cruz-Uribe and the second author. Our main tool to prove these bounds is through bounding a Goldberg auxiliary maximal operator.
  As an application, we obtain a quantitative extrapolation theorem for matrix-weighted variable Lebesgue spaces from the recent framework of directional Banach function spaces of the first author.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate which subsets of the real plane are realisable as the set of points on which a one-layer ReLU neural network takes a positive value. In the case of cones we give a full characterisation of such sets. Furthermore, we give a necessary condition for any subset of $\mathbb R^d$. We give various examples of such one-layer neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantitative unique continuation properties for discrete magnetic Schr{\"o}dinger operators in certain periodic graphs. This unique continuation property will be quantified through what is known in the literature as a Three Balls Inequality. We are able to extend this inequality to another family of periodic graph which contains the Hexagonal lattice. We also give a sketch of the proof for general star periodic graph.Our proofs are based on Carleman estimates.</description>

      <title>A note on Laplacian bounds, deformation properties and isoperimetric sets in metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the setting of length PI spaces satisfying a suitable deformation property, it is known that each isoperimetric set has an open representative. In this paper, we construct an example of a length PI space (without the deformation property) where an isoperimetric set does not have any representative whose topological interior is non-empty. Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition for the validity of the deformation property, consisting in an upper Laplacian bound for the squared distance functions from a point. Our result applies to essentially non-branching ${\sf MCP}(K,N)$ spaces, thus in particular to essentially non-branching ${\sf CD}(K,N)$ spaces and to many Carnot groups and sub-Riemannian manifolds. As a consequence, every isoperimetric set in an essentially non-branching ${\sf MCP}(K,N)$ space has an open representative, which is also bounded whenever a uniform lower bound on the volumes of unit balls is assumed.</description>

      <title>Coercivity and Gamma-convergence of the $p$-energy of sphere-valued Sobolev maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider sequences of maps from an $(n+m)$-dimensional domain into the $(n-1)$-sphere, which satisfy a natural $p$-energy growth, as $p$ approaches $n$ from below. We prove that, up to subsequences, the Jacobians of such maps converge in the flat topology to an integral $m$-current, and that the $p$-energy Gamma-converges to the mass of the limit current.
  As a corollary, we deduce that the Jacobians of $p$-energy minimizing maps converge to an integral $m$-current that is area-minimizing in a suitable cobordism class, depending on the boundary datum. Moreover, we obtain new estimates for the minimal $p$-energy of maps with prescribed singularities.</description>

      <title>Functional calculus on weighted Sobolev spaces for the Laplacian on the half-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Laplace operator on the half-space with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. We prove that this operator admits a bounded $H^\infty$-calculus on Sobolev spaces with power weights measuring the distance to the boundary. These weights do not necessarily belong to the class of Muckenhoupt $A_p$ weights. We additionally study the corresponding Dirichlet and Neumann heat semigroup. It is shown that these semigroups, in contrast to the $L^p$-case, have polynomial growth. Moreover, maximal regularity results for the heat equation are derived on inhomogeneous and homogeneous weighted Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard subspaces are a well-studied object in algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT). Given a standard subspace ${\tt V}$ of a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, one is interested in unitary one-parameter groups on $\mathcal{H}$ with $U_t {\tt V} \subseteq {\tt V}$ for every $t \in \mathbb{R}_+$. If $({\tt V},U)$ is a non-degenerate standard pair on $\mathcal{H}$, i.e. the self-adjoint infinitesimal generator of $U$ is a positive operator with trivial kernel, two classical results are given by Borchers' Theorem, relating non-degenerate standard pairs to positive energy representations of the affine group $\mathrm{Aff}(\mathbb{R})$ and the Longo-Witten Theorem, stating the the semigroup of unitary endomorphisms of ${\tt V}$ can be identified with the semigroup of symmetric operator-valued inner functions on the upper half-plane.
  In this thesis, we prove results similar to the theorems of Borchers and of Longo-Witten for a more general framework of unitary one-parameter groups without the assumption that their infinitesimal generator is positive. We replace this assumption by the weaker assumption that the triple $(\mathcal{H},{\tt V},U)$ is a so-called real regular one-parameter group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a general theoretical tool for the establishment of the boundedness of notoriously difficult operators (such as potentials) on certain specific types of rearrangement-invariant function spaces from analogous properties of operators that are easier to handle (such as fractional maximal operators). A principal example of the new results one obtains by our analysis is the following inequality, which generalizes a result of Korobkov and Kristensen (who had treated the case $\mu=\mathcal{L}^n$, the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$): There exists a constant $C&gt;0$ such that \[ \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |I_\alpha^\mu f|^p \;d\nu \leq C \|f\|_{L^{p,1}(\mathbb{R}^n,\mu)}^p \] for all $f$ in the Lorentz space $L^{p,1}(\mathbb{R}^n,\mu)$, where $\mu, \nu$ are Radon measures such that \[ \sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n, r&gt;0} \frac{\mu(B(x,r))}{r^{d}} &lt; \infty \quad \text{and} \quad \sup_{\mu(Q)&gt;0} \frac{\nu(Q)}{\quad\mu(Q)^{1-\frac{\alpha p}{d}}} &lt; \infty, \] and $I_\alpha^\mu$ is the Riesz potential defined with respect to $\mu$ of order $\alpha \in (0,d)$. More broadly, we obtain inequalities in this spirit in the context of rearrangement-invariant spaces through a result of independent interest, an extension of an interpolation theorem of Calder\'on where the target space in one endpoint is a space of bounded functions.</description>

      <title>Constrained differential operators, Sobolev inequalities, and Riesz potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inequalities for Riesz potentials are well-known to be equivalent to Sobolev inequalities of the same order for domain norms "far" from $L^1$, but to be weaker otherwise. Recent contributions by Van Schaftingen, by Hernandez, Rai\c{t}\u{a} and Spector, and by Stolyarov proved that this gap can be filled in Riesz potential inequalities for vector-valued functions in $L^1$ fulfilling a co-canceling differential condition. This work demonstrates that such a property is not just peculiar to the space $L^1$. Indeed, under the same differential constraint, a Riesz potential inequality is shown to hold for any domain and target rearrangement-invariant norms that render a Sobolev inequality of the same order true. This is based on a new interpolation inequality, which, via a kind of duality argument, yields a parallel property of Sobolev inequalities for any linear homogeneous elliptic canceling differential operator. Specifically, Sobolev inequalities involving the full gradient of a certain order share the same rearrangement-invariant domain and target spaces as their analogs for any other homogeneous elliptic canceling differential operator of equal order. As a consequence, Riesz potential inequalities under the co-canceling constraint and Sobolev inequalities for homogeneous elliptic canceling differential operators are offered for general families of rearrangement-invariant spaces, such as the Orlicz spaces and the Lorentz-Zygmund spaces. Especially relevant instances of inequalities for domain spaces neighboring $L^1$ are singled out.</description>

      <title>The quantum metric structure of quantum SU(2)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.06043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two parameter family of Dirac operators on quantum SU(2) and analyse their properties from the point of view of non-commutative metric geometry. It is shown that these Dirac operators give rise to compact quantum metric structures, and that the corresponding two parameter family of compact quantum metric spaces varies continuously in Rieffel's quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance. This continuity result includes the classical case where we recover the round 3-sphere up to a global scaling factor on the metric. Our main technical tool is a quantum SU(2) analogue of the Berezin transform, together with its associated fuzzy approximations, the analysis of which also leads to a systematic way of approximating Lipschitz operators by means of polynomial expressions in the generators.</description>

      <title>How to construct decay rates for kinetic Fokker--Planck equations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14506v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study time averages for the norm of solutions to kinetic Fokker--Planck equations associated with general Hamiltonians. We provide fully explicit and constructive decay estimates for systems subject to a confining potential, allowing fat-tail, sub-exponential and (super-)exponential local equilibria, which also include the classic Maxwellian case. The key step in our estimates is a modified Poincar\'e inequality, obtained via a Lions--Poincar\'e inequality and an averaging lemma.</description>

      <title>Classical solutions to the thin-film equation with general mobility in the perfect-wetting regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove well-posedness, partial regularity, and stability of the thin-film equation $h_t + (m(h) h_{zzz})_z = 0$ with general mobility $m(h) = h^n$ and mobility exponent $n\in (1,\tfrac{3}{2})\cup (\tfrac{3}{2},3)$ in the regime of perfect wetting (zero contact angle). After a suitable coordinate transformation to fix the free boundary (the contact line where liquid, air, and solid coalesce), the thin-film equation is rewritten as an abstract Cauchy problem and we obtain maximal $L^{p}_t$-regularity for the linearized evolution. Partial regularity close to the free boundary is obtained by studying the elliptic regularity of the spatial part of the linearization. This yields solutions that are non-smooth in the distance to the free boundary, in line with previous findings for source-type self-similar solutions. In a scaling-wise quasi-minimal norm for the initial data, we obtain a well-posedness and asymptotic stability result for perturbations of traveling waves. The novelty of this work lies in the usage of $L^{p}$-estimates in time, where $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$, while the existing literature mostly deals with $p = 2$ at least for nonlinear mobilities. This turns out to be essential to obtain for the first time a well-posedness result in the perfect-wetting regime for all physical nonlinear slip conditions except for a strongly degenerate case at $n = \tfrac 3 2$ and the well-understood Greenspan-slip case $n = 1$. Furthermore, compared to [J. Differential Equations, 257(1):15-81, 2014] by Giacomelli, the first author of this paper, Kn\"upfer, and Otto, where a PDE approach yields $L^2_t$-estimates, well-posedness, and stability for $1.8384 \approx \tfrac{3}{17}(15-\sqrt{21}) &lt; n &lt; \tfrac{3}{11}(7+\sqrt{5}) \approx 2.5189$, our functional-analytic approach is significantly shorter while at the same time giving a more general result.</description>

      <title>Invariant subalgebras of the reduced group $C^*$-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countable discrete group. We say that $\Gamma$ has $C^*$-invariant subalgebra rigidity (ISR) property if every $\Gamma$-invariant $C^*$-subalgebra $\mathcal{A}\le C_r^*(\Gamma)$ is of the form $C_r^*(N)$ for some normal subgroup $N\triangleleft\Gamma$. We show that all torsion-free, non-amenable (cylindrically) hyperbolic groups with property-AP and a finite direct product of such groups have this property. We also prove that an infinite group $\Gamma$ has the C$^*$-ISR property only if $\Gamma$ is simple amenable or $C^*$-simple.</description>

      <title>Analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle and topological Riemann-Roch theorem for circle fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain the new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $\pi :M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, \pi_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</description>

      <title>Scale-Dependent Suppression Functions and Functional Space Geometry in Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effects of a scale-dependent suppression function $\Omega(k, \Lambda)$ on the functional space geometry in renormalization theory. By introducing a dynamical cutoff scale $\Lambda$, the suppression function smoothly regulates high-momentum contributions without requiring a hard cutoff. We show that $\Omega(k, \Lambda)$ induces a modified metric on functional space, leading to a non-trivial Ricci curvature that becomes increasingly negative in the ultraviolet (UV) limit. This effect dynamically suppresses high-energy states, yielding a controlled deformation of the functional domain. Furthermore, we derive the renormalization group (RG) flow of $\Omega(k, \Lambda)$ and demonstrate its role in controlling the curvature flow of the functional space. The suppression function leads to spectral modifications that suggest an effective dimensional reduction at high energies, a feature relevant to functional space deformations and integral convergence in renormalization theory. Our findings provide a mathematical framework for studying regularization techniques and their role in the UV behavior of function spaces.</description>
