      <title>The Energy Spectrum of the Pion from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report, computational techniques are employed to extract the energy eigenvalues of the pion from two-point correlation function data that has been simulated using the lattice formulation of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) across various momentum values for the particle. The analysis focuses on systematically obtaining these eigenvalues to understand better the behavior of the pion under different kinematic conditions. Once extracted, these energy eigenvalues obtained through plateau fitting of the Energy vs Time graph, are utilized to plot the dispersion relation of the pion. This resulting dispersion relation is then compared with theoretical predictions to assess the accuracy and validity of the computational approach. The comparison provides insights into how well the lattice QCD simulations align with established theoretical expectations, and what range of kinematic variables are reliable.</description>

      <title>A lattice study of two dimensional SU(2) gauge theories with a single massless Majorana fermion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massless overlap fermions in the real representation of two dimensional $SU(N_c)$ gauge theories exhibit a mod($2$) index due to the rigidity of its spectrum when viewed as a function of the background gauge field - lattice gauge fields on a periodic torus come under two classes; ones that have one set of chirally paired zero modes and ones that do not. Focusing on $SU(2)$ and a single Majorana fermion in an integer representation, $J$; we present numerical evidence that shows only one of these classes survives the continuum limit and this depends on the boundary conditions of the fermion and the gauge field. As such, two of the four possible partition functions are zero in the continuum limit. By defining modified partition functions which do not include the zero modes of the overlap fermions in the fermion determinant, we are able to define an expectation value for a fermion bilinear as ratios of two mixed partition functions. This observable is referred to as the topological condensate and has a non-zero expectation value on any finite physical torus and also has a non-zero limit as the size of the torus is taken to infinity. We study the spectral density of fermions and the scaling of the lowest eigenvalue with the size of the torus to show the absence of any spontaneous symmetry breaking but the emergence of zero modes in the infinite volume limit where it is prohibited in finite volume. These results remain the same for $J = 1, 2, 3, 4$. These results motivate us to propose an independent plaquette model which reproduces the correct physics in the infinite volume limit using a single partition function.</description>

      <title>Role of Plaquette Term in Genuine $2+1$D String Dynamics on Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of quantum simulators of $2+1$D lattice gauge theories (LGTs), a fundamental open question is under what circumstances the observed physics is genuinely $2+1$D rather than effectively $1+1$D. Here, we address this question in the ongoing strong effort to quantum-simulate string dynamics in $2+1$D LGTs on state-of-the-art quantum hardware. Through tensor network simulations and analytic derivations, we show that the plaquette term, which represents a magnetic field and only emerges in $d&gt;1$ spatial dimensions, plays a crucial role in \textit{genuine} $2+1$D string dynamics deep in the confined regime. In its absence and for minimal-length (Manhattan-distance) strings, we demonstrate how string breaking, although on a lattice in $d=2$ spatial dimensions, can be effectively mapped to a $1+1$D dynamical process independently of lattice geometry. Our findings not only answer the question of what qualifies as genuine $2+1$D string dynamics, but also serve as a clear guide for future quantum simulation experiments of $2+1$D LGTs.</description>

      <title>Drell--Yan lepton pair production at low invariant masses: transverse-momentum resummation and non-perturbative effects in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the transverse-momentum ($q_T$) distribution of Drell-Yan lepton pairs produced with invariant masses ($M$) from low values up to the $Z$-boson peak ($4\leq M \leq 116$~GeV). We present perturbative predictions obtained by consistently combining the resummation of logarithmically enhanced QCD corrections at small $q_T$ ($q_T \ll M$) up to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy with the available fixed-order calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order (i.e. $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_S^3)$) valid at large $q_T$. For very low $q_T$ ($q_T\sim \Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$), non-perturbative (NP) QCD effects become dominant and have been included through a NP form factor with a small number of free-parameters. We compare our results with multiple experimental datasets from hadron colliders, finding excellent agreement between theory and data. By fitting the NP parameters, we achieve a precise extraction of the NP form factor and the so-called Collins-Soper kernel.</description>

      <title>Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Pion amplitudes and low energy parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10772v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the Gauge Theory Bootstrap method proposed in our previous work [arXiv:2309.12402], we compute pion scattering phase shifts for all partial waves with angular momentum $\ell\le 3$ up to 2 GeV and calculate the low energy $\chi$PT coefficients $\bar{\ell}_{1,2,4,6}$. The method looks for the most general S-matrix that matches at low energy the tree level amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model and at high energy, QCD sum rules and form factors. This is a theoretical/numerical calculation that uses as only data the pion mass $m_\pi$, pion decay constant $f_\pi$ and the QCD parameters $N_c=3$, $N_f=2$, $m_q$ and $\alpha_s$. All results are in reasonable agreement with experiment. In particular, we find the $\rho(770)$, $f_2(1270)$ and $\rho(1450)$ resonances. The interplay between the UV gauge theory and low energy pion physics is an example of a general situation where we know the microscopic theory as well as the effective theory of long wavelength fluctuations but we want to solve the strongly coupled dynamics at intermediate energies. The bootstrap builds a bridge between the low and high energy by determining the consistent S-matrix that matches both and provides, in this case, a new direction to understand the strongly coupled physics of gauge theories.</description>

      <title>The chromoelectric adjoint correlators in Euclidean space at next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics of quarkonium created in heavy-ion collisions is intrinsically connected to the correlation functions of adjoint chromoelectric fields in quantum chromodynamics. We study such correlation functions in a weak-coupling expansion in a thermal medium. We identify three distinct gauge-invariant correlators, and evaluate them to next-to-leading order. Two of the resulting correlators turn out to be asymmetric. We pinpoint the source of this asymmetry to Matsubara zero modes associated with Wilson lines. The results are shown to agree well with recent lattice calculations at high temperatures.</description>
