      <title>Reduced Order Hysteretic Flux Model for Transport Current Homogenization in Composite Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Reduced Order Hysteretic Flux (ROHF) model to describe the relationship between time-varying transport current and internal magnetic flux for composite superconductors. The ROHF model is parametrized using reference simulations of the conductor response, after which it enables the computation of macroscopic quantities such as voltage and power loss without requiring detailed electromagnetic field solutions. It is therefore suitable for the homogenization of transport current effects in large-scale superconducting magnets, avoiding a fine discretization of the composite strand small scale structures, allowing to drastically reduce the computational effort. The approximation can be implemented either (i) as a rate-independent model, neglecting eddy current effects in the normal conducting matrix, or (ii) as a rate-dependent model, including those eddy current effects. In this paper, the complete modeling workflow, including parameter identification, coupling with the other fields (temperature and magnetic field), and post-processing of the results, is described and verified using a twisted multifilamentary strand as an example.</description>

      <title>Advanced Space Mapping Technique Integrating a Shared Coarse Model for Multistate Tuning-Driven Multiphysics Optimization of Tunable Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces an advanced space mapping (SM) technique that applies a shared electromagnetic (EM)-based coarse model for multistate tuning-driven multiphysics optimization of tunable filters. The SM method combines the computational efficiency of EM single-physics simulations with the precision of multiphysics simulations. The shared coarse model is based on EM single-physics responses corresponding to various nontunable design parameters values. Conversely, the fine model is implemented to delineate the behavior of multiphysics responses concerning both nontunable and tunable design parameter values. The proposed overall surrogate model comprises multiple subsurrogate models, each consisting of one shared coarse model and two distinct mapping neural networks. The responses from the shared coarse model in the EM single-physics filed offer a suitable approximation for the fine responses in the multiphysics filed, whereas the mapping neural networks facilitate transition from the EM single-physics field to the multiphysics field. Each subsurrogate model maintains consistent nontunable design parameter values but possesses unique tunable design parameter values. By developing multiple subsurrogate models, optimization can be simultaneously performed for each tuning state. Nontunable design parameter values are constrained by all tuning states, whereas tunable design parameter values are confined to their respective tuning states. This optimization technique simultaneously accounts for all the tuning states to fulfill the necessary multiple tuning state requirements. Multiple EM and multiphysics training samples are generated concurrently to develop the surrogate model. Compared with existing direct multiphysics parameterized modeling techniques, our proposed method achieves superior multiphysics modeling accuracy with fewer training samples and reduced computational costs.</description>

      <title>Efficient ultrafast photoacoustic transduction on Tantalum thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nano-acoustic strain generation in thin metallic films via ultrafast laser excitation is widely used in material science, imaging and medical applications. Recently, it was shown that transition metals, such as Titanium, exhibit enhanced photoacoustic transduction properties compared to noble metals, such as Silver. This work presents experimental results and simulations that demonstrate that among transition metals Tantalum exhibits superior photoacoustic properties. Experiments of nano-acoustic strain generation by femtosecond laser pulses focused on thin Tantalum films deposited on Silicon substrates are presented. The nano-acoustic strains are measured via pump-probe transient reflectivity that captures the Brillouin oscillations produced by photon-phonon interactions. The observed Brillouin oscillations are correlated to the photoacoustic transduction efficiency of the Tantalum thin film and compared to the performance of Titanium thin films, clearly demonstrating the superior photoacoustic transduction efficiency of Tantalum. The findings are supported by computational results on the laser-induced strains and their propagation in these thin metal film/substrate systems using a Two-Temperature Model in combination with thermo-mechanical Finite Element Analysis. Finally, the role of the metal transducer-substrate acoustic impedance matching is discussed and the possibility to generate appropriately modulated acoustic pulse trains inside the crystalline substrate structures for the development of crystalline undulators used for {\gamma}-ray generation is presented.</description>

      <title>Coherent deflection of elliptic bunches colliding at crossing angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coherent deflection of charged particles bunch in the field of an counter-propagating bunch is considered. Bunches collide at non-zero crossing angle and they have different energies. Charge distributions in both colliding bunches are Gaussian. The generalization of Bassetti-Erskine formalism for bunch deflection and orbit shift is derived. Applications in collider physics are discussed.</description>

      <title>Zeptosecond Gamma-Ray Pulses Generation via FEL-Driven Microbunching and Laser-Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel and reliable approach to generate zeptosecond(10^{-21} s,zs), high-energy photon pulse bursts by synergistically exploiting the inherent characteristics of Free-Electron Lasers (FELs) and laser-Compton scattering. The feasibility of this scheme is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations. In a representative simulation, a 4 GeV electron beam, undergoing the FEL process, emits radiation at 0.7 nm and develops a microbunched structure. These microbunches subsequently interact with a 2 ps, 9 micrometers laser pulse in a head-on Compton scattering configuration. Our simulation results demonstrate that under conditions of well-established electron beam microbunching, the proposed method successfully yields high-brightness gamma-photon pulse bursts with durations approaching 800 zeptoseconds and exhibiting exceptional signal-to-noise ratios, consistent with theoretical expectations. This technique opens up avenues for exploring ultrafast nuclear dynamics and provides unprecedented perspectives for delving into the Quantum Zeno and Anti-Zeno effects.</description>

      <title>Commissioning of a radiofrequency quadrupole cooler-buncher for collinear laser spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A RadioFrequency Quadrupole (RFQ) cooler-buncher system has been developed and implemented in a collinear laser spectroscopy setup. This system is dedicated to convert a continuous ion beam into short bunches, while enhancing beam quality and reducing energy spread. The functionality of the RFQ cooler-buncher has been verified through offline tests with stable rubidium and indium beam, delivered from a surface ion source and a laser ablation ion source, respectively. With a transmission efficiency exceeding 60\%, bunched ion beams with a full width at half maximum of approximately 2~$\mu$s in the time-of-flight spectrum have been successfully achieved. The implementation of the RFQ cooler-buncher system also significantly improves the overall transmission efficiency of the collinear laser spectroscopy setup.</description>
