      <title>CoFinDiff: Controllable Financial Diffusion Model for Time Series Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of synthetic financial data is a critical technology in the financial domain, addressing challenges posed by limited data availability. Traditionally, statistical models have been employed to generate synthetic data. However, these models fail to capture the stylized facts commonly observed in financial data, limiting their practical applicability. Recently, machine learning models have been introduced to address the limitations of statistical models; however, controlling synthetic data generation remains challenging. We propose CoFinDiff (Controllable Financial Diffusion model), a synthetic financial data generation model based on conditional diffusion models that accept conditions about the synthetic time series. By incorporating conditions derived from price data into the conditional diffusion model via cross-attention, CoFinDiff learns the relationships between the conditions and the data, generating synthetic data that align with arbitrary conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that: (i) synthetic data generated by CoFinDiff capture stylized facts; (ii) the generated data accurately meet specified conditions for trends and volatility; (iii) the diversity of the generated data surpasses that of the baseline models; and (iv) models trained on CoFinDiff-generated data achieve improved performance in deep hedging task.</description>

      <title>Hedging with Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Derivatives, as a critical class of financial instruments, isolate and trade the price attributes of risk assets such as stocks, commodities, and indices, aiding risk management and enhancing market efficiency. However, traditional hedging models, constrained by assumptions such as continuous trading and zero transaction costs, fail to satisfy risk control requirements in complex and uncertain real-world markets.
  With advances in computing technology and deep learning, data-driven trading strategies are becoming increasingly prevalent. This thesis proposes a derivatives hedging framework integrating deep learning and reinforcement learning. The framework comprises a probabilistic forecasting model and a hedging agent, enabling market probability prediction, derivative pricing, and hedging.
  Specifically, we design a spatiotemporal attention-based probabilistic financial time series forecasting Transformer to address the scarcity of derivatives hedging data. A low-rank attention mechanism compresses high-dimensional assets into a low-dimensional latent space, capturing nonlinear asset relationships. The Transformer models sequential dependencies within this latent space, improving market probability forecasts and constructing an online training environment for downstream hedging tasks.
  Additionally, we incorporate generalized geometric Brownian motion to develop a risk-neutral pricing approach for derivatives. We model derivatives hedging as a reinforcement learning problem with sparse rewards and propose a behavior cloning-based recurrent proximal policy optimization (BC-RPPO) algorithm. This pretraining-finetuning framework significantly enhances the hedging agent's performance. Numerical experiments in the U.S. and Chinese financial markets demonstrate our method's superiority over traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>Risk-aware Trading Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate portfolio optimization in financial markets from a trading and risk management perspective. We term this task Risk-Aware Trading Portfolio Optimization (RATPO), formulate the corresponding optimization problem, and propose an efficient Risk-Aware Trading Swarm (RATS) algorithm to solve it. The key elements of RATPO are a generic initial portfolio P, a specific set of Unique Eligible Instruments (UEIs), their combination into an Eligible Optimization Strategy (EOS), an objective function, and a set of constraints. RATS searches for an optimal EOS that, added to P, improves the objective function repecting the constraints.
  RATS is a specialized Particle Swarm Optimization method that leverages the parameterization of P in terms of UEIs, enables parallel computation with a large number of particles, and is fully general with respect to specific choices of the key elements, which can be customized to encode financial knowledge and needs of traders and risk managers.
  We showcase two RATPO applications involving a real trading portfolio made of hundreds of different financial instruments, an objective function combining both market risk (VaR) and profit&amp;loss measures, constrains on market sensitivities and UEIs trading costs. In the case of small-sized EOS, RATS successfully identifies the optimal solution and demonstrates robustness with respect to hyper-parameters tuning. In the case of large-sized EOS, RATS markedly improves the portfolio objective value, optimizing risk and capital charge while respecting risk limits and preserving expected profits.
  Our work bridges the gap between the implementation of effective trading strategies and compliance with stringent regulatory and economic capital requirements, allowing a better alignment of business and risk management objectives.</description>
