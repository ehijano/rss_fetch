      <title>Martingales associated with strongly quasi-invariant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the martingales in relevance with $G$-strongly quasi-invariant states on a $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$, where $G$ is a separable locally compact group of $*$-automorphisms of $\mathcal A$. In the von Neumann algebra $\mathfrak A$ of the GNS representation, we define a unitary representation of the group and define a group $\hat G$ of $*$-automorphisms of $\mathfrak A$, which is homomorphic to $G$. For the case of compact $G$, under some mild condition, we find a $\hat G$-invariant state on $\mathfrak A$ and define a conditional expectation with range the $\hat G$-fixed subalgebra. Moving to the separable locally compact group $G=\cup_NG_N$, which is the union of increasing compact groups, we construct a sequence of conditional expectations and thereby construct (decreasing) martingales, which have limits by the martingale convergence theorem. We provide with an example for the group of finite permutations on the set of nonnegative integers acting on a $C^*$-algebra of infinite tensor product.</description>

      <title>Voiculescu's Theorem in Properly Infinite Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates Voiculescu's theorem on approximate equivalence in separable properly infinite factors. We establish the norm-denseness of the set of all reducible operators and prove Voiculescu's bicommutant theorem. Additionally, we extend these results to the multiplier algebras within separable type $\mathrm{III}$ factors.</description>

      <title>On relative commutants of subalgebras in group and tracial crossed product von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete group acting on a compact Hausdorff space $X$. Given $x\in X$, and $\mu\in\text{Prob}(X)$, we introduce the notion of contraction of $\mu$ towards $x$ with respect to unitary elements of a group von Neumann algebra not necessarily coming from group elements. Using this notion, we study relative commutants of subalgebras in tracial crossed product von Neumann algebras. The results are applied to negatively curved groups and $\text{SL}(d,\mathbb{Z})$, $d \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>On various notions of distance between subalgebras of operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given any irreducible inclusion $\mB \subset \mA$ of unital $C^*$-algebras with a finite-index conditional expectation $E: \mA \to \mB$, we show that the set of $E$-compatible intermediate $C^*$-subalgebras is finite, thereby generalizing a finiteness result of Ino and Watatani (from \cite{IW}). A finiteness result for a certain collection of intermediate $C^*$-subalgebras of a non-irreducible inclusion of simple unital $C^*$-algebras is also obtained, which provides a $C^*$-version of a finiteness result of Khoshkam and Mashood (from \cite{KM}).
  Apart from these finiteness results, comparisons between various notions of distance between subalgebras of operator algebras by Kadison-Kastler, Christensen and Mashood-Taylor are made. Further, these comparisons are used satisfactorily to provide some concrete calculations of distance between operator algebras associated to two distinct subgroups of a given discrete group.</description>

      <title>Continuity and equivariant dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local-triviality dimensions of actions on $C^*$-algebras, which are invariants developed for noncommutative Borsuk-Ulam theory. While finiteness of the local-triviality dimensions is known to guarantee freeness of an action, we show that free actions need not have finite weak local-triviality dimension. Moreover, the local-triviality dimensions of a continuous field may be greater than those of its individual fibers, and the dimensions may fail to vary continuously across the fibers. However, in certain circumstances upper semicontinuity of the weak local-triviality dimension is guaranteed. We examine these results and counterexamples with a focus on noncommutative tori and noncommutative spheres, both in terms of computation and theory.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free matricial Nullstellens\"atze for noncommutative polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hilbert's Nullstellensatz is one of the most fundamental correspondences between algebra and geometry, and has inspired a plethora of noncommutative analogs. In last two decades, there has been an increased interest in understanding vanishing sets of polynomials in several matrix variables without restricting the matrix size, prompted by developments in noncommutative function theory, control systems, operator algebras, and quantum information theory. The emerging results vary according to the interpretation of what vanishing means. For example, given a collection of noncommutative polynomials, one can consider all matrix tuples at which the values of these polynomials are all zero, singular, have common kernel, or have zero trace. This survey reviews Nullstellens\"atze for the above types of vanishing sets, and identifies their structural counterparts in the free algebra.</description>

      <title>Solving the p-Riccati Equations and Applications to the Factorisation of Differential Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solutions of the equation f^{ (p--1) }+ f^p = h^p in the unknown function f overan algebraic function field of characteristic p are very closely linked to the structure and fac-torisations of linear differential operators with coefficients in function fields of characteristic p.However, while being able to solve this equation over general algebraic function fields is necessaryeven for operators with rational coefficients, no general resolution method has been developed.We present an algorithm for testing the existence of solutions in polynomial time in the ``size''of h and an algorithm based on the computation of Riemann-Roch spaces and the selection ofelements in the divisor class group, for computing solutions of size polynomial in the ``size'' of hin polynomial time in the size of h and linear in the characteristic p, and discuss its applicationsto the factorisation of linear differential operators in positive characteristic p.</description>

      <title>Optimal transport for types and convex analysis for definable predicates in tracial $\mathrm{W}^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the connections between continuous model theory, free probability, and optimal transport/convex analysis in the context of tracial von Neumann algebras. In particular, we give an analog of Monge-Kantorovich duality for optimal couplings where the role of probability distributions on $\mathbb{C}^n$ is played by model-theoretic types, the role of real-valued continuous functions is played by definable predicates, and the role of continuous function $\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n$ is played by definable functions. In the process, we also advance the understanding of definable predicates and definable functions by showing that all definable predicates can be approximated by "$C^1$ definable predicates" whose gradients are definable functions. As a consequence, we show that every element in the definable closure of $\mathrm{W}^*(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ can be expressed as a definable function of $(x_1,\dots,x_n)$. We give several classes of examples showing that the definable closure can be much larger than $\mathrm{W}^*(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ in general.</description>

      <title>Chain Conditions for Etale Groupoid Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.11816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a unital commutative ring with unit and $\mathscr{G}$ an ample groupoid. Using the topology of the groupoid $\mathscr{G}$, Steinberg defined an etale groupoid algebra $R\mathscr{G}$. These etale groupoid algebras generalize various algebras including group algebras, commutative algebras over a field generated by idempotents, traditional groupoid algebras, Leavitt path algebras, higher-rank graph algebras, and inverse semigroup algebras. Steinberg later characterized the classical chain conditions for etale groupoid algebras. We characterize categorically noetherian and artinian, locally noetherian and artinian, and semisimple etale groupoid algebras, generalizing existing results for Leavitt path algebras.</description>

      <title>A geometric representative for the fundamental class in KK-duality of Smale spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental ingredient in the noncommutative geometry program is the notion of KK-duality, often called K-theoretic Poincar\'{e} duality, that generalises Spanier-Whitehead duality. In this paper we construct a $\theta$-summable Fredholm module that represents the fundamental class in KK-duality between the stable and unstable Ruelle algebras of a Smale space. To find such a representative, we construct dynamical partitions of unity on the Smale space with highly controlled Lipschitz constants. This requires a generalisation of Bowen's Markov partitions. Along with an aperiodic point-sampling technique we produce a noncommutative analogue of Whitney's embedding theorem, leading to the Fredholm module.</description>

      <title>Envelopes in the class of Banach algebras of polynomial growth and $C^\infty$-functions of a finite number of free variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of envelope of a topological algebra (in particular, an arbitrary associative algebra) with respect to a class of Banach algebra. In the case of the class of real Banach algebras of polynomial growth, i.e., admitting a $C^\infty$-functional calculus for every element, we get a functor that maps the algebra of polynomials in $k$ variables to the algebra of $C^\infty$-functions on $\mathbb{R}^k$. The envelope of a general commutative or non-commutative algebra can be treated as an algebra of $C^\infty$-functions on some commutative or non-commutative space. In particular, we describe the envelopes of the universal enveloping algebra of finite-dimensional Lie algebras, the coordinate algebras of the quantum plane and quantum $SL(2)$ and also look at some commutative examples. A result on algebras of `free $C^\infty$-functions', i.e., the envelopes of free associative algebras of finite rank $k$, is announced for general $k$ and proved for $k\le 2$.</description>
