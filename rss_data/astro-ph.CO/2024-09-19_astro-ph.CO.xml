      <title>The long freeze: an asymptotically static universe from holographic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that some holographic dark energy models can lead to a future evolution of the universe in which the scale factor $a$ is asymptotically constant, while $\dot a \rightarrow 0$ and the corresponding energy and pressure densities also vanish. We provide specific examples of such models and general conditions that can lead to an asymptotically static universe, which we have called the ``long freeze." We show that in some cases, such evolution can follow an arbitrarily long exponential expansion essentially identical to the asymptotic evolution of $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Accurate simulations of reionization using the reduced speed of light approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduced speed of light approximation has been employed to speed up radiative transfer simulations of reionization by a factor of $\gtrsim 5-10$. However, it has been shown to cause significant errors in the HI-ionizing background near reionization's end in simulations of representative cosmological volumes. This can bias inferences on the galaxy ionizing emissivity required to match observables, such as the Ly$\alpha$ forest. In this work, we show that using a reduced speed of light is, to a good approximation, equivalent to re-scaling the global ionizing emissivity in a redshift-dependent way. We derive this re-scaling and show that it can be used to ``correct'' the emissivity in reduced speed of light simulations. This approach of re-scaling the emissivity after the simulation has been run is useful in contexts where the emissivity is a free parameter. We test our method by running full speed of light simulations using these re-scaled emissivities and comparing them with their reduced speed of light counterparts. We find that for reduced speeds of light $\tilde{c} \geq 0.2$, the 21 cm power spectrum at $0.1 \leq k /[h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}] \leq 0.2$ and key Ly$\alpha$ forest observables agree to within $20\%$ throughout reionization, and often better than $10\%$. Position-dependent time-delay effects cause inaccuracies in reionization's morphology on large scales that produce errors up to a factor of $2$ for $\tilde{c} \leq 0.1$. Our method enables a factor of $5$ speedup of radiative transfer simulations of reionization in situations where the emissivity can be treated as a free parameter.</description>

      <title>Improved Halo Model Calibrations for Mixed Dark Matter Models of Ultralight Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the implications of relaxing the requirement for ultralight axions to account for all dark matter in the Universe by examining mixed dark matter (MDM) cosmologies with axion fractions $f \leq 0.3$ within the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) window $10^{-25}$ eV $\lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-23}$ eV. Our simulations, using a new MDM gravity solver implemented in AxiREPO, capture wave dynamics across various scales with high accuracy down to redshifts $z\approx 1$. We identify halos with Rockstar using the CDM component and find good agreement of inferred halo mass functions (HMFs) and concentration-mass relations with theoretical models across redshifts $z=1-10$. This justifies our halo finder approach a posteriori as well as the assumptions underlying the MDM halo model AxionHMcode. Using the inferred axion halo mass - cold halo mass relation $M_{\text{a}}(M_{\text{c}})$ and calibrating a generalised smoothing parameter $\alpha$ to our MDM simulations, we present a new version of AxionHMcode. The code exhibits excellent agreement with simulations on scales $k&lt; 20 \ h$ cMpc$^{-1}$ at redshifts $z=1-3.5$ for $f\leq 0.1$ around the fiducial axion mass $m = 10^{-24.5}$ eV $ = 3.16\times 10^{-25}$ eV, with maximum deviations remaining below 10%. For axion fractions $f\leq 0.3$, the model maintains accuracy with deviations under 20% at redshifts $z\approx 1$ and scales $k&lt; 10 \ h$ cMpc$^{-1}$, though deviations can reach up to 30% for higher redshifts when $f=0.3$. Reducing the run-time for a single evaluation of AxionHMcode to below $1$ minute, these results highlight the potential of AxionHMcode to provide a robust framework for parameter sampling across MDM cosmologies in Bayesian constraint and forecast analyses.</description>

      <title>Testing the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum of a halo model using hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical properties of LSS serve as powerful tools to constrain the cosmological properties of our Universe. Tracing the gas pressure, the tSZ effect is a biased probe of mass distribution and can be used to test the physics of feedback or cosmological models. Therefore, it is crucial to develop robust modeling of hot gas pressure for applications to tSZ surveys. Since gas collapses into bound structures, it is expected that most of the tSZ signal is within halos produced by cosmic accretion shocks. Hence, simple empirical halo models can be used to predict the tSZ power spectra. In this study, we employed the HMx halo model to compare the tSZ power spectra with those of several hydrodynamical simulations: the Horizon suite and the Magneticum simulation. We examined various contributions to the tSZ power spectrum across different redshifts, including the one- and two-halo term decomposition, the amount of bound gas, the importance of different masses and the electron pressure profiles. Our comparison of the tSZ power spectrum reveals discrepancies that increase with redshift. We find a 20% to 50% difference between the measured and predicted tSZ angular power spectrum over the multipole range $\ell=10^3-10^4$. Our analysis reveals that these differences are driven by the excess of power in the predicted two-halo term at low k and in the one-halo term at high k. At higher redshifts (z~3), simulations indicate that more power comes from outside the virial radius than from inside suggesting a limitation in the applicability of the halo model. We observe differences in the pressure profiles, despite the fair level of agreement on the tSZ power spectrum at low redshift with the default calibration of the halo model. In conclusion, our study suggests that the properties of the halo model need to be carefully controlled against real or mock data to be proven useful for cosmological purposes.</description>

      <title>Reionization relics in the cross-correlation between the Ly$\alpha$ forest and 21 cm intensity mapping in the post-reionization era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tumultuous effects of ultraviolet photons that source cosmic reionization, the subsequent compression and shock-heating of low-density regions, and the modulation of baryons in shallow potential wells induced by the passage of ionization fronts, collectively introduce perturbations to the evolution of the intergalactic medium in the post-reionization era. These enduring fluctuations persist deep into the post-reionization era, casting a challenge upon precision cosmology endeavors targeting tracers in this cosmic era. Simultaneously, these relics from reionization also present a unique opportunity to glean insights into the astrophysics that govern the epoch of reionization. In this work, we propose a first study of the cross-correlation of \lya forest and 21 cm intensity mapping, accounting for the repercussions of inhomogeneous reionization in the post-reionization era. We investigate the ability of SKA $\times$ DESI-like, SKA $\times$ MUST-like, and PUMA $\times$ MUST-like instrumental setups to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the redshift range $3.5 \leq z \leq 4$. Moreover, we assess how alterations in integration time, survey area, and reionization scenarios impact the SNR. Furthermore, we forecast the cross-correlation's potential to constrain cosmological parameters under varying assumptions: considering or disregarding reionization relics, marginalizing over reionization astrophysics, and assuming perfect knowledge of reionization. Notably, our findings underscore the remarkable capability of a futuristic PUMA $\times$ MUST-like setup, with a modest 100-hour integration time over a 100 sq. deg. survey, to constrain the ionization efficiency error to $\sigma_\zeta = 3.42 $.</description>

      <title>First confirmation of anisotropic bias from statistically anisotropic matter distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We confirm for the first time the existence of distinctive halo bias associated with the quadrupolar type of statistical anisotropy (SA) of the linear matter density field using cosmological $N$-body simulations. We find that the coefficient of the SA-induced bias for cluster-sized halos takes negative values and exhibits a decreasing trend with increasing halo mass. This results in the quadrupole halo power spectra in a statistically anisotropic universe being less amplified compared to the monopole spectra. The anisotropic feature in halo bias that we found presents a promising new tool for testing the hypothesis of a statistically anisotropic universe, with significant implications for the precise verification of anisotropic inflation scenarios and vector dark matter and dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Redshift Distribution Inference through Joint Self-Calibration and Clustering-Redshift Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately characterizing the true redshift (true-$z$) distribution of a photometric redshift (photo-$z$) sample is critical for cosmological analyses in imaging surveys. Clustering-based techniques, which include clustering-redshift (CZ) and self-calibration (SC) methods--depending on whether external spectroscopic data are used--offer powerful tools for this purpose. In this study, we explore the joint inference of the true-$z$ distribution by combining SC and CZ (denoted as SC+CZ). We derive simple multiplicative update rules to perform the joint inference. By incorporating appropriate error weighting and an additional weighting function, our method shows significant improvement over previous algorithms. We validate our approach using a DES Y3 mock catalog. The true-$z$ distribution estimated through the combined SC+CZ method is generally more accurate than using SC or CZ alone. To account for the different constraining powers of these methods, we assign distinct weights to the SC and CZ contributions. The optimal weights, which minimize the distribution error, depend on the relative constraining strength of the SC and CZ data. Specifically, for a spectroscopic redshift sample that represents 1% of the photo-$z$ sample, the optimal combination reduces the total error by 20% (40%) compared to using CZ (SC) alone, and it keeps the bias in mean redshift [$\Delta \bar{z} / (1 + z) $] at the level of 0.3%. Furthermore, when CZ data is only available in the low-$z$ range and the high-$z$ range relies solely on SC data, SC+CZ enables consistent estimation of the true-$z$ distribution across the entire redshift range. Our findings demonstrate that SC+CZ is an effective tool for constraining the true-$z$ distribution, paving the way for clustering-based methods to be applied at $z\gtrsim 1$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers. Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the distortion has an opposite sign and a $\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover the redshift range $\simeq 2\times 10^6-4\times 10^7$ between the $\mu$-era and the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints for dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\,{\rm eV}\lesssim m_{\rm dp}\lesssim 10^{-3}\,{\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\mu$-type distortion independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.</description>

      <title>Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z = 0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures. The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i) using WIYN-ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a moment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching algorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight to obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim simulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find the mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We also find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic structures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical and X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to map large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the peaks are similar to X-Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster and show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.</description>

      <title>SPECTER: An Instrument Concept for CMB Spectral Distortion Measurements with Enhanced Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\mu$-distortion) to late-time baryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the $\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$ arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here, we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while robustly marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the $\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$) assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally measure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the z-dependence of the MOND acceleration (a_0) within the Scale Invariant Vacuum (SIV) paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper: ``On the time dependency of $a_0$" the authors claim that they have tested ``one of the predictions of the Scale Invariant Vacuum (SIV) theory on MOND" by studying the dependence of the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) acceleration at two data sets, low-$z$ ($3.2\times10^{-4}\le z\le 3.2\times10^{-2}$) and high-$z$ ($0.5\le z\le 2.5$). They claim ``both samples show a dependency of $a_0$ from $z$". Here, the work mentioned above is revisited. The explicit analytic expression for the $z$-dependence of the $a_0$ within the SIV theory is given. Furthermore, the first estimates of the $\Omega_m$ within SIV theory give $\Omega_{m}=0.28\pm 0.04$ using the low-z data only, while a value of $\Omega_{m}=0.055$ is obtained using both data sets. This much lower $\Omega_m$ leaves no room for non-baryonic matter! Unlike in the mentioned paper above, the slope in the $z$-dependence of $A_0=\log_{10}(a_0)$ is estimated to be consistent with zero Z-slope for the two data sets. Finally, the statistics of the data are consistent with the SIV predictions; in particular, the possibility of change in the sign of the slopes for the two data sets is explainable within the SIV paradigm; however, the uncertainty in the data is too big for the clear demonstration of a $z$-dependence yet.</description>

Abstract: We use the latest dataset of supernova (SN) host galaxies to investigate how the host properties -- stellar mass, star formation rate, metallicity, absolute magnitude, and colour -- differ across SN types, with redshift-driven selection effects controlled. SN Ib and Ic host galaxies, on average, are more massive, metal-rich, and redder than SN II hosts. For subtypes, SN Ibn and Ic-BL have bluer hosts than their normal SN Ib and Ic siblings; SN IIb has consistent host properties with SN Ib, while hosts of SN IIn are more metal-rich than those of SN II. Hydrogen-deficient superluminous supernovae feature bluer and lower luminosity hosts than most subtypes of core-collapse supernova (CC SN). Assuming simple proportionality of CC SN rates and host star formation rates (SFRs) does not recover the observed mean host properties; either a population of long-lived progenitors or a metallicity-dependent SN production efficiency better reproduces the observed host properties. Assuming the latter case, the rates of SN II are insensitive to host metallicity, but the rates of SN Ib and Ic are substantially enhanced in metal-rich hosts by a factor of ~10 per dex increase in metallicity. Hosts of SN Ia are diverse in their observed properties; subtypes including SN Ia-91T, Ia-02cx, and Ia-CSM prefer star-forming hosts, while subtypes like SN Ia-91bg and Ca-rich prefer quiescent hosts. The rates of SN Ia-91T, Ia-02cx, and Ia-CSM are closely dependent on, or even proportional to, their host SFRs, indicating relatively short-lived progenitors. Conversely, the rates of SN Ia-91bg and Ca-rich transients are proportional to the total stellar mass, favoring long-lived progenitors.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for Galaxies with Extended Emission Line and Potential Outflows in JADES Medium-Band Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we systematically search for galaxies with extended emission line and potential outflows features using medium-band images in the GOODS-S field by comparing the morphology in medium-band images to adjacent continuum and UV bands. We look for galaxies that have a maximum extent 50\% larger, an excess area 30\% greater, or an axis ratio difference of more than 0.3 in the medium band compared to the reference bands. After visual inspection, we find 326 candidate galaxies at $1 &lt; z &lt; 6$, with a peak in the population near cosmic noon, benefiting from the good coverage of the medium-band filters. By examining their SEDs, we find that the candidate galaxies are at least 20\% more bursty in their star-forming activity and have 60\% more young stellar populations compared to a control sample selected based on the continuum band flux. Additionally, these candidates exhibit a significantly higher production rate of ionizing photons. We further find that candidates hosting known AGN produce extended emission that is more anisotropic compared to non-AGN candidates. A few of our candidates have been spectroscopically confirmed to have prominent outflow signatures through NIRSpec observations, showcasing the robustness of the photometric selection. Future spectroscopic follow-up will better help verify and characterize the kinematics and chemical properties of these systems.</description>

      <title>An evaluation of source-blending impact on the calibration of SKA EoR experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twenty-one-centimetre signals from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) are expected to be detected in the low-frequency radio window by the next-generation interferometers, particularly the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). However, precision data analysis pipelines are required to minimize the systematics within an infinitesimal error budget. Consequently, there is a growing need to characterize the sources of errors in EoR analysis. In this study, we identify one such error origin, namely source blending, which is introduced by the overlap of objects in the densely populated observing sky under SKA1-Low's unprecedented sensitivity and resolution, and evaluate its two-fold impact in both the spatial and frequency domains using a novel hybrid evaluation (HEVAL) pipeline combining end-to-end simulation with an analytic method to mimic EoR analysis pipelines. Sky models corrupted by source blending induce small but severe frequency-dependent calibration errors when coupled with astronomical foregrounds, impeding EoR parameter inference with strong additive residuals in the two-dimensional power spectrum space. We report that additive residuals from poor calibration against sky models with blending ratios of 5 and 0.5 per cent significantly contaminate the EoR window. In contrast, the sky model with a 0.05 per cent blending ratio leaves little residual imprint within the EoR window, therefore identifying a blending tolerance at approximately 0.05 per cent. Given that the SKA observing sky is estimated to suffer from an extended level of blending, strategies involving de-blending, frequency-dependent error mitigation, or a combination of both, are required to effectively attenuate the calibration impact of source-blending defects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider theories which break the invariance under diffeomorphisms (Diff) down to transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff) in the matter sector, consisting of multiple scalar fields. In particular, we regard shift-symmetric models with two free TDiff scalar fields in a flat Robertson-Walker spacetime and use the perfect fluid approach to study their dynamics. As a consequence of the symmetry breaking, an effective interaction between the fields is induced from the conservation of the total energy-momentum tensor, without the necessity to introduce any explicit interacting term in the Lagrangian. We study the different single-field domination regimes and analyze the energy exchange between the fields. Thereupon, we introduce an application of these models for the description of interactions in the dark sector, and compare the theoretical predictions of our model to observational data from Type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>The Low-Redshift Lyman Continuum Survey: The Roles of Stellar Feedback and ISM Geometry in LyC Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental questions of cosmology is the origin and mechanism(s) responsible for the reionization of the Universe beyond $z\sim6$. To address this question, many studies over the past decade have focused on local ($z\sim0.3$) galaxies which leak ionizing radiation (Lyman continuum or LyC). However, line-of-sight effects and data quality have prohibited deeper insight into the nature of LyC escape. To circumvent these limitations, we analyze stacks of a consolidated sample of {\it HST}/COS observations of the LyC in 89 galaxies at $z\sim0.3$. From fitting of the continuum, we obtain information about the underlying stellar populations and neutral ISM geometry. We find that most LyC non-detections are not leaking appreciable LyC ($f_{esc}^{\rm LyC}&lt;1$\%) but also that exceptional cases point to spatial variations in the LyC escape fraction $f_{esc}^{\rm LyC}$. Stellar populations younger than 3 Myr lead to an increase in ionizing feedback, which in turn increases the isotropy of LyC escape. Moreover, mechanical feedback from supernovae in 8-10 Myr stellar populations is important for anisotropic gas distributions needed for LyC escape. While mechanical feedback is necessary for any LyC escape, high $f_{esc}^{\rm LyC}$ ($&gt;5$\%) also requires a confluence of young stars and ionizing feedback. A two-stage burst of star formation could facilitate this optimal LyC escape scenario.</description>

      <title>From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the primordial black hole reheating scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH reheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas, especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any early matter-dominated universe scenario.</description>

      <title>Analysis of an iterative reconstruction method in comparison of the standard reconstruction method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of a new, iterative density reconstruction algorithm. This algorithm uses a decreasing smoothing scale to better reconstruct the density field in Lagrangian space. We implement this algorithm to run on the Quijote simulations, and extend it to (a) include a smoothing kernel that smoothly goes from anisotropic to isotropic, and (b) a variant that does not correct for redshift space distortions. We compare the performance of this algorithm with the standard reconstruction method. Our examinations of the methods include cross-correlation of the reconstructed density field with the linear density field, reconstructed two-point functions, and BAO parameter fitting. We also examine the impact of various parameters, such as smoothing scale, anisotropic smoothing, tracer type/bias, and the inclusion of second order perturbation theory. We find that the two reconstruction algorithms are comparable in most of the areas we examine. In particular, both algorithms give consistent fittings of BAO parameters. The fits are robust over a range of smoothing scales. We find the iterative algorithm is significantly better at removing redshift space distortions. The new algorithm will be a promising method to be employed in the ongoing and future large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole compaction function from stochastic fluctuations in ultra-slow-roll inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBH) with ultra-slow-roll inflation when stochastic effects are important. We use the $\Delta N$ formalism and simplify the stochastic equations with an analytical constant-roll approximation. Considering a viable inflation model, we find the spatial profile of the PBH compaction function numerically for each stochastic patch, without assumptions about Gaussianity or the radial profile. The stochastic effects that lead to an exponential tail for the density distribution also make the compaction function very spiky, unlike assumed in the literature. Naively using collapse thresholds found for smooth profiles, the PBH abundance is enhanced by up to a factor of $10^9$, and the PBH mass distribution is spread over three orders of magnitude in mass. The results point to a need to redo numerical simulations of PBH formation with spiky profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes still represent a viable candidate for a significant fraction, if not for the totality, of dark matter. If these compact objects have masses of order tens of solar masses, their coalescence can be observed by current and future ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Therefore, finding new gravitational wave signatures associated with this dark matter candidate can either lead to their detection or help constraining their abundance. In this work we consider the phenomenology of primordial black holes in dense environments, in particular globular clusters. We model the internal structure of globular clusters in a semi-analytical fashion, and we derive the expected merger rate. We show that, if primordial black holes are present in globular clusters, their contribution to the GW background can be comparable to other well-known channels, such as early- and late-time binaries, thus enhancing the detectability prospects of primordial black holes and demonstrating that this contribution needs to be taken into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we provide a data analysis of the BOSS galaxy clustering data with the recently proposed FreePower method, which adopts as parameters the power spectrum band-powers instead of a specific cosmological parametrization. It relies on the Alcock-Paczy\'nski effect and redshift-space distortions, and makes use of one-loop perturbation theory for biased tracers. In this way, we obtain for the first time constraints on the linear growth rate, on the Hubble parameter, as well as on various bias functions, that are independent of a model for the power spectrum shape and thus of both the early and late-time cosmological modelling. Using broad priors we find at $z_{\rm eff}=0.38$, $f=0.64^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$, $H/H_0=1.054^{+0.079}_{-0.048}$, and at $z_{\rm eff}=0.61$, $f=0.61^{+0.16}_{-0.11}$, $H/H_0=1.27\pm0.11$. The low-$z$ $H/H_0$ result is at 2.5$\sigma$ tension with Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM results. The precision in these results demonstrates the capabilities of the FreePower method. We also get constraints on the bias parameters which are in agreement with constraints from previous BOSS analyses, which serves as a cross-check of our pipeline.</description>

      <title>Revisiting evolution of domain walls and their gravitational radiation with CosmoLattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the publicly available CosmoLattice code, we conduct numerical simulations of a domain wall network and the resulting gravitational waves (GWs) in a radiation-dominated Universe in the $Z_2$-symmetric scalar field model. In particular, the domain wall evolution is investigated in detail both before and after reaching the scaling regime, using the combination of numerical and theoretical methods. We demonstrate that the total area of closed walls is negligible compared to that of a single long wall stretching throughout the simulation box. Therefore, the closed walls are unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall network evolution. This is in contrast with the case of cosmic strings, where formation of loops is crucial for maintaining the system in the scaling regime. To obtain the GW spectrum, we develop a technique that separates physical effects from numerical artefacts arising due to finite box size and non-zero lattice spacing. Our results on the GW spectrum agree well with Refs. [29, 30], which use different codes. Notably, we observe a peak at the Hubble scale, an exponential falloff at scales shorter than the wall width, and a plateau/bump at intermediate scales. We also study sensitivity of obtained results on the choice of initial conditions. We find that different types of initial conditions lead to qualitatively similar domain wall evolution in the scaling regime, but with important variations translating into different intensities of GWs.</description>

      <title>Reionization Parameter Inference from 3D Minkowski Functionals of the 21 cm Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Minkowski Functionals (MFs), a set of topological summary statistics, have emerged as a powerful tool for extracting non-Gaussian information. We investigate the prospect of constraining the reionization parameters using the MFs of the 21 cm brightness temperature field from the epoch of reionization (EoR). Realistic effects, including thermal noise, synthesized beam, and foreground avoidance, are applied to the mock observations from the radio interferometric array experiments such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We demonstrate that the MFs of the 21 cm signal measured with SKA-Low can be used to distinguish different reionization models, whereas the MF measurement with a HERA-like array cannot be made accurately enough. We further forecast the accuracies with which the MF measurements can place constraints on reionization parameters, using the standard MCMC analysis for parameter inference based on forward modeling. We find that for SKA-Low observation, MFs provide unbiased estimations of the reionization parameters with accuracies comparable to the power spectrum (PS) analysis. Furthermore, joint constraints using both MFs and PS can improve the constraint accuracies by up to $30\%$ compared to those with the PS alone. Nevertheless, the constraint accuracies can be degraded if the EoR window is shrunk with strong foreground avoidance. Our analysis demonstrates the promise of MFs as a set of summary statistics that extract complementary information from the 21 cm EoR field to the two-point statistics, which suggests a strong motivation for incorporating the MFs into the data analysis of future 21 cm observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript revisits the phenomenological emergent dark energy model (PEDE) by confronting it with recent cosmological data from early and late times. In particular we analyze PEDE model by using the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements coming from both Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI) data release 1 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Additionally, the measurements from cosmic chronometers, supernovae type Ia (Pantheon+), quasars, hydrogen II galaxies and cosmic background radiation distance priors are considered. By performing a Bayesian analysis based on Monte Carlo Markov Chain, we find consistent results on the constraints when SDSS and DESI are considered. However, we find higher values on the Hubble constant than Supernova $H_0$ for the Equation of State (SH0ES) does although it is still in agreement, within $1\sigma$ confidence level, when BAO measurements are added. Furthermore, we estimate the age of the Universe younger $\sim3\%$ than the one predicted by the standard cosmology. Additionally, we report values of $q_0 = -0.771^{+0.007}_{-0.007}$, $z_T = 0.764^{+0.011}_{-0.011}$ for the deceleration parameter today and the deceleration-acceleration transition redshift, respectively. However, PEDE cosmology is disfavoured by the combined samples.</description>

      <title>Cosmological gravity on all scales IV: 3x2pt Fisher forecasts for pixelised phenomenological modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stage IV large scale structure surveys are promising probes of gravity on cosmological scales. Due to the vast model-space in the modified gravity literature, model-independent parameterisations represent useful and scalable ways to test extensions of $\Lambda$CDM. In this work we use a recently validated approach of computing the non-linear $3\times 2$pt observables in modified gravity models with a time-varying effective gravitational constant $\mu$ and a gravitational slip $\eta$ that is binned in redshift to produce Fisher forecasts for an LSST Y10-like survey. We also include in our modelling an effective nulling scheme for weak-lensing by applying the BNT transformation that localises the weak-lensing kernel enabling well-informed scale cuts. We show that the combination of improved non-linear modelling and better control of the scales that are modelled/cut yields high precision constraints on the cosmological and modified gravity parameters. We find that 4 redshift bins for $\mu$ of width corresponding to equal incremental $\Lambda$CDM growth is optimal given the state-of-the-art modelling and show how the BNT transformation can be used to mitigate the impact of small-scale systematic effects, such as baryonic feedback.</description>

      <title>Charting the Nanohertz Gravitational Wave Sky with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the summer of 2023, the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) announced a compelling evidence for the existence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Despite this breakthrough, however, several critical questions remain unanswered: What is the source of the signal? How can cosmic variance be accounted for? To what extent can we constrain nanohertz gravity? When will individual supermassive black hole binaries become observable? And how can we achieve a stronger detection? These open questions have spurred significant interests in PTA science, making this an opportune moment to revisit the astronomical and theoretical foundations of the field, as well as the data analysis techniques employed. In this review, we focus on the theoretical aspects of the SGWB as detected by PTAs. We provide a comprehensive derivation of the expected signal and its correlation, presented in a pedagogical manner, while also addressing current constraints. Looking ahead, we explore future milestones in the field, with detailed discussions on emerging theoretical considerations such as cosmic variance, the cumulants of the one- and two-point functions, subluminal gravitational waves, and the anisotropy and polarization of the SGWB.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Primordial Black Hole Abundance through Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Advanced LIGO and Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a promising dark matter candidate, primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ are supposed to have evaporated by today through Hawking radiation. This scenario is challenged by the memory burden effect, which suggests that the evaporation of black holes may slow down significantly after they have emitted about half of their initial mass. We explore the astrophysical implications of the memory burden effect on the PBH abundance by today and the possibility for PBHs lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ to persist as dark matter. Our analysis utilizes current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data to constrain the primordial power spectrum and infer the PBH abundance. We find a null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves that accompanied the formation of the PBHs. Then we find that PBHs are ruled out within the mass range $\sim[10^{-24},10^{-19}]M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, we expect that next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer, will provide even more stringent constraints. Our results indicate that future detectors can reach sensitivities that could rule out PBH as dark matter within $\sim[10^{-29}M_{\odot},10^{-16}M_{\odot}]$ in the null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Bosenovae with Quadratically-Coupled Scalars in Quantum Sensing Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) particles of mass $m_\phi \lesssim 1~{\rm eV}$ can form boson stars in DM halos. Collapse of boson stars leads to explosive bosenova emission of copious relativistic ULDM particles. In this work, we analyze sensitivity of terrestrial and space-based experiments to detect such relativistic scalar ULDM particles interacting through quadratic couplings with Standard Model constituents, including electrons, photons and gluons. We highlight key differences with searches for linear ULDM couplings. Screening of ULDM with quadratic couplings near the surface of the Earth can significantly impact observations in terrestrial experiments, motivating future space-based experiments. We demonstrate excellent ULDM discovery prospects, especially for quantum sensors, which can probe quadratic couplings orders below existing constraints by detecting bosenova events in the ULDM mass range $10^{-23}\,{\rm eV} \lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-5}\,{\rm eV}$. We also report updated constraints on quadratic couplings of ULDM in case it comprises cold DM.</description>

      <title>Composite Dark Matter with Forbidden Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A dark matter model based on QCD-like $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory with electroweakly interacting dark quarks is discussed. Assuming the dark quark mass $m$ is smaller than the dynamical scale $\Lambda_d \sim 4\pi f_d$, the main component of the dark matter is the lightest $G$-parity odd dark pion associated with chiral symmetry breaking in the dark sector. We show that nonzero dark quark mass induces the universal mass contribution to both $G$-parity odd and even pions, and their masses tend to be degenerate. As a result, dark pion annihilation into heavier $G$-parity even dark pion also affects the dark matter relic abundance. Thus, our setup naturally accommodates forbidden dark matter scenario and realizes heavy dark matter whose mass is ${\cal O}(1$-$100)~{\rm TeV}$, which is different from conventional electroweakly interacting dark matter such as minimal dark matter. We also discuss CP-violation from $\theta$-term in the dark gauge sector and find that the predicted size of electron electric dipole moment can be as large as $\sim 10^{-32}~e~{\rm cm}$.</description>

      <title>Axion star condensation around primordial black holes and microlensing limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present novel findings concerning the parameter space of axion stars, extended object forming in dense dark matter environments through gravitational condensation. We emphasize their formation within the dense minihalos that potentially surround primordial black holes and in axion miniclusters. Our study investigates the relation between the radius and mass of an axion star in these dense surroundings, revealing distinct morphological characteristics compared to isolated scenarios. We explore the implications of these results when applied to the bound state between a primordial black hole and an axion star and the gravitational microlensing from extended objects, leading to insights on the observational constraints from such ``halo'' axion stars. We provide a constraint on the fraction of the galactic population of axion stars from their contribution to the microlensing events from the EROS-2 survey, using the numerical resolution of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation.</description>

      <title>Smooth reheating and dark matter via non-Abelian gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how a dark sector can provide a crucial link between a vacuum-dominated early universe and the later radiation-dominated epoch. As an example, we consider a feeble axion-like coupling of dark non-Abelian gauge fields with a single inflaton. In this scenario, a dark heat bath emerges at the end of inflation. As the dark sector cools down, its gauge fields confine into composite glueball states. The reheating of the visible sector is realized through portal interactions. After confinement, discrete symmetries protect part of the glueball states that form relic dark matter, while the others keep decaying into Standard Model degrees of freedom. The dark relic abundance depends mostly on the departure from equilibrium dynamics after the phase transition, constraining the confinement scale of the dark sector. Moreover, indirect detection and Big-Bang nucleosynthesis set bounds on the scale of portal interactions. We show that in a narrow but non-vanishing region of the parameter space, the correct dark matter abundance and sufficient reheating temperature are simultaneously reached.</description>

      <title>The impact of feedback on the evolution of gas density profiles from galaxies to clusters: a universal fitting formula from the Simba suite of simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radial distribution of gas within galactic haloes is connected to the star formation rate and the nature of baryon-driven feedback processes. Using six variants of the hydrodynamic simulation Simba, we study the impact of different stellar/AGN feedback prescriptions on the gas density profiles of haloes in the total mass range $10^{11} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} &lt; M_{\mathrm{200c}} &lt; 10^{14} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and redshift interval $0&lt;z&lt;4$. We find that the radial profiles are well represented by a power law and that, for a fixed total halo mass, the slope and amplitude of such power law are generally weakly dependent on redshift. Once AGN-driven jets are activated in the simulation, the gas density profile of haloes with $M_{\rm 200c} \gtrsim 10^{13} \, \rm M_{\odot}$ declines more gently with radial distance. We argue that this distinctive feature could be exploited with current observations to discriminate amongst the predictions of the different feedback models. We introduce a universal fitting formula for the slope and amplitude of the gas density profile as a function of total halo mass and redshift. The best-fit functions are suitable for all feedback variants considered, and their predictions are in excellent agreement with the numerical results. We provide the values of all fit parameters, making our fitting formula a versatile tool to mimic the effect of Simba feedback models onto N-body simulations and semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. Our results can also aid observational estimates of the gas mass within haloes that assume a specific slope for the underlying gas density profile.</description>
