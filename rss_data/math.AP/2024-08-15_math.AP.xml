      <title>Rigid body in compressible flow with general inflow-outflow boundary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the motion of a rigid body within a compressible, isentropic, and viscous fluid contained in a fixed bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3$. The fluid's behavior is described by the Navier-Stokes equations, while the motion of the rigid body is governed by ordinary differential equations representing the conservation of linear and angular momentum. We prescribe a time-independent fluid velocity along the boundary of $\Omega$ and a time-independent fluid density at the inflow boundary of $\Omega$. Additionally, we assume a no-slip boundary condition at the interface between the fluid and the rigid body. We prove existence of a weak solution to the given problem within a time interval where the rigid body does not touch the boundary $\partial\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Transverse Instability of Stokes Waves at Finite Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Stokes wave is a traveling free-surface periodic water wave that is constant in the direction transverse to the direction of propagation. In 1981 McLean discovered via numerical methods that Stokes waves are unstable with respect to transverse perturbations. In \cite{CreNguStr} for the case of infinite depth we proved rigorously that the spectrum of the water wave system linearized at small Stokes waves, with respect to transverse perturbations, contains unstable eigenvalues lying approximately on an ellipse. In this paper we consider the case of finite depth and prove that the same spectral instability result holds for all but finitely many values of the depth. The computations and some aspects of the theory are considerably more complicated in the finite depth case.</description>

      <title>Continuity of attractors for a highly oscillatory family of perturbations of the square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the family of semilinear parabolic problems \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} u_{t}(x,t) = \Delta u(x,t) - au(x,t) + f(u(x,t)), \,\,\, x \in \Omega_{\epsilon}, t &gt; 0, \\ \frac{\partial u}{\partial N} (x,t) = g(u(x,t)), \,\,\, x \in \partial \Omega_{\epsilon}, t &gt; 0, \end{array} \right. \end{equation*}
  where $a &gt; 0$, $\Omega$ is the unit square, $\Omega_{\epsilon} = h_{\epsilon}(\Omega)$, $h_{\epsilon}$ is a family of $C^{m}$ - diffeomorphisms, $m \geq 1$, which converge to the identity of $\Omega$ in $C^{\alpha}$ norm, if $\alpha &lt;1$ but do not converge in the $C^{1}$ - norm and, $f,g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are real functions.
  We show that a weak version of this problem, transported to the fixed domain $\Omega$ by a ``pull-back'' procedure, is well posed for $0 &lt;\epsilon \leq \epsilon_{0}$, $\epsilon_{0} &gt; 0$, in a suitable phase space, the associated semigroup has a global attractor $\mathcal{A}_{\epsilon}$ and the family $\{ \mathcal{A}_{\epsilon} \}_{0 \, &lt; \, \epsilon \, \leq \, \epsilon_{0}}$ converges as $\epsilon \to 0$ to the attractor of the limiting problem:
  \begin{equation*}\ \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} u_{t}(x,t) = \Delta u(x,t) - au(x,t) + f(u(x,t)), \,\,\, x \in \Omega, t &gt; 0, \\ \frac{\partial u}{\partial N} (x,t) = g(u(x,t))\mu, \,\,\, x \in \partial \Omega, t &gt; 0, \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $\mu$ is essentially the limit of the Jacobian determinant of the diffeomorphism ${h_{\epsilon}}_{| \partial \Omega} : \partial \Omega \rightarrow \partial h_{\epsilon}(\Omega)$ (but does not depend on the particular family $h_{\epsilon})$.</description>

      <title>Long Time Dynamics Of The Three-dimensional Nernst-Planck-Darcy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an electrodiffusion model describing the evolution of $N$ ionic species in a three-dimensional fluid flowing through a porous medium and forced by added body charges. We address the global well-posedness and long-time dynamics of the model. In the absence of added charges, we prove that the ionic concentrations decay exponentially fast in time to their initial spatial averages in all Sobolev norms. When the fluid undergoes the influence of given time-independent charges, we obtain the existence of a finite-dimensional global attractor.</description>

      <title>Exact Boundary Controllability for Reduced System Associated to Extended Maxwell Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theory of viscoelasticity, an important class of models admits a representation in terms of springs and dashpots. Widely used members of this class are the Maxwell model and its extended version. The paper concerns about the exact boundary controllability (abbreviated by EBC) for the reduced system (abbreviated by RS) associated to the extended Maxwell model (EMM). The initial boundary value problem (abbreviated by IBP) with a mixed type boundary condition (abbreviated by MBC) in the absence of the exterior force is called the augmented system (abbreviated by AD system). Here, the MBC consists of a homogeneous displacement boundary condition and inhomogeneous traction boundary condition with a boundary control. The RS is a closed subsystem inside the AD system (see Section \ref{sec1} for the details of the EMM and the RS). For the RS, we consider the IBP for the associated AD system. By using a dissipative structure of the RS in relation with the AD system, we will prove the EBC for the RS by a modified version of Russell's principle. Also, as an application of this EBC, we will show a partial boundary controllability (abbreviated by PBC) for the Boltzmann type viscoelastic system of equations (abbreviated by BVS) associated to the EMM. That is, for a large enough time $T&gt;0$ and any pair of given speeds $(v_0, v_1)$, there is a boundary control which steers to have $v(0)=v^0,\,v(t)=v^1$, where $v(t)=\partial_t u(t)$ is the speed of the displacement vector $u(t)$ of BVS at time $t$.</description>

      <title>Longtime behaviors of an epidemic model with nonlocal diffusions and a free boundary: spreading-vanishing dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a nonlocal epidemic model whose spatial domain evolves over time and is represented by $[0,h(t)]$ with $h(t)$ standing for the spreading front of epidemic. It is assumed that the agents can cross the fixed boundary $x=0$, but they will die immediately if they do it, which implies that the area $(-\infty,0)$ is a hostile environment for the agents. We first show that this model is well posed, then prove that the longtime behaviors are governed by a spreading-vanishing dichotomy and finally give some criteria determining spreading and vanishing. Particularly, we obtain the asymptotical behaviors of the principal eigenvalue of a cooperative system with nonlocal diffusions without assuming the related nonlocal operator is self-adjoint, and the steady state problem of such cooperative system on half space $[0,\infty)$ is studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Existence and local asymptotics for a system of cross-diffusion equations with nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard model for a multicomponent mixture with cross-diffusion effects and degenerate mobility. The nonlocality is described by means of a symmetric singular kernel. We define a notion of weak solution adapted to possible degeneracies and prove, as our first main result, its global-in-time existence. The proof relies on an application of the formal gradient flow structure of the system (to overcome the lack of a-priori estimates), combined with an extension of the boundedness-by-entropy method, in turn involving a careful analysis of an auxiliary variational problem. This allows to obtain solutions to an approximate, time-discrete system. Letting the time step size go to zero, we recover the desired nonlocal weak solution where, due to their low regularity, the Cahn-Hilliard terms require a special treatment.
  Finally, we prove convergence of solutions for this class of nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equations to their local counterparts.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Interface Model for Two-Phase Flows on Evolving Surfaces with Different Densities: Global Well-Posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to a Navier-Stokes/Cahn-Hilliard type system on a given two-dimensional evolving surface in the case of different densities and a singular (logarithmic) potential. The system describes a diffuse interface model for a two-phase flow of viscous incompressible fluids on an evolving surface. We also establish the validity of the instantaneous strict separation property from the pure phases. To show these results we use our previous achievements on local well-posedness together with suitable novel regularity results for the convective Cahn-Hilliard equation. The latter allows to obtain higher-order energy estimates to extend the local solution globally in time. To this aim the time evolution of energy type quantities has to be calculated and estimated carefully.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energetically most efficient way how a deformed red blood cell regains equilibrium is mathematically described by the gradient flow of the Canham-Helfrich functional, including a spontaneous curvature and the conservation of surface area and enclosed volume. Using a recently discovered multiplicity inequality, we prove global existence and convergence of smooth solutions for spheres and axisymmetric tori, provided the initial energy lies below explicit thresholds.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Gradient Flows of MMD Functionals with Distance Kernel and Cauchy Problems on Quantile Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a comprehensive description of Wasserstein gradient flows of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) functionals $\mathcal F_\nu := \text{MMD}_K^2(\cdot, \nu)$ towards given target measures $\nu$ on the real line, where we focus on the negative distance kernel $K(x,y) := -|x-y|$. In one dimension, the Wasserstein-2 space can be isometrically embedded into the cone $\mathcal C(0,1) \subset L_2(0,1)$ of quantile functions leading to a characterization of Wasserstein gradient flows via the solution of an associated Cauchy problem on $L_2(0,1)$. Based on the construction of an appropriate counterpart of $\mathcal F_\nu$ on $L_2(0,1)$ and its subdifferential, we provide a solution of the Cauchy problem. For discrete target measures $\nu$, this results in a piecewise linear solution formula. We prove invariance and smoothing properties of the flow on subsets of $\mathcal C(0,1)$. For certain $\mathcal F_\nu$-flows this implies that initial point measures instantly become absolutely continuous, and stay so over time. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of the flow by various numerical examples using an implicit Euler scheme and demonstrate differences to the explicit Euler scheme, which is easier to compute, but comes with limited convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>Front propagation in hybrid reaction-diffusion epidemic models with spatial heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-species reaction-diffusion system in one space dimension that is derived from an epidemiological model in a spatially periodic environment with two types of pathogens: the wild type and the mutant. The system is of a hybrid nature, partly cooperative and partly competitive, but neither of these entirely. We study under what conditions the spreading of infection occurs when the pathogen are localized initially. We show that there is a well-defined spreading speed and that it coincides with the minimal speed of the traveling waves. Next, we study the homogenization limit of the traveling waves when the spatial period of the coefficients tends to zero. Finally, we give an example of the coefficients for which the right-bound and left-bound traveling waves have different speeds, via an analysis of a certain singular limit problem. Note that such an example never exists in scalar reaction-diffusion equations even with non-symmetric spatial heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and large-time behavior for a special $2\frac{1}{2}$D full compressible viscous non-resistive MHD system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the full compressible, viscous, non-resistive MHD system under the assumption that the fluids move on a plane while the magnetic field is oriented vertically. Within the framework of Besov spaces, by introducing several new unknown quantities and exploiting the intrinsic structure of the system, we prove the global well-posedness of strong solutions for initial data close to a constant equilibrium state. Furthermore, under some suitable additional conditions involving only the low-frequency part of the initial perturbation, we develop a Lyapunov-type energy argument, which yields the optimal time-decay rates of the global solution. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first one on global solvability to the full compressible, viscous, non-resistive MHD system in multi-dimensional whole space.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the initial boundary values problem associated to the compressible viscous non-resistive and heat-conducting magnetohydrodynamic flow, where the magnetic field is vertical. More precisely, by exploiting the intrinsic structure of the system and introducing several new unknown quantities, we overcome the difficulty stemming from the lack of dissipation for density and magnetic field, and prove the global well-posedness of strong solutions in the framework of Soboles spaces $H^3$. In addition, we also get the exponential decay for this non-resistive system. Different from the known results [23], [24], [42], we donot need the assumption that the background magnetic field is positive here.</description>

      <title>Geometric constraints on Ekman boundary layer solutions in non-flat regions with well-prepared data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of Ekman boundary layer solutions near the non-flat boundaries presents a complex challenge, with limited research on this issue. In Masmoudi's pioneering work [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 53 (2000), 432--483], the Ekman boundary layer solution was investigated on the domain $\mathbb{T}^2\times [\varepsilon B(x,y), 1]$, where $\varepsilon$ is a small constant and $B(x,y)$ denotes a periodic smooth function. This study investigates the influence of the geometric structure of the boundary $B(x,y)$ within the boundary layer. Specifically, for well-prepared initial data in the domain $\mathbb{R}^2\times[B(x,y), B(x,y)+2]$, if the boundary surface $B(x,y)$ is smooth and satisfies certain geometric constraints concerning its Gaussian and mean curvatures, then we derive an approximate boundary layer solution. Additionally, according to the curvature and incompressible conditions, the limit system we constructed is a 2D primitive system with damping and rotational effects. From the model's background, it reflects the characteristics arising from rotational effects. Finally, we validate the convergence of this approximate solution. No smallness condition on the amplitude of boundary $B(x, y)$ is required.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Attention Operator: Materializing Hidden Knowledge Towards Interpretable Physics Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent popularity of attention-based neural architectures in core AI fields like natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), their potential in modeling complex physical systems remains under-explored. Learning problems in physical systems are often characterized as discovering operators that map between function spaces based on a few instances of function pairs. This task frequently presents a severely ill-posed PDE inverse problem. In this work, we propose a novel neural operator architecture based on the attention mechanism, which we coin Nonlocal Attention Operator (NAO), and explore its capability towards developing a foundation physical model. In particular, we show that the attention mechanism is equivalent to a double integral operator that enables nonlocal interactions among spatial tokens, with a data-dependent kernel characterizing the inverse mapping from data to the hidden parameter field of the underlying operator. As such, the attention mechanism extracts global prior information from training data generated by multiple systems, and suggests the exploratory space in the form of a nonlinear kernel map. Consequently, NAO can address ill-posedness and rank deficiency in inverse PDE problems by encoding regularization and achieving generalizability. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of NAO over baseline neural models in terms of generalizability to unseen data resolutions and system states. Our work not only suggests a novel neural operator architecture for learning interpretable foundation models of physical systems, but also offers a new perspective towards understanding the attention mechanism.</description>

      <title>Finite Dimensional Projections of HJB Equations in the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper continues the study of controlled interacting particle systems with common noise started in [W. Gangbo, S. Mayorga and A. {\'{S}}wi{\k{e}}ch, \textit{SIAM J. Math. Anal.} 53 (2021), no. 2, 1320--1356] and [S. Mayorga and A. {\'{S}}wi{\k{e}}ch, \textit{SIAM J. Control Optim.} 61 (2023), no. 2, 820--851]. First, we extend the following results of the previously mentioned works to the case of multiplicative noise: (i) We generalize the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ corresponding to control problems of $n$ particles to the value function $V$ corresponding to an appropriately defined infinite dimensional control problem; (ii) we prove, under certain additional assumptions, $C^{1,1}$ regularity of $V$ in the spatial variable. The second main contribution of the present work is the proof that if $DV$ is continuous (which, in particular, includes the previously proven case of $C^{1,1}$ regularity in the spatial variable), the value function $V$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$. Using this projection property, we show that optimal controls of the finite dimensional problem correspond to optimal controls of the infinite dimensional problem and vice versa. In the case of a linear state equation, we are able to prove that $V$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$ under relaxed assumptions on the coefficients of the cost functional by using approximation techniques in the Wasserstein space, thus covering cases where $V$ may not be differentiable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06636v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove capacitary versions of the fractional Sobolev--Poincar\'e inequalities. We characterize localized variant of the boundary fractional Sobolev--Poincar\'e inequalities through uniform fatness condition of the domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Existence type results on the fractional Hardy inequality are established in the supercritical case $sp&gt;n$ for $s\in(0,1)$, $p&gt;1$. Characterization of the fractional Hardy inequality through weak supersolution of the associate problem is also addressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider phase separations on (generalized) hypersurfaces in Euclidian space. We consider a diffuse surface area (line tension) energy of Modica-Mortola type and prove a compactness and lower bound estimate in the sharp interface limit. We use the concept of generalized BV functions over currents as introduced by Anzellotti et. al. [Annali di Matematica Pura ed Applicata, 170, 1996] to give a suitable formulation in the limit and achieve the necessary compactness property. We also consider an application to phase separated biomembranes where a Willmore energy for the membranes is combined with a generalized line tension energy. For a diffuse description of such energies we give a lower bound estimate in the sharp interface limit.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Born-Infeld system, arising as a nonlinear model of electromagnetism, and its extension introduced by Brenier [Bre04] the so-called "augmented Born-Infeld system". We show that this system enjoys a non-resonance structure and prove global existence and linear asymptotic behaviour of small (admissible) perturbations of arbitrary constant states.</description>

      <title>Semilinear equations in bounded cylinders: Morse index and bifurcation from one-dimensional solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study semilinear elliptic equations in domains where there is a natural class of solutions, which depend only on one variable, and whose simple geometry reflects the geometry of the domain. We prove that under quite general assumptions, other types of solutions also exist. More precisely, we consider one-dimensional solutions in bounded cylinders and, combining a suitable separation of variables with the theory of ordinary differential equations, we show how to compute the Morse index of such solutions. The Morse index is then used to prove local and global bifurcation results.</description>

      <title>Optimal Savings and Value of Population in A Stochastic Environment: Transient Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the work on optimal investment and consumption of a population considered in [2] to a general stochastic setting over a finite time horizon. We incorporate the Cobb-Douglas production function in the capital dynamics while the consumption utility function and the drift rate in the population dynamics can be general, in contrast with [2, 30, 31]. The dynamic programming formulation yields an unconventional nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, in which the Cobb-Douglas production function as the coefficient of the gradient of the value function induces the mismatching of power rates between capital and population. Moreover, the equation has a very singular term, essentially a very negative power of the partial derivative of the value function with respect to the capital, coming from the optimization of control, and their resolution turns out to be a complex problem not amenable to classical analysis. To show that this singular term, which has not been studied in any physical systems yet, does not actually blow up, we establish new pointwise generalized power laws for the partial derivative of the value function. Our contribution lies in providing a theoretical treatment that combines both the probabilistic approach and theory of partial differential equations to derive the pointwise upper and lower bounds as well as energy estimates in weighted Sobolev spaces. By then, we accomplish showing the well-posedness of classical solutions to a non-canonical parabolic equation arising from a long-lasting problem in macroeconomics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider rotated $n$-Laplace systems on the unit ball $B_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ of the form
  \begin{align*}
  -\mathrm{div}\left( Q|\nabla u|^{n-2} \nabla u\right) = \mathrm{div}(G),
  \end{align*}
  where $u\in W^{1,n}(B_1;\mathbb{R}^N)$, $Q\in W^{1,n}(B_1;SO(N))$ and $G\in L^{\left( \frac{n}{n-1},q \right)}(B_1;\mathbb{R}^n\otimes \mathbb{R}^N)$ for some $0&lt;q&lt;\frac{n}{n-1}$. We prove that $\nabla u\in L^{(n,q(n-1))}_{loc}$ with estimates. As a corollary, we obtain that solutions to $\Delta_n u \in \mathcal{H}^1$, where $\mathcal{H}^1$ is the Hardy space, have a higher integrability, namely $\nabla u \in L^{(n,n-1)}_{loc}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove extension results for functions in Besov spaces. Our results are new in the homogeneous setting, while our technique applies equally in the inhomogeneous setting to obtain new proofs of classical results. While our results include $p&gt;1$, of principle interest is the case $p=1$, where we show that \begin{equation*} \int_{\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n+1}}t^{a}|\nabla^{m+1}u(x,t)|\;dtdx\lesssim\left\vert f\right\vert _{B^{m-a,1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})} \end{equation*} for all $f \in \dot{B}^{m-a,1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ (the homogeneous Besov space) where $u$ is a suitably scaled heat extension of $f$.</description>

Abstract: We establish a Lions-type concentration-compactness principle and its variant at infinity for Musielak-Orlicz-Sobolev spaces associated with a double phase operator with variable exponents. Based on these principles, we demonstrate the existence and concentration of solutions for a class of critical double phase equations of Schr\"odinger type in $\mathbb{R}^N$ involving variable exponents with various types of potentials. Our growth condition is more appropriately suited compared to the existing works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the first and rigorous confirmations of the hypotheses by Ludwig Boltzmann in his seminal paper \cite{Boltzmann} within the context of the Landau equation in the presence of a harmonic potential. We prove that (i) Each {\it entropy-invariant solution} can be identified as a {\it time-periodic Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution}. Moreover, these distributions can be characterized by thirteen conservation laws, which sheds light on the global dynamics. (ii) Each {\it time-periodic Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution} is nonlinearly stable, including neutral asymptotic stability and Lyapunov stability. Furthermore, the convergence rate is entirely reliant on the thirteen conservation laws and is optimal when compared to the linear scenario.</description>

      <title>$BMO$ and gradient estimates for solutions of critical elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we explore several applications of the recently introduced spaces of functions of bounded $\beta$-dimensional mean oscillation for $\beta \in (0,n]$ to regularity theory of critical exponent elliptic equations.
  We first show that functions with gradient in weak-$L^n$ are in $BMO^\beta$ for any $\beta \in (0,n]$, improving the classical result $\nabla u\in L^n$ implies $u\in BMO$. We apply this result to the Poisson equation $-\Delta u = \operatorname*{div} F$ with zero boundary conditions in a bounded $C^1$ domain to show that $u\in BMO^{\beta}$ when $F$ is in weak-$L^n$. Next, we consider the $n$-Laplace equation \begin{align*} -\operatorname*{div}( |\nabla U|^{n-2} \nabla U) &amp;= F \text{ in } \Omega, \newline
  U &amp;=0 \text{ on }\partial \Omega. \end{align*} with $F\in L^1(\Omega)$ and show that the classical result $u\in BMO$ can be improved to $u\in BMO^\beta$. Finally, we consider the $n$-Laplace equation in the case when $F \in L^1$, $\operatorname*{div} F=0$ and prove that for smooth domains $\Omega$ we have the estimate \begin{align*} \|\nabla U \|_{L^n} \mathbb \leq C \, \|F\|^{1/(n-1)}_{L^1}, \end{align*} where the constant $C$ is independent of $F$.</description>

Abstract: We consider an asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Vlasov-Riesz system of order $\alpha$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ which is a kinetic model induced by Riesz interactions. We prove small data scattering when $1/2&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and modified scattering when $1&lt;\alpha&lt;1+\delta$ for some $\delta&gt;0$. Moreover, we show the existence of (modified) wave operators for such a regime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the existence of modified scattering with polynomial correction in kinetic models.</description>

      <title>FEM for 1D-problems involving the logarithmic Laplacian: error estimates and numerical implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the numerical analysis of a finite element method (FEM) for one-dimensional Dirichlet problems involving the logarithmic Laplacian (the pseudo-differential operator that appears as a first-order expansion of the fractional Laplacian as the exponent $s\to 0^+$). Our analysis exhibits new phenomena in this setting; in particular, using recently obtained regularity results, we prove rigorous error estimates and provide a logarithmic order of convergence in the energy norm using suitable $\log$-weighted spaces. Numerical evidence suggests that this type of rate cannot be improved. Moreover, we show that the stiffness matrix of logarithmic problems can be obtained as the derivative of the fractional stiffness matrix evaluated at $s=0$. Lastly, we investigate the relationship between the discrete eigenvalue problem and its convergence to the continuous one.</description>
