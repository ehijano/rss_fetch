      <title>Tuning Universality in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit crackling-like avalanches whose origin lacks a mechanistic explanation. Here, I derive a stochastic theory of deep information propagation (DIP) by incorporating Central Limit Theorem (CLT)-level fluctuations. Four effective couplings $(r, h, D_1, D_2)$ characterize the dynamics, yielding a Landau description of the static exponents and a Directed Percolation (DP) structure of activity cascades. Tuning the couplings selects between avalanche dynamics generated by a Brownian Motion (BM) in a logarithmic trap and an absorbed free BM, each corresponding to a distinct universality classes. Numerical simulations confirm the theory and demonstrate that activation function design controls the collective dynamics in random DNNs.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of monitored free fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore, both analytically and numerically, the quantum dynamics of a many-body free-fermion system subjected to local density measurements. We begin by extending the mapping to the nonlinear sigma-model (NLSM) field theory for the case of finite evolution time $T$ and different classes of initial states, which lead to different NLSM boundary conditions. The analytical formalism is then used to study how quantum correlations gradually develop, with increasing $T$, from those determined by the initial state towards their steady-state form. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations for several types of initial states. We further consider the long-time limit, when the system in $d+1$ space-time dimensions becomes quasi-one-dimensional, and analyze the scaling of the ``localization'' time (which is simultaneously the purification time and the charge-sharpening time for this class of problems). The analytical predictions for scaling properties are fully confirmed by numerical simulations in a $d=2$ model around the measurement-induced phase transition. We use this dynamical approach to determine numerically the measurement-induced transition point and the associated correlation-length critical exponent.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Graph Neural Networks for Classifying Structure and Magnetism in Delafossite Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Delafossites (ABC2, where A and B are metals and C is a chalcogen) are a versatile family of quantum materials and layered oxides/chalcogenides whose properties are highly sensitive to atomic composition and stacking geometry. Their broad chemical tunability makes them an ideal platform for large-scale combinatorial exploration and high-throughput computational screening with desirable quantum properties. In this work, we employ a Concept Whitening Graph Neural Network, a gray-box AI model, to classify delafossite structures by stacking sequence and magnetic states. By aligning learned representations with human-interpretable physical concepts, this gray-box approach enables both accurate prediction and insight into the structural and chemical features driving magnetic behavior. The magnetic-ordering models achieved validation accuracies exceeding 80 percent, with a further slight uptick observed in the model incorporating the largest number of concepts. Concept alignment analysis revealed measurable learning across nine physically meaningful descriptors, with coefficients of determination ranging from approximately 0.6 for the d-shell valence-electron concepts to 0.4-0.5 for the magnetic coupling parameters. Furthermore, we mapped the concept importances onto the material graph representation, elucidating interpretable physical trends and the progression of stable concept-aligned regions across training. These results demonstrate the potential of interpretable graph-based learning to capture the underlying physics of complex materials systems and provide an interpretable framework for accelerating the discovery and understanding of delafossites and related crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Avalanches in active glasses with finite persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the statistics of avalanches in glassy systems of active particles with finite persistence, with and without an externally applied shear. In departing from the infinite-persistence limit and exploring the interplay of internal activity and external driving, we uncover when and why active and passive systems display similar avalanche statistics and where these analogies fail. We find that power-law distributed stress drops emerge only when activity builds long enough correlations, controlled by the persistence length, with exponents that vary from the purely strain-driven case, to the purely activity-driven case, in a smooth fashion. The local structure and scaling of avalanches of plastic rearrangements remains universal across both limit cases, supporting an interpretation of activity as increasing the typical size of the regions involved in a given avalanche. Our results bridge quasistatic shear strain and finite-persistence active yielding, showing that avalanches driven by self-propulsion retain the characteristic fingerprints of long-range stress propagation.</description>

      <title>Carrier localization and dynamics in In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N: the impact of alloying and Si doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alloying and doping are crucial for enhancing the electronic and optical properties of semiconductors while simultaneously introducing disorder. This report explores the effects of alloying and Si (0.5 at.\%) doping on In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N thin films that were grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. Post-growth X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that Si doping does not affect the lattice parameters and screw dislocations but significantly increases the edge dislocation density. Temperature-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy shows that Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N exhibits higher photoluminescence intensity, blue-shifted peaks, narrower emission linewidths, and quenching of lower energy sidebands when compared to pristine In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N. The peak energies of the most dominant feature, the donor-bound exciton, for both samples show an $S$-shape behavior indicating the presence of disorder. Although doping improves luminescence, it also introduces deeper localized states. This suggests that impurity-induced disorder outweighs compositional fluctuations, as confirmed by higher disorder parameters and Stokes shifts. Thus, the Si doping leads to increased localization, reducing nonradiative recombination channels while enhancing radiative processes. The deeper states in the doped sample confirm improved carrier confinement, and their saturation leads to early thermalization, thereby lowering the red-blue shift transition from 165 K to about 50 K. Even though the high doping level makes Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N a degenerate system, it exhibits enhanced luminescence properties. These findings shed light on the impact of silicon doping on charge transport in InGaN alloys for optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Symmetries at the origin of hierarchical emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many systems of interest exhibit nested emergent layers with their own rules and regularities, and our knowledge about them seems naturally organised around these levels. This paper proposes that this type of hierarchical emergence arises as a result of underlying symmetries. By combining principles from information theory, group theory, and statistical mechanics, one finds that dynamical processes that are equivariant with respect to a symmetry group give rise to emergent macroscopic levels organised into a hierarchy determined by the subgroups of the symmetry. The same symmetries happen to also shape Bayesian beliefs, yielding hierarchies of abstract belief states that can be updated autonomously at different levels of resolution. These results are illustrated in Hopfield networks and Ehrenfest diffusion, showing that familiar macroscopic quantities emerge naturally from their symmetries. Together, these results suggest that symmetries provide a fundamental mechanism for emergence and support a structural correspondence between objective and epistemic processes, making feasible inferential problems that would otherwise be computationally intractable.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Learnability Transition of Measurement-Induced Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) captures how local measurements generate long-range quantum correlations and drive dynamical phase transitions in many-body systems. Yet estimating MIE experimentally remains challenging: direct evaluation requires extensive post-selection over measurement outcomes, raising the question of whether MIE is accessible with only polynomial resources. We address this challenge by reframing MIE detection as a data-driven learning problem that assumes no prior knowledge of state preparation. Using measurement records alone, we train a neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict the uncertainty metric for MIE--the gap between upper and lower bounds of the average post-measurement bipartite entanglement. Applied to random circuits with one-dimensional all-to-all connectivity and two-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupling, our method reveals a learnability transition with increasing circuit depth: below a threshold, the uncertainty is small and decreases with polynomial measurement data and model parameters, while above it the uncertainty remains large despite increasing resources. We further verify this transition experimentally on current noisy quantum devices, demonstrating its robustness to realistic noise. These results highlight the power of data-driven approaches for learning MIE and delineate the practical limits of its classical learnability.</description>

      <title>Storage capacity of perceptron with variable selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to distinguish genuine structure from chance correlations in high-dimensional data. In this work, we address this issue for the perceptron, a foundational model of neural computation. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the pattern load $\alpha$ and the variable selection ratio $\rho$ for which a simple perceptron can perfectly classify $P = \alpha N$ random patterns by optimally selecting $M = \rho N$ variables out of $N$ variables. While the Cover--Gardner theory establishes that a random subset of $\rho N$ dimensions can separate $\alpha N$ random patterns if and only if $\alpha &lt; 2\rho$, we demonstrate that optimal variable selection can surpass this bound by developing a method, based on the replica method from statistical mechanics, for enumerating the combinations of variables that enable perfect pattern classification. This not only provides a quantitative criterion for distinguishing true structure in the data from spurious regularities, but also yields the storage capacity of associative memory models with sparse asymmetric couplings.</description>

      <title>Testing Transformer Learnability on the Arithmetic Sequence of Rooted Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study whether a Large Language Model can learn the deterministic sequence of trees generated by the iterated prime factorization of the natural numbers. Each integer is mapped into a rooted planar tree and the resulting sequence $ \mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$ defines an arithmetic text with measurable statistical structure. A transformer network (the GPT-2 architecture) is trained from scratch on the first $10^{11}$ elements to subsequently test its predictive ability under next-word and masked-word prediction tasks. Our results show that the model partially learns the internal grammar of $\mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$, capturing non-trivial regularities and correlations. This suggests that learnability may extend beyond empirical data to the very structure of arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Refining Heuristic Predictors of Fractional Chern Insulators using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an interpretable, data-driven framework to quantify how single-particle band geometry governs the stability of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Using large-scale exact diagonalization, we evaluate an FCI metric that yields a continuous spectral measure of FCI stability across parameter space. We then train Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) -- a recently developed interpretable neural architecture -- to regress this metric from two band-geometric descriptors: the trace violation $T$ and the Berry curvature fluctuations $\sigma_B$. Applied to spinless fermions at filling $\nu=1/3$ in models on the checkerboard and kagome lattices, our approach yields compact analytical formulas that predict FCI stability with over $&gt;80 \%$ accuracy in both regression and classification tasks, and remain reliable even in data-scarce regimes. The learned relations reveal model-dependent trends, clarifying the limits of Landau-level-mimicking heuristics. Our framework provides a general method for extracting simple, phenomenological "laws" that connect many-body phase stability to chosen physical descriptors, enabling rapid hypothesis formation and targeted design of quantum phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of transient two-dimensional surfaces where a random-walking particle escapes to infinity in contrast to localization in standard flat 2D space. We first prove that any rotationally symmetric 2D membrane embedded in flat 3D space cannot be transient. Then we formulate a criterion for the transience of a general asymmetric 2D membrane. We use it to explicitly construct a class of transient 2D manifolds with a non-trivial metric and height function but ``zero average curvature,'' which we dub tablecloth manifolds. The absence of the logarithmic infrared divergence of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in turn implies the absence of weak localization, non-existence of bound states in shallow potentials, and breakdown of the Mermin-Wagner theorem and Kosterlitz-Thouless transition on the tablecloth manifolds, which may be realizable in both quantum simulators and corrugated two-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Holstein mechanism in a single-electron (one-site) system, where unitary evolution intrinsically involves both fermion and boson operators under nonadiabatic conditions. The resulting unitary dynamics and boson-frequency dependence reveal a quantum phase transition, evidenced by distinct short-time (power-law decay) and long-time (exponential decay) behaviors, which are manifested in the polaronic shift, bosonic energy, and dynamics of reduced density matrix. This observation is consistent with a non-Markovian to Markovian transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays promise high-fidelity quantum simulations of critical phenomena with flexible geometries. Yet experimental realizations inevitably suffer from disorder due to random displacements of atoms, leading to departures from the expected behavior. Here, we study how such positional disorder influences the Ising criticality. Since disorder breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, one might expect the system to flow to an infinite-strength disordered fixed point, erasing all nontrivial critical features in low spatial dimensions. Remarkably, we find instead that disorder in Rydberg systems is subjected to nontrivial local constraints, making the physics markedly different from systems with more conventional spatially short-range correlated or long-range correlated disorder. This leads to new classes of criticalities even at dimensions where conventional disorder would destroy criticality altogether. We then demonstrate as a consequence how a novel pseudo-criticality emerges in Rydberg atom chains of experimentally realistic scale, and show that the renormalization group flow is governed by a locally constrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking perturbation. Our findings uncover new disorder-driven phenomena and underscore the importance of carefully treating disorder effects in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Exploring Replica Symmetry Breaking and Topological Collapse in Spin Glasses with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Replica symmetry breaking (RSB) underlies the complex organization of disordered systems, yet quantitative validation beyond $N \sim 100$ spins has remained computationally challenging. We use quantum annealing to access ground states of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model up to $N = 4000$ spins, enabling the most extensive test of Parisi's Nobel Prize-winning RSB solution to date. Five independent observables confirm RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value with characteristic $N^{-2/3}$ corrections, energy fluctuations scale as $N^{-3/4}$ ($\gamma = 0.739 \pm 0.036$), the chaos exponent $\theta = 0.51 \pm 0.02$ ($R^2 = 0.989$) confirms mean-field universality, the overlap distribution exhibits hierarchical structure ($\sigma_q = 0.19$), and the complexity remains invariant under 36\% network dilution. Beyond a critical threshold $0.8 &lt; D_c &lt; 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously through a cooperative avalanche that converts the entire system to vacancies within a narrow parameter window $\Delta D = 0.1$. These findings establish quantum computation as a tool for probing emergent many-body phenomena and uncover the topological foundations of complexity in disordered systems, with implications for neural networks, optimization, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Mechanical hysterons with tunable interactions of general sign</title>

Abstract: Hysterons are elementary units of hysteresis that underlie many complex behaviors of non-equilibrium matter. Because models of interacting hysterons can describe disordered matter, this suggests that artificial systems could respond to mechanical inputs in precise and targeted ways. Specifying the properties of hysterons and their interactions could thus be a general method for realizing arbitrary non-equilibrium behaviors. Elastic structures including slender beams, creased sheets, and shells are clear candidates for artificial hysterons, but complete control of their interactions has seemed impractical or impossible. Here we report a mechanical hysteron composed of rigid bars and linear springs, which has controllable properties and tunable interactions of general sign that can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. We derive a mapping from the system parameters to the hysteron properties, and we show how collective behaviors of multiple hysterons can be targeted by adjusting geometric parameters on the fly. By transforming an abstract hysteron model into a physical design platform, our work demonstrates a route toward designed materials that can sense, compute, and respond to their mechanical environment.</description>

      <title>Quantum sequel of neural network training</title>

Abstract: Training of neural networks (NNs) has emerged as a major consumer of both computational and energy resources. Quantum computers were coined as a root to facilitate training, but no experimental evidence has been presented so far. Here we demonstrate that quantum annealing platforms, such as D-Wave, can enable fast and efficient training of classical NNs, which are then deployable on conventional hardware. From a physics perspective, NN training can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition: the system evolves from an initial spin glass state to a highly ordered, trained state. This process involves eliminating numerous undesired minima in its energy landscape. The advantage of annealing devices is their ability to rapidly find multiple deep states. We found that this quantum training achieves superior performance scaling compared to classical backpropagation methods, with a clearly higher scaling exponent (1.01 vs. 0.78). It may be further increased up to a factor of 2 with a fully coherent quantum platform using a variant of the Grover algorithm. Furthermore, we argue that even a modestly sized annealer can be beneficial to train a deep NN by being applied sequentially to a few layers at a time.</description>

      <title>Suppression of quantized heat flow by the dielectric response of a compressible strip at the quantum Hall edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22459</link>

Abstract: We develop a unified perturbative framework for energy transport along a chiral quantum Hall edge coupled to a disordered, compressible strip. Treating the strip as a generic linear response environment characterized by its retarded susceptibility, we obtain leading corrections to both the heat flux carried by the edge plasmon and to its spectrum. Two generic regimes emerge: (i) a gapped, local dielectric response with finite-range coupling, producing a negative correction to the quantized heat flux that scales as T^4 at low temperatures together with a convex cubic shift of the plasmon dispersion; and (ii) a hydrodynamic (diffusive) response with relaxation, yielding a crossover from T^4 to T^{3/2} scaling and a change of sign in the correction. We further introduce a microscopic dipolar model in which the edge couples electrostatically to localized dipole moments inside a wide compressible strip. This long-range interaction amplifies the nonlocal dielectric back-action and generates new suppression laws, T^3 or even T^2 for smooth disorder profiles, together with a universal ratio connecting spectral curvature to thermal response. Across all regimes, the total heat flux remains quantized: the apparent deficit of the plasmon contribution reflects reversible heat drag into the compressible strip rather than a breakdown of quantization. The framework thus provides a coherent and quantitatively plausible explanation of the "missing heat flux" anomaly and unifies the thermal and spectral signatures of quantum Hall edge dynamics.</description>

      <title>Information phases of partial projected ensembles generated from random quantum states and scrambling dynamics</title>

Abstract: The projected ensemble -- an ensemble of pure states on a subsystem conditioned on projective measurement outcomes on its complement -- provides a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure than the reduced density matrix of the subsystem in bipartite quantum states. This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. We contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures. Finally, we show that these information phases, as characterised by the Holevo information, emerge in the dynamics of chaotic quantum circuits and discuss the associated timescales.</description>
