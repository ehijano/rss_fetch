      <title>Computing the cohomology of line bundles on the incidence correspondence and related invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the package "IncidenceCorrespondenceCohomology" for the computer algebra system Macaulay2. The main feature concerns the computation of characters and dimensions for the cohomology groups of line bundles on the incidence correspondence (the partial flag variety parametrizing pairs consisting of a point in projective space and a hyperplane containing it). Additionally, the package provides tools for (1) computing the multiplication in the graded Han-Monsky representation ring, (2) determining the splitting type of vector bundles of principal parts on the projective line, and (3) testing the weak and strong Lefschetz properties for Artinian monomial complete intersections.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Fulton--MacPherson configuration spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using techniques in logarithmic geometry, we construct a logarithmic analogue of the Fulton--MacPherson configuration spaces. We similarly construct a logarithmically smooth degeneration of the Fulton--MacPherson configuration spaces. Both constructions parametrise point configurations on certain target degenerations arising from both logarithmic geometry and the original Fulton--MacPherson construction. The degeneration satisfies a "degeneration formula" -- each irreducible component of its special fibre can be described as a proper birational modification of a product of logarithmic Fulton--MacPherson configuration spaces.</description>

      <title>Higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants from projective bundles on smooth log Calabi-Yau pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,E)$ be a smooth log Calabi-Yau pair consisting of a smooth Fano surface $X$ and a smooth anticanonical divisor $E$. We obtain certain higher genus local Gromov-Witten invariants from the projectivization of the canonical bundle $Z := \mathbb{P}(K_X \oplus \mathcal{O}_X)$, using the degeneration formula for stable log maps [KLR]. We evaluate an invariant in the degeneration using the relationship between $q$-refined tropical curve counting and logarithmic Gromov-Witten theory with $\lambda_g$-insertion [Bou]. As a corollary, we use flops to prove a blow up formula for higher genus invariants of $Z$. Additionally assuming $X$ is toric, we prove an all genera correspondence between open invariants of an outer Aganagic-Vafa brane $L \subset K_X$ and closed invariants of $Z$ using the Topological Vertex [AKMV] and an argument in [GRZZ], that generalizes a genus-0 open-closed equality of [Cha] to all genera.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Perverse Subanalytic Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [arXiv:2109.13991], the author explained a relation between enhanced ind-sheaves and enhanced subanalytic sheaves. In particular, a relation between [Thm.9.5.3, Andrea D'Agnolo and Masaki Kashiwara, Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for holonomic $\mathcal{D}$-modules, 2016] and [Thm.6.3, Masaki Kashiwara, Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for irregular holonomic $\mathcal{D}$-modules, 2016] had been explained. Moreover, in [arXiv:2310.19501], the author defined $\mathbb{C}$-constructibility for enhanced subanalytic sheaves and proved that there exists an equivalence of categories between the triangulated category of holonomic $\mathcal{D}$-modules and that of $\mathbb{C}$-constructible enhanced subanalytic sheaves. In this paper, we will show that there exists a t-structure on the triangulated category of $\mathbb{C}$-constructible enhanced subanalytic sheaves whose heart is equivalent to the abelian category of holonomic $\mathcal{D}$-modules. Furthermore, we shall consider simple objects of its heart and minimal extensions of objects of its heart.</description>

      <title>Small extensions of analytic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extension $K/k$ of analytic (i.e. real valued complete) fields is called small if it is topologically-algebraically generated by finitely many elements. We prove that this property is inherited by subextensions and hence topological generating degree of such extensions is monotonic. Much more detailed results are obtained in the case of degree one. Let $k$ be an analytic algebraically closed field of positive residual characteristic $p$ and $K=\widehat{k(t)^a}$ with a non-trivial valuation. In a previous work it was shown that the set $I_{K/k}$ of intermediate complete algebraically closed subextensions $k\subseteq F\subseteq K$ is totally ordered by inclusion. In this paper we show that $I_{K/k}$ is an interval parameterized by the distance between $t$ and $F$. Moreover, logarithmic parameterizations induced by other generators differ by PL functions with slopes in $p^{\mathbb Z}$ and corners in $|K^\times|$, so $I_{K/k}$ acquires a natural PL structure.</description>

      <title>A Galois-Theoretic Complexity Measure for Solving Systems of Algebraic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications of algebraic geometry, we introduce the Galois width, a quantity characterizing the complexity of solving algebraic equations in a restricted model of computation allowing only field arithmetic and adjoining polynomial roots. We explain why practical heuristics such as monodromy give (at least) lower bounds on this quantity, and discuss problems in geometry, optimization, statistics, and computer vision for which knowledge of the Galois width either leads to improvements over standard solution techniques or rules out this possibility entirely.</description>

      <title>Weak Lefschetz property of equigenerated complete intersections. Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that any Artinian complete intersection homogeneous ideal $I$ in $K[x_0,\cdots,x_n]$ generated by $n+1$ forms of degree $d\ge 2$ satisfies the weak Lefschetz property (WLP) in degree $t&lt; d+\lceil \frac{d}{n} \rceil$. As a consequence, we get that the Jacobian ideal of a smooth 3-fold of degree $d\ge 7$ in ${\mathbb P}^4$ satisfies the weak Lefschetz property in degree $d$, answering a recent question of Beauville.</description>

      <title>Superisolated singularities and friends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superisolated surface singularities in $(\mathbb{C}^3,0)$ were introduced by I. Luengo to prove that the $\mu$-constant stratum may be singular. The main feature of this family is that it can bring information from the projective plane curves (global setting but smaller dimension) into surface singularities. They are simple enough to allow to retreive information and complicated enough to offer a variety of properties. The so-called L\^e-Yomdin singularities are a generalization which offers a wider catalog of examples. We study some properties of these singularities, mainly topological and related with the monodromy, and we introduce another family which exploits the same properties but in the quasi-homogeneous setting.</description>

      <title>On the relative Nullstellensatz in nonarchimedean geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a relative version of the Nullstellensatz for algebras topologically of finite type over a given Banach Tate ring $A$, under the assumption that the corresponding statement holds for rational localizations of $A$. This applies in particular to pseudoaffinoid algebras and to the coordinate rings of affinoid subspaces of a Fargues--Fontaine curve.</description>

      <title>Dream resolution and principalization I: enough derivations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a first paper in a project on extending the dream principalization and resolution methods of [ATW24], [McQ20] and [Que22] to quasi-excellent, logarithmic and relative settings. We show that the main results of [ATW24] extend to regular schemes with enough derivations and are functorial with respect to all regular morphisms. This is already strong enough to formally imply that the same results hold in other categories, such as complex and p-adic analytic spaces. Our method has many common points with that of [ATW24], but the accent is now shifted towards the study of weighted centers and their coordinate presentations. Not only we hope that this is a bit simpler and more conceptual, this method will be easily applied in the logarithmic and relative settings in the sequel.</description>

      <title>Hilbert scheme of smooth curves of degree sixteen in $\mathbb{P}^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We denote by $\mathcal{H}_{d,g,r}$ the Hilbert scheme of smooth curves, which is the union of components whose general point corresponds to a smooth irreducible and non-degenerate curve of degree $d$ and genus $g$ in $\mathbb{P}^r$. In this article, we study $\mathcal{H}_{16,g,5}$ for almost every possible genus $g$ and chasing after its irreducibility. We also study the natural moduli map $\mathcal{H}_{d,g,5}\stackrel{\mu}{\to}\mathcal{M}_g$ and several key properties such as gonality of a general element as well as characterizing smooth elements in each component.</description>

      <title>Discriminants and motivic integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study invariants of a plane cuve singularity $(f,0)$ coming from motivic integration on symmetric powers of a formal deformation of $f$. We show that a natural discriminant integral recovers the motivic classes of the principal Hilbert schemes of points on $f$, while the orbifold integral gives the plethystic exponential of the motivic Igusa zeta function of $f$. The latter result also holds in higher dimemsions.
  Combined with results of Gorsky and N\'emethi we obtain an interpretation of the discriminant integrals in terms of knot Floer homology, which is reminiscent of the relation between the cohomology of contact loci and fixed point Floer homology proven by de la Bodega and Poza.</description>

      <title>Valuative compactifications of analytic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an algebraic variety over $\mathbf{C}$. We define a canonical compactification $X^{\!\urcorner}$ of the complex analytic space $X(\mathbf{C})$ by adding a Berkovich space over a trivially valued field at the boundary. The construction is functorial with respect to proper morphisms and preserves many properties, such as normality, regularity, etc. We prove a partial GAGA theorem in this setting : there is an equivalence between the categories of coherent sheaves on $X$ and $X^{\!\urcorner}$, and it induces bijections on global sections. The results still hold if $\mathbf{C}$ is replaced by a complete non-trivially valued field $k$, and complex analytic spaces by Berkovich analytic spaces over $k$.</description>

      <title>Smoothings from zero mutable Laurent polynomials via log resolutions and divisorial extractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conjecture by Corti, Filip and Petracci, inspired by mirror symmetry, states that smoothing types of affine Gorenstein toric 3-folds correspond to zero mutable Laurent polynomials. We propose a method to prove this conjecture via log crepant log resolutions constructed from compatible collections of divisorial extractions. For affine cones over weighted projective planes we prove for several infinite families of zero mutable Laurent polynomials that they indeed describe curves that admit a compatible collection of divisorial extractions. The construction of log crepant log resolutions and smoothings will be worked out in joint work with Alessio Corti and Helge Ruddat.</description>

      <title>The Pro-\'Etale Homotopy Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we define the pro-\'etale homotopy type of a scheme and prove some of its expected properties. Our definition is similar to the definition of the \'etale homotopy type by Michael Artin and Barry Mazur. We prove that for a qcqs scheme the pro-\'etale homotopy type is profinite, determined by a single split affine weakly contractible hypercovering and computes the cohomology of a certain class of sheaves. We show that the pro-\'etale homotopy type of a w-contractible scheme is trivial and compute the pro-\'etale homotopy type of the real numbers. Moreover, we prove that a suitable version of $\pi_0$ composed with the pro-\'etale homotopy type gives back the space of components of the base scheme. We make some progress towards describing the pro-\'etale homotopy type of arbitrary fields. Lastly, we give a refined definition of the pro-\'etale homotopy type using the theory by Ilan Barnea and Tomer M. Schlank and the theory of condensed sets by Dustin Clausen and Peter Scholze. This allows us to define pro-\'etale homotopy groups associated to pointed qcqs schemes.</description>

      <title>A Brill-Noether Theorem for (toric) surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Brill-Noether theorem states that a map from a general curve to a projective space deforms in a family of expected dimension as long as its image does not lie in any hyperplane. In this note, we observe, as a direct consequence of standard results on Severi varieties, an analogous statement for maps from a general curve to any smooth, projective surface. Namely, a non-constant map deforms in a family of expected dimension as long as its image has anti-canonical degree at least 4.
  In the case of toric surfaces, curves of anti-canonical degree at most 3 admit a particularly elegant description in terms certain toric contractions. We raise the question of whether a Brill-Noether theorem could hold for toric varieties of higher dimension.</description>

Abstract: We study linear operators preserving the property of being a volume polynomial. More, precisely we show that a linear operator preserves this property if the associated symbol is itself a volume polynomial. This can be seen as an analogue to theorems by Borcea-Br\"and\'en and Br\"and\'en-Huh for stable polynomials and Lorentzian polynomials, respectively.</description>

      <title>Stability for complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations with an application to singular Ricci-flat metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first establish the weak stability results for solutions of complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations in relative full mass classes, extending the results known to hold in the full mass class. Building on weak stability, we then prove the $\mathcal{C}^{k,\alpha}$ stability of solutions to complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations on quasi-projective varieties. As an application, we study the limit of the singular Ricci-flat metrics on $\mathbb{Q}$-Calabi-Yau projective varieties, inspired by Tosatti's work on Calabi-Yau projective manifolds.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck Duality theories -- abstract and concrete, I: pseudo-coherent finite maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.09372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grothendieck Duality -- the theory of the twisted inverse image pseudofunctor (-)^! over a suitable category of scheme-maps -- can be developed concretely, with emphasis on explicit constructions, or abstractly, with emphasis on category-theoretic considerations. It is not obvious that the two resulting theories are essentially the same. This is a semi-expository account of the connection between these approaches, a nontrivial matter involving some alluring relations, for instance among differential forms, residues and duality. In particular, it emerges that the culminating Ideal Theorem in Hartshorne's "Residues and Duality" holds for arbitrary essentially-finite-type maps of noetherian schemes and bounded-below complexes with quasi-coherent cohomology. What appears in this first part mostly concerns pseudo-coherent finite maps. The rest is being prepared.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.15977v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the gonality and the dimension of the Brill-Noether loci $W^1_d(C)$ for curves in a non primitive linear system of a simple abelian surface, adapting vector bundles techniques \`a la Lazarsfeld originally introduced with $K3$ surfaces. As a corollary, we obtain general Green's conjecture for curves on abelian surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05911v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for sampling points from an algebraic manifold, either affine or projective, defined over a local field, with a prescribed probability distribution. Inspired by the work of Breiding and Marigliano on sampling real algebraic manifolds, our approach leverages slicing the given variety with random linear spaces of complementary dimension. We also provide an implementation of this sampling technique and demonstrate its applicability to various contexts, including sampling from linear $p$-adic algebraic groups, abelian varieties, and modular curves.</description>

      <title>Theta characteristics and the fixed locus of [-1] on some varieties of Kummer type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study some combinatorial aspects of the fixed loci of symplectic involutions acting on hyperk\"ahler varieties of Kummer type. Given an abelian surface $A$ with a $(1,d)$-polarization $L$, there is an isomorphism $K_{d-1}A\cong K_{\hat{A}}(0,\hat{l},-1)$ between a hyperk\"ahler of Kummer type that parametrizes length-$d$ subschemes of $A$ and one that parametrizes degree $d-1$ line bundles supported on curves in $|\hat{L}|$, where $\hat{L}$ is the dual $(1,d)$-polarization on $\hat{A}$. We examine the bijection this isomorphism gives between isolated points in the fixed loci of $[-1_A]$ when $d$ is odd, which has a combinatorics related to theta characteristics. Along the way, we give a table of numerical values for a formula of Kamenova, Mongardi, and Oblomkov counting the number of components of a symplectic involution acting on a Kummer-type variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to explain how basic properties of perverse sheaves sometimes translate via Riemann-Hilbert correspondences (in both characteristic $0$ and characteristic $p$) to highly non-trivial properties of singularities, especially their local cohomology. Along the way, we develop a theory of perverse $\mathbf{F}_p$-sheaves on varieties in characteristic $p$, expanding on previous work by various authors, and including a strong version of the Artin vanishing theorem.</description>

      <title>Chevalley formulae for the motivic Chern classes of Schubert cells and for the stable envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17200v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Chevalley formula to multiply the motivic Chern classes of Schubert cells in a generalized flag manifold $G/P$ by the class of any line bundle $\mathcal{L}_\lambda$. Our formula is given in terms of the $\lambda$-chains of Lenart and Postnikov. Its proof relies on a change of basis formula in the affine Hecke algebra due to Ram, and on the Hecke algebra action on torus-equivariant K-theory of the complete flag manifold $G/B$ via left Demazure--Lusztig operators. We revisit some wall-crossing formulae for the stable envelopes in $T^*(G/B)$. We use our Chevalley formula, and the equivalence between motivic Chern classes of Schubert cells and K-theoretic stable envelopes in $T^*(G/B)$, to give formulae for the change of polarization, and for the change of slope for stable envelopes. We prove several additional applications, including Serre, star, and Dynkin, dualities of the Chevalley coefficients, new formulae for the Whittaker functions, and for the Hall--Littlewood polynomials. We also discuss positivity properties of Chevalley coefficients, and properties of the coefficients arising from multiplication by minuscule weights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ be an algebraically closed perfectoid field over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ with the ring of integer $\mathcal{O}_C$ and the infinitesimal thickening $\Ainf$. Let $\mathfrak X$ be a semi-stable formal scheme over $\mathcal{O}_C$ with a fixed flat lifting $\widetilde{\mathfrak X}$ over $\Ainf$. Let $X$ be the generic fiber of $\mathfrak{X}$ and $\widetilde X$ be its lifting over $\BdRp$ induced by $\widetilde{\mathfrak X}$. Let $\MIC_r(\widetilde X)^{{\rm H}\text{-small}}$ and $\rL\rS_r(X,\BBdRp)^{{\rm H}\text{-small}}$ be the $v$-stacks of rank-$r$ Hitchin-small integrable connections on $X_{\et}$ and $\BBdRp$-local systems on $X_{v}$, respectively. In this paper, we establish an equivalence between these two stacks by introducing a new period sheaf with connection $(\calO\bB_{\dR,\pd}^+,\rd)$ on $X_{v}$.</description>

      <title>Algorithm for motivic Hilbert zeta function of some curve singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for computing the motivic Hilbert zeta function for curve singularities with a monomial valuation group or for singular curves defined by $y^{k}=x^{n}$, where $gcd(k,n)=1$. It is well known that the Hilbert scheme of points on a smooth curve is isomorphic to the symmetric product of the curve. However, the geometrical structure of Hilbert scheme of points on singular curves remains less understood. The algorithm we propose computes the motivic Hilbert zeta function, $Z_{(C,O)}^{Hilb}(q)\in K_{0}(Var_{\mathbb{C}})[[q]]$, for such curve singularities. This function is represented as a series with coefficients in the Grothendieck ring of varieties over $\mathbb{C}$.
  The main computational challenge arises from the infinity of $\Gamma$. To address this, we approximate $\Gamma$ by truncating it to a finite subset to allow effective algorithm operation. We also analyze the time complexity and estimate the range of the effective finite length of $\Gamma$ necessary for reliable results. The Python implementation of our algorithm is available at https://github.com/whaozhu/motivic_hilbert.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.13634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if $p&gt;d$ there is a unique gaussian distribution (in the sense of Evans) on the space $\mathbb{Q}_p[x_1, \ldots, x_n]_{(d)}$ which is invariant under the action of $\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb{Z}_p)$ by change of variables. This gives the nonarchimedean counterpart of Kostlan's Theorem on the classification of orthogonally (respectively unitarily) invariant gaussian measures on the space $\mathbb{R}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]_{(d)}$ (respectively $\mathbb{C}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]_{(d)}$). More generally, if $V$ is an $n$--dimensional vector space over a nonarchimedean local field $K$ with ring of integers $R$, and if $\lambda$ is a partition of an integer $d$, we study the problem of determining the invariant lattices in the Schur module $S_\lambda(V)$ under the action of the group $\mathrm{GL}(n,R)$.</description>

We examine the canonical metrics obtained by the Delzant construction on these varieties and characterise cases when the bound is attained. We comment on computational tools used in the investigation, in particular Neural Networks and the gradient saliency method.</description>

Abstract: We establish an intriguing relation of the smooth theta divisor $\Theta^n$ with permutohedron $\Pi^n$ and the corresponding toric variety $X_\Pi^n.$ In particular, we show that the generalised Todd genus of the theta divisor $\Theta^n$ coincides with $h$-polynomial of permutohedron $\Pi^n$ and thus is different from the same genus of $X_\Pi^n$ only by the sign $(-1)^n.$ As an application we find all the Hodge numbers of the theta divisors in terms of the Eulerian numbers. We reveal also interesting numerical relations between theta-divisors and Tomei manifolds from the theory of the integrable Toda lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03941v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A smooth cuboid can be identified with a $3\times 3$ matrix of linear forms, with coefficients in a field $K$, whose determinant describes a smooth cubic in the projective plane. To each such matrix one can associate a group scheme over $K$. We produce isomorphism invariants of these groups in terms of their adjoint algebras, which also give information on the number of their maximal abelian subgroups. Moreover, we give a characterization of the isomorphism types of the groups in terms of isomorphisms of elliptic curves and also give a description of the automorphism group. We conclude by applying our results to the determination of the automorphism groups and isomorphism testing of finite $p$-groups of class $2$ and exponent $p$ arising in this way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define Hochschild cohomology of the second kind for differential graded (dg) or curved algebras as a derived functor in a compactly generated derived category of the second kind, and show that it is invariant under Morita equivalence of the second kind. A bimodule version of Koszul duality is constructed and used to show that Hochschild cohomology of the second kind is preserved under (nonconilpotent) Koszul duality. We show that Hochschild cohomology of the second kind of an algebra often computes the ordinary Hochschild cohomology of geometrically meaningful dg categories. Examples include the category of infinity local systems on a topological space, the bounded derived category of a complex algebraic manifold and the category of matrix factorizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07015v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two families of $g$-dimensional abelian varieties, induced by distinct rational maps defined on a common variety $\overline{\mathcal A}$ and mapping to two bases $\overline{S}_1$ and $\overline{S}_2$. Two non-torsion sections induce birational fiberwise translations on $\overline{\mathcal A}$. We consider the action of a specific subset of the group generated by these translations. Under the assumption that $\operatorname{dim} \overline{S}_1 (= \operatorname{dim} \overline{S}_2) \leq g$, we prove that the points with finite orbit are contained in a proper Zariski closed subset. This subset is explicitly described to a certain extent. Our results generalize a theorem of Corvaja, Tsimermann, and Zannier to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Pinched theorem and the reverse Yau's inequalities for compact K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a compact K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifold $M$ of dimension $n\ge 2$, we explicitly write the expression $-c_1^n(M)+\frac{2(n+1)}{n}c_2(M)c_1^{n-2}(M)$ in the form of certain integral on the holomorphic sectional curvature and its average at a fixed point in $M$ using the invariant theory. As applications, we get a reverse Yau's inequality and improve the classical $\frac{1}{4}$-pinched theorem and negative $\frac{1}{4}$-pinched theorem for compact K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifolds to smaller pinching constant depending only on the dimension and the first Chern class of $M$. If $M$ is not with positive or negative holomorphic sectional curvature, then there exists a point $x\in M$ such that the average of the holomorphic sectional curvature at $x$ vanishes. In particular, we characterise the $2$-dimensional complex torus by certain curvature condition. Moreover, we confirm Yau's conjecture for positive holomorphic sectional curvature and Siu-Yang's conjecture for negative holomorphic sectional curvature even for higher dimensions if the absolute value of the holomorphic sectional curvature is small enough. Finally, using the reverse Yau's inequality, we can judge if a projective manifold doesn't carry any hermitian metric with negative holomorphic sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>Locally recoverable algebro-geometric codes from projective bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A code is locally recoverable when each symbol in one of its code words can be reconstructed as a function of $r$ other symbols. We use bundles of projective spaces over a line to construct locally recoverable codes with availability; that is, evaluation codes where each code word symbol can be reconstructed from several disjoint sets of other symbols. The simplest case, where the code's underlying variety is a plane, exhibits noteworthy properties: When $r = 1$, $2$, $3$, they are optimal; when $r \geq 4$, they are optimal with probability approaching $1$ as the alphabet size grows. Additionally, their information rate is close to the theoretical limit. In higher dimensions, our codes form a family of asymptotically good codes.</description>

      <title>Relating flat connections and polylogarithms on higher genus Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we relate two recent constructions that generalize classical (genus-zero) polylogarithms to higher-genus Riemann surfaces. A flat connection valued in a freely generated Lie algebra on a punctured Riemann surface of arbitrary genus produces an infinite family of homotopy-invariant iterated integrals associated to all possible words in the alphabet of the Lie algebra generators. Each iterated integral associated to a word is a higher-genus polylogarithm. Different flat connections taking values in the same Lie algebra on a given Riemann surface may be related to one another by the composition of a gauge transformation and an automorphism of the Lie algebra, thus producing closely related families of polylogarithms. In this paper we provide two methods to explicitly construct this correspondence between the meromorphic multiple-valued connection introduced by Enriquez in e-Print 1112.0864 and the non-meromorphic single-valued and modular-invariant connection introduced by D'Hoker, Hidding and Schlotterer, in e-Print 2306.08644.</description>

      <title>Higher local systems and the categorified monodromy equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study local systems of $(\infty,n)$-categories on spaces. We prove that categorical local systems are captured by (higher) monodromy data: in particular, if $X$ is $(n+1)$-connected, then local systems of $(\infty,n)$-categories over $X$ can be described as $\mathbb{E}_{n+1}$-modules over the iterated loop space $\Omega_{n+1}X$. This generalizes the classical monodromy equivalence presenting ordinary local systems as modules over the based loop spaces. Along the way we revisit from the perspective of $\infty$-categories Teleman's influential theory of topological group actions on categories, and we extend it to topological actions on $(\infty,n)$-categories. Finally, we show that the group of invertible objects in the category of local systems of $(\infty,n)$-categories over an $n$-connected space $X$ is isomorphic to the group of characters of $\pi_n(X)$. This should be thought of as a topological analogue of the higher Brauer group of the space $X$. We conclude the paper with applications of the theory of categorical local systems to the fiberwise Fukaya category of symplectic fibrations.</description>
