      <title>Scaling Properties of Avalanche Activity in the Two-Dimensional Abelian Sandpile Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling properties of avalanche activity in the two-dimensional Abelian sandpile model. Instead of the conventional avalanche size distribution, we analyze the site activity distribution, which measures how often a site participates in avalanches when grains are added across the lattice. Using numerical simulations for system sizes up to \(L = 160\), averaged over \(10^4\) configurations, we determine the probability distribution \(P(A, L)\) of site activities. The results show that \(P(A, L)\) follows a finite-size scaling form \[ P(A, L) \sim L^{-2} F\Big(\frac{A}{L^2}\Big). \] For small values \(A \ll L^2\) the scaling function behaves as \[ F(u) \sim u^{-1/2}, \quad \text{corresponding to} \quad P(A) \sim \frac{1}{L}, \] while for large activities \(A \sim O(L^2)\) the distribution decays as \[ F(u) \sim \exp\big(-c_3 u - c_4 u^2\big). \] The crossover between these two regimes occurs at \[ A^* \sim 0.1 \, L^2, \] marking the threshold between typical and highly excitable sites. This characterization of local avalanche activity provides complementary information to the usual avalanche size statistics, highlighting how local regions serve as frequent conduits for critical dynamics. These results may help connect sandpile models to real-world self-organized critical systems where only partial local activity can be observed.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Cellular Automata for Real-Time Wildfire Spread Modeling in California</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent and devastating, and therefore the technology to combat them must adapt accordingly. Modern predictive models have failed to balance predictive accuracy and operational viability, resulting in consistently delayed or misinformed fire suppression and public safety efforts. The present study addresses this gap by developing and validating a predictive model based on cellular automata (CA) that incorporates key environmental variables, including vegetation density (NDVI), wind speed and direction, and topographic slope derived from open-access datasets. The presented CA framework offers a lightweight alternative to data-heavy approaches that fail in emergency contexts. Evaluation of the model using a confusion matrix against burn scars from the 2025 Pacific Palisades Fire yielded a recall of 0.860, a precision of 0.605, and an overall F1 score of 0.711 after 50 parameter optimization trials, with each simulation taking an average of 1.22 seconds. CA-based models can bridge the gap between accuracy and applicability, successfully guiding public safety and fire suppression efforts.</description>

      <title>Squeezing codes: robust fluctuation-stabilized memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce families of classical stochastic dynamics in two and higher dimensions which stabilize order in the absence of any symmetry. Our dynamics are qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, and have the unusual feature of being fluctuation-stabilized: their order becomes increasingly fragile in larger dimensions. One of our models maintains an ordered phase only in two dimensions. The phase transitions that occur as the order is lost realize new dynamical universality classes which are fundamentally non-equilibrium in character.</description>

      <title>Local active error correction from simulated confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. We prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in the linear system size $L$, provided that it has access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each noisy qubit. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.</description>
