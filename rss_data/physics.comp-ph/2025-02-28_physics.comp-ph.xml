      <title>Mixed Finite Element Analysis of Flexoelectric Response: Exploring Unit Cell Stacking and Strain Gradient Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity, a coupling between strain gradients and electric polarization, has attracted significant interest due to its critical role in enhanced effects at small scales and its applicability across a diverse range of materials. Modeling flexoelectricity is challenging, especially in 3D, due to the higher-order equations involved, which require continuity conditions that limit the use of standard finite element methods. This study employs a modified mixed finite element formulation, specifically designed to account for spurious oscillations that can hinder convergence, particularly in large-scale problems solved with iterative solvers. A numerical analysis has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of stacking individual flexoelectric unit cells to achieve an enhanced overall flexoelectric response. The study also seeks to determine the feasibility of locally modifying the strain gradient to induce localized enhancements in the flexoelectric effect.</description>

      <title>A finite element approach for modelling the fracture behaviour of unidirectional FFF-printed parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a finite element modelling approach for unidirectional Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)-printed specimens under tensile loading. In this study, the focus is on the fracture behaviour, the goal is to simulate the mechanical behaviour of specimens with different strand orientations until final failure of the specimens. In particular, the aim is to represent experimentally observed failure modes for different print orientations and the typical dependence of the parts strength on the print orientation. We investigate several modelling aspects like the choice of a suitable failure criterion, a suitable way to represent fracture in the finite element mesh or the necessary level of detail when modelling the characteristic edges of FFF-printed specimens. As a result, this work provides an approach to model FFF printed specimens in finite element simulations, which can represent the characteristic relation between mesostructural layout and macroscopic fracture behaviour.</description>

      <title>Efficient solution strategy to couple micromagnetic simulations with ballistic transport in magnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computationally efficient strategy that allows to simulate magnetization switching driven by spin-transfer torque in magnetic tunnel junctions within a micromagnetic model coupled with a matrix-based non-equilibrium Green's function algorithm. Exemplary simulation for a realistic set of parameters are carried out and show switching times below 4 ns for voltages above 300 mV or around 2*10^{10} A m^{-2} for the P to AP (parallel to anti-parallel) direction. For AP to P switching, a trend-reversal in the switching time is seen i.e. the time for magnetization reversal first decreases with increasing bias voltage but then starts to rise again.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity Multiphysics Modelling for Rapid Predictions Using Physics-informed Parallel Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling complex multiphysics systems governed by nonlinear and strongly coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) is a cornerstone in computational science and engineering. However, it remains a formidable challenge for traditional numerical solvers due to high computational cost, making them impractical for large-scale applications. Neural operators' reliance on data-driven training limits their applicability in real-world scenarios, as data is often scarce or expensive to obtain. Here, we propose a novel paradigm, physics-informed parallel neural operator (PIPNO), a scalable and unsupervised learning framework that enables data-free PDE modelling by leveraging only governing physical laws. The parallel kernel integration design, incorporating ensemble learning, significantly enhances both compatibility and computational efficiency, enabling scalable operator learning for nonlinear and strongly coupled PDEs. PIPNO efficiently captures nonlinear operator mappings across diverse physics, including geotechnical engineering, material science, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and fluid dynamics. The proposed method achieves high-fidelity and rapid predictions, outperforming existing operator learning approaches in modelling nonlinear and strongly coupled multiphysics systems. Therefore, PIPNO offers a powerful alternative to conventional solvers, broadening the applicability of neural operators for multiphysics modelling while ensuring efficiency, robustness, and scalability.</description>

      <title>Computation of Magnetohydrodynamic Equilibria with Voigt Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first numerical investigation of using Voigt regularization as a method for obtaining magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria without the assumption of nested magnetic flux surfaces. Voigt regularization modifies the MHD dynamics by introducing additional terms that vanish in the infinite-time limit, allowing for magnetic reconnection and the formation of magnetic islands, which can overlap and produce field-line chaos. The utility of this approach is demonstrated through numerical solutions of two-dimensional ideal and resistive test problems. Our results show that Voigt regularization can significantly accelerate the convergence to solutions in resistive MHD problems, while also highlighting challenges in applying the method to ideal MHD systems. This research opens up new possibilities for developing more efficient and robust MHD equilibrium solvers, which could contribute to the design and optimization of future fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Mapping: Revolutionizing Predictive Models for Divertor Plasma Detachment Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent complexity of boundary plasma, characterized by multi-scale and multi-physics challenges, has historically restricted high-fidelity simulations to scientific research due to their intensive computational demands. Consequently, routine applications such as discharge control and scenario development have relied on faster, but less accurate empirical methods. This work introduces DivControlNN, a novel machine-learning-based surrogate model designed to address these limitations by enabling quasi-real-time predictions (i.e., $\sim0.2$ ms) of boundary and divertor plasma behavior. Trained on over 70,000 2D UEDGE simulations from KSTAR tokamak equilibria, DivControlNN employs latent space mapping to efficiently represent complex divertor plasma states, achieving a computational speed-up of over $10^8$ compared to traditional simulations while maintaining a relative error below 20% for key plasma property predictions. During the 2024 KSTAR experimental campaign, a prototype detachment control system powered by DivControlNN successfully demonstrated detachment control on its first attempt, even for a new tungsten divertor configuration and without any fine-tuning. These results highlight the transformative potential of DivControlNN in overcoming diagnostic challenges in future fusion reactors by providing fast, robust, and reliable predictions for advanced integrated control systems.</description>

      <title>A curvilinear surface ALE formulation for self-evolving Navier-Stokes manifolds -- General theory and analytical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation for Navier-Stokes flow on self-evolving surfaces is presented. It is based on a new curvilinear surface parameterization that describes the motion of the ALE frame. Its in-plane part becomes fully arbitrary, while its out-of-plane part follows the material motion of the surface. This allows for the description of flows on deforming surfaces using only surface meshes. The unknown fields are the fluid density or pressure, the fluid velocity and the surface motion, where the latter two share the same normal velocity. The corresponding field equations are the continuity equation or area-incompressibility constraint, the surface Navier-Stokes equations, and suitable surface mesh equations. The presentation focuses on their strong and weak forms, and presents several manufactured steady and transient solutions. These solutions are used to illustrate and discuss the properties of the proposed new ALE formulation. They also serve as basis for the development and verification of corresponding computational methods. The new formulation allows for a detailed study of fluidic membranes such as soap films, capillary menisci and lipid bilayers.</description>

      <title>Half-Metallic Fe/MgO Superlattice: An Ideal Candidate for Magnetic Tunnel Junction Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) based Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) is poised to replace embedded Flash for advanced applications such as automotive microcontroller units. To achieve deeper technological adoption, MTJ needs to exhibit three key features: low magnetization (Ms), high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and high tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR). Here, we theoretically show that when Fe/MgO multilayers are inserted into the fixed and free layers of the MTJ, these three conditions are simultaneously met. As the number of Fe/MgO multilayers in MTJ electrodes is increased, we find that the electron transport evolves from direct barrier tunneling of majority spin states to the resonant tunneling of minority spin states. Remarkably, the projected density of states (PDOS) of Fe/MgO superlattice at the MgO tunnel barrier exhibits half-metallicity near the Fermi Energy, where the minority states exist while the majority states are gapped out, resulting in astronomically high TMR.</description>

      <title>Neural operator-based super-fidelity: A warm-start approach for accelerating steady-state simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the use of neural networks to accelerate the solving of partial differential equations (PDEs) has gained significant traction in both academia and industry. However, employing neural networks as standalone surrogate models raises concerns about solution reliability, especially in precision-critical scientific tasks. This study introduces a novel "super-fidelity" method that leverages neural networks for warm-starting steady-state PDE solvers, ensuring both efficiency and accuracy. Inspired by super-resolution techniques in computer vision, this method maps low-fidelity solutions to high-fidelity targets using a vector-cloud neural network with equivariance (VCNN-e), a neural operator that preserves all necessary invariance and equivariance properties for scalar and vector predictions while seamlessly adapting to different spatial discretizations. We evaluated this approach in three scenarios: (1) a weakly nonlinear case involving low Reynolds number flows around elliptical cylinders, (2) a strongly nonlinear case with high Reynolds number flows over airfoils, and (3) a practical case with high Reynolds number flows over a wing. In all cases, the neural operator-based initialization accelerated convergence by at least two-fold compared to traditional methods, without sacrificing accuracy. The method's robustness and scalability are further demonstrated across different linear equation solvers and multi-process computing configurations. It also achieves overall time savings in scenarios with multiple simulations, even when accounting for model development time. Overall, our approach provides an effective means to accelerate steady-state PDE solutions using neural operators, maintaining high accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency, particularly in precision-driven scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs): Combining Accuracy and Interpretability in Data-Driven Material Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid constitutive modeling integrates two complementary approaches for describing and predicting a material's mechanical behavior: purely data-driven black-box methods and physically constrained, theory-based models. While black-box methods offer high accuracy, they often lack interpretability and extrapolability. Conversely, physics-based models provide theoretical insight and generalizability but may not capture complex behaviors with the same accuracy. Traditionally, hybrid modeling has required a trade-off between these aspects. In this paper, we show how recent advances in symbolic machine learning, specifically Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), help to overcome this limitation. We introduce Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs) as a new class of hybrid constitutive models. By incorporating a post-processing symbolification step, CKANs combine the predictive accuracy of data-driven models with the interpretability and extrapolation capabilities of symbolic expressions, bridging the gap between machine learning and physical modeling.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo simulation framework for investigating the effect of inter-track coupling on H$_2$O$_2$ productions at ultra-high dose rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Lower production of H$_2$O$_2$ in water is a hallmark of ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) compared to the conventional dose rate (CDR). However, the current computational models based on the predicted yield of H$_2$O$_2$ are in opposite of the experimental data. Methods: We construct an analytical model for the rate equation in the production of H$_2$O$_2$ from \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals and use it as a guide to propose a hypothetical geometrical inhomogeneity in the configuration of particles in the FLASH-UHDR beams. We perform a series of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the track structures for a system of charged particles impinging the medium in the form of clusters and/or bunches. Results: We demonstrate the interplay of diffusion, reaction rates, and overlaps in track-spacing attribute to a lower yield of H$_2$O$_2$ at FLASH-UHDR vs. CDR. This trend is reversed if spacing among the tracks becomes larger than a critical value, with a length scale that is proportional to the diffusion length of \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals modulated by a rate of decay due to recombination with other species, available within a track, and the space among the tracks. The latter is substantial on the suppressing of the H$_2$O$_2$ population at FLASH-UHDR relative to CDR. Conclusions: Based on our analysis of the present work, at FLASH-UHDR, the lower yield in H$_2$O$_2$ can be interpreted as a signature of bunching the particles in beams of ionizing radiation. The beams enter the medium in closely packed clusters and form inhomogeneities in the track-structure distribution. Thus the MC simulations based on the assumption of uniformly distributed tracks are unable to explain the experimental data.</description>

      <title>eTraj.jl: Trajectory-Based Simulation for Strong-Field Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of light-matter interactions in the realm of strong-field ionization has been a focal point and has attracted widespread interest. We present the eTraj.jl program package, designed to implement established classical/semiclassical trajectory-based methods to determine the photoelectron momentum distribution resulting from strong-field ionization of both atoms and molecules. The program operates within a unified theoretical framework that separates the trajectory-based computation into two stages: initial-condition preparation and trajectory evolution. For initial-condition preparation, we provide several methods, including the Strong-Field Approximation with Saddle-Point Approximation (SFA-SPA), SFA-SPA with Non-adiabatic Expansion (SFA-SPANE), and the Ammosov-Delone-Krainov theory (ADK), with atomic and molecular variants, as well as the Weak-Field Asymptotic Theory (WFAT) for molecules. For trajectory evolution, available options are Classical Trajectory Monte-Carlo (CTMC), which employs purely classical electron trajectories, and the Quantum Trajectory Monte-Carlo (QTMC) and Semi-Classical Two-Step model (SCTS), which include the quantum phase during trajectory evolution. The program is a versatile, efficient, flexible, and out-of-the-box solution for trajectory-based simulations for strong-field ionization. It is designed with user-friendliness in mind and is expected to serve as a valuable and powerful tool for the community of strong-field physics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing creep resistance in refractory high-entropy alloys: role of grain size and local chemical order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00588v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are a promising class of materials with potential applications in extreme environments, where the dominant failure mode is thermal creep. The design of these alloys, therefore, requires an understanding of how their microstructure and local chemical distribution affect creep behavior. In this study, we performed high-fidelity atomistic simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials to explore the creep deformation of MoNbTaW RHEAs under a wide range of stress and temperature conditions. We parametrized grain size and local chemical order (LCO) to investigate the effects of these two important design variables, which are controllable during the alloy fabrication process. Our investigation revealed that resistance to creep deformation is enhanced by larger grain sizes and higher levels of LCO. This study highlights the importance of utilizing LCO in conjunction with other microstructural properties when designing RHEAs for extreme environment applications.</description>

      <title>Solving Crystal Structures by Carrying Out the Calculation of the Single-Atom R1 Method in a Lottery Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As originally designed [Zhang &amp; Donahue (2024), Acta Cryst. A80, 2370248.], after one cycle of calculation, the single-atom R1 (sR1) method required a user to intelligently determine a partial structure to start the next cycle. In this paper, a lottery scheme has been designed to randomly split a parent model into two child models. This allows the calculation to be carried out in care-free manner. By chance, one child model may have higher amounts of "good" atoms than the parent model. Thus, its expansion in the next cycle favors an improved model. These "lucky" results are carried onto the next cycles. while "unlucky" results in which no improvements occur are discarded. Furthermore, unchanged models are carried onto the next cycles in those "unlucky" occasions. On average a child model has the same fraction of "good" atoms as the parent. Only a substantial statistical fluctuation results in appreciable deviation. This lottery scheme works because such fluctuations do happen. Indeed, test applications with the computing power accessibly by the author have demonstrated that the designed scheme can drive an sR1 calculation to or close to reaching a correct structure solution.</description>
