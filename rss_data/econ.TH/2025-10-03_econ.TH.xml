      <title>Persuasion in Lemons Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study information disclosure in competitive markets with adverse selection. Sellers privately observe product quality, with higher quality entailing higher production costs, while buyers trade at the market-clearing price after observing a public signal. Because sellers' participation in trade conveys information about quality, the designer faces endogenous constraints in the set of posteriors that she can induce. We reformulate the designer's problem as a martingale optimal transport exercise with an additional condition that rules out further information transmission through sellers' participation decisions, and characterize the optimal signals. When the designer maximizes trade volume, the solution features negative-assortative matching of inefficient and efficient sellers. When the objective is a weighted combination of price and surplus, optimal signals preserve this structure as long as the weight on the price is high enough, otherwise they fully reveal low-quality types while pooling middle types with high-quality sellers.</description>

      <title>Learning to Play Multi-Follower Bayesian Stackelberg Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a multi-follower Bayesian Stackelberg game, a leader plays a mixed strategy over $L$ actions to which $n\ge 1$ followers, each having one of $K$ possible private types, best respond. The leader's optimal strategy depends on the distribution of the followers' private types. We study an online learning version of this problem: a leader interacts for $T$ rounds with $n$ followers with types sampled from an unknown distribution every round. The leader's goal is to minimize regret, defined as the difference between the cumulative utility of the optimal strategy and that of the actually chosen strategies. We design learning algorithms for the leader under different feedback settings. Under type feedback, where the leader observes the followers' types after each round, we design algorithms that achieve $\mathcal O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), nK \} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for independent type distributions and $\mathcal O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), K^n \} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for general type distributions. Interestingly, those bounds do not grow with $n$ at a polynomial rate. Under action feedback, where the leader only observes the followers' actions, we design algorithms with $\mathcal O( \min\{\sqrt{ n^L K^L A^{2L} L T \log T}, K^n\sqrt{ T } \log T \} )$ regret. We also provide a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{\min\{L, nK\}T})$, almost matching the type-feedback upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Desirable Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of aggregating individual preferences over alternatives into a social ranking. A key feature of the problems that we consider - and the one that allows us to obtain positive results, in contrast to negative results such as Arrow's Impossibililty Theorem - is that the alternatives to be ranked are outcomes of a competitive process. Examples include rankings of colleges or academic journals. The foundation of our ranking method is that alternatives that agents rank higher than the one they receive (and thus have been rejected by) should also be ranked higher in the aggregate ranking. We introduce axioms to formalize this idea, and call any ranking that satisfies our axioms a desirable ranking. We show that as the market grows large, any desirable ranking coincides with the true underlying ranking of colleges by quality. Last, we provide an algorithm for constructing desirable rankings, and show that the outcome of this algorithm is the unique ranking of the colleges that satisfy our axioms.</description>

      <title>Robust Regulation of Firms' Access to Consumer Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05822v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study how to regulate firms' access to consumer data when a regulator faces non-Bayesian uncertainty about how firms will exploit the consumer's information to segment the market and set prices. I fully characterize all worst-case optimal policies when the regulator maximizes consumer surplus: the regulator allows a firm to access data only if the firm cannot use the database to identify a small group of consumers.</description>

      <title>Voting with Random Proposers: Two Rounds May Suffice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Voting with Random Proposers (VRP) procedure to address the challenges of agenda manipulation in voting. In each round of VRP, a randomly selected proposer suggests an alternative that is voted on against the previous round's winner. In a framework with single-peaked preferences, we show that the VRP procedure guarantees that the Condorcet winner is implemented in a few rounds with truthful voting, and in just two rounds under sufficiently symmetric preference distributions or if status quo positions are not extreme. The results have applications for committee decisions, legislative decision-making, and the organization of citizens' assemblies and decentralized autonomous organizations.</description>

      <title>Price Impact of Insurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes optimal insurance design when the insurer internalizes the effect of coverage on third-party service prices. A monopolistic insurer contracts with risk-averse agents who have sequential two-dimensional private information and preferences represented by Yaari's dual utility. Insurance contracts shape service demand and, through a market-clearing condition, determine equilibrium third-party prices. We characterize the structure of optimal contracts and show they take simple forms: either full coverage after a deductible is paid or limited coverage with an out-of-pocket maximum, closely mirroring real-world insurance plans. Technically, we formulate the problem as a sequential screening model and solve it using tools from optimal transport theory.</description>

      <title>Paying and Persuading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study dynamic contracting where a principal (Sender) privately observes a Markovian state and seeks to motivate an agent (Receiver) who takes actions. Sender can both use payments to augment ex-post payoffs or persuasion to alter the informational environment as ways to provide incentives. For any stage-game payoffs, cost of transfers, rate of future discounting, and Markov transition rule, optimal transfers are backloaded-payments occur only when Sender commits to reveal the state at all continuation histories. In a rideshare example, the optimal contract is a loyalty program: drivers receive the static optimal information structure until a random promotion time, after which the state is fully revealed and only payments are used to motivate the driver.</description>

      <title>Efficiency, Envy, and Incentives in Combinatorial Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring efficiency and envy-freeness in allocating indivisible goods without money often requires randomization. However, existing combinatorial assignment mechanisms (for applications such as course allocation, food banks, and refugee resettlement) guarantee these properties either ex ante or ex post, but not both. We propose a new class of mechanisms based on Competitive Equilibrium from Random Incomes (CERI): Agents receive random token budgets and select optimal lotteries at competitive prices that clear markets in expectation. Our main insight is to let the CERI price vector guide all ex-post allocations. We show that all ordinally efficient allocations are CERI allocations, which can be implemented as lotteries over near-feasible Pareto-efficient outcomes. With identical budget distributions, CERI allocations are ordinally envy-free; with budget distributions on small supports, ex-post allocations are envy-free up to one good. Moreover, we design an asymptotically efficient implementation of CERI that satisfies a strong new non-manipulability property in large markets.</description>
