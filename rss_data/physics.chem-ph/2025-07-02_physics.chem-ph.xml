      <title>Simulation of the total energy of a triatomic silicon cluster in the first order of perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of a new approach to calculating the total energy of a diatomic molecule (cluster), it is shown that in the first order of perturbation theory, the total energy of a triatomic cluster is equal to the sum of the total energies of the diatomic clusters (molecules). If all three aluminum atoms are in the ground state of Al(2p), then the quantum of energy of collective electron oscillations (plasmon energy) in each of the diatomic clusters (molecules) is eV (electron volts).</description>

      <title>Classifying Hotspots Mutations for Biosimulation with Quantum Neural Networks and Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of biomolecular datasets presents significant challenges for computational biology. Quantum computing emerges as a promising solution to address these complexities. This study introduces a novel quantum framework for analyzing TART-T and TART-C gene data by integrating genomic and structural information. Leveraging a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), we classify hotspot mutations, utilizing quantum superposition to uncover intricate relationships within the data. Additionally, a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is employed to estimate molecular ground-state energies through a hybrid classical-quantum approach, overcoming the limitations of traditional computational methods. Implemented using IBM Qiskit, our framework demonstrates high accuracy in both mutation classification and energy estimation on current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. These results underscore the potential of quantum computing to advance the understanding of gene function and protein structure. Furthermore, this research serves as a foundational blueprint for extending quantum computational methods to other genes and biological systems, highlighting their synergy with classical approaches and paving the way for breakthroughs in drug discovery and personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the impact of the Tamm-Dancoff approximation on the computed spectra of transition-metal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tamm-Dancoff Approximation (TDA) offers a computationally efficient alternative to full linear-response Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) for calculating electronic excited states, particularly in large molecular systems. By neglecting the coupling between excitation and de-excitation channels, TDA simplifies the TDDFT response equations into a Hermitian form. This not only reduces computational cost but also eliminates numerical instabilities that can arise in the full non-Hermitian formalism. While TDA has been widely explored for valence excitations, its reliability for transition metal complexes and core-level spectroscopies remains largely untested. In this work, we address this gap by systematically comparing TDA and full TDDFT results for a series of transition metal species, focusing on absorption spectra across the UV-Vis, metal K-edges, and L-edges. Our results show that, for core-level excitations, TDA yields excitation energies and oscillator strengths nearly indistinguishable from those obtained with full TDDFT. This agreement is attributed to the negligible contribution of de-excitation amplitudes at high excitation energies, indicating that the omitted coupling terms play an insignificant role in these spectral regimes. These findings validate the accuracy and robustness of TDA in core-level spectra simulations and support its broader application in studies involving transition metal systems.</description>

      <title>A direct approach to computing non-interacting kinetic energy functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-interacting kinetic energy functional, $T_s[\rho]$, plays a fundamental role in Density Functional Theory (DFT), but its explicit form remains unknown for arbitrary $N$-representable densities. While it can in principle be evaluated by solving a constrained optimization problem, the associated adjoint problem may not always be well-posed; the adjoint operator can also be singular. To the best of knowledge, none of the existing approaches in the literature exactly determine the non-interacting kinetic energy functional for a given electron density, $\rho$, even when $\rho$ corresponds to a ground state density of Kohn-Sham DFT analysis. In this work, we present a variational framework for computing an extension of $T_s[\rho]$ using an exact trigonometric reparametrization of the density that eliminates the need for an adjoint equation. We present a proof-of-concept numerical validation of the variational principle for the special case of 1D Kohn-Sham systems. Our method, however, is general and provides a systematic foundation for computing $T_s[\rho]$ in higher dimensions too, paving the way for improved kinetic energy functionals in DFT.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Accelerated Computational Surface-Specific Vibrational Spectroscopy Reveals Oxidation Level of Graphene in Contact with Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise characterization of the graphene/water interface has been hindered by experimental inconsistencies and limited molecular-level access to interfacial structures. In this work, we present a novel integrated computational approach that combines machine-learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations with first-principles vibrational spectroscopy calculations to reveal how graphene oxidation alters interfacial water structure. Our simulations demonstrate that pristine graphene leaves the hydrogen-bond network of interfacial water largely unperturbed, whereas graphene oxide (GO) with surface hydroxyls induces a pronounced $\Delta f \sim 100 cm^{-1}$ redshift of the free-OH vibrational band and a dramatic reduction in its amplitude. These spectral shifts in the computed surface-specific sum-frequency generation spectrum serve as sensitive molecular markers of the GO oxidation level, reconciling previously conflicting experimental observations. By providing a quantitative spectroscopic fingerprint of GO oxidation, our findings have broad implications for catalysis and electrochemistry, where the structuring of interfacial water is critical to performance.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Molecular Graphs with Geometries via Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate molecular property predictions require 3D geometries, which are typically obtained using expensive methods such as density functional theory (DFT). Here, we attempt to obtain molecular geometries by relying solely on machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) models. To this end, we first curate a large-scale molecular relaxation dataset comprising 3.5 million molecules and 300 million snapshots. Then MLIP foundation models are trained with supervised learning to predict energy and forces given 3D molecular structures. Once trained, we show that the foundation models can be used in different ways to obtain geometries either explicitly or implicitly. First, it can be used to obtain low-energy 3D geometries via geometry optimization, providing relaxed 3D geometries for downstream molecular property predictions. To mitigate potential biases and enhance downstream predictions, we introduce geometry fine-tuning based on the relaxed 3D geometries. Second, the foundation models can be directly fine-tuned for property prediction when ground truth 3D geometries are available. Our results demonstrate that MLIP foundation models trained on relaxation data can provide valuable molecular geometries that benefit property predictions.</description>

      <title>Learning collective variables that respect permutational symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to translational and rotational symmetries, clusters of identical interacting particles possess permutational symmetry. Coarse-grained models for such systems are instrumental in identifying metastable states, providing an effective description of their dynamics, and estimating transition rates. We propose a numerical framework for learning collective variables that respect translational, rotational, and permutational symmetries, and for estimating transition rates and residence times. It combines a sort-based featurization, residence manifold learning in the feature space, and learning collective variables with autoencoders whose loss function utilizes the orthogonality relationship (Legoll and Lelievre, 2010). The committor of the resulting reduced model is used as the reaction coordinate in the forward flux sampling and to design a control for sampling the transition path process. We offer two case studies, the Lennard-Jones-7 in 2D and the Lennard-Jones-8 in 3D. The transition rates and residence times computed with the aid of the reduced models agree with those obtained via brute-force methods.</description>

      <title>A Scalable and Quantum-Accurate Foundation Model for Biomolecular Force Field via Linearly Tensorized Quadrangle Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate atomistic biomolecular simulations are vital for disease mechanism understanding, drug discovery, and biomaterial design, but existing simulation methods exhibit significant limitations. Classical force fields are efficient but lack accuracy for transition states and fine conformational details critical in many chemical and biological processes. Quantum Mechanics (QM) methods are highly accurate but computationally infeasible for large-scale or long-time simulations. AI-based force fields (AIFFs) aim to achieve QM-level accuracy with efficiency but struggle to balance many-body modeling complexity, accuracy, and speed, often constrained by limited training data and insufficient validation for generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LiTEN, a novel equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle Attention (TQA). TQA efficiently models three- and four-body interactions with linear complexity by reparameterizing high-order tensor features via vector operations, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. Building on LiTEN, LiTEN-FF is a robust AIFF foundation model, pre-trained on the extensive nablaDFT dataset for broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned on SPICE for accurate solvated system simulations. LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across most evaluation subsets of rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, outperforming leading models such as MACE, NequIP, and EquiFormer. LiTEN-FF enables the most comprehensive suite of downstream biomolecular modeling tasks to date, including QM-level conformer searches, geometry optimization, and free energy surface construction, while offering 10x faster inference than MACE-OFF for large biomolecules (~1000 atoms). In summary, we present a physically grounded, highly efficient framework that advances complex biomolecular modeling, providing a versatile foundation for drug discovery and related applications.</description>

      <title>Information encoding in spherical DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherical density functional theory (DFT) [Theophilou, J. Chem. Phys. 149, 074104 (2018)] is a reformulation of the classic theorems of DFT, in which the role of the total density of a many-electron system is replaced by a set of sphericalized densities, constructed by spherically-averaging the total electron density about each atomic nucleus. In Hohenberg-Kohn DFT and its constrained-search generalization, the electron density suffices to reconstruct the spatial locations and atomic numbers of the constituent atoms, and thus the external potential. However, the original proofs of spherical DFT require knowledge of the atomic locations at which each sphericalized density originates, in addition to the set of sphericalized densities themselves. In the present work, we utilize formal results from geometric algebra -- in particular, the subfield of distance geometry -- to show that this spatial information is encoded within the ensemble of sphericalized densities themselves, and does not require independent specification. Consequently, the set of sphericalized densities uniquely determines the total external potential of the system, exactly as in Hohenberg-Kohn DFT. This theoretical result is illustrated through numerical examples for LiF and for glycine, the simplest amino acid. In addition to establishing a sound practical foundation for spherical DFT, the extended theorem provides a rationale for the use of sphericalized atomic basis densities -- rather than orientation-dependent basis functions -- when designing classical or machine-learned potentials for atomistic simulation.</description>

      <title>State and Memory is All You Need for Robust and Reliable AI Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful advances in natural language understanding and generation. Yet their application to complex, real-world scientific workflows remain limited by challenges in memory, planning, and tool integration. Here, we introduce SciBORG (Scientific Bespoke Artificial Intelligence Agents Optimized for Research Goals), a modular agentic framework that allows LLM-based agents to autonomously plan, reason, and achieve robust and reliable domain-specific task execution. Agents are constructed dynamically from source code documentation and augmented with finite-state automata (FSA) memory, enabling persistent state tracking and context-aware decision-making. This approach eliminates the need for manual prompt engineering and allows for robust, scalable deployment across diverse applications via maintaining context across extended workflows and to recover from tool or execution failures. We validate SciBORG through integration with both physical and virtual hardware, such as microwave synthesizers for executing user-specified reactions, with context-aware decision making and demonstrate its use in autonomous multi-step bioassay retrieval from the PubChem database utilizing multi-step planning, reasoning, agent-to-agent communication and coordination for execution of exploratory tasks. Systematic benchmarking shows that SciBORG agents achieve reliable execution, adaptive planning, and interpretable state transitions. Our results show that memory and state awareness are critical enablers of agentic planning and reliability, offering a generalizable foundation for deploying AI agents in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Confocal Raman microscopy inside sessile multicomponent droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaporating multicomponent droplets are ubiquitous and appear in a variety of everyday situations and technological applications, including coating, 3D printing, and energy conversion processes. During evaporation, concentration gradients are typically induced, resulting in flows within the droplets. Many of the mechanisms underlying multicomponent droplet evaporation are not fully understood. However, most methods utilize markers that can be surface active and thus affect droplet dynamics. Thus, high-resolution marker-free measurements of concentration gradients in evaporating multicomponent droplets are needed. Raman microscopy can provide such a method. However, as the Raman laser has to undergo a phase transition, it is refracted, leading to a distorted drop contour. In this study, we model refraction in the droplet to better understand the shift in focus leading to geometric distortion. The horizontal and vertical shifts in focus are analyzed, and a modified configuration that enables Raman measurements with a horizontal laser is introduced. For both configurations, the simulated drop shape in the Raman image fits well with the measured shape. While Raman measurements with a vertically incident laser allow the study of the upper part of the droplet, for droplets with large contact angles, horizontal Raman measurements allow for the analysis of the region around the 3-phase contact line. As an example, a concentration map of an evaporating 4.2 $\mu$L glycerol/water droplet is presented. The results of this study can be used as a guide for Raman microscopy measurements of droplets. These findings contribute to understanding droplet dynamics during evaporation and provide a basis for developing novel printing, cleaning, and energy conversion technology applications.</description>

      <title>Homotopy continuation method for solving Dyson equation fully self-consistently: theory and application to NdNiO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solution of the Dyson equation for the small-gap systems can be plagued by large non-converging iterations. In addition to the convergence issues, due to a high non-linearity, the Dyson equation may have multiple solutions. We apply the homotopy continuation approach to control the behavior of iterations. We used the homotopy continuation to locate multiple fully self-consistent GW solutions for NdNiO2 solid and to establish the corresponding Hartree-Fock limits. Some of the solutions found are qualitatively new and help to understand the nature of electron correlation in this material. We show that there are multiple low-energy charge-transfer solutions leading to a formation of charge-density waves. Our results qualitatively agree with the experimental conductivity measurements. To rationalize the structure of solutions, we compare the k-point occupations and generalize the concept of natural difference orbitals for correlated periodic solids.</description>

      <title>Engineering NV Centers via Hydrogen-Driven Defect Chemistry in CVD Diamonds for Quantum Applications: NVHx Dissociations into NV, Origin of 468nm Center, and Cause of Brown Coloration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving high NV center conversion efficiency remains a key challenge in advancing diamond-based quantum technologies. The generally accepted mechanism for NV formation is that irradiation-induced vacancies become mobile during annealing and are trapped by substitutional nitrogen. However, the suggested mechanism does not consider the presence and role of hydrogen in the diamond and its influence on the NV formation pathway. This is despite ab-initio calculations, which strongly suggest the formation of hydrogen-passivated NV centers during CVD diamond growth. Recent experimental observations showing a strong spatial correlation between NV centers, brown coloration, and the 468 nm luminescence center in as-grown CVD diamonds prompted us to investigate the atomistic origin of these phenomena in the presence of NxVHy-type complex defects. We used hybrid density functional theory DFT calculations and spectroscopic analysis of CVD diamonds grown with varying nitrogen content to investigate defect equilibria during growth. We identified the 468 nm center as the NVH- defect, a hydrogen-passivated NV center, and assigned the characteristic UV-VIS absorption bands at 270 360 and 520 nm to NxVHy complexes. Our findings reveal that hydrogen plays a central role in stabilizing these defects during growth. We further showed that NVHx complex defects dissociate into NV centers and interstitial hydrogen during post-growth irradiation and annealing, complementing vacancy trapping by substitutional nitrogen. These results provide a unified picture of the defect chemistry underlying brown coloration, 468 nm center, and NV formation in CVD diamonds, offering new insights for optimizing diamond synthesis and processing for quantum applications by taking advantage of hydrogens role and dissociation of NVHx complexes.</description>

      <title>Historical Contingencies Steer the Topology of Randomly Assembled Graphs</title>

Abstract: Graphs are used to represent and analyze data in domains as diverse as physics, biology, chemistry, planetary science, and the social sciences. Across domains, random graph models relate generative processes to expected graph properties, and allow for sampling from distinct ensembles. Here we introduce a new random graph model, inspired by assembly theory, and characterize the graphs it generates. We show that graphs generated using our method represent a diverse ensemble, characterized by a broad range of summary statistics, unexpected even in graphs with identical degree sequences. Finally we demonstrate that the distinct properties of these graphs are enabled by historical contingencies during the generative process. These results lay the foundation for further development of novel sampling methods based on assembly theory with applications to drug discovery and materials science.</description>

      <title>Ab initio density functional theory approach to warm dense hydrogen: from density response to electronic correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of warm dense hydrogen is of key importance for the modeling of compact astrophysical objects and to understand and further optimize inertial confinement fusion (ICF) applications. The work horse of warm dense matter theory is given by thermal density functional theory (DFT), which, however, suffers from two limitations: (i) its accuracy can depend on the utilized exchange--correlation (XC) functional, which has to be approximated and (ii) it is generally limited to single-electron properties such as the density distribution. Here, we present a new ansatz combining time-dependent DFT results for the dynamic structure factor $S_{ee}(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ with static DFT results for the density response. This allows us to estimate the electron--electron static structure factor $S_{ee}(\mathbf{q})$ of warm dense hydrogen with high accuracy over a broad range of densities and temperatures. In addition to its value for the study of warm dense matter, our work opens up new avenues for the future study of electronic correlations exclusively within the framework of DFT for a host of applications.</description>

      <title>Static disorder-induced renormalization of polariton group velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular exciton-polaritons exhibit long-range, ultrafast propagation, yet recent experiments have reported far slower propagation than expected. In this work, we implement a nonperturbative approach to quantify how static energetic disorder renormalizes polariton group velocity in strongly coupled microcavities. The method requires no exact diagonalization or master equation propagation, and depends only on measurable parameters: the mean exciton energy and its variance, the microcavity dispersion, and the Rabi splitting. Using parameters corresponding to recently probed organic microcavities, we show that exciton inhomogeneous broadening slows both lower and upper polaritons, particularly when the mean exciton energy fluctuation approaches the collective light-matter coupling strength. A detailed discussion and interpretation of these results is provided using perturbation theory in the limit of weak resonance scattering. Overall, our results support the view that exciton-phonon interactions likely dominate the recent experimental observations of polariton slowdown in disordered media.</description>

      <title>Computing solvation free energies of small molecules with first principles accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18171v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free energies play a central role in characterising the behaviour of chemical systems and are among the most important quantities that can be calculated by molecular dynamics simulations. Solvation free energies in various organic solvents, in particular, are well-studied physicochemical properties of drug-like molecules and are commonly used to assess and optimise the accuracy of nonbonded parameters in empirical forcefields, and also as a fast-to-compute surrogate of performance for protein-ligand binding free energy estimation. Machine learned potentials (MLPs) show great promise as more accurate alternatives to empirical forcefields, but are not readily decomposed into physically motivated functional forms, which has thus far rendered them incompatible with standard alchemical free energy methods that manipulate individual pairwise interaction terms. However, since the accuracy of free energy calculations is highly sensitive to the forcefield, this is a key area in which MLPs have the potential to address the shortcomings of empirical forcefields. In this work, we introduce an efficient alchemical free energy protocol that enables calculations of rigorous free energy differences in condensed phase systems modelled entirely by MLPs. Using a pretrained, transferrable, alchemically equipped MLP model, we demonstrate sub-chemical accuracy for the solvation free energies of a wide range of organic molecules.</description>

Abstract: Frozen Density Embedding Theory (FDET) [Wesolowski {\it Phys. Rev. A} {\bf 77}, 012504 (2008)] provides the interpretation of the eigenvalue equations for an embedded $N'$-electron wavefunction, in which the embedding operator is multiplicative, as the Euler-Lagrange equation corresponding to the constrained minimisation of the Hohenberg-Kohn energy functional. The constraint is given by a non-negative function integrating to an integer $N-N'&gt;0$ with $N$ being the total number of electrons in the whole system ($\min_{\rho\rightarrow\forall_{\mathbf{r}}\big(\rho({\mathbf r})\ge \rho_2({\mathbf r}\big)} E^{HK}_v[\rho]=E^{HK}_v[\rho_1^{FDET}+\rho_2]\ge E^{HK}[\rho_v^{o}]=E^o_v$). The exact FDET eigenvalue equations are analysed for $\rho_2$ such that it is equal to the exact ground-state density $\rho_v^{o}({\mathbf r})$ in some measurable volume. It is shown that, the stationary ($\rho_1^{FDET}$) obtained from the FDET eigenvalue equations - if it exists - differs from $\rho_1^o=\rho_v^{o}-\rho_2$ leading to the sharp inequality $E^{HK}[\rho_1^{FDET}+\rho_2]&gt; E^o_v$ for such densities $\rho_2$.
  The result is discussed in the context of subsystem DFT, pseudopotential theory, and exact density-dependent embedding potentials.</description>

      <title>Accurate Chemistry Collection: Coupled cluster atomization energies for broad chemical space</title>

Abstract: Accurate thermochemical data with sub-chemical accuracy (i.e., within $\pm$1 kcal mol$^{-1}$ from sufficiently accurate experimental or theoretical reference data) is essential for the development and improvement of computational chemistry methods. Challenging thermochemical properties such as heats of formation and total atomization energies (TAEs) are of particular interest because they rigorously test the ability of computational chemistry methods to accurately describe complex chemical transformations involving multiple bond rearrangements. Yet, existing thermochemical datasets that confidently reach this level of accuracy are limited in either size or scope. Datasets with highly accurate reference values include a small number of data points, and larger datasets provide less accurate data or only cover a narrow portion of the chemical space. The existing datasets are therefore insufficient for developing data-driven methods with predictive accuracy over a large chemical space. The Microsoft Research Accurate Chemistry Collection (MSR-ACC) will address this challenge. Here, it offers the MSR-ACC/TAE25 dataset of 76,879 total atomization energies obtained at the CCSD(T)/CBS level via the W1-F12 thermochemical protocol. The dataset is constructed to exhaustively cover chemical space for all elements up to argon by enumerating and sampling chemical graphs, thus avoiding bias towards any particular subspace of the chemical space (such as drug-like, organic, or experimentally observed molecules). With this first dataset in MSR-ACC, we enable data-driven approaches for developing predictive computational chemistry methods with unprecedented accuracy and scope.</description>

      <title>Large-eddy simulation of turbulent spray flames: Effects of scalar correlation and enthalpy reduction in flamelet modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of turbulent spray combustion provides a promising tool for advanced engine design. In spray flames, the droplet evaporation not only reduces the ambient gas temperature, but also influences flame structure by generating substantial local fluctuations of the mixture fraction $\widetilde{Z}$ and progress variable $\widetilde{c}$. These two scalars, conventionally assumed independent in flamelet models, exhibit significant correlations arising from the coupling among evaporation, turbulent mixing and chemical reactions. This study proposes a six-dimensional flamelet-generated manifolds (FGM) method, considering the evaporation-induced specific enthalpy reduction and scalar correlation. A novel joint presumed probability density function (PDF) method is derived using the copula theory, achieving rapid grid convergence and good feasibility. Large-eddy simulation (LES) is performed on the Sydney ethanol turbulent spray flames (EtF1, EtF4 and EtF7), which feature different ethanol mass flow rates and jet Reynolds numbers. Both gas and liquid phase statistics show good agreement with experimental data across the three flames. The incorporation of specific enthalpy reduction and scalar correlation in FGM modeling improves gas temperature predictions, along with enhanced liquid-phase prediction through refined gas-field resolution. The correlation coefficient of $\widetilde{Z}$ and $\widetilde{c}$ is found to be a competing result of local evaporation and combustion, since evaporation elevates $\widetilde{Z}$ and dilutes reaction products, whereas chemical reactions enhance $\widetilde{c}$ fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Non-Clifford diagonalization for measurement shot reduction in quantum expectation value estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating expectation values on near-term quantum computers often requires a prohibitively large number of measurements. One widely-used strategy to mitigate this problem has been to partition an operator's Pauli terms into sets of mutually commuting operators. Here, we introduce a method that relaxes this constraint of commutativity, instead allowing for entirely arbitrary terms to be grouped together, save a locality constraint. The key idea is that we decompose the operator into arbitrary tensor products with bounded tensor size, ignoring Pauli commuting relations. This method -- named $k$-NoCliD ($k$-local non-Clifford diagonalization) -- allows one to measure in far fewer bases in most cases, often (though not always) at the cost of increasing the circuit depth. We introduce several partitioning algorithms tailored to different Hamiltonian classes. For electronic structure, we numerically demonstrate the existence of threshold values of $k$ for which $k$-NoCliD leads to the lowest shot counts, though we leave improved partitioning algorithms to future work. We focus primarily on three Hamiltonian classes -- molecular vibrational structure, Fermi-Hubbard, and Bose-Hubbard -- and show that $k$-NoCliD reduces the number of circuit shots, often by a very large margin, and often even for $k$ as small as 2.</description>

      <title>Establishing baselines for generative discovery of inorganic crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for materials discovery, yet its advantages over traditional methods remain unclear. In this work, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration of charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds - against four generative techniques based on diffusion models, variational autoencoders, and large language models. Our results show that established methods such as ion exchange are better at generating novel materials that are stable, although many of these closely resemble known compounds. In contrast, generative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when sufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties such as electronic band gap and bulk modulus. To enhance the performance of both the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation screening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability and property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including universal interatomic potentials. This low-cost filtering step leads to substantial improvement in the success rates of all methods, remains computationally efficient, and ultimately provides a practical pathway toward more effective generative strategies for materials discovery. By establishing baselines for comparison, this work highlights opportunities for continued advancement of generative models, especially for the targeted generation of novel materials that are thermodynamically stable.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically propose a new method in cavity- and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with improved temporal resolution in the measurement of stochastic Raman spectral fluctuations. Our approach combines Fourier spectroscopy and photon correlation to decouple the integration time from the temporal resolution. Using statistical optics simulations, we establish the relationship between time resolution and Raman signal strength, revealing that typical Raman spectral fluctuations, commensurate with molecular conformational dynamics, can theoretically be resolved on micro- to millisecond timescales. The method can further extract average single-molecule dynamics from small sub-ensembles, thereby potentially mitigating challenges in achieving strictly single-molecule isolation on SERS substrates.</description>

      <title>High-resolution spectroscopy of barium monofluoride: Odd isotopologues, hyperfine structure and isotope shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Barium monofluoride (BaF) is a promising molecular species for precision tests of fundamental symmetries and interactions. We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of BaF spectra and isotope shifts, focusing in particular on the poorly understood odd isotopologues 137BaF and 135BaF. By comparing state-of-the-art ab initio calculations with high-resolution fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy data, we provide a benchmark for electronic structure theory and disentangle the hyperfine and rovibrational spectra of the five most abundant isotopologues, from 138BaF to 134BaF. The comprehensive knowledge gained enables a King plot analysis of the isotope shifts that reveals the odd-even staggering of the barium nuclear charge radii. It also paths the way for improved laser cooling of rare BaF isotopologues and crucially supports future measurements of nuclear anapole and Schiff moments.</description>
