      <title>Two-pion exchange contributions to the relativistic chiral nuclear force at N$^3$LO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the two-pion exchange contributions to the nucleon-nucleon interaction up to next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N$^3$LO) in covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory. Both one-loop and two-loop diagrams are calculated with the spectral functional regularization. We show that the phase shifts for partial waves with total angular momentum $3\le J\le 5$ are in better agreement with the partial wave analysis from the Nijmegen or the SAID group than their N$^2$LO counterparts. In addition, the relativistic chiral force exhibits better convergence than its non-relativistic counterpart, suggesting the importance of relativistic corrections.</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical analyses of intertwined phase transitions in odd-mass Nb isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in odd-mass Nb isotopes are investigated in the framework of the interacting boson-fermion model with configuration mixing. A quantum analysis reveals a Type I QPT (gradual shape-evolution within the intruder configuration) superimposed on a Type II QPT (abrupt crossing of normal and intruder states), thus demonstrating the occurrence of intertwined QPTs. A classical analysis highlights the implications for the single particle motion in the deformed field generated by the even-even Zr cores.</description>

      <title>Nuclear structure study with two- and three-nucleon contact interactions derived within low-energy EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the application of a nuclear potential consisting of two- and three-nucleon contact interactions in nuclear structure investigations. The nuclear Hamiltonian has been derived for a very low-energy regime within the framework of the effective field theory, its low-energy constants have been fitted to a few low-energy nucleon-nucleon experimental observables and the deuteron and 3H binding energies. Our goal is to validate the ability of this Hamiltonian to reproduce some important features of open-shell nuclei, and to this end we derive effective shell-model Hamiltonians for nuclei in the p- and sd-shell mass regions. The results of shell-model calculations with these effective Hamiltonians are then compared with experiment, and also with those obtained with a nuclear Hamiltonian derived within chiral perturbation theory, that includes also terms with one- and two-pion exchanges.</description>

      <title>Systematic investigation on the superheavy nucleus formation in the reactions of $^{48}$Ca, $^{50}$Ti, $^{51}$V and $^{54}$Cr on actinide nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of superheavy elements strongly relies on the competition of the quasifission and fusion fission dynamics in the fusion-evaporation reactions. The systematics on the formation of superheavy nuclei in the $^{48}$Ca, $^{50}$Ti, $^{51}$V and $^{54}$Cr induced fusion reactions on actinide nuclei $^{232}$Th, $^{231}$Pa, $^{238}$U, $^{237}$Np, $^{242,244}$Pu, $^{243}$Am, $^{245,248}$Cm, $^{249}$Bk, $^{249}$Cf has been thoroughly investigated with the dinuclear system model by including the cluster transfer and coupling to the dynamical evolution of the quadrupole deformation parameters. The uncertainties of the fusion-evaporation excitation functions with the mass models of FRDM2012, KTUY05, LDM1966, SkyHFB, WS4 are investigated and compared with the available experimental data from Dubna, GSI, Berkeley and RIKEN. The production cross sections, optimal evaporation channels and beam energies in the synthesis of superheavy elements Z = 119 and 120 were predicted and compared for the different mass models in the reactions of $^{50}\mathrm{Ti} + ^{249}\mathrm{Bk}$, $^{51}\mathrm{V} + ^{248}\mathrm{Cm}$, $^{54}\mathrm{Cr} + ^{243}\mathrm{Am}$, $^{50}\mathrm{Ti} + ^{249}\mathrm{Cf}$, $^{51}\mathrm{V} + ^{249}\mathrm{Bk}$, $^{54}\mathrm{Cr} + ^{248}\mathrm{Cm}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>From Classical to Quantum Machine Learning: Different Approaches in Fission Barrier Height Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fission barrier energy is a fundamental property of nuclear structure that governs the stability of nuclei against fission, directly affecting their spontaneous fission half-lives and the formation of superheavy elements. However, because it can only be measured indirectly, it also enables the emergence of alternative, complementary, fast, and accurate prediction tools for traditional theoretical models. In this study, we examine the use of classical, hybrid, and quantum support vector regression (SVR) approaches to estimate fission barrier heights, starting from fundamental nuclear properties and their derived additional properties. For this purpose, eight different SVR-based approaches are considered: (i) Classical SVR, (ii) Enhanced Classical SVR with polynomial and trigonometric feature extensions, (iii) Quantum-Inspired SVR, (iv) Hybrid SVR, (v) Enhanced Hybrid SVR, (vi) Quantum Core SVR, (vii) Fixed-Parameter Quantum Feature Map SVR, and (viii) Pure Quantum SVR. The models were trained and tested on a dataset of 317 isotopes in the Z (atomic number) range of 98-126, encompassing the actinide and superheavy regions. The model performance was evaluated in terms of R2, RMSE, MAE, and training-test R2 gap. The results show that the hybrid model achieves the best overall performance. However, while quantum-enhanced approaches are still limited by circuit depth and optimization precision, they achieve competitive accuracy comparable to classical results. Considering future developments in quantum hardware and algorithms, quantum approaches are expected to achieve considerable improvements. The findings suggest that quantum machine learning can supplement classical approaches and offer a promising path toward more accurate and efficient nuclear property predictions.</description>

      <title>Impact of finite-range spin-orbit and tensor terms in Gogny EDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy Density Functionals are of major interest for the study of the atomic nucleus as, coupled with mean-field and beyond N-body approaches, they are applicable to the whole nuclear chart, including superheavy elements. On the one hand, the growing need for nuclear data and, on the other hand, the large amount of experimental data on exotic nuclei explain the work carried out on these phenomenological forms of the nucleon-nucleon interaction to analyze the richness of the nuclear phenomena. In this paper, we propose a fully finite-range extension of the Gogny EDF, including a short-range spin-orbit term and a long-range tensor term. The original fitting protocol of the Gogny interaction has been adapted to include both finite range spin-orbit and tensor terms, adding new constraints and filters linked to relevant data. Nuclear matter, spectroscopic and fission properties are discussed, highlighting ways of improving EDFs when all spin and isospin exchanges are introduced with finite-range terms.</description>

Abstract: The Landau-Migdal parameter and quenching factor for the Gamow-Teller strength distributions in the 48Ca, 90Zr, 132Sn and 208Pb parent nuclei are deduced from a detailed comparison of experimental distributions (obtained for the \b{eta}^((-)) -channel) with respective strength functions evaluated within the semi-microscopic Particle-Hole Dispersive Optical Model. The deduced values are compared with the values obtained in other studies.</description>

      <title>Exploring fixed points and eigenstates of quantum systems with reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to identify the fixed points of a given quantum operation. The method iteratively constructs the unitary transformation that maps the computational basis onto the basis of fixed points through a reward-penalty scheme based on quantum measurements. In cases where the operation corresponds to a Hamiltonian evolution, this task reduces to determining the Hamiltonian eigenstates. The algorithm is first benchmarked on random Hamiltonians acting on two and three qubits and then applied to many-body systems of up to six qubits, including the transverse-field Ising model and the all-to-all pairing Hamiltonian. In both cases, the algorithm is demonstrated to perform successfully; in the pairing model, it can also reveal hidden symmetries, which can be exploited to restrict learning to specific symmetry sectors. Finally, we discuss the possibility of post-selecting high-fidelity states even when full convergence has not been reached.</description>

      <title>Geometry-induced azimuthal anisotropy in coherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropies in heavy-ion collisions are conventionally interpreted as signatures of hydrodynamic flow. We demonstrate that in peripheral collisions, a significant $\cos 2\phi$ asymmetry in the decay leptons of coherently photoproduced $J/\psi$ mesons arises purely from the initial-state geometry of the nuclear electromagnetic field. This modulation originates from the linear polarization of coherent photons, which is radially aligned in impact parameter space and transferred to the vector meson. By employing light-cone perturbation theory within the dipole formalism, we calculate the centrality dependence of this asymmetry for collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. Our predictions quantitatively reproduce STAR data. This observable thus provides a rigorous benchmark for distinguishing electromagnetic initial-state effects from collective medium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Collinear spin correlations of final-state radiation in dense QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin correlations are required to reproduce the correct azimuthal dependence of matrix elements for successive branchings at disparate angles in QCD jets. In this paper, we study modifications to this, $\cos(2\psi_{12})$, azimuthal pattern in the presence of a quark-gluon plasma. To that end, we consider a simplified setup in which a narrow and energetic QCD antenna is formed inside a medium of fixed length and radiates a collinear emission outside it. The calculation includes both light and heavy-quarks. Further, we do not include medium-induced spin-flip interactions since they are energy suppressed in our formalism. We show that the amplitude of the azimuthal modulation in the presence of a medium is always suppressed with respect to the vacuum baseline, with its magnitude depending on the medium properties and splitting kinematics. For a medium with a momentum space anisotropy, we find that the azimuthal modulation acquires a phase shift, i.e., $\cos(2\psi_{12}) \to \cos(2\psi_{12}+\phi_{\rm med })$, where $\phi_{\rm med}$ is a process-dependent function that again depends on the medium properties and splitting kinematics. This work provides theory guidance for implementing spin-driven interference effects in phenomenological studies of jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Tensor network simulations of quasi-GPDs in the massive Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Parton Distribution functions (GPDs) are off-diagonal light-cone matrix elements that encode the internal structure of hadrons in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom. In this work, we present the first nonperturbative study of quasi-GPDs in the massive Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions (QED2), within the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice field theory. Quasi-distributions are spatial correlation functions of boosted states, which approach the relevant light-cone distributions in the luminal limit. Using tensor networks, we prepare the first excited state in the strongly coupled regime and boost it to close to the light-cone on lattices of up to 400 lattice sites. We compute both quasi-parton distribution functions and, for the first time, quasi-GPDs, and study their convergence for increasingly boosted states. In addition, we perform analytic calculations of GPDs in the two-particle Fock-space approximation and in the Reggeized limit, providing qualitative benchmarks for the tensor network results. Our analysis establishes computational benchmarks for accessing partonic observables in low-dimensional gauge theories, offering a starting point for future extensions to higher dimensions, non-Abelian theories, and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Proton mass decompositions in the NNLO QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor are expressed by the gravitational form factors. The forward values of the gravitational form factors allow for a decomposition of the proton mass into the contributions from quarks and gluons, and the further subdivisions into the contributions from quark masses and from the QCD trace anomaly may be considered. We present the most recent evaluations of these mass decompositions, using a recent quantitative evaluation of the forward values of relevant gravitational form factors at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD. We also calculate the renormalization scale dependence of each component within these decompositions. The results indicate several shortcomings of those decompositions. We propose a new decomposition according to the twist of the relevant operators, i.e., classifying the effects via the partonic motion according to asymptotic freedom and the parton correlation by non-perturbative QCD interactions. We demonstrate the improvements by our new decomposition. We also present the results for the pion, which exhibit quite different parton-correlation behaviors from the proton.</description>

      <title>Pion Valence-Quark TMD from Continuum Schwinger Function Methods and Gaussian GTMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the continuum Schwinger function method to investigate the unpolarized valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMD) of the pion at the hadron scale. The first seventeen generalized Mellin-transverse moments, constructed from lightlike and transverse vectors, are computed and found to be well described by a factorized ansatz, in which the longitudinal component coincides with the distribution function (DF) and the transverse momentum follows a Gaussian form. The Gaussianity relation between the mean and mean-squared transverse momenta is satisfied with approximately $99\%$ accuracy in our numerical results, with the mean-squared transverse momentum equal to $0.231\,\text{GeV}^2$. Using the extracted TMD, we test the hypothesis that the quark's transverse spatial distribution also follows a Gaussian form and find that the resulting electromagnetic form factor is in good agreement with existing data. These results indicate that the intrinsic transverse-momentum and transverse-spatial distributions of valence quarks in the pion can be accurately approximated by a Gaussian ansatz, supporting its use in phenomenological analyses and experimental fits.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Trace Anomaly of Dense Matter inside Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trace anomaly $\Delta$ is an important quantity that measures the broken conformal symmetry in neutron star matter. In this work, we present quasi-universal relations that connect the stellar profile of $\Delta$ to the compactness, moment of inertia, and tidal deformability of neutron stars. We apply the quasi-universal relations to determine the trace anomaly profiles for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 based on their mass-radius measurements. We also analyze PSR J0737-3039A according to its moment of inertia inferred from Bayesian modeling of nuclear equation of state. A recent multimessenger constraint on the tidal deformability is also studied, resulting in an estimate value of the trace anomaly $\Delta_c = 0.1770^{+0.0365}_{-0.0432}$ at the center of a $1.4M_\odot$ canonical neutron star. It is expected that more precise observations from both electromagnetic and gravitational-wave channels in the future will provide tighter constraints on the behavior of $\Delta$ inside neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review paper, I present a study of the structure of the hadrons computed in the covariant Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model as the chiral effective quark theory of QCD. I describe how the NJL model is treated to imitate the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and confinement QCD properties. The consistency for the parton distribution functions and electromagnetic form factors, as internal structure observables, in comparison with existing data and other theoretical predictions, is also shown. The implications of mimicking the QCD properties in the NJL model for hadron structure observables, as well as the relevance of the results to EIC, EicC, and COMPASS/AMBER future experiments, are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit scalar emissions in double beta decays of nuclei, often discussed in the context of Majoron models, in light of the latest developments on the study of neutrinoless double beta decay amplitudes from an effective field theory approach. The sensitivity of double beta decay experiments to this process is assessed through an analysis of spectral shapes, and the study is extended to massive scalars, scalars coupling to sterile neutrinos, and exotic right-handed effective couplings.</description>

      <title>Projected Density Matrix Sampling for Lattice Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for studying quantum many-body systems but face difficulties in accessing excited states and in treating sign problems. We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $\beta$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $\beta$ where sign problems occur. Our method provides a general route toward quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy for lattice Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Magnetic susceptibility of hot hadronic medium and quark degrees of freedom near the QCD cross-over point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the lattice QCD results for the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility of the medium below the cross-over temperature are difficult to reconcile with the available hadronic models. In particular, in the widely used Hadron Resonance Gas model, reproducing well numerous other features of the medium, one observes a substantially too strong diamagnetism compared to the lattice simulations. One thus needs a significant source of paramagnetism below the QCD cross-over temperature, possible to achieve with sufficiently light fermions. We thus consider a quark-meson model, where the temperature-dependent quark masses are fixed from the baryon-baryon and baryon-strangeness susceptibility data from the lattice at zero magnetic field. We show that in such a framework one can describe the magnetic susceptibility, with the vacuum contributions duly incorporated. In the hadronic picture, we also evaluate the contribution of the pion--vector-meson loops to the magnetic susceptibility evaluated via the photon polarization, showing it is small and paramagnetic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Four formulations of perfect spin hydrodynamics for spin-1/2 particles, distinguished by their treatment of spin (classical vs. quantum) and by the underlying particle statistics (Boltzmann vs. Fermi-Dirac), are analyzed and shown to satisfy the requirements of a divergence-type theory. Moreover, for all the formulations, we define the generating functions associated with the relevant thermodynamic currents and demonstrate that the constructed hydrodynamic theory is nonlinearly causal and stable. The latter is achieved by employing the exact expressions for the distribution functions, indicating a nonperturbative character of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear boson diffusion equation is taken as a basis to account for the fast thermalization of gluons in the initial stages of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. For constant drift and diffusion coefficients with schematic initial conditions, this equation has previously been solved exactly. In order to achieve a more realistic time evolution towards thermalization, energy-dependent transport coefficients are introduced, requiring numerical solutions of the nonlinear equation. Their accuracy is tested against the exact analytical results in the limit of constant coefficients. The consequences for transient gluon-condensate formation through elastic scatterings in overoccupied systems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Radial and Non-Radial Oscillations of Protoneutron Stars with Hyperonic Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores radial and non-radial oscillations of protoneutron stars (PNSs) as they evolve from hot, neutrino-rich configurations through deleptonization to cold, catalyzed states. The equation of state (EoS) is modeled using a density-dependent relativistic mean-field framework, with stellar evolution characterized by changes in entropy and lepton fraction. Both nucleonic and hyperonic compositions are considered. Non-radial $f$- and $p_1$-mode oscillations are computed using both the Cowling approximation and the full General Relativistic framework. Trapped neutrinos initially increase the error in the Cowling approximation for $f$-modes, which decreases during deleptonization and rises again in the cold phase. In contrast, $p_1$-mode errors peak during intermediate stages due to evolving pressure and density gradients. The emergence of hyperons modestly raises oscillation frequencies in both modes. Existing universal relations for $f$-mode frequency and damping time lack model independence for PNSs, motivating a more robust relation. In particular, our proposed universal relation involving the moment of inertia and $\tilde{\eta}$ shows strong agreement across all evolutionary phases, offering a temperature-sensitive, model-independent scaling for asteroseismology. Radial oscillations of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ PNS are also studied for different EoSs. Our results show that displacement ($\xi$) and pressure perturbation ($\eta$) profiles are highly sensitive to thermal state, composition, and compactness. Hyperonic stars show higher frequencies, altered node structures, and stronger pressure perturbations due to EoS softening. Differences in frequency separation $\Delta \nu_n$ and fundamental frequency $\nu_0$ between nucleonic and hyperonic models provide clear observational diagnostics for probing the interiors of PNSs and constraining the EoS of dense matter.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study in the island of inversion within the two-major-shell valence space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an \textit{ab initio} study of nuclear structure in the island of inversion around neutron number $N=20$, using multishell effective Hamiltonians derived from the valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group approach combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method. By progressively expanding the valence space from the \textit{sd} shell to the intermediate $sdf_{7/2}p_{3/2}$ space and, for the first time, to the full \textit{sdfp} shell, we investigate low-lying spectra, $E2$ transition strengths, deformation properties, and neutron occupancies in even-even Ne, Mg, and Si isotopes around $N=20$. Our results show that enlarging the valence space significantly improves the description of quadrupole collectivity, yielding better agreement with experimental data for key observables such as the lowered $2^+$ energies and the enhanced $B(E2;0^+_1\rightarrow2_1^+)$ values. The analysis reveals the critical role of cross-shell multi-particle multi-hole excitations in breaking the $N=20$ shell closure and establishing intruder-dominated ground states. It also demonstrates the ability of the VS-IMSRG+PGCM framework to capture both dynamical (short range) and static (long range) correlations across multiple major-oscillator shells.</description>

      <title>Shape polarization and coexistence of high-$K$ three-quasiparticle states in odd-mass $N=106$ isotones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-quasiparticle $K$-isomeric states in odd-mass $N=106$ isotones within the $A\sim 180$ mass region are systematically investigated using configuration-constrained potential energy surface calculations. The calculations successfully reproduce the excitation energies and deformations of known high-$K$ isomers in the nuclei from $^{175}$Tm to $^{181}$Re. For the nuclei closer to the $Z=82$ shell closure ($^{183}$Ir, $^{185}$Au, and $^{187}$Tl), predictions for the configurations of observed and yet-to-be-observed isomers are provided. The results reveal strong shape polarization, where the three-quasiparticle states are driven to larger deformations compared to the often shape-soft or spherical ground states. A particularly rich spectrum of shape coexistence is predicted in $^{187}$Tl, where several high-$K$ three-quasiparticle configurations with distinct prolate, oblate, and triaxial shapes are found to coexist at similar excitation energies. Notably, the oblate-deformed $K^{\pi}=29/2^+$ configuration at $E_x = 1839$ keV is proposed to be responsible for a long-lived isomer. This study provides a comprehensive picture of shape evolution and coexistence in high-$K$ multi-quasiparticle states, offering valuable insights for future experimental research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two body tunneling problems are hard to treat analytically due to the incompatibility between tunneling and perturbation theory. The lack of classical solutions of the Euclidean Lagrangian of continuous systems further thwarts semi-classical expansions. To develop an analytic theory which provides insight on interacting two-particle tunneling, we use new results to derive the Bethe-Salpeter equation of a tunneling field theory with Yukawa coupling. We show that in the one plus one dimensional case a closed form solution in the instantaneous positive-energy regime is permitted. We then compute the scattering amplitude by perturbing on interparticle interaction and recover the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to confirm physical consistency and relevancy.</description>

Abstract: The precise calculation of alpha-induced neutron-emission ($\alpha$,n) reaction rates is fundamental to understanding nucleosynthesis in diverse stellar environments. This study investigates the nuclear reaction rates for various non-resonant alpha-induced neutron-emission reactions by employing analytical, theoretical, and computational methods. We have adopted analytical expressions from existing literature, and for the computational approach, we have implemented the Monte Carlo method. To better understand the functionality and validate the established open-source Monte Carlo scripts, we also developed our own computational code and used it to test various aspects of the method. A comprehensive comparison of the reaction rates from each method is presented by plotting their dependency on temperature.</description>

      <title>Effects of short-range correlations at high densities on neutron stars with and without DM content: role of the repulsive self-interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how short-range correlations affect relativistic hadronic models at high densities, with direct consequences for the structure of neutron stars, both with and without dark matter content. Two versions of the model are examined: one with vector self-interactions up to second order ($\omega_0^2$) and another including a fourth-order term ($\omega_0^4$). We show that SRC tend to soften the equation of state when only the quadratic term is present, but produce a noticeable stiffening once the $\omega_0^4$ term is included. The corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff solutions for pure neutron stars indicate that short-range correlations reduce the maximum mass in the first case but increase it in the second. Extending the analysis to stars containing a fermionic dark matter component, within the two-fluid formalism, we verify that the same features appear in the respective mass-radius diagrams. In particular, the decrease of the maximum mass with increasing dark matter fraction is partly compensated by the SRC effects in the hadronic sector for the model with the fourth-order term. In all cases, the resulting parametrizations are consistent with recent astrophysical constraints, including the joint NICER-XMM-Newton analyses of the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, as well as the gravitational-wave event GW190425.</description>

      <title>Heavy quarkonium dynamics at next-to-leading order in the binding energy over temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the potential non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (pNRQCD) effective field theory, we derive a Lindblad equation for the evolution of the heavy-quarkonium reduced density matrix that is accurate to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the ratio of the binding energy of the state to the temperature of the medium. The resulting NLO Lindblad equation can be used to more reliably describe heavy-quarkonium evolution in the quark-gluon plasma at low temperatures compared to the leading-order truncation. For phenomenological application, we numerically solve the resulting NLO Lindblad equation using the quantum trajectories algorithm. To achieve this, we map the solution of the three-dimensional Lindblad equation to the solution of an ensemble of one-dimensional Schr\"odinger evolutions with Monte-Carlo sampled quantum jumps. Averaging over the Monte-Carlo sampled quantum jumps, we obtain the solution to the NLO Lindblad equation without truncation in the angular momentum quantum number of the states considered. We also consider the evolution of the system using only the complex effective Hamiltonian without stochastic jumps and find that this provides a reliable approximation for the ground state survival probability at LO and NLO. Finally, we make comparisons with our prior leading-order pNRQCD results and experimental data available from the ATLAS, ALICE, and CMS collaborations.</description>

Abstract: The quasistatic electric current density of fermions in the presence of an external electric field is determined through the utilization of a time-ordered Schwinger propagator. The study encompasses the necessary conditions for establishing a well-defined time-ordered propagator within the Schwinger formalism, specifically concentrating on constant and uniform electromagnetic fields. Within this theoretical framework, a chemical potential is introduced, resulting in non-zero values for the electric current and charge number density. Consequently, the dependence of electric conductivity on the strength of the electric field and the charge number density is investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20751v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete 4x4 block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Fully correlated static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. A special focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem while keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex, as well as the components of the dynamical kernel, acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Indications for freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the quark-gluon plasma at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The D-measure of net-charge fluctuations quantifies the variance of net charge in strongly interacting matter. It was introduced over 20 years ago as a potential signal of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions, where it is expected to be suppressed due to the fractional electric charges of quarks. Measurements have been performed at RHIC and LHC, but the conclusion has been elusive in the absence of quantitative calculations for both scenarios. We address this issue by employing a recently developed formalism of density correlations and incorporate resonance decays, local charge conservation, and experimental kinematic cuts. We find that the hadron gas scenario is in fair agreement with the ALICE data for \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collisions only when a very short rapidity range of local charge conservation is enforced, while the QGP scenario is in excellent agreement with experimental data and largely insensitive to the range of local charge conservation. A Bayesian analysis of the data utilizing different priors yields moderate evidence for the freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the QGP phase relative to hadron gas. The upcoming high-fidelity measurements from LHC Run 2 will serve as a precision test of the two scenarios.</description>

      <title>Effects of a Brueckner-Hartree-Fock-corrected effective mass on speed of sound, conformality, and observables of dark matter-admixed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an equation of state describing cold and dense matter in the core of neutron stars which includes an admixture of fermionic dark matter and incorporates nucleon effective masses derived from the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) many-body approach within a relativistic mean-field model. Such a BHF-informed mixed-model approach increases stellar compactness, with mass-radius configurations which are consistent with smaller, lighter pulsars. The model displays the expected non-monotonic behavior of sound speed hinted at by neutron star data, and is closer to the conformal bound at maximum mass. We find that the model displays tension with bounds on heavier pulsars, suggesting that the hypothesis of an aggregated dark component in neutron stars needs further critical study.</description>

      <title>$A_{\beta}[E_{\beta}]$ in $^{37}$K decay: new physics with opposite $\beta$ helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11502v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By extending our analysis and simulations of our $^{37}$K $\beta$-decay data set to allow the $\beta$ asymmetry with respect to nuclear spin to vary with $\beta$ energy $E_{\beta}$, we have gained sensitivity to new physics that depends on a helicity factor for the $\beta$, $m_\beta/E_\beta$.
  In particular, we constrain Lorentz scalar and tensor quark-lepton interaction strengths at a sensitivity complementary to the similar Fierz interference term in neutron $\beta$ decay.
  Our result for that new physics is a Fierz interference term $b$ = 0.033 $\pm$ 0.084 (stat) $\pm$ 0.039 (syst),
  consistent with the standard model electroweak interaction value $b=0$. We consider presently achieved complementarity to $\beta$-decay and particle physics experiments, along with projectable technical improvements to our method.</description>

      <title>Geometry Induced Chiral Transport and Entanglement in $AdS_2$ Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.</description>
