      <title>Spatiotemporal variability and prediction of e-bike battery levels in bike-sharing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bike Sharing Systems (BSSs) play a crucial role in promoting sustainable urban mobility by facilitating short-range trips and connecting with other transport modes. Traditionally, most BSS fleets have consisted of mechanical bikes (m-bikes), but electric bikes (e-bikes) are being progressively introduced due to their ability to cover longer distances and appeal to a wider range of users. However, the charging requirements of e-bikes often hinder their deployment and optimal functioning. This study examines the spatiotemporal variations in battery levels of Barcelona's BSS, revealing that bikes stationed near the city centre tend to have shorter rest periods and lower average battery levels. Additionally, to improve the management of e-bike fleets, a Markov-chain approach is developed to predict both bike availability and battery levels. This research offers a unique perspective on the dynamics of e-bike battery levels and provides a practical tool to overcome the main operational challenges in their implementation.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of a kinetic model describing social interactions on a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the optimal control of a kinetic model describing agents who migrate on a graph and interact within its nodes exchanging a physical quantity. As a prototype model, we consider the spread of an infectious disease on a graph, so that the exchanged quantity is the viral-load. The control, exerted on both the mobility and on the interactions separately, aims at minimising the average macroscopic viral-load.
  We prove that minimising the average viral-load weighted by the mass in each node is the most effective and convenient strategy. We consider two different interactions: in the first one the infection (gain) and the healing (loss) processes happen within the same interaction, while in the second case the infection and healing result from two different processes. With the appropriate controls, we prove that in the first case it is possible to stop the increase of the disease, but paying a very high cost in terms of control, while in the second case it is possible to eradicate the disease. We test numerically the role of each intervention and the interplay between the mobility and the interaction control strategies in each model.</description>

      <title>Topological Components in a Community Currency Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transaction data from digital payment systems can be used to study economic processes at such a detail that was not possible previously. Here, we analyse the data from Sarafu token network, a community inclusion currency in Kenya. During the COVID-19 emergency, the Sarafu was disbursed as part of a humanitarian aid project. In this work, the transactions are analysed using network science. A topological categorisation is defined to identify cyclic and acyclic components. Furthermore, temporal aspects of circulation taking place within these components are considered. The significant presence of different types of strongly connected components as compared to randomized null models shows the importance of cycles in this economic network. Especially, indicating their key role in currency recirculation. In some acyclic components, the most significant triad suggests the presence of a group of users collecting currency from accounts active only once, hinting at a misuse of the system. In some other acyclic components, small isolated groups of users were active only once, suggesting the presence of users only interested in trying out the system. The methods used in this paper can answer specific questions related to user activities, currency design, and assessment of monetary interventions. Our methodology provides a general quantitative tool for analysing the behaviour of users in a currency network.</description>

      <title>Global decomposition of networks into multiple cores formed by local hubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks are ubiquitous in various fields, representing systems where nodes and their interconnections constitute their intricate structures. We introduce a network decomposition scheme to reveal multiscale core-periphery structures lurking inside, using the concept of locally defined nodal hub centrality and edge-pruning techniques built upon it. We demonstrate that the hub-centrality-based edge pruning reveals a series of breaking points in network decomposition, which effectively separates a network into its backbone and shell structures. Our local-edge decomposition method iteratively identifies and removes locally least important nodes, and uncovers an onion-like hierarchical structure as a result. Compared with the conventional $k$-core decomposition method, our method based on relative information residing in local structures exhibits a clear advantage in terms of discovering locally crucial substructures. Furthermore, we introduce the core-periphery score to properly separate the core and periphery with our decomposition scheme. By extending the method combined with the network community structure, we successfully detect multiple core-periphery structures by decomposition inside each community. Moreover, the application of our decomposition to supernode networks defined from the communities reveals the intricate relation between the two representative mesoscale structures.</description>

      <title>Topological communities in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most complex systems can be captured by graphs or networks. Networks connect nodes (e.g.\ neurons) through edges (synapses), thus summarizing the system's structure. A popular way of interrogating graphs is community detection, which uncovers sets of geometrically related nodes. {\em Geometric communities} consist of nodes ``closer'' to each other than to others in the graph. Some network features do not depend on node proximity -- rather, on them playing similar roles (e.g.\ building bridges) even if located far apart. These features can thus escape proximity-based analyses. We lack a general framework to uncover such features. We introduce {\em topological communities}, an alternative perspective to decomposing graphs. We find clusters that describe a network as much as classical communities, yet are missed by current techniques. In our framework, each graph guides our attention to its relevant features, whether geometric or topological. Our analysis complements existing ones, and could be a default method to study networks confronted without prior knowledge. Classical community detection has bolstered our understanding of biological, neural, or social systems; yet it is only half the story. Topological communities promise deep insights on a wealth of available data. We illustrate this for the global airport network, human connectomes, and others.</description>
