      <title>Large Teams Overshadow Individual Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an ideal world, every scientist's contribution would be fully recognized, driving collective scientific progress. In reality, however, only a few scientists are recognized and remembered. Sociologist Robert Merton first described this disparity between contribution and recognition as the Matthew Effect, where citations disproportionately favor established scientists, even when their contributions are no greater than those of junior peers. Merton's work, however, did not account for coauthored papers, where citations acknowledge teams rather than individual authors. How do teams affect reward systems in science? We hypothesize that teams will divide and obscure intellectual credit, making it even harder to recognize individual contributions. To test this, we developed and analyzed the world's first large-scale observational dataset on author contributions, derived from LaTeX source files of 1.6 million papers authored by 2 million scientists. We also quantified individual credits within teams using a validated algorithm and examined their relationship to contributions, accounting for factors such as team size, career stage, and historical time. Our findings confirm that teams amplify the Matthew Effect and overshadow individual contributions. As scientific research shifts from individual efforts to collaborative teamwork, this study highlights the urgent need for effective credit assignment practices in team-based science.</description>

      <title>EC-SBM Synthetic Network Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic networks with realistic community structure is vital to effectively evaluate community detection algorithms. In this study, we propose a new synthetic network generator called the Edge-Connected Stochastic Block Model (EC-SBM). The goal of EC-SBM is to take a given clustered real-world network and produce a synthetic network that resembles the clustered real-world network with respect to both network and community-specific criteria. In particular, we focus on simulating the internal edge connectivity of the clusters in the reference clustered network. Our extensive performance study on large real-world networks shows that EC-SBM has high accuracy in both network and community-specific criteria, and is generally more accurate than current alternative approaches for this problem. Furthermore, EC-SBM is fast enough to scale to real-world networks with millions of nodes.</description>

Abstract: We address the problem of selecting $k$ representative nodes from a network, aiming to achieve two objectives: identifying the most influential nodes and ensuring the selection proportionally reflects the network's diversity. We propose two approaches to accomplish this, analyze them theoretically, and demonstrate their effectiveness through a series of experiments.</description>

      <title>A Pseudo Markov-Chain Model and Time-Elapsed Measures of Mobility from Collective Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a pseudo Markov-chain model to understand time-elapsed flows, over multiple intervals, from time and space aggregated collective inter-location trip data, given as a time-series. Building on the model, we develop measures of mobility that parallel those known for individual mobility data, such as the radius of gyration. We apply these measures to the NetMob 2024 Data Challenge data, and obtain interesting results that are consistent with published statistics and commuting patterns in cities. Besides building a new framework, we foresee applications of this approach to an improved understanding of human mobility in the context of environmental changes and sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Graph machine learning for flight delay prediction due to holding manouver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flight delays due to holding maneuvers are a critical and costly phenomenon in aviation, driven by the need to manage air traffic congestion and ensure safety. Holding maneuvers occur when aircraft are instructed to circle in designated airspace, often due to factors such as airport congestion, adverse weather, or air traffic control restrictions. This study models the prediction of flight delays due to holding maneuvers as a graph problem, leveraging advanced Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML) techniques to capture complex interdependencies in air traffic networks. Holding maneuvers, while crucial for safety, cause increased fuel usage, emissions, and passenger dissatisfaction, making accurate prediction essential for operational efficiency. Traditional machine learning models, typically using tabular data, often overlook spatial-temporal relations within air traffic data. To address this, we model the problem of predicting holding as edge feature prediction in a directed (multi)graph where we apply both CatBoost, enriched with graph features capturing network centrality and connectivity, and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), which excel in relational data contexts. Our results indicate that CatBoost outperforms GAT in this imbalanced dataset, effectively predicting holding events and offering interpretability through graph-based feature importance. Additionally, we discuss the model's potential operational impact through a web-based tool that allows users to simulate real-time delay predictions. This research underscores the viability of graph-based approaches for predictive analysis in aviation, with implications for enhancing fuel efficiency, reducing delays, and improving passenger experience.</description>

      <title>A Classification System Approach in Predicting Chinese Censorship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to using a classifier to predict whether a Weibo post would be censored under the Chinese internet. Through randomized sampling from \citeauthor{Fu2021} and Chinese tokenizing strategies, we constructed a cleaned Chinese phrase dataset with binary censorship markings. Utilizing various probability-based information retrieval methods on the data, we were able to derive 4 logistic regression models for classification. Furthermore, we experimented with pre-trained transformers to perform similar classification tasks. After evaluating both the macro-F1 and ROC-AUC metrics, we concluded that the Fined-Tuned BERT model exceeds other strategies in performance.</description>

      <title>HOG-Diff: Higher-Order Guided Diffusion for Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph generation is a critical yet challenging task as empirical analyses require a deep understanding of complex, non-Euclidean structures. Although diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, these models typically adapt from the frameworks designed for image generation, making them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose a novel Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff) model that follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum and is guided by higher-order information, enabling the progressive generation of plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks. Extensive experiments on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiminghh/HOG-Diff.</description>

      <title>The Role of Network and Identity in the Diffusion of Hashtags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusion of culture online is theorized to be influenced by many interacting social factors (e.g., network and identity). However, most existing computational cascade models consider just a single factor (e.g., network or identity). This work offers a new framework for teasing apart the mechanisms underlying hashtag cascades. We curate a new dataset of 1,337 hashtags representing cultural innovation online, develop a 10-factor evaluation framework for comparing empirical and simulated cascades, and show that a combined network+identity model better simulates hashtag cascades than network- or identity-only counterfactuals. We also explore heterogeneity in performance: While a combined network+identity model best predicts the popularity of cascades, a network-only model best predicts cascade growth and an identity-only model best predicts adopter composition. The network+identity model has the highest comparative advantage among hashtags used for expressing racial or regional identity and talking about sports or news. In fact, we are able to predict what combination of network and/or identity best models each hashtag and use this to further improve performance. Our results show the utility of models incorporating the interactions of network, identity, and other social factors in the diffusion of hashtags in social media.</description>

      <title>Domain-Informed Negative Sampling Strategies for Dynamic Graph Embedding in Meme Stock-Related Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social network platforms like Reddit are increasingly impacting real-world economics. Meme stocks are a recent phenomena where price movements are driven by retail investors organizing themselves via social networks. To study the impact of social networks on meme stocks, the first step is to analyze these networks. Going forward, predicting meme stocks' returns would require to predict dynamic interactions first. This is different from conventional link prediction, frequently applied in e.g. recommendation systems. For this task, it is essential to predict more complex interaction dynamics, such as the exact timing. These are crucial for linking the network to meme stock price movements. Dynamic graph embedding (DGE) has recently emerged as a promising approach for modeling dynamic graph-structured data. However, current negative sampling strategies, an important component of DGE, are designed for conventional dynamic link prediction and do not capture the specific patterns present in meme stock-related social networks. This limits the training and evaluation of DGE models in such social networks. To overcome this drawback, we propose novel negative sampling strategies based on the analysis of real meme stock-related social networks and financial knowledge. Our experiments show that the proposed negative sampling strategies can better evaluate and train DGE models targeted at meme stock-related social networks compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Destabilizing a Social Network Model via Intrinsic Feedback Vulnerabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social influence plays a significant role in shaping individual opinions and actions, particularly in a world of ubiquitous digital interconnection. The rapid development of generative AI has engendered well-founded concerns regarding the potential scalable implementation of radicalization techniques in social media. Motivated by these developments, we present a case study investigating the effects of small but intentional perturbations on a simple social network. We employ Taylor's classic model of social influence and use tools from robust control theory (most notably the Dynamical Structure Function (DSF)), to identify perturbations that qualitatively alter the system's behavior while remaining as unobtrusive as possible. We examine two such scenarios: perturbations to an existing link and perturbations that introduce a new link to the network. In each case, we identify destabilizing perturbations of minimal norm and simulate their effects. Remarkably, we find that small but targeted alterations to network structure may lead to the radicalization of all agents -- sentiments grow without bound -- exhibiting the potential for large-scale shifts in collective behavior to be triggered by comparatively minuscule adjustments in social influence. Given that this method of identifying perturbations that are innocuous but destabilizing applies to any suitable dynamical system, our findings emphasize a need for similar analyses to be carried out on real systems (e.g., real social networks), to identify where such dynamics may already exist.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernels to Subgraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subgraph representation learning has been effective in solving various real-world problems. However, current graph neural networks (GNNs) produce suboptimal results for subgraph-level tasks due to their inability to capture complex interactions within and between subgraphs. To provide a more expressive and efficient alternative, we propose WLKS, a Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernel generalized for subgraphs by applying the WL algorithm on induced $k$-hop neighborhoods. We combine kernels across different $k$-hop levels to capture richer structural information that is not fully encoded in existing models. Our approach can balance expressiveness and efficiency by eliminating the need for neighborhood sampling. In experiments on eight real-world and synthetic benchmarks, WLKS significantly outperforms leading approaches on five datasets while reducing training time, ranging from 0.01x to 0.25x compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Higher-order shortest paths in hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the defining features of complex networks is the connectivity properties that we observe emerging from local interactions. Recently, hypergraphs have emerged as a versatile tool to model networks with non-dyadic, higher-order interactions. Nevertheless, the connectivity properties of real-world hypergraphs remain largely understudied. In this work we introduce path size as a measure to characterise higher-order connectivity and quantify the relevance of non-dyadic ties for efficient shortest paths in a diverse set of empirical networks with and without temporal information. By comparing our results with simple randomised null models, our analysis presents a nuanced picture, suggesting that non-dyadic ties are often central and are vital for system connectivity, while dyadic edges remain essential to connect more peripheral nodes, an effect which is particularly pronounced for time-varying systems. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the structural organisation of systems with higher-order interactions.</description>
