      <title>Principle of structural analogy of solutions and its application to nonlinear PDEs and delay PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the principle of structural analogy of solutions, approaches have been developed for constructing exact solutions of complex nonlinear PDEs, including PDEs with delay, based on the use of special solutions to auxiliary simpler related equations. It is shown that to obtain exact solutions of nonlinear non-autonomous PDEs, the coefficients of which depend on time, it is possible to use generalized and functional separable solutions of simpler autonomous PDEs, the coefficients of which do not depend on time. Specific examples of constructing exact solutions to nonlinear PDEs, the coefficients of which depend arbitrarily on time, are considered. It has been discovered that generalized and functional separable solutions of nonlinear PDEs with constant delay can be used to construct exact solutions of more complex nonlinear PDEs with variable delay of general form. A number of nonlinear reaction-diffusion type PDEs with variable delay are described, which allow exact solutions with generalized separation of variables.</description>

      <title>Modulation theory of soliton-mean flow in KdV equation with box type initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the KdV equation with box type initial data, the interaction between a trial soliton and large-scale dispersive mean flow is studied theoretically and numerically. The pure box initial value can cause rarefaction wave and dispersive shock wave, and can create an area of soliton train. The key to the interaction of soliton and mean flow is that the dynamic evolutions of the mean flow and the local soliton can be described by the same modulation system. The soliton modulation system is derived from the degenerations of the two-genus Whitham modulation system. Considering the influence of rarefaction wave, dispersive shock wave and soliton train on the trial soliton, in the framework of Whitham modulation theory, the equation describing the soliton trajectory and the changes in amplitude and phase shift are given explicitly. The predicted results are compared with the numerical simulations, which verifies the corrections of the theoretical analysis. The exotic interaction phenomena between soliton and mean flow found in this work have broad applications to shallow water soliton propagations and real soliton experiments in fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exact real time dynamics with free fermions in disguise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum spin chains with a hidden free fermionic structure, distinct from the Jordan-Wigner transformation and its generalizations. We express selected local operators with the hidden fermions. This way we can exactly solve the real time dynamics in various physical scenarios, including the computation of selected dynamical two point functions and Loschmidt amplitudes, in continuous or discrete time. In the latter case we build quantum circuits that can be implemented on a quantum computer. With this we extend the family of classically simulable quantum many body processes.</description>
