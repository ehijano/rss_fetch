      <description>arXiv:2403.00034v1 Announce Type: new

      <title>Irrational rotations and 2-filling rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a skew product transformation associated to an irrational rotation of the circle [0,1]/~. This skew product keeps track of the number of times an orbit of the rotation lands in the two complementary intervals of {0,1/2} in the circle. We show that under certain conditions on the continued fraction expansion of the irrational number defining the rotation, the skew product transformation has certain dense orbits. This is in spite of the presence of numerous non-dense orbits. We use this to construct laminations on infinite type surfaces with exotic properties. In particular, we show that for every infinite type surface with an isolated planar end, there is an infinite clique of 2-filling rays based at that end. These 2-filling rays are relevant to Bavard--Walker's loop graphs.</description>

      <title>Understanding the role of B-cells in CAR T-cell therapy in leukemia through a mathematical mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has been proven to be successful against different leukaemias and lymphomas. This paper makes an analytical and numerical study of a mathematical model describing the competition of CAR-T, leukaemias tumor and B cells. Considering its significance in sustaining anti-CD19 CAR T-cell stimulation, we integrate a B-cell source term into the model. Through stability and bifurcation analyses, we reveal the potential for tumor eradication contingent on the continuous influx of B-cells, uncovering a transcritical bifurcation at a critical B-cell input. Additionally, we identify an almost heteroclinic cycle between equilibrium points, providing a theoretical basis for understanding disease relapse. Analyzing the oscillatory behavior of the system, we approximate the time-dependent dynamics of CAR T-cells and leukemic cells, shedding light on the impact of initial tumor burden on therapeutic outcomes. In conclusion, our study provides insights into CAR T-cell therapy dynamics for acute lymphoblastic leukemias, offering a theoretical foundation for clinical observations and suggesting avenues for future immunotherapy modeling research.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of a Diffusive Epidemiological Model Involving the Caputo-Fabrizio Fractional Time-Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study a fractional SEIR biological model of a reaction-diffusion, using the non-singular kernel Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative in the Caputo sense and employing the Laplacian operator. In our PDE model, the government seeks immunity through the vaccination program, which is considered a control variable. Our study aims to identify the ideal control pair that reduces the number of infected/infectious people and the associated vaccine and treatment costs over a limited time and space. Moreover, by using the forward-backward algorithm, the approximate results are explained by dynamic graphs to monitor the effectiveness of vaccination.</description>

      <title>Finite Time Stability Analysis for Fractional Stochastic Neutral Delay Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we delve into the study of a stochastic differential equation with a fractional order and a time delay, encompassing deterministic and stochastic components. Our primary aim is to rigorously establish the existence of a unique solution that follows specified initial conditions, achieved through mathematical analysis. Moreover, we extend our research to investigate the finite-time stability of the system, analyzing trajectory behavior within a specific time frame. Employing advanced mathematical techniques, we systematically verify the finite-time stability, providing insights into convergence and stability within this defined interval. By employing illustrative examples, we strengthen this all-encompassing investigation into the intricate dynamics and stability properties that exist in fractionally ordered stochastic systems with time delays.</description>

      <title>A Floquet-Lyapunov Theory for nonautonomous linear periodic differential equations with piecewise constant deviating arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a version of the classical Floquet-Lyapunov theorem for $\omega-$periodic nonautonomous linear (impulsive and non-impulsive) differential equations with piecewise constant arguments of generalized type (in short, IDEPCAG or DEPCAG). We have proven that the nonautonomous linear IDEPCAG is kinematically similar to an autonomous linear ordinary differential equation. We have also provided some examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our results.</description>

      <title>Equicontractive weak separation property on the line does not imply convex finite type condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{S_1, S_2, \dots, S_n\}$ be an iterated function system on $\mathbb{R}$ with attractor $K$. It is known that if the iterated function system satisfies the weak separation property and $K = [0,1]$ then the iterated function system also satisfies the convex finite type condition. We show that the condition $K = [0,1]$ is necessary. That is, we give two examples of iterated function systems on $\mathbb{R}$ satisfying weak separation condition, and $0&lt; \dim_H(K) &lt; 1$ such that the IFS does not satisfy the convex finite type condition.</description>

      <title>Stability-Certified Learning of Control Systems with Quadratic Nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work primarily focuses on an operator inference methodology aimed at constructing low-dimensional dynamical models based on a priori hypotheses about their structure, often informed by established physics or expert insights. Stability is a fundamental attribute of dynamical systems, yet it is not always assured in models derived through inference. Our main objective is to develop a method that facilitates the inference of quadratic control dynamical systems with inherent stability guarantees. To this aim, we investigate the stability characteristics of control systems with energy-preserving nonlinearities, thereby identifying conditions under which such systems are bounded-input bounded-state stable. These insights are subsequently applied to the learning process, yielding inferred models that are inherently stable by design. The efficacy of our proposed framework is demonstrated through a couple of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Bounded orbits for 3 bodies in $\mathbb{R}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Newtonian 3-body problem in dimension 4, and fix a value of the angular momentum which is compatible with this dimension. We show that the energy function cannot tend to its infimum on an unbounded sequence of states. Consequently the infimum of the energy is its minimum. This completes our previous work \cite{AD19} on the existence of Lyapunov stable relative periodic orbits in the 3-body problem in $\mathbb{R}^4$.</description>

      <title>Badly approximable grids and k-divergent lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an m by n real matrix A, we investigate the set of badly approximable targets for A as a subset of the m-torus. It is well known that this set is large in the sense that it is dense and has full Hausdorff dimension. We investigate the relationship between its measure and Diophantine properties of A. On the one hand, we give the first examples of a non-singular matrix A such that the set of badly approximable targets has full measure with respect to some non-trivial algebraic measure on the torus. For this, we use transference theorems due to Jarnik and Khintchine, and the parametric geometry of numbers in the sense of Roy. On the other hand, we give a novel Diophantine condition on A that slightly strengthens non-singularity, and show that under the assumption that A satisfies this condition, the set of badly approximable targets is a null-set with respect to any non-trivial algebraic measure on the torus. For this we use naive homogeneous dynamics, harmonic analysis, and a novel concept we refer to as mixing convergence of measures.</description>
