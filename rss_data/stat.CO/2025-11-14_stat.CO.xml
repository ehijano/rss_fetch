      <title>Diagnostics for Semiparametric Accelerated Failure Time Models with R Package afttest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semiparametric accelerated failure time (AFT) model is a useful alternative to the widely used Cox proportional hazard model, which directly links the logarithm of the failure time to the covariates, yielding more interpretable regression coefficients. However, diagnostic procedures for the semiparametric AFT model have received relatively little attention. This paper introduces afttest, an R package that implements recently developed diagnostic tools for the semiparametric AFT model. The package supports diagnostic procedures for models fitted with either rank-based or least-squares methods. It provides functions to assess model assumptions, including the overall adequacy, the link function, and functional form of each covariate. The test statistics are of Kolmogorov-type suprema of transformed aggregated martingale residual processes. The p-values are obtained by approximating the null distribution with an efficient multiplier bootstrap procedure. Additionally, the package offers graphical tools to compare the observed stochastic processes with a number of approximated realizations. Applications of the package to the well-known Mayo clinic primary biliary cirrhosis study are presented.</description>

      <title>On The Performance of Prefix-Sum Parallel Kalman Filters and Smoothers on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental evaluation of parallel-in-time Kalman filters and smoothers using graphics processing units (GPUs). In particular, the paper evaluates different all-prefix-sum algorithms, that is, parallel scan algorithms for temporal parallelization of Kalman filters and smoothers in two ways: by calculating the required number of operations via simulation, and by measuring the actual run time of the algorithms on real GPU hardware. In addition, a novel parallel-in-time two-filter smoother is proposed and experimentally evaluated. Julia code for Metal and CUDA implementations of all the algorithms is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Masking criteria for selecting an imputation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The masking-one-out (MOO) procedure, masking an observed entry and comparing it versus its imputed values, is a very common procedure for comparing imputation models. We study the optimum of this procedure and generalize it to a missing data assumption and establish the corresponding semi-parametric efficiency theory. However, MOO is a measure of prediction accuracy, which is not ideal for evaluating an imputation model. To address this issue, we introduce three modified MOO criteria, based on rank transformation, energy distance, and likelihood principle, that allow us to select an imputation model that properly account for the stochastic nature of data. The likelihood approach further enables an elegant framework of learning an imputation model from the data and we derive its statistical and computational learning theories as well as consistency of BIC model selection. We also show how MOO is related to the missing-at-random assumption. Finally, we introduce the prediction-imputation diagram, a two-dimensional diagram visually comparing both the prediction and imputation utilities for various imputation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present methods that provide all zeroes and extrema of a function that do not require differentiation. Using point process theory, we are able to describe the locations of zeroes or maxima, their number, as well as their distribution over a given window of observation. The algorithms in order to accomplish the theoretical development are also provided, and they are exemplified using many illustrative examples, for real and complex functions.</description>

      <title>Modeling Spatio-Temporal Transport: From Rigid Advection to Realistic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic models for spatio-temporal transport face a critical trade-off between physical realism and interpretability. The advection model with a single constant velocity is interpretable but physically limited by its perfect correlation over time. This work aims to bridge the gap between this simple framework and its physically realistic extensions. Our guiding principle is to introduce a spatial correlation structure that vanishes over time. To achieve this, we present two distinct approaches. The first constructs complex velocity structures, either through superpositions of advection components or by allowing the velocity to vary locally. The second is a spectral technique that replaces the singular spectrum of rigid advection with a more flexible form, introducing temporal decorrelation controlled by parameters. We accompany these models with efficient simulation algorithms and demonstrate their success in replicating complex dynamics, such as tropical cyclones and the solutions of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Group Spike and Slab Variational Bayes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Group Spike-and-slab Variational Bayes (GSVB), a scalable method for group sparse regression. A fast co-ordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI) algorithm is developed for several common model families including Gaussian, Binomial and Poisson. Theoretical guarantees for our proposed approach are provided by deriving contraction rates for the variational posterior in grouped linear regression. Through extensive numerical studies, we demonstrate that GSVB provides state-of-the-art performance, offering a computationally inexpensive substitute to MCMC, whilst performing comparably or better than existing MAP methods. Additionally, we analyze three real world datasets wherein we highlight the practical utility of our method, demonstrating that GSVB provides parsimonious models with excellent predictive performance, variable selection and uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Provably Scalable Black-Box Variational Inference with Structured Variational Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10989v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational families with full-rank covariance approximations are known not to work well in black-box variational inference (BBVI), both empirically and theoretically. In fact, recent computational complexity results for BBVI have established that full-rank variational families scale poorly with the dimensionality of the problem compared to e.g. mean-field families. This is particularly critical to hierarchical Bayesian models with local variables; their dimensionality increases with the size of the datasets. Consequently, one gets an iteration complexity with an explicit $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ dependence on the dataset size $N$. In this paper, we explore a theoretical middle ground between mean-field variational families and full-rank families: structured variational families. We rigorously prove that certain scale matrix structures can achieve a better iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}\left(N\right)$, implying better scaling with respect to $N$. We empirically verify our theoretical results on large-scale hierarchical models.</description>

      <title>Approximate Bayesian Computation with Statistical Distances for Model Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21603v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model selection is a key task in statistics, playing a critical role across various scientific disciplines. While no model can fully capture the complexities of a real-world data-generating process, identifying the model that best approximates it can provide valuable insights. Bayesian statistics offers a flexible framework for model selection by updating prior beliefs as new data becomes available, allowing for ongoing refinement of candidate models. This is typically achieved by calculating posterior probabilities, which quantify the support for each model given the observed data. However, in cases where likelihood functions are intractable, exact computation of these posterior probabilities becomes infeasible. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has emerged as a likelihood-free method and it is traditionally used with summary statistics to reduce data dimensionality, however this often results in information loss difficult to quantify, particularly in model selection contexts. Recent advancements propose the use of full data approaches based on statistical distances, offering a promising alternative that bypasses the need for handcrafted summary statistics and can yield posterior approximations that more closely reflect the true posterior under suitable conditions. Despite these developments, full data ABC approaches have not yet been widely applied to model selection problems. This paper seeks to address this gap by investigating the performance of ABC with statistical distances in model selection. Through simulation studies and an application to toad movement models, this work explores whether full data approaches can overcome the limitations of summary statistic-based ABC for model choice.</description>

      <title>Rebalancing Markov jump processes for non-reversible continuous-time sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are central in computational statistics, and typically rely on detailed balance to ensure invariance with respect to a target distribution. Although straightforward to construct by Metropolization, this can induce diffusion-like exploration of the sample space, requiring careful tuning of parameters such as step size. We introduce a general mechanism for constructing non-reversible continuous-time samplers, without requiring detailed balance. Our approach transforms jump processes satisfying a skew-detailed balance condition for a reference measure into processes sampling a target measure absolutely continuous with respect to it. Unbounded balancing functions allow such samplers to dynamically select favourable transitions. We establish invariance under weak criteria and demonstrate how to verify geometric ergodicity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the resulting samplers are more robust to parameter tuning.</description>

      <title>New sampling approaches for Shrinkage Inverse-Wishart distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose new sampling approaches for the Shrinkage Inverse-Wishart (SIW) distribution, a generalized family of the Inverse-Wishart distribution originally proposed by Berger et al. (2020, Annals of Statistics). It offers a flexible prior for covariance matrices and remains conjugate to the Gaussian likelihood, similar to the classical Inverse-Wishart. Despite these advantages, sampling from SIW remains challenging. The existing algorithm relies on a nested Gibbs sampler, which is slow and lacks rigorous theoretical analysis of its convergence. We propose a new algorithm based on the Sampling Importance Resampling (SIR) method, which is significantly faster and comes with theoretical guarantees on convergence rates. A known issue with SIR methods is the large discrepancy in importance weights, which occurs when the proposal distribution has thinner tails than the target. In the case of SIW, certain parameter settings can lead to such discrepancies, reducing the robustness of the output samples. To sample from such SIW distributions, we robustify the proposed algorithm by including a clipping step to the SIR framework which transforms large importance weights. We provide theoretical results on the convergence behavior in terms of the clipping size, and discuss strategies for choosing this parameter via simulation studies. The robustified version retains the computational efficiency of the original algorithm.</description>
