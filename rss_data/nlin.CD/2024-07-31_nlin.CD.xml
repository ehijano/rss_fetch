      <title>From chimeras to extensive chaos in networks of heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of coupled oscillators can exhibit a wide range of complex dynamical behavior, from complete synchronization to chimera and chaotic states. Here we analyze the dynamics of networks of populations of heterogeneous mean-field coupled Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators and show that the instability that leads to chimera states in a simple two-population model also leads to extensive chaos in large networks of coupled populations. Formally, the system consists of a complex network of interacting oscillator populations whose mesoscopic behavior evolves according to the Ott-Antonsen equations. By considering identical parameters across populations, the system contains a manifold of homogeneous solutions where all populations behave identically. Stability analysis of these homogeneous states provided by the Master Stability Function shows that non-trivial dynamics might emerge on a wide region of the parameter space for arbitrary network topologies. As examples, we first revisit the two-population case, and provide a complete bifurcation diagram. Then, we investigate the emergent dynamics in large ring and Erd\"os-R\'enyi networks. In both cases, transverse instabilities lead to extensive space-time chaos, i.e., irregular regimes whose complexity scales linearly with the system size. In summary, our work provides a unified analytical framework to understand the emergent dynamics of networks of Kuramoto populations, from chimera states to robust high-dimensional chaos.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics of a Superconducting Szilard Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement a Szilard engine that uses a 2-bit logical unit consisting of coupled quantum flux parametrons -- Josephson-junction superconducting circuits originally designed for quantum computing. Detailed simulations show that it is highly thermodynamically efficient while functioning as a Maxwell demon. The physically-calibrated design is targeted to direct experimental exploration. However, variations in Josephson junction fabrication introduce asymmetries that result in energy inefficiency and low operational fidelity. We provide a design solution that mitigates these practical challenges. The resulting platform is ideally suited to probe the thermodynamic foundations of information processing devices far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Detecting Causality in the Frequency Domain with Cross-Mapping Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding causal relationships within a system is crucial for uncovering its underlying mechanisms. Causal discovery methods, which facilitate the construction of such models from time-series data, hold the potential to significantly advance scientific and engineering fields.
  This study introduces the Cross-Mapping Coherence (CMC) method, designed to reveal causal connections in the frequency domain between time series. CMC builds upon nonlinear state-space reconstruction and extends the Convergent Cross-Mapping algorithm to the frequency domain by utilizing coherence metrics for evaluation. We tested the Cross-Mapping Coherence method using simulations of logistic maps, Lorenz systems, Kuramoto oscillators, and the Wilson-Cowan model of the visual cortex. CMC accurately identified the direction of causal connections in all simulated scenarios. When applied to the Wilson-Cowan model, CMC yielded consistent results similar to spectral Granger causality.
  Furthermore, CMC exhibits high sensitivity in detecting weak connections, demonstrates sample efficiency, and maintains robustness in the presence of noise.
  In conclusion, the capability to determine directed causal influences across different frequency bands allows CMC to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of complex, nonlinear systems.</description>
