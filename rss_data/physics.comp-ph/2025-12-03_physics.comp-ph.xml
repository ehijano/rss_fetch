      <title>Towards a fully differentiable digital twin for solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximizing energy yield (EY) - the total electric energy generated by a solar cell within a year at a specific location - is crucial in photovoltaics (PV), especially for emerging technologies. Computational methods provide the necessary insights and guidance for future research. However, existing simulations typically focus on only isolated aspects of solar cells. This lack of consistency highlights the need for a framework unifying all computational levels, from material to cell properties, for accurate prediction and optimization of EY prediction. To address this challenge, a differentiable digital twin, Sol(Di)$^2$T, is introduced to enable comprehensive end-to-end optimization of solar cells. The workflow starts with material properties and morphological processing parameters, followed by optical and electrical simulations. Finally, climatic conditions and geographic location are incorporated to predict the EY. Each step is either intrinsically differentiable or replaced with a machine-learned surrogate model, enabling not only accurate EY prediction but also gradient-based optimization with respect to input parameters. Consequently, Sol(Di)$^2$T extends EY predictions to previously unexplored conditions. Demonstrated for an organic solar cell, the proposed framework marks a significant step towards tailoring solar cells for specific applications while ensuring maximal performance.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium modeling of lyotropic liquid crystals: from binary simulations to multi-component theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamically consistent theoretical framework for lyotropic liquid crystals (LCs) based on the GENERIC (General Equation for the Non-Equilibrium Reversible-Irreversible Coupling) formalism. This formalism ensures conservation of energy and production of entropy, while coupling concentration, momentum balance, and liquid crystalline order. Starting from a binary nematic-isotropic mixture, we derive a theory for these key variables, which is then extended to multi-component systems.
  The binary equations are solved numerically using a Julia-based solver that relies on an upwind finite-difference scheme, enabling stable and efficient simulations capable of handling multiple time scales while satisfying fundamental mathematical constraints. The results of simulations are consistent with experimental observations of topological core defects in chromonic LCs, as well as flow-driven droplet shape transitions under Couette and Poiseuille flows.
  This work provides a platform for simulations of multi-component lyotropic LCs that can be extended to systems with multiple interfaces, active materials, and materials subject to external fields.</description>

      <title>Geant4 Modeling of Energy and Charge Deposition in Satellites Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding radiation effects in spacecraft components is critical for predicting long-term performance degradation. In this work, a Geant4 Monte Carlo model is developed to compute charge and energy deposition in satellite solar-cell materials exposed to electrons, protons, and X-ray environments. The model is validated against published experimental and computational benchmarks and shows strong agreement across multiple energy ranges. Power-density deposition profiles are then evaluated for a multi-layer solar-cell structure under blackbody soft X-rays, mono-energetic X-rays, and high-energy electrons. The results show that low-energy X-rays dominate damage in surface layers, while high-energy particles penetrate deeper into semiconductor and substrate layers, posing risk to electronic components. These findings highlight the importance of radiation-specific shielding strategies for space solar-cell design.</description>

      <title>Improved Ising Meson Spectroscopy Simulation on a Noisy Digital Quantum Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transverse-field Ising model serves as a paradigm for studying confinement and excitation spectra, particularly the emergence of $E_8$ symmetry near criticality. However, experimentally resolving the Ising meson spectroscopy required to verify these symmetries is challenging on near-term quantum hardware due to the depth of circuits required for real-time evolution. Here, we demonstrate improved spectroscopy of confined excitations using two distinct error-resilient circuit construction techniques on the IBM Torino device: first-order Trotter decomposition utilizing native fractional gates, and a tensor-network-based circuit compression via Riemannian optimization. By analyzing the Fourier spectrum of error-mitigated time-series data, we successfully identify key signatures of $E_8$ symmetry despite hardware noise. These results validate the viability of both circuit compression and hardware-efficient compilation for probing complex topological phenomena on NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of the 2D Hubbard Model via Hilbert Space-Filling Curve Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate tensor network simulations of the two-dimensional Hubbard model by mapping the lattice onto a one-dimensional chain using space-filling curves. In particular, we focus on the Hilbert curve, whose locality-preserving structure minimizes the range of effective interactions in the mapped model. This enables a more compact matrix product state (MPS) representation compared to conventional snake mapping. Through systematic benchmarks, we show that the Hilbert curve consistently yields lower ground-state energies at fixed bond dimension, with the advantage increasing for larger system sizes and in physically relevant interaction regimes. Our implementation reaches clusters up to $32\times32$ sites with open and periodic boundary conditions, delivering reliable ground-state energies and correlation functions in agreement with established results, but at significantly reduced computational cost. These findings establish space-filling curve mappings, particularly the Hilbert curve, as a powerful tool for extending tensor-network studies of strongly correlated two-dimensional quantum systems beyond the limits accessible with standard approaches.</description>

      <title>Rational regulation strategies of interstitial localized electrons in electride: A density functional theory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a class of electron-rich materials, electrides demonstrate promising applications in many fields. However, the required high pressure restricts the practical applications to some extent. This study reveals that the unique feature of electride, i.e., the localization of interstitial electrons, can be greatly enhanced and tuned by self-defective doping, applying tensile/compressive stress, or shear stress. Moreover, the requirement of orbital orthogonality between the valence and core electron wave functions, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle, should be the driven force for the electron interstitial localization; and the exertion of external pressure modifies the available space to accommodate the electronic wave functions, thus enhances the interstitial localization. These discoveries lay down the ground for searching for promising electrides that are practicable at ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Modulation of DNA rheology by a transcription factor that forms aging microgels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins and nucleic acids form non-Newtonian liquids with complex rheological properties that contribute to their function in vivo. Here we investigate the rheology of the transcription factor NANOG, a key protein in sustaining embryonic stem cell self-renewal. We discover that at high concentrations NANOG forms macroscopic aging gels through its intrinsically disordered tryptophan-rich domain. By combining molecular dynamics simulations, mass photometry and Cryo-EM, we also discover that NANOG forms self-limiting micelle-like clusters which expose their DNA-binding domains. In dense solutions of DNA, NANOG micelle-like structures stabilize intermolecular entanglements and crosslinks, forming microgel-like structures. Our findings suggest that NANOG may contribute to regulate gene expression in a unconventional way: by restricting and stabilizing genome dynamics at key transcriptional sites through the formation of an aging microgel-like structure, potentially enabling mechanical memory in the gene network.</description>

      <title>Lower Bound on the Representation Complexity of Antisymmetric Tensor Product Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor product function (TPF) approximations have been widely adopted in solving high-dimensional problems, such as partial differential equations and eigenvalue problems, achieving desirable accuracy with computational overhead that scales linearly with problem dimensions. However, recent studies have underscored the extraordinarily high computational cost of TPFs on quantum many-body problems, even for systems with as few as three particles. A key distinction in these problems is the antisymmetry requirement on the unknown functions. In the present work, we rigorously establish that the minimum number of involved terms for a class of TPFs to be exactly antisymmetric increases exponentially fast with the problem dimension. This class encompasses both traditionally discretized TPFs and the recent ones parameterized by neural networks. Our proof exploits the link between the antisymmetric TPFs in this class and the corresponding antisymmetric tensors and focuses on the Canonical Polyadic rank of the latter. As a result, our findings reveal that low-rank TPFs are fundamentally unsuitable for high-dimensional problems where antisymmetry is essential.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lanczos method for systematic optimization of neural-network quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, artificial intelligence for science has made significant inroads into various fields of natural science research. In the field of quantum many-body computation, researchers have developed numerous ground state solvers based on neural-network quantum states (NQSs), achieving ground state energies with accuracy comparable to or surpassing traditional methods such as variational Monte Carlo methods, density matrix renormalization group, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Here, we combine supervised learning, variational Monte Carlo (VMC), and the Lanczos method to develop a systematic approach to improving the NQSs of many-body systems, which we refer to as the NQS Lanczos method. The algorithm mainly consists of two parts: the supervised learning part and the VMC optimization part. Through supervised learning, the Lanczos states are represented by the NQSs. Through VMC, the NQSs are further optimized. We analyze the reasons for the underfitting problem and demonstrate how the NQS Lanczos method systematically improves the energy in the highly frustrated regime of the two-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model. Compared to the existing method that combines the Lanczos method with the restricted Boltzmann machine, the primary advantage of the NQS Lanczos method is its linearly increasing computational cost.</description>

      <title>Julia in HEP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Julia is a mature general-purpose programming language, with a large ecosystem of libraries and more than 12000 third-party packages, which specifically targets scientific computing. As a language, Julia is as dynamic, interactive, and accessible as Python with NumPy, but achieves run-time performance on par with C/C++. In this paper, we describe the state of adoption of Julia in HEP, where momentum has been gathering over a number of years.
  HEP-oriented Julia packages can already, via UnROOT.jl, read HEP's major file formats, including TTree and RNTuple. Interfaces to some of HEP's major software packages, such as through Geant4.jl, are available too. Jet reconstruction algorithms in Julia show excellent performance. A number of full HEP analyses have been performed in Julia.
  We show how, as the support for HEP has matured, developments have benefited from Julia's core design choices, which makes reuse from and integration with other packages easy. In particular, libraries developed outside HEP for plotting, statistics, fitting, and scientific machine learning are extremely useful.
  We believe that the powerful combination of flexibility and speed, the wide selection of scientific programming tools, and support for all modern programming paradigms and tools, make Julia the ideal choice for a future language in HEP.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state energy for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ &amp; $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in almost all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.</description>

      <title>A general polynomial emulator for cosmology via moment projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02179v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MomentEmu, a general-purpose polynomial emulator for fast and interpretable mappings between theoretical parameters and observational features. The method constructs moment matrices to project simulation data onto polynomial bases, yielding symbolic expressions that approximate the target mapping. Compared to neural-network-based emulators, MomentEmu offers negligible training cost, millisecond-level evaluation, and transparent functional forms. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we develop two emulators: PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$, which maps six cosmological parameters to the CMB power spectra (TT, EE, BB, TE), and PolyCAMB-peak, which enables a bidirectional mapping between the cosmological parameters and the acoustic peak features of $D_\ell^{\rm TT}$. PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$ achieves sub-percent accuracy over multipoles $\ell \leq 4050$, while PolyCAMB-peak also attains comparable precision and produces symbolic forms consistent with known analytical approximations. The method is well suited for forward modelling, parameter inference, and uncertainty propagation, particularly when the parameter space is moderate in dimensionality and the mapping is smooth. MomentEmu offers a lightweight and portable alternative to regression-based or black-box emulators in cosmological analysis.</description>

      <title>Scalable ADER-DG Transport Method with Polynomial Order Independent CFL Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are known to suffer from increasingly restrictive explicit time-step constraints as the polynomial order increases, limiting their efficiency at high orders for explicit time-stepping schemes. In this paper, we introduce a novel \emph{locally implicit}, but \emph{globally explicit} ADER-DG scheme designed for transport-dominated problems. The method achieves a maximum stable time step governed by an element-width based CFL condition that is independent of the polynomial degree. By solving a set of element-local implicit problems at each time step, our approach more effectively utilises the domain of dependence. As a result, our method remains stable for CFL numbers up to $\approx 1/\sqrt{d}$ in $d$ spatial dimensions. We provide a rigorous stability proof in one dimension, and extend the analysis to two and three dimensions using a semi-analytical von Neumann stability analysis. The accuracy and convergence of the method are demonstrated through numerical experiments for both linear and nonlinear test cases, including numerical simulations of a transport problem on a cubed sphere 2D manifold embedded in 3D.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Pruning for Increased Robustness and Reduced Computational Overhead in Gaussian Process Accelerated Saddle Point Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made. Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires significant computational effort.</description>

      <title>Dimension- and Facet-Dependent Altermagnetic Biferroics and Ferromagnetic Biferroics and Triferroics in CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently garnered significant interest due to their vanishing net magnetic moment and non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. However, altermagnetic (AM) multiferroics especially triferroics remain scarce. We investigate the experimentally synthesized non-van der Waals CrSb as a model system to explore the effects of dimensionality and facet orientation on its ferroic properties. NiAs, MnP, wurtzite (WZ), zincblende (ZB), and rocksalt (RS) phases are considered. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the altermagnetism of CrSb in MnP phase which has comparable stability with experimental NiAs phase. Both NiAs- and MnP-phase (110) facets exhibit AM-ferroelastic (FC) biferroics, while the WZ-phase bulk and (001) facets host ferromagnetic (FM) or AM-ferroelectric (FE) biferroics. Notably, the WZ-phase (110) facets are identified as FM/AM-FE-FC triferroics, with moderate energy barriers of 0.129 and 0.363 eV atom-1 for FE and FC switching, respectively. Both FE and FC switching can reverse the AM spin splitting in antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations while preserving the high spin polarization in FM states. The magnetic anisotropy is highly tunable, exhibiting either uniaxial or in-plane behavior depending on the phase, dimension, and facet. This work establishes a framework for designing AM multiferroics through polymorphic, dimensional, and facet engineering, offering promising avenues for multifunctional spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Common Task Framework For a Critical Evaluation of Scientific Machine Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23166v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is transforming modeling and control in the physical, engineering, and biological sciences. However, rapid development has outpaced the creation of standardized, objective benchmarks - leading to weak baselines, reporting bias, and inconsistent evaluations across methods. This undermines reproducibility, misguides resource allocation, and obscures scientific progress. To address this, we propose a Common Task Framework (CTF) for scientific machine learning. The CTF features a curated set of datasets and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, state reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints, including noise and limited data. Inspired by the success of CTFs in fields like natural language processing and computer vision, our framework provides a structured, rigorous foundation for head-to-head evaluation of diverse algorithms. As a first step, we benchmark methods on two canonical nonlinear systems: Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Lorenz. These results illustrate the utility of the CTF in revealing method strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific classes of problems and diverse objectives. Next, we are launching a competition around a global real world sea surface temperature dataset with a true holdout dataset to foster community engagement. Our long-term vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets that raise the bar for rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML.</description>

      <title>Tailored Three Dimensional Betatron Dynamics in UltraStable Hybrid Laser Plasma RF Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detailed theoretical and numerical investigation of hybrid laser plasma RF accelerators, elucidating the mechanisms governing transverse beam dynamics, betatron polarization, and radiation reaction in ultra-relativistic electron bunches is presented. This framework combines analytical models of spatiotemporal plasma wakefield modulation, phase-dependent RF-driven oscillations, and quantum-corrected Landau Lifshitz radiation reaction with fully self-consistent 3D particle in cell simulations using EPOCH. The results demonstrate that RF amplitude, frequency, and phase enable precise control over transverse focusing strengths, betatron oscillation amplitudes, and polarization states. Resonant alignment between RF fields and natural betatron frequencies amplifies transverse excursions while damping parasitic oscillations through enhanced focusing gradients and radiation reaction, yielding reductions in emittance and mitigation of synchrotron-like energy losses. Stability maps and 3D force landscapes reveal strong phase sensitivity, where initial conditions and RF component ratios govern the temporal evolution of betatron amplitudes, and longitudinal field gradients modulate {\gamma} growth rates. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of nonlinear, resonant, and damping phenomena in hybrid laser plasma RF systems, highlighting the full spectrum of controllable transverse, longitudinal, and polarization dynamics in ultra relativistic electron beams.</description>

      <title>Distortion-Driven Carrier Decoupling in Doped LiMgPO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between lattice distortions and charge carriers governs the properties of many functional oxides. In alkali-doped LiMgPO4, a significant enhancement in dosimetric response is observed, but its microscopic origin is not understood. Using non-adiabatic molecular dynamics, we reveal a fundamental mechanism of carrier decoupling driven by a hierarchy of lattice distortions. We show that electrons localize into stable small polarons on an ultrafast timescale, trapped by the strong local potential induced by the dopant, while holes form more delocalized polarons that migrate efficiently through a lattice smoothed by global strain. The stark contrast between the dynamics of trapped electrons and mobile holes explains the suppressed recombination and enhanced energy storage. These results present a clear physical picture of how multiscale lattice distortions can independently control electron and hole transport, offering new insights into the physics of polarons in complex materials.</description>
