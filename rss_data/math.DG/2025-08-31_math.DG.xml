      <title>Blow-up phenomena for the constant scalar curvature and constant boundary mean curvature equation (after Chen and Wu)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the compactness of the solutions to the constant scalar curvature and constant boundary mean curvature equation is considered. Chen and Wu constructed a smooth counterexample showing that the compactness of the set of ``lower energy" solutions to the above equation fails when the dimension of the manifold is not less than 62. We prove that a smooth counterexample still exists when the dimension of the manifold is not less than 35.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to ordinary differential equations of the form $$\frac{\partial^2y}{(\partial x)^2}=a^3(x, y)(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x})^3+a^2(x, y)(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x})^2+a^1(x,y)\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}+a^0(x, y) $$ The algebra of all differential invariants of point transformations is constructed for these equations in general position and the equivalence problem is solved for them.</description>

      <title>Sectional Curvature, Isotropic Curvature, and Yau's Pinching Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a closed Riemannian manifold $(M^n,g)$ has finite fundamental group and satisfies the curvature condition \begin{equation*}
  R_{1313} +R_{1414} +R_{2323} + R_{2424} &gt; \tfrac{1}{2}\left(R_{1212} + R_{3434}\right) \end{equation*} for all orthonormal four-frame $\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\} \subset T_pM$, then $M$ is homeomorphic to a spherical space form. This generalizes the famous sphere theorem under the stronger condition of $\frac{1}{4}$-pinched sectional curvature. As an application, we provide a partial answer to a pinching problem proposed by Yau in 1990.</description>

      <title>Nearly Parallel \texorpdfstring{$\G_{2}$}{G2}-Structures with Torus Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nearly parallel $\G_{2}$-structures with a three-torus symmetry via multi-moment map techniques. An effective three-torus action on a nearly parallel $\G_{2}$-manifold yields a multi-moment map. The torus acts freely on its regular level sets, so they are torus bundles over smooth three-dimensional manifolds. We show that the geometry of the base spaces is specified by two triples of closed two-forms related by a Riemannian metric. We then describe an inverse construction producing invariant nearly parallel $\G_{2}$-structures from three-dimensional data. We observe that locally this may produce examples with four-torus symmetry.</description>

      <title>Characteristic tensors for almost Finsler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost Finsler manifolds and partial Finsler manifolds are introduced, extending the standard definition of a Finsler manifold to allow for a nontrivial slit containing points fixed under homogeneous scaling and for metrics where the fundamental tensor has nonpositive eigenvalues. The bipartite spaces offer examples of comparatively simple almost Finsler manifolds and partial Finsler manifolds with physics applications. Special cases are the $\bf{a}$ and $\bf{b}$ spaces, which have almost Finsler norms and partial Finsler norms formed from a Riemannian norm and a 1-form. The indicatrix union of the almost Finsler $\bf{a}$ manifolds equals the indicatrix union of Randers spaces. Characteristic tensors that vanish for bipartite spaces and $\bf{b}$ spaces are obtained and expressed using geometric quantities. These tensors are generalizations of the Matsumoto tensor, which vanishes on Randers and $\bf{a}$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Quantitative estimates for the relative isoperimetric problem and its gradient flow outside convex bodies in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove three related quantitative results for the relative isoperimetric problem outside a convex body $\Omega$ in the plane: (1) {\L}ojasiewicz estimates and quantitative rigidity for critical points, (2) rates of convergence for the gradient flow, and (3) quantitative stability for minimizers. These results come with explicit constants and optimal exponents/rates, and hold whenever a simple two-dimensional auxiliary variational problem for circular arcs outside of $\Omega$ is nondegenerate. The proofs are inter-related, and in particular, for the first time in the context of isoperimetric problems, a flow approach is used to prove quantitative stability for minimizers.</description>

      <title>Constructibility of momentum maps and linear variation for singular symplectic reduced spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the transverse image of the momentum map of a Hamiltonian Lie group action admits a natural integral affine stratification with the property that over each stratum the momentum map is an equivariantly locally trivial fibration, provided the group is compact and the momentum map is proper. Using this we extend the linear variation theorem of Duistermaat and Heckman to singular values of the momentum map by showing that the cohomology classes of the symplectic forms on the reduced spaces at values within a stratum vary linearly. We also point out an instance of an invariant cycle theorem for momentum maps. Finally, we extend all of the above to Hamiltonian actions of proper quasi-symplectic groupoids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a sharp upper bound for the bottom spectrum of the Beltrami Laplacian on universal covers of closed Riemannian manifolds with scalar curvature lower bound. Moreover, we prove a scalar curvature rigidity theorem when this bound is achieved. Additionally, we prove a net characterization of scalar curvature for general complete noncompact Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Higher Fundamental Forms and Warped Product Hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Warped products are one of the simplest families of Riemannian manifolds that can have non-trivial geometries. In this article, we characterize the geometry of hypersurface embeddings arising from warped product manifolds using the language of higher (Riemannian) fundamental forms. In a similar vein, we also study the geometry of conformal manifolds with embedded hypersurfaces that admits a trivialization of the conformal metric to a product metric, with base manifold given by the embedded hypersurface. We show that the higher conformal fundamental forms play a critical role in their characterization.</description>

      <title>Minimal tori in $\mathbb{R}^4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe tools for the study of minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^4$; some are classical (the Gauss maps) and some are newer (the link/braid/writhe at infinity). Then we look for complete proper non holomorphic minimal tori with total curvature $-8\pi$ and a single end immersed in $\mathbb{R}^4$. We translate the problem into a system of $10$ quadratic or linear equations in $11$ real variables with coefficients in terms of the Weierstrass function $\wp$ and give explicit solutions for these equations if $T$ is a rectangular torus. For the square torus, we have a complete answer with a unique family of solutions generalizing the Chen-Gackstetter torus in $\mathbb{R}^3$. On the other hand, we show that there is no solution on the equianharmonic torus.</description>

      <title>Equivariant instanton homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.01091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define four versions of equivariant instanton Floer homology ($I^+, I^-, I^\infty$ and $\widetilde I$) for a class of 3-manifolds and $SO(3)$-bundles over them including all rational homology spheres. These versions are analogous to the four flavors of monopole and Heegaard Floer homology theories. This construction is functorial for a large class of 4-manifold cobordisms, and agrees with Donaldson's definition of equivariant instanton homology for integer homology spheres. Furthermore, one of our invariants is isomorphic to Floer's instanton homology for admissible bundles, and we calculate $I^\infty$ in all cases it is defined, away from characteristic 2.
  The appendix, possibly of independent interest, defines an algebraic construction of three equivariant homology theories for dg-modules over a dg-algebra, the equivariant homology $H^+(A,M)$, the coBorel homology $H^-(A,M)$, and the Tate homology $H^\infty(A,M)$. The constructions of the appendix are used to define our invariants.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study lightlikeness preserving mappings from the $4$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime $\mathcal{M}_4$ to itself under no additional regularity assumptions like continuity, surjectivity, or injectivity. We prove that such a mapping $\phi$ satisfies one of the following three conditions. (1) The mapping $\phi$ can be written as a composition of a Lorentz transformation, a multiplication by a positive scalar, and a translation. (2) There is an event $r\in \mathcal{M}_4$ such that $\phi(\mathcal{M}_4\setminus\{r\})$ is contained in one light cone. (3) There is a lightlike line $\ell$ such that $\phi(\mathcal{M}_4\setminus \ell)$ is contained in another lightlike line. Here, a line that is contained in some light cone in $\mathcal{M}_4$ is called a lightlike line. We also give several similar results on mappings defined on a certain subset of $\mathcal{M}_4$ or the compactification of $\mathcal{M}_4$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Networks: Bridging higher-rank Teichm\"uller theory and BPS states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book offers a comprehensive introduction to spectral networks from a unified viewpoint that bridges geometry with the physics of supersymmetric gauge theories. It provides the foundational background needed to approach the frontiers of this rapidly evolving field, treating geometric and physical aspects in parallel. After surveying fundamental topics in algebra and geometry, a detailed introduction to higher-rank Teichm\"uller theory is developed, including Fock-Goncharov theory for Hitchin representations, maximal representations and the more recent notion of $\Theta$-positivity. Spectral networks are subsequently introduced, emphasizing their utility in the study of character varieties via the abelianization and non-abelianization maps they define. In parallel, key aspects of four-dimensional gauge dynamics with eight supercharges are explored, including electric-magnetic duality, Seiberg-Witten theory, and class $\mathcal S$ theories. The role of spectral networks as a framework for determining and analyzing BPS spectra in class $\mathcal S$ theories is then examined. The final chapter outlines recent applications of spectral networks across a range of contemporary research areas. This volume is intended for researchers and advanced students in either mathematics or physics who wish to enter the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We complete the classification of all smooth 4-dimensional Kahler geometries admitting a twistor (conformal Killing-Yano) 2-form invariant under a 2-torus action. We establish that there are six geometrically distinct families, and we provide them in a simple form amenable to calculations and compute their curvature. We also find that for toric geometries the square norm of the twistor 2-form is quadratic in moment maps, and we are led to conjecture that this holds when less symmetry is present.</description>

      <title>Tangent Currents, King's Residue Formula and Intersection Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the intersection of positive closed currents on domains using the theory of tangent currents in connection with King's residue formula. One of the main results provides a reasonable sufficient condition for the definition of the (proper) intersection of positive closed currents on domains. Another is an analytic description of the self-intersection of analytic subsets. The key idea is to connect tangent currents to complex Monge-Amp\`ere type currents. We also investigate the existence, the $h$-dimension and the shadow of tangent currents. Additionally, we introduce local regularizations of positive closed currents, examine classical examples and look into the relationship between our approach and slicing theory. Our work extends to general complex manifolds including compact K\"ahler manifolds.</description>
