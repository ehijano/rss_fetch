      <title>Benchmarking Automatic Speech Recognition for Indian Languages in Agricultural Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digitization of agricultural advisory services in India requires robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems capable of accurately transcribing domain-specific terminology in multiple Indian languages. This paper presents a benchmarking framework for evaluating ASR performance in agricultural contexts across Hindi, Telugu, and Odia languages. We introduce evaluation metrics including Agriculture Weighted Word Error Rate (AWWER) and domain-specific utility scoring to complement traditional metrics. Our evaluation of 10,934 audio recordings, each transcribed by up to 10 ASR models, reveals performance variations across languages and models, with Hindi achieving the best overall performance (WER: 16.2%) while Odia presents the greatest challenges (best WER: 35.1%, achieved only with speaker diarization). We characterize audio quality challenges inherent to real-world agricultural field recordings and demonstrate that speaker diarization with best-speaker selection can substantially reduce WER for multi-speaker recordings (upto 66% depending on the proportion of multi-speaker audio). We identify recurring error patterns in agricultural terminology and provide practical recommendations for improving ASR systems in low-resource agricultural domains. The study establishes baseline benchmarks for future agricultural ASR development.</description>

      <title>Sounding Highlights: Dual-Pathway Audio Encoders for Audio-Visual Video Highlight Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03891v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-visual video highlight detection aims to automatically identify the most salient moments in videos by leveraging both visual and auditory cues. However, existing models often underutilize the audio modality, focusing on high-level semantic features while failing to fully leverage the rich, dynamic characteristics of sound. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Dual-Pathway Audio Encoders for Video Highlight Detection (DAViHD). The dual-pathway audio encoder is composed of a semantic pathway for content understanding and a dynamic pathway that captures spectro-temporal dynamics. The semantic pathway extracts high-level information by identifying the content within the audio, such as speech, music, or specific sound events. The dynamic pathway employs a frequency-adaptive mechanism as time evolves to jointly model these dynamics, enabling it to identify transient acoustic events via salient spectral bands and rapid energy changes. We integrate the novel audio encoder into a full audio-visual framework and achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale MrHiSum benchmark. Our results demonstrate that a sophisticated, dual-faceted audio representation is key to advancing the field of highlight detection.</description>

      <title>Universal Robust Speech Adaptation for Cross-Domain Speech Recognition and Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech enhancement (SE) have exhibited remarkable capabilities under matched noise and channel conditions. However, these models often suffer from severe performance degradation when confronted with domain shifts, particularly in the presence of unseen noise and channel distortions. In view of this, we in this paper present URSA-GAN, a unified and domain-aware generative framework specifically designed to mitigate mismatches in both noise and channel conditions. URSA-GAN leverages a dual-embedding architecture that consists of a noise encoder and a channel encoder, each pre-trained with limited in-domain data to capture domain-relevant representations. These embeddings condition a GAN-based speech generator, facilitating the synthesis of speech that is acoustically aligned with the target domain while preserving phonetic content. To enhance generalization further, we propose dynamic stochastic perturbation, a novel regularization technique that introduces controlled variability into the embeddings during generation, promoting robustness to unseen domains. Empirical results demonstrate that URSA-GAN effectively reduces character error rates in ASR and improves perceptual metrics in SE across diverse noisy and mismatched channel scenarios. Notably, evaluations on compound test conditions with both channel and noise degradations confirm the generalization ability of URSA-GAN, yielding relative improvements of 16.16% in ASR performance and 15.58% in SE metrics.</description>

      <title>LALM-as-a-Judge: Benchmarking Large Audio-Language Models for Safety Evaluation in Multi-Turn Spoken Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoken dialogues with and between voice agents are becoming increasingly common, yet assessing them for their socially harmful content such as violence, harassment, and hate remains text-centric and fails to account for audio-specific cues and transcription errors. We present LALM-as-a-Judge, the first controlled benchmark and systematic study of large audio-language models (LALMs) as safety judges for multi-turn spoken dialogues. We generate 24,000 unsafe and synthetic spoken dialogues in English that consist of 3-10 turns, by having a single dialogue turn including content with one of 8 harmful categories (e.g., violence) and on one of 5 grades, from very mild to severe. On 160 dialogues, 5 human raters confirmed reliable unsafe detection and a meaningful severity scale. We benchmark three open-source LALMs: Qwen2-Audio, Audio Flamingo 3, and MERaLiON as zero-shot judges that output a scalar safety score in [0,1] across audio-only, transcription-only, or multimodal inputs, along with a transcription-only LLaMA baseline. We measure the judges' sensitivity to detecting unsafe content, the specificity in ordering severity levels, and the stability of the score in dialogue turns. Results reveal architecture- and modality-dependent trade-offs: the most sensitive judge is also the least stable across turns, while stable configurations sacrifice detection of mild harmful content. Transcription quality is a key bottleneck: Whisper-Large may significantly reduce sensitivity for transcription-only modes, while largely preserving severity ordering. Audio becomes crucial when paralinguistic cues or transcription fidelity are category-critical. We summarize all findings and provide actionable guidance for practitioners.</description>

      <title>Decoding Ambiguous Emotions with Test-Time Scaling in Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition from human speech is a critical enabler for socially aware conversational AI. However, while most prior work frames emotion recognition as a categorical classification problem, real-world affective states are often ambiguous, overlapping, and context-dependent, posing significant challenges for both annotation and automatic modeling. Recent large-scale audio language models (ALMs) offer new opportunities for nuanced affective reasoning without explicit emotion supervision, but their capacity to handle ambiguous emotions remains underexplored. At the same time, advances in inference-time techniques such as test-time scaling (TTS) have shown promise for improving generalization and adaptability in hard NLP tasks, but their relevance to affective computing is still largely unknown. In this work, we introduce the first benchmark for ambiguous emotion recognition in speech with ALMs under test-time scaling. Our evaluation systematically compares eight state-of-the-art ALMs and five TTS strategies across three prominent speech emotion datasets. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the interaction between model capacity, TTS, and affective ambiguity, offering new insights into the computational and representational challenges of ambiguous emotion understanding. Our benchmark establishes a foundation for developing more robust, context-aware, and emotionally intelligent speech-based AI systems, and highlights key future directions for bridging the gap between model assumptions and the complexity of real-world human emotion.</description>

      <title>Audit After Segmentation: Reference-Free Mask Quality Assessment for Language-Referred Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language-referred audio-visual segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects described by natural language by jointly reasoning over video, audio, and text. Beyond generating segmentation masks, providing rich and interpretable diagnoses of mask quality remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Mask Quality Assessment in the Ref-AVS context (MQA-RefAVS), a new task that evaluates the quality of candidate segmentation masks without relying on ground-truth annotations as references at inference time. Given audio-visual-language inputs and each provided segmentation mask, the task requires estimating its IoU with the unobserved ground truth, identifying the corresponding error type, and recommending an actionable quality-control decision. To support this task, we construct MQ-RAVSBench, a benchmark featuring diverse and representative mask error modes that span both geometric and semantic issues. We further propose MQ-Auditor, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based auditor that explicitly reasons over multimodal cues and mask information to produce quantitative and qualitative mask quality assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs and can be integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems to detect segmentation failures and support downstream segmentation improvement. Data and codes will be released at https://github.com/jasongief/MQA-RefAVS.</description>

      <title>Frontend Token Enhancement for Token-Based Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discretized representations of speech signals are efficient alternatives to continuous features for various speech applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech language models. However, these representations, such as semantic or phonetic tokens derived from clustering outputs of self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models, are susceptible to environmental noise, which can degrade backend task performance. In this work, we introduce a frontend system that estimates clean speech tokens from noisy speech and evaluate it on an ASR backend using semantic tokens. We consider four types of enhancement models based on their input/output domains: wave-to-wave, token-to-token, continuous SSL features-to-token, and wave-to-token. These models are trained independently of ASR backends. Experiments on the CHiME-4 dataset demonstrate that wave-to-token enhancement achieves the best performance among the frontends. Moreover, it mostly outperforms the ASR system based on continuous SSL features.</description>

      <title>Speaker-Aware Simulation Improves Conversational Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for conversational speech remains challenging due to the limited availability of large-scale, well-annotated multi-speaker dialogue data and the complex temporal dynamics of natural interactions. Speaker-aware simulated conversations (SASC) offer an effective data augmentation strategy by transforming single-speaker recordings into realistic multi-speaker dialogues. However, prior work has primarily focused on English data, leaving questions about the applicability to lower-resource languages. In this paper, we adapt and implement the SASC framework for Hungarian conversational ASR. We further propose C-SASC, an extended variant that incorporates pause modeling conditioned on utterance duration, enabling a more faithful representation of local temporal dependencies observed in human conversation while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of the original approach. We generate synthetic Hungarian dialogues from the BEA-Large corpus and combine them with real conversational data for ASR training. Both SASC and C-SASC are evaluated extensively under a wide range of simulation configurations, using conversational statistics derived from CallHome, BEA-Dialogue, and GRASS corpora. Experimental results show that speaker-aware conversational simulation consistently improves recognition performance over naive concatenation-based augmentation. While the additional duration conditioning in C-SASC yields modest but systematic gains--most notably in character-level error rates--its effectiveness depends on the match between source conversational statistics and the target domain. Overall, our findings confirm the robustness of speaker-aware conversational simulation for Hungarian ASR and highlight the benefits and limitations of increasingly detailed temporal modeling in synthetic dialogue generation.</description>

      <title>EDNet: A Versatile Speech Enhancement Framework with Gating Mamba Mechanism and Phase Shift-Invariant Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech signals in real-world environments are frequently affected by various distortions such as additive noise, reverberation, and bandwidth limitation, which may appear individually or in combination. Traditional speech enhancement methods typically rely on either masking, which focuses on suppressing non-speech components while preserving observable structure, or mapping, which seeks to recover clean speech through direct transformation of the input. Each approach offers strengths in specific scenarios but may be less effective outside its target conditions. We propose the Erase and Draw Network (EDNet), a versatile speech enhancement framework designed to handle a broad range of distortion types without prior assumptions about task or input characteristics. EDNet consists of two main components: (1) the Gating Mamba (GM) module, which adaptively combines masking and mapping through a learnable gating mechanism that selects between suppression (Erase) and reconstruction (Draw) based on local signal features, and (2) Phase Shift-Invariant Training (PSIT), a shift tolerant supervision strategy that improves phase estimation by enabling dynamic alignment during training while remaining compatible with standard loss functions. Experimental results on denoising, dereverberation, bandwidth extension, and multi distortion enhancement tasks show that EDNet consistently achieves strong performance across conditions, demonstrating its architectural flexibility and adaptability to diverse task settings.</description>

      <title>MOSA: Mixtures of Simple Adapters Outperform Monolithic Approaches in LLM-based Multilingual ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based ASR overcomes multilingual data scarcity by projecting speech representations into the LLM space to leverage its robust semantic and reasoning capabilities. However, while previous approaches typically enhance performance by scaling data or model parameters, a single projector often struggles to effectively align representations across different languages. In this work, we propose an MoE-based projector named MOSA (Mixture of Simple Adapters). By aggregating multiple simple adapters, this architecture enables different experts to specialize in learning either language-shared or language-specific knowledge. This approach not only mitigates parameter interference between languages but also facilitates positive transfer from high-resource to low-resource languages, effectively alleviating data scarcity issues. Experimental results demonstrate that MOSA-Base achieves a 15.4% relative reduction in average WER compared to the Ideal-LLM Base, consistently outperforming it across all languages. Notably, MOSA achieves a 13.3% WER reduction over the Ideal-LLM Base while utilizing only 60% of its parameters. These findings highlight MOSA's superior parameter efficiency and robustness against data imbalance, suggesting that a mixture of simple adapters is more suitable for multilingual LLM-based ASR than complex single-adapter designs.</description>

      <title>PAS-SE: Personalized Auxiliary-Sensor Speech Enhancement for Voice Pickup in Hearables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech enhancement for voice pickup in hearables aims to improve the user's voice by suppressing noise and interfering talkers, while maintaining own-voice quality. For single-channel methods, it is particularly challenging to distinguish the target from interfering talkers without additional context. In this paper, we compare two strategies to resolve this ambiguity: personalized speech enhancement (PSE), which uses enrollment utterances to represent the target, and auxiliary-sensor speech enhancement (AS-SE), which uses in-ear microphones as additional input. We evaluate the strategies on two public datasets, employing different auxiliary sensor arrays, to investigate their cross-dataset generalization. We propose training-time augmentations to facilitate cross-dataset generalization of AS-SE systems. We also show that combining PSE and AS-SE (PAS-SE) provides complementary performance benefits, especially when enrollment speech is recorded with the in-ear microphone. We further demonstrate that PAS-SE personalized with noisy in-ear enrollments maintains performance benefits over the AS-SE system.</description>

      <title>Adapting Diarization-Conditioned Whisper for End-to-End Multi-Talker Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a speaker-attributed (SA) Whisper-based model for multi-talker speech recognition that combines target-speaker modeling with serialized output training (SOT). Our approach leverages a Diarization-Conditioned Whisper (DiCoW) encoder to extract target-speaker embeddings, which are concatenated into a single representation and passed to a shared decoder. This enables the model to transcribe overlapping speech as a serialized output stream with speaker tags and timestamps. In contrast to target-speaker ASR systems such as DiCoW, which decode each speaker separately, our approach performs joint decoding, allowing the decoder to condition on the context of all speakers simultaneously. Experiments show that the model outperforms existing SOT-based approaches and surpasses DiCoW on multi-talker mixtures (e.g., LibriMix).</description>

      <title>A framework for diffuseness evaluation using a tight-frame microphone array configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a unified framework for estimating both sound-field direction and diffuseness using practical microphone arrays with different spatial configurations. Building on covariance-based diffuseness models, we formulate a velocity-only covariance approach that enables consistent diffuseness evaluation across heterogeneous array geometries without requiring mode whitening or spherical-harmonic decomposition. Three array types -- an A-format array, a rigid-sphere array, and a newly proposed tight-frame array -- are modeled and compared through both simulations and measurement-based experiments. The results show that the tight-frame configuration achieves near-isotropic directional sampling and reproduces diffuseness characteristics comparable to those of higher-order spherical arrays, while maintaining a compact physical structure. We further examine the accuracy of direction-of-arrival estimation based on acoustic intensity within the same framework. These findings connect theoretical diffuseness analysis with implementable array designs and support the development of robust, broadband methods for spatial-sound-field characterization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancement of speech technology has predominantly favored high-resource languages, creating a significant digital divide for speakers of most Sub-Saharan African languages. To address this gap, we introduce WAXAL, a large-scale, openly accessible speech dataset for 21 languages representing over 100 million speakers. The collection consists of two main components: an Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset containing approximately 1,250 hours of transcribed, natural speech from a diverse range of speakers, and a Text-to-Speech (TTS) dataset with over 180 hours of high-quality, single-speaker recordings reading phonetically balanced scripts. This paper details our methodology for data collection, annotation, and quality control, which involved partnerships with four African academic and community organizations. We provide a detailed statistical overview of the dataset and discuss its potential limitations and ethical considerations. The WAXAL datasets are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/WaxalNLP under the permissive CC-BY-4.0 license to catalyze research, enable the development of inclusive technologies, and serve as a vital resource for the digital preservation of these languages.</description>

      <title>Conditional Flow Matching for Visually-Guided Acoustic Highlighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visually-guided acoustic highlighting seeks to rebalance audio in alignment with the accompanying video, creating a coherent audio-visual experience. While visual saliency and enhancement have been widely studied, acoustic highlighting remains underexplored, often leading to misalignment between visual and auditory focus. Existing approaches use discriminative models, which struggle with the inherent ambiguity in audio remixing, where no natural one-to-one mapping exists between poorly-balanced and well-balanced audio mixes. To address this limitation, we reframe this task as a generative problem and introduce a Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) framework. A key challenge in iterative flow-based generation is that early prediction errors -- in selecting the correct source to enhance -- compound over steps and push trajectories off-manifold. To address this, we introduce a rollout loss that penalizes drift at the final step, encouraging self-correcting trajectories and stabilizing long-range flow integration. We further propose a conditioning module that fuses audio and visual cues before vector field regression, enabling explicit cross-modal source selection. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our method consistently surpasses the previous state-of-the-art discriminative approach, establishing that visually-guided audio remixing is best addressed through generative modeling.</description>

      <title>SAVGBench: Benchmarking Spatially Aligned Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the lack of multimodal generative models capable of producing high-quality videos with spatially aligned audio. While recent advancements in generative models have been successful in video generation, they often overlook the spatial alignment between audio and visuals, which is essential for immersive experiences. To tackle this problem, we establish a new research direction in benchmarking the Spatially Aligned Audio-Video Generation (SAVG) task. We introduce a spatially aligned audio-visual dataset, whose audio and video data are curated based on whether sound events are onscreen or not. We also propose a new alignment metric that aims to evaluate the spatial alignment between audio and video. Then, using the dataset and metric, we benchmark two types of baseline methods: one is based on a joint audio-video generation model, and the other is a two-stage method that combines a video generation model and a video-to-audio generation model. Our experimental results demonstrate that gaps exist between the baseline methods and the ground truth in terms of video and audio quality, as well as spatial alignment between the two modalities.</description>

      <title>GRAM: Spatial general-purpose audio representation models for real-world applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00934v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio foundation models learn general-purpose audio representations that facilitate a wide range of downstream tasks. While the performance of these models has greatly increased for conventional single-channel, dry audio clips, their success in real-world acoustic environments with reverberation and noise is limited. Furthermore, most audio foundation models ignore the spatial dimension of real-world acoustic environments, ruling out tasks involving sound localization. To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a general-purpose real-world audio model that employs a multi-channel masked autoencoder to efficiently learn spatial audio representations. We evaluated GRAM and other audio foundation models in a standardized manner on high-quality simulations of naturalistic, spatial acoustic environments as well as recordings of real-world environments and release these two complementary benchmark task suites: NatHEAR and RealSELD. Our results demonstrate that GRAM outperforms all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models on NatHEAR and the clean, single-channel version HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also shows state-of-the-art localization performance in simulated environments and generalizes efficiently to real-world recordings in RealSELD. Taken together, GRAM presents a significant advance toward robust spatial audio foundation models for real-world environments.</description>

      <title>When Good Sounds Go Adversarial: Jailbreaking Audio-Language Models with Benign Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, audio has emerged as a key interface for human-AI interaction. However, this convenience also introduces new vulnerabilities, making audio a potential attack surface for adversaries. Our research introduces WhisperInject, a two-stage adversarial audio attack framework that manipulates state-of-the-art audio language models to generate harmful content. Our method embeds harmful payloads as subtle perturbations into audio inputs that remain intelligible to human listeners. The first stage uses a novel reward-based white-box optimization method, Reinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD), to jailbreak the target model and elicit harmful native responses. This native harmful response then serves as the target for Stage 2, Payload Injection, where we use gradient-based optimization to embed subtle perturbations into benign audio carriers, such as weather queries or greeting messages. Our method achieves average attack success rates of 60-78% across two benchmarks and five multimodal LLMs, validated by multiple evaluation frameworks. Our work demonstrates a new class of practical, audio-native threats, moving beyond theoretical exploits to reveal a feasible and covert method for manipulating multimodal AI systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling Spoken Language Models with Syllabic Speech Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling, evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a 2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient long-context spoken language models.</description>

      <title>Noise-Conditioned Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Robust Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust speaker verification under noisy conditions remains an open challenge. Conventional deep learning methods learn a robust unified speaker representation space against diverse background noise and achieve significant improvement. In contrast, this paper presents a noise-conditioned mixture-ofexperts framework that decomposes the feature space into specialized noise-aware subspaces for speaker verification. Specifically, we propose a noise-conditioned expert routing mechanism, a universal model based expert specialization strategy, and an SNR-decaying curriculum learning protocol, collectively improving model robustness and generalization under diverse noise conditions. The proposed method can automatically route inputs to expert networks based on noise information derived from the inputs, where each expert targets distinct noise characteristics while preserving speaker identity information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate consistent superiority over baselines, confirming that explicit noise-dependent feature modeling significantly enhances robustness without sacrificing verification accuracy.</description>

      <title>The ICASSP 2026 HumDial Challenge: Benchmarking Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems in the LLM Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly Audio-LLMs and Omni-models, spoken dialogue systems have evolved significantly, progressively narrowing the gap between human-machine and human-human interactions. Achieving truly ``human-like'' communication necessitates a dual capability: emotional intelligence to perceive and resonate with users' emotional states, and robust interaction mechanisms to navigate the dynamic, natural flow of conversation, such as real-time turn-taking. Therefore, we launched the first Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (HumDial) at ICASSP 2026 to benchmark these dual capabilities. Anchored by a sizable dataset derived from authentic human conversations, this initiative establishes a fair evaluation platform across two tracks: (1) Emotional Intelligence, targeting long-term emotion understanding and empathetic generation; and (2) Full-Duplex Interaction, systematically evaluating real-time decision-making under `` listening-while-speaking'' conditions. This paper summarizes the dataset, track configurations, and the final results.</description>

      <title>VidTune: Creating Video Soundtracks with Generative Music and Contextual Thumbnails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music shapes the tone of videos, yet creators often struggle to find soundtracks that match their video's mood and narrative. Recent text-to-music models let creators generate music from text prompts, but our formative study (N=8) shows creators struggle to construct diverse prompts, quickly review and compare tracks, and understand their impact on the video. We present VidTune, a system that supports soundtrack creation by generating diverse music options from a creator's prompt and producing contextual thumbnails for rapid review. VidTune extracts representative video subjects to ground thumbnails in context, maps each track's valence and energy onto visual cues like color and brightness, and depicts prominent genres and instruments. Creators can refine tracks through natural language edits, which VidTune expands into new generations. In a controlled user study (N=12) and an exploratory case study (N=6), participants found VidTune helpful for efficiently reviewing and comparing music options and described the process as playful and enriching.</description>
