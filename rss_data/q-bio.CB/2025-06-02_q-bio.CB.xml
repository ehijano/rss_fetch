      <title>Glucagon and insulin production in pancreatic cells modeled using Petri nets and Boolean networks</title>

Abstract: Diabetes is a civilization chronic disease characterized by a constant elevated concentration of glucose in the blood. Many processes are involved in the glucose regulation, and their interactions are very complex. To better understand those processes we set ourselves a goal to create a Petri net model of the glucose regulation in the whole body. So far we have managed to create a model of glycolysis and synthesis of glucose in the liver, and the general overview models of the glucose regulation in a healthy and diabetic person. In this paper we introduce Petri nets models of insulin secretion in beta cell of the pancreas, and glucagon in the pancreas alpha cells. Those two hormones have mutually opposite effects: insulin preventing hyperglycemia, and glucagon preventing hypoglycemia. Understanding the mechanisms of insulin and glucagon secretion constitutes the basis for understanding diabetes. We also present a model in which both processes occur together, depending on the blood glucose level. The dynamics of each model is analysed. Additionally, we transform the overall insulin and glucagon secretion system to a Boolean network, following standard transformation rules.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis of branched cells in complex environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cell migration in vivo is often guided by chemical signals. Such chemotaxis, such as performed by immune cells migrating to a wound site, is complicated by the complex geometry inside living tissues. In this study, we extend our theoretical model of branched-cell migration on a network by introducing chemokine sources to explore the cellular response. The model predicts a speed-accuracy tradeoff, whereby slow cells are significantly more accurate and able to follow efficiently a weak chemoattractant signal. We then compare the model's predictions with experimental observations of neutrophils migrating to the site of laser-inflicted wound in a zebrafish larva fin, and migrating in-vitro inside a regular lattice of pillars. We find that the model captures the details of the sub-cellular response to the chemokine gradient, as well as the large-scale migration response. This comparison suggests that the neutrophils behave as fast cells, compromising their chemotaxis accuracy, which explains the functionality of these immune cells.</description>
