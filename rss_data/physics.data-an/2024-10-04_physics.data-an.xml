      <title>Analyzing black-hole ringdowns II: data conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series data from observations of black hole ringdown gravitational waves are often analyzed in the time domain by using damped sinusoid models with acyclic boundary conditions. Data conditioning operations, including downsampling, filtering, and the choice of data segment duration, reduce the computational cost of such analyses and can improve numerical stability. Here we analyze simulated damped sinsuoid signals to illustrate how data conditioning operations, if not carefully applied, can undesirably alter the analysis' posterior distributions. We discuss how currently implemented downsampling and filtering methods, if applied too aggressively, can introduce systematic errors and skew tests of general relativity. These issues arise because current downsampling and filtering methods do not operate identically on the data and model. Alternative downsampling and filtering methods which identically operate on the data and model may be achievable, but we argue that the current operations can still be implemented safely. We also show that our preferred anti-alias filtering technique, which has an instantaneous frequency-domain response at its roll-off frequency, preserves the structure of posterior distributions better than other commonly used filters with transient frequency-domain responses. Lastly, we highlight that exceptionally long data segments may need to be analyzed in cases where thin lines in the noise power spectral density overlap with central signal frequencies. Our findings may be broadly applicable to any analysis of truncated time domain data with acyclic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Exploring language relations through syntactic distances and geographic proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Languages are grouped into families that share common linguistic traits. While this approach has been successful in understanding genetic relations between diverse languages, more analyses are needed to accurately quantify their relatedness, especially in less studied linguistic levels such as syntax. Here, we explore linguistic distances using series of parts of speech (POS) extracted from the Universal Dependencies dataset. Within an information-theoretic framework, we show that employing POS trigrams maximizes the possibility of capturing syntactic variations while being at the same time compatible with the amount of available data. Linguistic connections are then established by assessing pairwise distances based on the POS distributions. Intriguingly, our analysis reveals definite clusters that correspond to well known language families and groups, with exceptions explained by distinct morphological typologies. Furthermore, we obtain a significant correlation between language similarity and geographic distance, which underscores the influence of spatial proximity on language kinships.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification with Bayesian Higher Order ReLU KANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first method of uncertainty quantification in the domain of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, specifically focusing on (Higher Order) ReLUKANs to enhance computational efficiency given the computational demands of Bayesian methods. The method we propose is general in nature, providing access to both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. It is also capable of generalization to other various basis functions. We validate our method through a series of closure tests, including simple one-dimensional functions and application to the domain of (Stochastic) Partial Differential Equations. Referring to the latter, we demonstrate the method's ability to correctly identify functional dependencies introduced through the inclusion of a stochastic term.
