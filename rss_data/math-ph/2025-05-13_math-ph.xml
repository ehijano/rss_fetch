      <title>Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequalities and ground states of Fermions in relativistic Hartree-Fock model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous mathematical analysis of the relativistic Hartree-Fock model for finite Fermi systems. We first establish an optimal Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev (GNS) inequality with Hartree-type nonlinearities for orthonormal systems and characterize the qualitative properties of its optimizers. Furthermore, we derive a finite-rank Lieb-Thirring inequality involving convolution terms and show that it is the duality of the GNS-inequality-a result that, to our knowledge, has not previously appeared in the literature. For the relativistic Hartree-Fock model, we prove that ground states exist if and only if the coupling parameter $K&lt;\mathcal{K}_\infty^{(N)}$, where $\mathcal{K}_\infty^{(N)}$ is the optimal constant in the GNS-inequality. Finally, under suitable assumptions on the external potentials, we calculate the precisely asymptotic behavior of ground states as $K\nearrow\mathcal{K}_\infty^{(N)}$.</description>

      <title>Fractional super-diffusion of energy in open harmonic chain with heat baths at the boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the hydrodynamic limit for a one-dimensional harmonic chain of $n+1$-interacting atoms with a random exchange of the momentum between neighbors.
  The system is open: at the left and right boundaries {are} attached to Langevin heat baths at temperatures $T_L$ and $T_R$, respectively.
  Under the super-diffusive scaling of space-time $(n u,n^{3/2}t)$, $u\in[0,1]$, $t\ge0$ we prove that the empirical profile of energy
  converges, as $n\to+\infty$, to the solution $T(t,u)$ of a fractional diffusion equation with {boundary conditons} determined
  by the temperatures of the heat baths. i.e. $T(t,0)=T_L$ and $T(t,1)=T_R$.</description>

      <title>Polar Duality and the Donoho--Stark Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar duality is a fundamental geometric concept that can be interpreted as a form of Fourier transform between convex sets. Meanwhile, the Donoho-Stark uncertainty principle in harmonic analysis provides a framework for comparing the relative concentrations of a function and its Fourier transform. Combining the Blaschke--Santal\'o inequality from convex geometry with the Donoho--Stark principle, we establish estimates for the trade-off of concentration between a square integrable function in a symmetric convex body and that of its Fourier transform in the polar dual of that body. In passing, we use the Donoho-Stark uncertainty principle to establish a new concentration result for the Wigner function.</description>

      <title>Ordering of Energy Levels in the Fr\"{o}hlich Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a one-dimensional system of \( N \) electrons subject to an external potential \( U \). Let \( E_{\rm el}(S) \) denote the ground state energy of the system with total spin \( S \). The Mattis--Lieb theorem asserts that, for a broad class of potentials \( U \), the inequality \( E_{\rm el}(S) &lt; E_{\rm el}(S') \) holds whenever \( S &lt; S' \). This result implies that the ground state of a one-dimensional many-electron system is non-ferromagnetic. In the present work, we demonstrate that the Mattis--Lieb theorem can be extended to electron-phonon interacting systems governed by the Fr\"ohlich model. Our analysis is carried out in the setting without an ultraviolet cutoff. The cornerstone of our approach is the construction of a Feynman--Kac-type formula for the heat semigroup generated by the Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the Chern-Simons potentials given the Pontryagin densities in arbitrary even dimensions $ D\geq4 $. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general and allows for non-metricity, which accommodates the existence of non-trivial Pontryagin densities in $ D=4n-2 \, (n \geq 2) $ dimensions. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern-Simons potential of the Pontryagin density given an arbitrary even dimension.</description>

Abstract: We consider Novikov's problem of describing level lines of quasiperiodic functions on a plane for two-dimensional potentials of dihedral symmetry. It is shown that quasiperiodic potentials of this type can have open level lines only at a single energy level $\, \epsilon = \epsilon_{0} \, $, which brings them close to random potentials on a plane.</description>

      <title>Complete monotonicity of log-functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the property of complete monotonicity within a special family $\mathcal{F}_s$ of functions in $s$ variables involving logarithms. The main result of this work provides a linear isomorphism between $\mathcal{F}_s$ and the space of real multivariate polynomials. This isomorphism identifies the cone of completely monotone functions with the cone of non-negative polynomials. We conclude that the cone of completely monotone functions in $\mathcal{F}_s$ is semi-algebraic. This gives a finite time algorithm to decide whether a function in $\mathcal{F}_s$ is completely monotone</description>

      <title>Integrability and Chaos via fractal analysis of Spectral Form Factors: Gaussian approximations and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the mathematical equivalence between the spectral form factor, a quantity used to identify the onset of quantum chaos and scrambling in quantum many-body systems, and the classical problem of statistical characterization of planar random walks. We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random process on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such random process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the associated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This leads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for quantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low temperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the distribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the spectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation. Assuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical problem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk, defined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement, approaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk approaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the fractal dimension $4/3$. Additionally, we numerically show that Bethe Ansatz walkers fall into a category similar to the non-integrable walkers.</description>

      <title>New Lie systems from Goursat distributions: reductions and reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that types of bracket-generating distributions lead to new classes of Lie systems with compatible geometric structures. Specifically, the $n$-trailer system is analysed, showing that its associated distribution is related to a Lie system if $n = 0$ or $n = 1$. These systems allow symmetry reductions and the reconstruction of solutions of the original system from those of the reduced one. The reconstruction procedure is discussed and indicates potential extensions for studying broader classes of differential equations through Lie systems and new types of superposition rules.</description>

      <title>2D Quon Language: Unifying Framework for Cliffords, Matchgates, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating generic quantum states and dynamics is practically intractable using classical computers. However, certain special classes -- namely Clifford and matchgate circuits -- permit efficient computation. They provide invaluable tools for studying many-body physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum computation. While both play foundational roles across multiple disciplines, the origins of their tractability seem disparate, and their relationship remain unclear. A deeper understanding of such tractable classes could expand their scope and enable a wide range of new applications. In this work, we make progress toward the unified understanding of the Clifford and matchgate -- these two classes are, in fact, distinct special cases of a single underlying structure. Specifically, we introduce the 2D Quon language, which combines Majorana worldlines with their underlying spacetime topology to diagrammatically represent quantum processes and tensor networks. In full generality, the 2D Quon language is universal -- capable of representing arbitrary quantum states, dynamics, or tensor networks -- yet they become especially powerful in describing Clifford and matchgate classes. Each class can be efficiently characterized in a visually recognizable manner using the Quon framework. This capability naturally gives rise to several families of efficiently computable tensor networks introduced in this work: punctured matchgates, hybrid Clifford-matchgate-MPS, and ansatze generated from factories of tractable networks. All of these exhibit high non-Cliffordness, high non-matchgateness, and large bipartite entanglement entropy. We discuss a range of applications of our approach, from recovering well-known results such as the Kramers-Wannier duality and the star-triangle relation of the Ising model, to enabling variational optimization with novel ansatz states.</description>

      <title>Equivalence functors in graded supergeometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been recently proved that the category of N-manifolds of degree $n$, i.e., $\mathbb N$-graded supermanifolds of degree $n$ in which the parity agrees with the gradation, is equivalent to the category of purely even $n$-tuple vector superbundles with a certain action of the symmetry group $S_n$ permuting the vector bundle structures; this can be viewed as a desuperization of N-manifolds. We put this result into a much wider context of graded structures on supermanifolds and describe explicitly several canonical equivalences of the corresponding categories in a purely geometrical and constructive way; the desuperization equivalence functor is a composition of some of them. Our constructions are completely canonical, we use such tools of supergeometry as the iterated tangent functor, the parity reversion in vector superbundles, and the modern view of $n$-tuple vector bundles as a sequence of commuting Euler vector fields of the vector bundle structures in question. All this opens new horizons in the land of graded supergeometry.</description>

      <title>Are Pad\'e approximants suitable for modelling shape functions of traversable wormholes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the applicability of Pad\'e approximants in constructing suitable shape functions for traversable wormholes, emphasizing their ability to satisfy essential geometric constraints. By analyzing low-order Pad\'e approximants, we demonstrate their effectiveness in transforming inadequate shape functions into physically consistent candidates, while inherently fulfilling critical criteria such as asymptotic flatness, flare-out conditions, and throat regularity. Specific parameter restrictions are established to ensure compliance with these constraints; for instance, low-order rational approximations help to avoid artificial singularities and maintain asymptotic behavior when derivative conditions at the throat are controlled. In contrast, high-order Pad\'e approximants introduce challenges, including spurious poles within the physical domain, which disrupt geometric requirements. Our findings highlight that low-order Pad\'e approximants provide a robust framework for simplifying complex shape functions into analytically tractable forms, balancing mathematical flexibility with physical feasibility. This work underscores their potential as a systematic tool in traversable wormhole modeling, while cautioning against unphysical artifacts in higher-order approximations.</description>

      <title>Multiple Scattering of Elastic Waves in Polycrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elastic waves that propagate in polycrystalline materials attenuate due to scattering of energy out of the primary propagation direction in addition to becoming dispersive in their group and phase velocities. Attenuation and dispersion are modeled through multiple scattering theory to describe the mean displacement field or the mean elastodynamic Green's function. The Green's function is governed by the Dyson equation and was solved previously (Weaver, 1990) by truncating the multiple scattering series at first-order, which is known as the first-order smoothing approximation (FOSA). FOSA allows for multiple scattering but places a restriction on the scattering events such that a scatterer can only be visited once during a particular multiple scattering process. In other words, recurrent scattering between two scatterers is not permitted. In this article, the Dyson equation is solved using the second-order smoothing approximation (SOSA). The SOSA permits scatterers to be visited twice during the multiple scattering process and, thus, provides a more complete picture of the multiple scattering effects on elastic waves. The derivation is valid at all frequencies spanning the Rayleigh, stochastic, and geometric scattering regimes without additional approximations that limit applicability in strongly scattering cases (like the Born approximation). The importance of SOSA is exemplified through analyzing specific weak and strongly scattering polycrystals. Multiple scattering effects contained in SOSA are shown to be important at the beginning of the stochastic scattering regime and are particularly important for transverse (shear) waves. This step forward opens the door for a deeper fundamental understanding of multiple scattering phenomena in polycrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Locally Optimal Percolation for Network Resilience Dismantling via Fiedler Vector Gradient Iterative Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network resilience, dynamically quantified by the Fiedler value (\(\lambda_2\),the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix) ensures functional stability and efficient energy transmission, yet also introduces vulnerabilities that dismantling the resilience of the network can cause a functional breakdown of the network. However, traditional percolation strategies focused on structural attacks often fail to effectively affect resilience and lack universal applicability. Here, we employ a Laplacian spectral perturbation approach to systematically identify and remove edges critical to resilience. We derive the sensitivity of \(\lambda_2\) to topological changes and employ the gradient of Fiedler vector to measure each edge's contribution of resilience, revealing an intrinsic relationship to community partition. Accordingly, we propose the Fiedler Gradient Iterative Attack (FGIA) algorithm, which constructs locally optimal edge removal sequences to maximize \(\lambda_2\) degradation with significantly lower computational cost than brute-force methods. Our results offer a rigorous approach for inducing controlled resilience collapse, with potential applications in neuroscience and critical infrastructure protection.</description>

Abstract: Quantum replacer codes are codes that can be protected from errors induced by a given set of quantum replacer channels, an important class of quantum channels that includes the erasures of subsets of qubits that arise in quantum error correction. We prove a structure theorem for such codes that synthesizes a variety of special cases with earlier theoretical work in quantum error correction. We present several examples and applications of the theorem, including a mix of new observations and results together with some subclasses of codes revisited from this new perspective.</description>

      <title>Chern character and Fermi point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper expresses the Chern character for topological K-theory based on the formulation of the family of Fredholm operators, by using the points at which the Fredholm operator becomes singular (Fermi points). In particular, we explain that the odd Chern character can be thought of as a generalization of the spectral flow. As applications, we give elementary proofs of the evenness of the edge index and the bulk-edge correspondence for four-dimensional topological insulators with time-reversal symmetry of class AI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variationality of the equation of conformal geodesics is an important problem in geometry with applications to general relativity. Recently it was proven that, in three dimensions, this system of equations for un-parametrized curves is the Euler-Lagrange equations of a certain conformally invariant functional, while the parametrized system in three dimensions is not variational. We demonstrate that variationality fails in higher dimensions for both parametrized and un-parametrized conformal geodesics, indicating that variational principle may be the selection principle for the physical dimension.</description>

      <title>Transverse linear stability of line solitons for 2D Toda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $2$-dimensional Toda lattice ($2$D Toda) is a completely integrable semi-discrete wave equation with the KP-II equation in its continuous limit. Using Darboux transformations, we prove the linear stability of $1$-line solitons for $2$D Toda of any size in an exponentially weighted space. We prove that the dominant part of solutions to the linearized equation around a $1$-line soliton is a time derivative of the $1$-line soliton multiplied by a function of time and transverse variables. The amplitude is described by a $1$-dimensional damped wave equation in the transverse variable, as is the case with the linearized KP-II equation.</description>

      <title>Multi-party dynamic quantum homomorphic encryption scheme based on rotation operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum homomorphic encryption is the corresponding technology of classical homomorphic encryption in the quantum field. Due to its ability to ensure the correctness of computation and the security of data, it is particularly suitable for delegated computation in quantum cloud networks. However, previous schemes were unable to simultaneously handle the volatility problem of servers dynamically and eliminate the error caused by homomorphic evaluation of T-gate non-interactively. Therefore, a novel multi-party dynamic quantum homomorphic encryption scheme based on rotation operators is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the proposed scheme uses the rotation operators to solve the phase gate error that occurs during the homomorphic evaluation of T-gate non-interactively. Secondly, the scheme can dynamically deal with instability of servers, such as adding a server or removing a server. Then, the trusted key center is introduced, which is responsible for key updating and circuit replacement, which lowers the requirements for quantum capabilities on the client. Finally, this scheme extends the single-client multi-server model to the multi-client multi-server model, making it more suitable for quantum distributed networks and enhancing its practicality. In addition, we theoretically prove the correctness and fully homomorphic property of the proposed scheme, and verify it through the simulation conducted on the IBM Quantum Experience. Security analysis and efficiency analysis further demonstrate that the proposed scheme is information-theoretically secure and possesses high qubit efficiency.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$-boundedness of wave operators for higher order Schr\"odinger operator with zero singularities in low odd dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the $L^p$-bounds of wave operators for higher-order Schr\"odinger operators $H = (-\Delta)^m + V$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $m \ge 2$ and real-valued decaying potentials $V$. Our main objective is to establish the sharp $L^p$-boundedness of the wave operators $W_\pm(H; (-\Delta)^m)$ in the presence of all types of zero-resonance singularities, for all odd dimensions $1 \le n \le 4m - 1$.
  Specifically, for odd $n$ with $1 \le n \le 4m - 1$, there exist $m_n$ types of zero resonances for $H$, along with a critical type $k_c$ (both depending on $n$ and $m$). If zero is a regular point of $H$ or a $\mathbf{k}$-th kind resonance with $1 \le \mathbf{k} \le k_c$, the wave operators $W_\pm(H; (-\Delta)^m)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. If zero is a $\mathbf{k}$-th kind resonance with $k_c &lt; \mathbf{k} \le m_n$, we show that the range of $p$-boundedness for $W_\pm(H; (-\Delta)^m)$ narrows to $1 &lt; p &lt; p_{\mathbf{k}}$, where $$p_{\mathbf{k}} = \frac{n}{n - 2m + \mathbf{k} + k_c - 1}.$$ Additionally, if zero is an eigenvalue of $H$ (i.e., $\mathbf{k} = m_n + 1$), then $W_\pm(H; (-\Delta)^m)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \frac{2n}{n - 1}$.
  Furthermore, it is shown that the wave operators $W_\pm(H; (-\Delta)^m)$ are unbounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $p_{\mathbf{k}} &lt; p \le \infty$ if $k_c &lt; \mathbf{k} \le m_n$, and for all $\frac{2n}{n - 1} &lt; p \le \infty$ if zero is an eigenvalue of $H$ with a non-zero solution $\phi$ to $H\phi = 0$ in $\bigcap_{s &lt; -\frac{1}{2}} L^{2}_{s}(\mathbb{R}^n) \setminus L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$(referred to as a $p$-wave resonance). The key idea of the proof is to reduce the $L^p$-unboundedness to establishing the optimality of time-decay estimates for $e^{itH}P_{ac}(H)$ in weighted $L^2$ spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and studies generalized degenerate Clifford and Lipschitz groups in geometric (Clifford) algebras. These Lie groups preserve the direct sums of the subspaces determined by the grade involution and reversion under the adjoint and twisted adjoint representations in degenerate geometric algebras. We prove that the generalized degenerate Clifford and Lipschitz groups can be defined using centralizers and twisted centralizers of fixed grades subspaces and the norm functions that are widely used in the theory of spin groups. We study the relations between these groups and consider them in the particular cases of plane-based geometric algebras and Grassmann algebras. The corresponding Lie algebras are studied. The presented groups are interesting for the study of generalized degenerate spin groups and applications in computer science, physics, and engineering.</description>

      <title>Nonamenable Poisson zoo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Poisson zoo on an infinite Cayley graph $G$, we take a probability measure $\nu$ on rooted finite connected subsets, called lattice animals, and place i.i.d. Poisson($\lambda$) copies of them at each vertex. If the expected volume of the animals w.r.t. $\nu$ is infinite, then the whole $G$ is covered for any $\lambda&gt;0$. If the second moment of the volume is finite, then it is easy to see that for small enough $\lambda$ the union of the animals has only finite clusters, while for $\lambda$ large enough there are also infinite clusters. Here we show that:
  1. If $G$ is a nonamenable free product, then for ANY $\nu$ with infinite second but finite first moment and any $\lambda&gt;0$, there will be infinite clusters, despite having arbitrarily low density.
  2. The same result holds for ANY nonamenable $G$, when the lattice animals are worms: random walk pieces of random finite length.
  It remains open if the result holds for ANY nonamenable Cayley graph with ANY lattice animal measure $\nu$ with infinite second moment.
  3. We also give a Poisson zoo example $\nu$ on $\mathbb{T}_d \times \mathbb{Z}^5$ with finite first moment and a UNIQUE infinite cluster for any $\lambda&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Iterative Relaxation Method to Obtain Global Transonic Flows around Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flows around compact objects are necessarily transonic. Due to their dissipative nature, finding of sonic points is not trivial. Becker and Le in 2003 (BL03) proposed a novel methodology to obtain global transonic solutions, using iterative relaxation technique and exploiting the inner boundary conditions of the central object. In the current work, we propose a generic methodology -- IRM-SP and IRM-SHOCK to obtain any class of global accretion and wind solutions, given a set of constants of motion. We have considered viscosity in the system, which transports angular momentum outwards. In addition, it heats the system. Radiative processes like bremsstrahlung which cools the system is also incorporated. An interplay between heating and cooling process, along with gravity and centrifugal forces gives rise to multiple sonic points and hence shocks. The proposed methodology successfully generates any class of accretion as well as wind solutions, allowing us to unify them. Additionally, we report here rigorously the mathematical as well as the computational algorithm needed, to find sonic point(s) and thus obtain global transonic flows around compact objects.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the one-dimensional inverse problem of determining the memory kernel by the integral overdetermination condition for the direct problem of finding the velocity potential and the displacement of boundary points. A wave equation with initial and acoustic boundary conditions in media with dispersion is used as a mathematical model. The inverse problem is reduced to an equivalent problem with homogeneous boundary conditions for the system of integro-differential equations. Using the technique of estimating integral equations and the contraction mappings principle in Sobolev spaces, the global existence and uniqueness theorem for the inverse problem is proved.</description>

      <title>An Approximation Framework for Subspace-based Methods in Spectral Analysis with Accuracy Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mathematical framework for the approximation of eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators through subspace-based methods is presented.
  The framework contains spectral inequalities that extend to unbounded operators and account for multiple error sources.
  We include conceptual remarks, on how such framework addresses contemporary challenges towards a more complete approximation theory for quantum physics.
  Further analysis considers the computational operation of subspace-based methods and proposes new numerical practices.
  In particular, analytical guarantees on dimension detection of spectral subspaces in the presence of noise are introduced.
  The generality of the framework invites application to a broad class of numerical methods, and its utility is demonstrated through recent advances in signal processing.</description>

      <title>Second-gradient models for incompressible viscous fluids and associated cylindrical flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce second-gradient models for incompressible viscous fluids, building on the framework introduced by Fried and Gurtin. We propose a new and simple constitutive relation for the hyperpressure to ensure that the models are both physically meaningful and mathematically well-posed. The framework is further extended to incorporate pressure-dependent viscosities. We show that for the pressure-dependent viscosity model, the inclusion of second-gradient effects guarantees the ellipticity of the governing pressure equation, in contrast to previous models rooted in classical continuum mechanics. The constant viscosity model is applied to steady cylindrical flows, where explicit solutions are derived under both strong and weak adherence boundary conditions. In each case, we establish convergence of the velocity profiles to the classical Navier-Stokes solutions as the model's characteristic length scales tend to zero.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and flexibility in $p$-adic symplectic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $n\ge 2$ be an integer and let $p$ be a prime number. We prove that the analog of Gromov's non-squeezing theorem does not hold for $p$-adic embeddings: for any $p$-adic absolute value $R$, the entire $p$-adic space $(\mathbb{Q}_p)^{2n}$ is symplectomorphic to the $p$-adic cylinder $\mathrm{Z}_p^{2n}(R)$ of radius $R$, showing a degree of flexibility which stands in contrast with the real case. However, some rigidity remains: we prove that the $p$-adic affine analog of Gromov's result still holds. We will also show that in the non-linear situation, if the $p$-adic embeddings are equivariant with respect to a torus action, then non-squeezing holds, which generalizes a recent result by Figalli, Palmer and the second author. This allows us to introduce equivariant $p$-adic analytic symplectic capacities, of which the $p$-adic equivariant Gromov width is an example.</description>

      <title>Quon Classical Simulation: Unifying Clifford, Matchgates and Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified classical simulation framework for quantum circuits, termed Quon Classical Simulation (QCS), built upon the diagrammatic formalism of the Quon language. Central to this framework is the introduction of magic holes, a topological feature that captures the global source of computational hardness in simulating quantum systems. Unlike conventional measures, the complexity of QCS is governed by the topological entanglement entropy associated with these magic holes. We show that Clifford circuits and Matchgate circuits are free of magic holes and thus efficiently simulable within our model. To capture the interaction structure of magic holes, we define a topological tensor network representation and develop novel skein relations and reduction algorithms to simplify circuit representations. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of classical simulations and provides a unified explanation for the tractability of various known quantum circuit classes. Our work offers a new topological perspective on the classical simulability of quantum systems and topological complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that in the chiral limit of the Bistritzer--MacDonald Hamiltonian, there exist magic angles at which the Hamiltonian exhibits flat bands of multiplicity four instead of two. We analyse the structure of Bloch functions associated with the bands of arbitrary multiplicity, compute the corresponding Chern number to be $ -1 $, and show that there exist infinitely many degenerate magic angles for a generic choice of tunnelling potential, including the Bistritzer--MacDonald potential. Moreover, we demonstrate for generic tunnelling potentials flat bands have only twofold or fourfold multiplicities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a universal relation that we call the $x-y$ swap relation, which plays a prominent role in the theory of topological recursion, Hurwitz theory, and free probability theory. We describe in a very precise and detailed way the interaction of the $x-y$ swap relation and KP integrability. As an application, we prove a recent conjecture that relates some particular instances of topological recursion to the Mironov-Morozov-Semenoff matrix integrals.</description>

Abstract: We prove a structural theorem relating the higher genera free energy functions of the Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchies to the Witten-Kontsevich free energy function of the Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy. As an important application, for any given genus $g\geq 1$, we construct a set of universal identities valid for the free energy functions of any Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchy. In particular, we present some techniques that can be used to derive universal identities without relying on the geometry of the moduli space of stable curves of higher genus.</description>

      <title>Pfaffian structure of the eigenvector overlap for the symplectic Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the integrable structure and scaling limits of the conditioned eigenvector overlap of the symplectic Ginibre ensemble of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices with independent quaternion elements. The average of the overlap matrix elements constructed from left and right eigenvectors, conditioned to $x$, are derived in terms of a Pfaffian determinant. Regarded as a two-dimensional Coulomb gas with the Neumann boundary condition along the real axis, it contains a kernel of skew-orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight function $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2(1+|z-x|^2)e^{-2|z|^2}$, including a non-trivial insertion of a point charge. The mean off-diagonal overlap is related to the diagonal (self-)overlap by a transposition, in analogy to the complex Ginibre ensemble. For $x$ conditioned to the real line, extending previous results at $x=0$, we determine the skew-orthogonal polynomials and their skew-kernel with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$. This is done in two steps and involves a Christoffel perturbation of the weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, by computing first the corresponding quantities for the unperturbed weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$. Its kernel is shown to satisfy a differential equation at finite matrix size $N$. This allows us to take different large-$N$ limits, where we distinguish bulk and edge regime along the real axis. The limiting mean diagonal overlaps and corresponding eigenvalue correlation functions of the point processes with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$ are determined. We also examine the effect on the planar orthogonal polynomials when changing the variance in $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, as this appears in the eigenvector statistics of the complex Ginibre ensemble.</description>

Abstract: We use the theory of $x-y$ duality to propose a new definition / construction for the correlation differentials of topological recursion; we call it "generalized topological recursion". This new definition coincides with the original topological recursion of Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin in the regular case and allows, in particular, to get meaningful answers in a variety of irregular and degenerate situations.</description>

      <title>Special solutions of a discrete Painlev\'e equation for quantum minimal surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider solutions of a discrete Painlev\'e equation arising from a construction of quantum minimal surfaces by Arnlind, Hoppe and Kontsevich, and in earlier work of Cornalba and Taylor on static membranes. While the discrete equation admits a continuum limit to the continuous Painlev\'e I equation, we find that it has the same space of initial values as the Painlev\'e V equation with certain specific parameter values. We further explicitly show how each iteration of this discrete Painlev\'e I equation corresponds to a certain composition of B\"acklund transformations for Painlev\'e V, as was first remarked in work by Tokihiro, Grammaticos and Ramani. In addition, we show that some explicit special function solutions of Painlev\'e V, written in terms of modified Bessel functions, yield the unique positive solution of the initial value problem required for quantum minimal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Bethe roots for periodic TASEP and algebraic curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algebraic method for solving the Bethe ansatz equations for the periodic totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) with an arbitrary number of sites and particles. The Bethe ansatz equations are realized as an algebraic equation on a certain Riemann surface. While our Riemann surface is essentially the same as the one introduced by Prolhac, we focus on its algebraic realization as a (singular) plane curve. By a counting argument on the Riemann surface, we provide a rigorous proof of the completeness of the Bethe ansatz. The decomposition of the Riemann surface into connected components determines how often each value of the product of Bethe roots appears. We classify the connected components and their multiplicities using a similar argument to the spectral degeneracy of the Markov matrix discussed by Golinelli-Mallick. As a result, we give an algebro-geometric characterization of Golinelli-Mallick-type spectral degeneracy of the Markov matrix. We also give explicit formulas for the number of connected components, the number of ramification points, and the total genus of the Riemann surface. These formulas recover the table of examples presented by Prolhac. Moreover, we explore applications of the special type of Bethe roots that appear in this case to partition functions of the five-vertex model. We introduce a version of the free energy and evaluate the thermodynamic limit to find the explicit form in terms of the Riemann zeta function.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Exact Dynamical Structure Factor of the Heisenberg Antiferromagnetic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3855</link>
      <description>arXiv:1402.3855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit our initial derivations of the exact 2-spinon $S_2$ and 4-spinon $S_4$ dynamical structure factors (DSF). First we show that the latter derivations had normalization factors that are twice and quadriple the correct ones respectively. This means that $S_2$ contributes not 72% as was previously thought but 36% to the total DSF. We also calculated the contribution of $S_4$ to be between 18% and 20% and not 27% as was calculated by Caux and Hagemans. In fact we show that the latter reference had also the normalization factor twice the correct value and had it done the numeric integrations correctly it would have obtained a contribution between 36% and 40% for $S_4$. Furthermore, we prove that its claim that our initial derivation of $S_4$ was also incorrect in its dependency on the spectral parameters is incorrect because fixing the momentun transfer $k$ up to $2\pi$ as the latter reference did to justify its claim only amounts to mutltiplying the overall factor by 2 because as we will prove in this paper $S_4$ is periodic in $k$ with period $2\pi$. Also in this paper we derive $S_n$ for general $n$ by following a different approach compared to our initial derivation of $S_4$. Although for $S_4$ both the new derivation and the initial one lead to equivalent formulas that are expressed differently, the new form presented in this paper is much more elegant and compact and also reveals new hidden and nontrivial symmetries which substantially simplify the numeric evaluation of $S_4$ and its sum rules. Moreover based on the results of this paper we propose a simple approximation to the total DSF of the Heisenberg model. Finally we comment on how our work might resolve the discrepancy between the exact theoretic results and experiemntal data as reported by Zaliznyak et al.</description>

      <title>Multiple points on the boundaries of Brownian loop-soup clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a Brownian loop soup with intensity $c\in(0,1]$ in the unit disk, we show that almost surely, the set of simple (resp. double) points on any portion of boundary of any of its clusters has Hausdorff dimension $2-\xi_c(2)$ (resp. $2-\xi_c(4)$), where $\xi_c(k)$ is the generalized disconnection exponent computed in arxiv:1901.05436. As a consequence, when the dimension is positive, such points are a.s. dense on every boundary of every cluster. There are a.s. no triple points on the cluster boundaries.
  As an intermediate result, we establish a separation lemma for Brownian loop soups, which is a powerful tool for obtaining sharp estimates on non-intersection and non-disconnection probabilities in the setting of loop soups. In particular, it allows us to define a family of generalized intersection exponents $\xi_c(k, \lambda)$, and show that $\xi_c(k)$ is the limit as $\lambda\searrow 0$ of $\xi_c(k, \lambda)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05203v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</description>

Abstract: Given a noncommutative Hamiltonian space $A$, we prove that the conjecture ``{\it quantization commutes with reduction}'' holds for $A$. We further construct a semidirect product algebra $A \rtimes \mG^A$, and establish the correspondence between equivariant sheaves on the representation space and left $A\rtimes\mG^A$-modules. In the quiver setting, using the quantum and classical trace maps, we establish the explicit correspondence between quantizations on a preprojective algebra and those on a quiver variety.</description>

Abstract: We prove that higher-derivative and genuinely nonlocal Lagrangian systems can be Lyapunov-stable even when their Hamiltonians lack a lower bound. Explicit free and coupled Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillators, together with a genuine nonlocal model, are analysed to identify the precise conditions under which stability holds. These counterexamples point out the logical gap in the "Ostrogradsky instability" claims and provide benchmarks for constructing efficient stable higher-derivative theories.</description>

      <title>Adaptive sampling-based optimization of quantics tensor trains for noisy functions: applications to quantum simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor cross interpolation (TCI) is a powerful technique for learning a tensor train (TT) by adaptively sampling a target tensor based on an interpolation formula. However, when the tensor evaluations contain random noise, optimizing the TT is more advantageous than interpolating the noise. Here, we propose a new method that starts with an initial guess of TT and optimizes it using non-linear least-squares by fitting it to measured points obtained from TCI. We use quantics TCI (QTCI) in this method and demonstrate its effectiveness on sine and two-time correlation functions, with each evaluated with random noise. The resulting QTT exhibits increased robustness against noise compared to the QTCI method. Furthermore, we employ this optimized QTT of the correlation function in quantum simulation based on pseudo-imaginary-time evolution, resulting in ground-state energy with higher accuracy than the QTCI or Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras and solvable unitary circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exactly solvable models in quantum many body dynamics provide valuable insights into many interesting physical phenomena, and serve as platforms to rigorously investigate fundamental theoretical questions. Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and out-of-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Ground state solutions for Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of ground state solutions by considering the minimization problem on a Nehari-Pohozaev set. The presence of a doping profile causes several difficulties, especially in the proof of the uniqueness of a maximum point of a fibering map. A key ingredient is to establish the energy inequality. We also establish the relation between ground state solutions and $L^2$-constraint minimizers. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, some geometric quantities related to the domain, such as the mean curvature,are responsible for the existence of ground state solutions.</description>

Abstract: We show that every Born Lie algebra can be obtained by the bicross product construction starting from two pseudo-Riemannian Lie algebras. We then obtain a classification of all Lie algebras up to dimension four and all six-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras admitting an integrable Born structure. Finally, we study the curvature properties of the pseudo-Riemannian metrics of the integrable Born structures obtained in our classification results.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian metric spaces and GH-convergence: the unbounded case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of Lorentzian metric space which drops the boundedness condition from our previous work and argue that the properties defining our spaces are minimal. In fact, they are defined by three conditions given by (a) the reverse triangle inequality for chronologically related events, (b) Lorentzian distance continuity and relative compactness of chronological diamonds, and (c) a distinguishing condition via the Lorentzian distance function. By adding a countably generating condition we confirm the validity of desirable properties for our spaces including the Polish property. The definition of (pre)length space given in our previous work on the bounded case is generalized to this setting. We also define a notion of Gromov-Hausdorff convergence for Lorentzian metric spaces and prove that (pre)length spaces are GH-stable. It is also shown that our (sequenced) Lorentzian metric spaces bring a natural quasi-uniformity (resp. quasi-metric). Finally, an explicit comparison with other recent constructions based on our previous work on bounded Lorentzian metric spaces is presented.</description>

      <title>Turbulent solutions of the binormal flow and the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last three decades there has been an intense activity on the exploration of turbulent phenomena of dispersive equations, as for instance the growth of Sobolev norms since the work of Bourgain in the 90s. In general the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation has been left aside because of its complete integrability. In a series of papers of the last six years that we survey here for the special issue of the ICMP 2024 ([12],[13],[14],[15],[16],[7],[8]), we considered, together with the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation, the binormal flow, which is a geometric flow explicitly related to it. We displayed rigorously a large range of complex behavior as creation of singularities and unique continuation, Fourier growth, Talbot effects, intermittency and multifractality, justifying in particular some previous numerical observations. To do so we constructed a class of well-posedness for the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation included in the critical Fourier-Lebesgue space $\mathcal FL^\infty$ and in supercritical Sobolev spaces with respect to scaling. Last but not least we recall that the binormal flow is a classical model for the dynamics of a vortex filament in a 3D fluid or superfluid, and that vortex motions are a key element of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Gauging or extending bulk and boundary conformal field theories: Application to bulk and domain wall problem in topological matter and their descriptions by (mock) modular covariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gauging operations (or group extensions) in (smeared) boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and bulk conformal field theories and their applications to various phenomena in topologically ordered systems. We apply the resultant theories to the correspondence between the renormalization group (RG) flow of CFTs and the classification of topological quantum field theories in the testable information of general classes of partition functions. One can obtain the bulk topological properties of $2+1$ dimensional topological ordered phase corresponding to the massive RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional systems, or smeared BCFT. We present an obstruction of mass condensation for smeared BCFT analogous to the Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem for noninvertible symmetry. Related to the bulk topological degeneracies in $2+1$ dimensions and quantum phases in $1+1$ dimensions we construct a new series of BCFT. We also investigate the implications of the massless RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional CFT to $2+1$ dimensional topological order which corresponds to the earlier proposal by L. Kong and H. Zheng in [Nucl. Phys. B 966 (2021), 115384], arXiv:1912.01760 closely related to the integer-spin simple current by Schellekens and Gato-Rivera. We study the properties of the product of two CFTs connected by the two kinds of massless flows. The (mock) modular covariants appearing in the analysis seem to contain new ones. By applying the folding trick to the coupled model, we provide a general method to solve the gapped and charged domain wall. One can obtain the general phenomenology of the transportation of anyons through the domain wall. Our work gives a unified direction for the future theoretical and numerical studies of the topological phase based on the established data of classifications of conformal field theories or modular invariants.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Edge Universality of Orthogonal Polynomial Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the mesoscopic fluctuations at edges of orthogonal polynomial ensembles with both continuous and discrete measures. Our main result is a Central limit Theorem (CLT) for linear statistics at mesoscopic scales. We show that if the recurrence coefficients for the associated orthogonal polynomials are slowly varying, a universal CLT holds. Our primary tool is the resolvent for the truncated Jacobi matrices associated with the orthogonal polynomials. While the Combes-Thomas estimate has been successful in obtaining bulk mesoscopic fluctuations in the literature, it is too rough at the edges. Instead, we prove an estimate for the resolvent of Jacobi matrices with slowly varying entries. Particular examples to which our CLT applies are Jacobi, Laguerre and Gaussian unitary ensembles as well as discrete ensembles from random tilings.</description>

      <title>Excited States of the Uniform Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a cornerstone of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the local-density approximation (LDA), one of the most successful approximations in DFT. In this work, we extend the concept of UEG by introducing excited-state UEGs, systems characterized by a gap at the Fermi surface created by the excitation of electrons near the Fermi level. We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states.</description>

      <title>Open orbits in causal flag manifolds, modular flows and wedge regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study open orbits of symmetric subgroups of a simple connected
  Lie group G on a causal flag manifold.
  First we show that a flag manifold M of G carries an invariant causal structure if and only if G is hermitian
  of tube type and M is the conformal completion
  of the corresponding simple euclidean Jordan algebra,
  resp., the Shilov boundary of the associated symmetric tube domain.
  We then study open orbits in M under symmetric subgroups,
  also called causal
  Makarevic spaces, from the perspective of applications in Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT). A key motivation is the geometry of corresponding modular flows.
  The open orbits are reductive causal symmetric
  spaces, which arise in two flavors:
  compactly causal and non-compactly causal ones.
  In the non-compactly causal case we determine the corresponding Euler elements
  and their positivity regions. For compactly causal spaces,
  modular flows do not always exist and we determine
  when this is the case. Then the positivity regions of the modular flows are not globally hyperbolic,
  but these spaces contain other interesting
  globally hyperbolic subsets that can be described
  in terms of the conformally flat Jordan coordinates via Cayley charts.
  We discuss the Lorentzian case, involving de Sitter
  and anti-de Sitter space in some detail.</description>

      <title>$T\overline{T}$ Deformation: Introduction and Some Recent Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review explores recent advances in the theory of $T\bar{T}$ deformation, an irrelevant yet solvable deformation of quantum field theories defined via the quadratic form of the energy-momentum tensor. It addresses classical and quantum aspects, highlighting significant developments across various fields, including field theory, holography, and string theory. Classically, $T\bar{T}$ deformation manifests through multiple geometric interpretations, notably random geometry, Jackiw-Teitelboim-like gravity, and uniform light-cone gauge frameworks. For quantum aspects, the deformation introduces notable features such as non-locality, UV-IR mixing, solvable renormalization structures, and intriguing modifications to correlation functions and entanglement properties. Furthermore, the paper examines the profound relationship between $T\bar{T}$ deformation and holography, particularly within the mixed boundary conditions/cutoff AdS holography proposal and holographic entanglement entropy. Connections to string theory through single-trace deformations and their holographic duals further reveal the deformed structure of the worldsheet. This review synthesizes recent developments and outlines potential directions for future research in the study of $T\bar{T}$-like deformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the asymptotic symmetry algebras (ASA) of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity within the framework of sl(3,R) symmetry. By explicitly constructing this algebra,
  we explore how the presence of the dilaton field influences the structure of asymptotic symmetries and symmetry breaking mechanisms at the AdS(2) boundary. For the sl(3,R) model, the
  dilaton field preserves a subset of the complete W(3)-symmetry, restricting the algebra to sl(3,R). These results provide deeper insights into the role of dilaton dynamics
  in holographic dualities, with implications for the thermodynamics and geometry of AdS(2). The findings pave the way for systematically exploring extended gauge symmetries in
  two-dimensional gravity and their relevance to higher-rank Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Creation of chaos for interacting Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ Brownian particles, with or without inertia, interacting in the mean-field regime via a weak, smooth, long-range potential, and starting initially from an arbitrary exchangeable $N$-particle distribution. In this model framework, we establish a fine version of the so-called creation-of-chaos phenomenon: in weak norms, the mean-field approximation for a typical particle is shown to hold with an accuracy $O(N^{-1})$ up to an error due solely to initial pair correlations, which is damped exponentially over time. Corresponding higher-order results are also derived in the form of higher-order correlation estimates. The approach is new and easily adaptable: we start from suboptimal correlation estimates obtained from an elementary use of It\^o's calculus on moments of the empirical measure, together with ergodic properties of the mean-field dynamics, and these bounds are then made optimal after combination with PDE estimates on the BBKY hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Ryu-Takayanagi Formula for Multi-Boundary Black Holes from 2D Large-$\textbf{$c$}$ CFT Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.</description>

      <title>Simple and exact nonlinear pendulum motion for all possible initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16816v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simple and formally exact solutions of energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum motion are derived for all three classes: swinging, stopping, and spinning. Their unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires tractable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss nonlinear pendulum. Although with seemingly very different characteristic motions, the swinging and the spinning motion can now be treated on the same footing using frequency domain. The key insights provided by the solutions is the importance of angular velocity frequency analysis, rather than that of angular displacement. The emphasis on velocity frequency domain should benefit other studies of nonlinear motion as well. Brief theoretical derivations are given. The solutions are validated by exact numerical values and frequencies analysis of dynamical simulations using velocity verlet integration.</description>

      <title>Minimal Factorization of Chern-Simons Theory -- Gravitational Anyonic Edge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One approach to analyzing entanglement in a gauge theory is embedding it into a factorized theory with edge modes on the entangling boundary. For topological quantum field theories (TQFT), this naturally leads to factorizing a TQFT by adding local edge modes associated with the corresponding CFT. In this work, we instead construct a minimal set of edge modes compatible with the topological invariance of Chern-Simons theory. This leads us to propose a minimal factorization map. These minimal edge modes can be interpreted as the degrees of freedom of a particle on a quantum group. Of particular interest is three-dimensional gravity as a Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SL$(2,\mathbb{R}) \times$ SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$. Our minimal factorization proposal uniquely gives rise to quantum group edge modes factorizing the bulk state space of 3d gravity. This agrees with earlier proposals that relate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in 3d gravity to topological entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of multiplicative chaos Part II: Fourier dimensions of classical multiplicative chaos measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified approach for studying the polynomial Fourier decay of classical multiplicative chaos measures. As consequences, we obtain the precise Fourier dimensions for multiplicative chaos measures arising from the following key models: the sub-critical 1D and 2D GMC; the sub-critical $d$-dimensional GMC with $d \ge 3$ when the parameter $\gamma$ is near the critical value; the canonical Mandelbrot random coverings; the canonical Mandelbrot cascades. For various other models, we establish the non-trivial lower bounds of the Fourier dimensions and in various cases we conjecture that they are all optimal and provide the exact value of the Fourier dimensions.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Quantum Information Scrambling with the Operator Entanglement Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal features of chaotic quantum dynamics underlie our understanding of thermalization in closed quantum systems and the complexity of quantum computations. Reversible automaton circuits, comprised of classical logic gates, have emerged as a tractable means to study such dynamics. Despite generating no entanglement in the computational basis, these circuits nevertheless capture many features expected from fully quantum evolutions. In this work, we demonstrate that the differences between automaton dynamics and fully quantum dynamics are revealed by the operator entanglement spectrum, much like the entanglement spectrum of a quantum state distinguishes between the dynamics of states under Clifford and Haar random circuits. While the operator entanglement spectrum under random unitary dynamics is governed by the eigenvalue statistics of random Gaussian matrices, we show evidence that under random automaton dynamics it is described by the statistics of Bernoulli random matrices, whose entries are random variables taking values $0$ or $1$. We study the crossover between automaton and generic unitary operator dynamics as the automaton circuit is doped with gates that introduce superpositions, namely Hadamard or $R_x = e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}X}$ gates. We find that a constant number of superposition-generating gates is sufficient to drive the operator dynamics to the random-circuit universality class, similar to earlier results on Clifford circuits doped with $T$ gates. This establishes the operator entanglement spectrum as a useful tool for probing the chaoticity and universality class of quantum dynamics.</description>
