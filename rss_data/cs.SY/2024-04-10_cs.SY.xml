      <title>Parameter-Adaptive Approximate MPC: Tuning Neural-Network Controllers without Re-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a method to control nonlinear systems with guaranteed stability and constraint satisfaction but suffers from high computation times. Approximate MPC (AMPC) with neural networks (NNs) has emerged to address this limitation, enabling deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems. However, when tuning AMPCs for real-world systems, large datasets need to be regenerated and the NN needs to be retrained at every tuning step. This work introduces a novel, parameter-adaptive AMPC architecture capable of online tuning without recomputing large datasets and retraining. By incorporating local sensitivities of nonlinear programs, the proposed method not only mimics optimal MPC inputs but also adjusts to changes in physical parameters of the model using linear predictions while still guaranteeing stability. We showcase the effectiveness of parameter-adaptive AMPC by controlling the swing-ups of two different real cartpole systems with a severely resource-constrained microcontroller (MCU). We use the same NN across both system instances that have different parameters. This work not only represents the first experimental demonstration of AMPC for fast-moving systems on low-cost MCUs to the best of our knowledge, but also showcases generalization across system instances and variations through our parameter-adaptation method. Taken together, these contributions represent a marked step toward the practical application of AMPC in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal robust exact first-order differentiators with Lipschitz continuous output</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signal differentiation problem involves the development of algorithms that allow to recover a signal's derivatives from noisy measurements. This paper develops a first-order differentiator with the following combination of properties: robustness to measurement noise, exactness in the absence of noise, optimal worst-case differentiation error, and Lipschitz continuous output where the output's Lipschitz constant is a tunable parameter. This combination of advantageous properties is not shared by any existing differentiator. Both continuous-time and sample-based versions of the differentiator are developed and theoretical guarantees are established for both. The continuous-time version of the differentiator consists in a regularized and sliding-mode-filtered linear adaptive differentiator. The sample-based, implementable version is then obtained through appropriate discretization. An illustrative example is provided to highlight the features of the developed differentiator.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control based Energy Management System for Home Energy Resiliency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the occurrence of extreme weather events is increasing so are the outages caused by them. During such unplanned outages, a house needs to be provided with an energy supply to maintain habitable conditions by maintaining thermal comfort and servicing at least critical loads. An energy system consisting of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) panels along with battery storage is an excellent carbon-free choice to provide energy resiliency to houses against extreme weather-related outages. However, to provide habitable conditions this energy system has to provide not only for the non-air-conditioning (non-AC) load demand but also for the turning on of the AC system which has a considerably higher startup power requirement as compared to its rated power. Hence, an intelligent automated decision-making controller is needed which can manage the trade-off between competing requirements.
  In this paper, we propose such an intelligent controller based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). We compare its performance with a Baseline controller which is unintelligent, and a Rule-Based controller which has some intelligence, based on three resiliency metrics that we have developed. We perform extensive simulations for numerous scenarios involving different energy system sizes and AC startup power requirements. Every simulation is one week long and is carried out for a single-family detached house located in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in 2017. The simulation results show that the MPC controller performs better than the other controllers in the more energy-constrained scenarios (smaller PV-battery size, larger AC startup power requirement) in providing both thermal comfort and servicing non-AC loads in a balanced manner.</description>

      <title>Learning Model Predictive Control Parameters via Bayesian Optimization for Battery Fast Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning parameters in model predictive control (MPC) presents significant challenges, particularly when there is a notable discrepancy between the controller's predictions and the actual behavior of the closed-loop plant. This mismatch may stem from factors like substantial model-plant differences, limited prediction horizons that do not cover the entire time of interest, or unforeseen system disturbances. Such mismatches can jeopardize both performance and safety, including constraint satisfaction. Traditional methods address this issue by modifying the finite horizon cost function to better reflect the overall operational cost, learning parts of the prediction model from data, or implementing robust MPC strategies, which might be either computationally intensive or overly cautious. As an alternative, directly optimizing or learning the controller parameters to enhance closed-loop performance has been proposed. We apply Bayesian optimization for efficient learning of unknown model parameters and parameterized constraint backoff terms, aiming to improve closed-loop performance of battery fast charging. This approach establishes a hierarchical control framework where Bayesian optimization directly fine-tunes closed-loop behavior towards a global and long-term objective, while MPC handles lower-level, short-term control tasks. For lithium-ion battery fast charging, we show that the learning approach not only ensures safe operation but also maximizes closed-loop performance. This includes maintaining the battery's operation below its maximum terminal voltage and reducing charging times, all achieved using a standard nominal MPC model with a short horizon and notable initial model-plant mismatch.</description>

      <title>A data-driven approach to UIO-based fault diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a data-driven approach to the design of a residual generator, based on a dead-beat unknown-input observer, for linear time-invariant discrete-time state-space models, whose state equation is affected both by disturbances and by actuator faults. We first review the modelbased conditions for the existence of such a residual generator, and then prove that under suitable assumptions on the collected historical data, we are both able to determine if the problem is solvable and to identify the matrices of a possible residual generator. We propose an algorithm that, based only on the collected data (and not on the system description), is able to perform both tasks. An illustrating example and some remarks on limitations and possible extensions of the current results conclude the paper.</description>

      <title>A Large-Scale Simulation Method for Neuromorphic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Splitting algorithms are well-established in convex optimization and are designed to solve large-scale problems. Using such algorithms to simulate the behavior of nonlinear circuit networks provides scalable methods for the simulation and design of neuromorphic systems. For circuits made of linear capacitors and inductors with nonlinear resistive elements, we propose a splitting that breaks the network into its LTI lossless component and its static resistive component. This splitting has both physical and algorithmic advantages and allows for separate calculations in the time domain and in the frequency domain. To demonstrate the scalability of this approach, a network made from one hundred neurons modeled by the well-known FitzHugh-Nagumo circuit with all-to-all diffusive coupling is simulated.</description>

      <title>XFLEX HYDRO demonstrators grid services assessment and Ancillary Services Matrix elaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the methodology and key results which enabled to establish the so-called Ancillary Service Matrix (ASM) presenting the ability to deliver the different ancillary services of each of the 6 demonstrators of the XFLEX HYDRO research project combined with the applicable technologies studied in this analysis. These technologies include i) the variable speed technology with Doubly Fed Induction Machine (DFIM) or Full Size Frequency Converters (FSFC), ii) the Smart Power Plant Supervisor (SPPS) enabling to extend the operating range of the hydraulic units in turbine mode based on a better knowledge of the hydro unit wear and tear and associated costs over the full unit operating range, iii) the hydraulic short circuit (HSC) operation leading to simultaneous operation of pump and turbines of Pumped Storage Power Plants (PSPP) and iv) the Hydro-Battery-Hybrid (HBH) applied at Run-of-River demonstrator.
  The demonstrators considered for this study includes 4 pumped storage power plants, 1 conventional hydro storage plant and 1 run-of-the-river plant. For each demonstrator a 1D simulation model was developed and validated and was further enhanced to include the model of control system enabling to address the various ancillary services. The systematic 1D numerical simulation of ancillary service contribution of each demonstrator and related technologies enabled to quantify the magnitude of active power response to contribute to the different grid services. The results have been scored between 0 and 5 for each ancillary service, allowing to populate the Ancillary Service Matrix which is summarizing the results in a graphical and synthetic way. The analysis of the score of the Ancillary Services Matrix enables the reader to draw several key conclusions about the benefits unlocked by the implementation of these technologies which are summarized in the paper.</description>

Abstract: This paper is addressing the quantification and the comparison of pumped storage power plants, PSPP, contribution to synchronous inertia and synthetic inertia when fixed speed and variable speed motor-generators technologies are considered, respectively. Therefore, a grid stability study was conducted by means of 1D SIMSEN simulation for the 2 x 395 MW PSPP Frades 2 in Portugal with both fixed speed and variable speed technologies in case of operation connected to an infinite power network or to an islanded 4.4 GW synchronous power network.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in Modern Heterogeneous Power Networks with Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronized operation of generators in a power network is paramount to the stability and reliability of energy delivery. In this paper, we address the synchronization problem in a heterogeneous power grid, consisting of both synchronous generators and inverter-based generators, and derive the necessary and sufficient condition guaranteeing the existence of a unique locally stable synchronized mode. Further, our results have implications for utilizing grid-following inverters versus grid-forming inverters in order to enhance network stability. This work is of particular importance as power grids around the world are undergoing a transition from being predominantly composed of synchronous generators towards a grid consisting of a preponderance of inverter based generators.</description>

      <title>Traffic Signal Control and Speed Offset Coordination Using Q-Learning for Arterial Road Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arterial traffic interacts with freeway traffic, yet the two are controlled independently. Arterial traffic signals do not take into account freeway traffic and how ramps control ingress traffic and have no control over egress traffic from the freeway. This often results in long queues in either direction that block ramps and spill over to arterial streets or freeway lanes. In this paper, we propose an adaptive arterial traffic control strategy that combines traffic signal control (TSC) and dynamic speed offset (DSO) coordination using a Q-learning algorithm for a traffic network that involves a freeway segment and adjacent arterial streets. The TSC agent computes the signal cycle length and split based on observed intersection demands and adjacent freeway off-ramp queues. The DSO agent computes the relative offset and the recommended speeds of both ways between consecutive intersections based on their physical distance, intersection queues, and signal cycles. We evaluate the performance of the proposed arterial traffic control strategy using microscopic traffic simulations of an arterial corridor with seven intersections near the I-710 freeway. The proposed QL-based control significantly outperforms a fixed-time control and MAXBAND in terms of the travel time and the number of stops under low or moderate demands. In high-demand scenarios, the travel-time benefit provided by the QL-based control is reduced as it mitigates off-ramp and intersection queues, which is a necessary trade-off in our perspective. In addition, mutual benefit is obtained by implementing freeway and arterial traffic control simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Learning Locally Interacting Discrete Dynamical Systems: Towards Data-Efficient and Scalable Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locally interacting dynamical systems, such as epidemic spread, rumor propagation through crowd, and forest fire, exhibit complex global dynamics originated from local, relatively simple, and often stochastic interactions between dynamic elements. Their temporal evolution is often driven by transitions between a finite number of discrete states. Despite significant advancements in predictive modeling through deep learning, such interactions among many elements have rarely explored as a specific domain for predictive modeling. We present Attentive Recurrent Neural Cellular Automata (AR-NCA), to effectively discover unknown local state transition rules by associating the temporal information between neighboring cells in a permutation-invariant manner. AR-NCA exhibits the superior generalizability across various system configurations (i.e., spatial distribution of states), data efficiency and robustness in extremely data-limited scenarios even in the presence of stochastic interactions, and scalability through spatial dimension-independent prediction.</description>

Abstract: The battery management system plays a vital role in ensuring the safety and dependability of electric and hybrid vehicles. It is responsible for various functions, including state evaluation, monitoring, charge control, and cell balancing, all integrated within the BMS. Nonetheless, due to the uncertainties surrounding battery performance, implementing these functionalities poses significant challenges. In this study, we explore the latest approaches for assessing battery states, highlight notable advancements in battery management systems (BMS), address existing issues with current BMS technology, and put forth possible solutions for predicting battery charging voltage.</description>

      <title>Human-Machine Interaction in Automated Vehicles: Reducing Voluntary Driver Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel car-following control method to reduce voluntary driver interventions and improve traffic stability in Automated Vehicles (AVs). Through a combination of experimental and empirical analysis, we show how voluntary driver interventions can instigate substantial traffic disturbances that are amplified along the traffic upstream. Motivated by these findings, we present a framework for driver intervention based on evidence accumulation (EA), which describes the evolution of the driver's distrust in automation, ultimately resulting in intervention. Informed through the EA framework, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based car-following control for AVs that is strategically designed to mitigate unnecessary driver intervention and improve traffic stability. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control model.</description>

      <title>A Cyber Manufacturing IoT System for Adaptive Machine Learning Model Deployment by Interactive Causality Enabled Self-Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has been demonstrated to improve productivity in many manufacturing applications. To host these ML applications, several software and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems have been proposed for manufacturing applications to deploy ML applications and provide real-time intelligence. Recently, an interactive causality enabled self-labeling method has been proposed to advance adaptive ML applications in cyber-physical systems, especially manufacturing, by automatically adapting and personalizing ML models after deployment to counter data distribution shifts. The unique features of the self-labeling method require a novel software system to support dynamism at various levels.
  This paper proposes the AdaptIoT system, comprised of an end-to-end data streaming pipeline, ML service integration, and an automated self-labeling service. The self-labeling service consists of causal knowledge bases and automated full-cycle self-labeling workflows to adapt multiple ML models simultaneously. AdaptIoT employs a containerized microservice architecture to deliver a scalable and portable solution for small and medium-sized manufacturers. A field demonstration of a self-labeling adaptive ML application is conducted with a makerspace and shows reliable performance.</description>

      <title>AI-MOLE: Autonomous Iterative Motion Learning for Unknown Nonlinear Dynamics with Extensive Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes Autonomous Iterative Motion Learning (AI-MOLE), a method that enables systems with unknown, nonlinear dynamics to autonomously learn to solve reference tracking tasks. The method iteratively applies an input trajectory to the unknown dynamics, trains a Gaussian process model based on the experimental data, and utilizes the model to update the input trajectory until desired tracking performance is achieved. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed method determines necessary parameters automatically, i.e., AI-MOLE works plug-and-play and without manual parameter tuning. Furthermore, AI-MOLE only requires input/output information, but can also exploit available state information to accelerate learning.
  While other approaches are typically only validated in simulation or on a single real-world testbed using manually tuned parameters, we present the unprecedented result of validating the proposed method on three different real-world robots and a total of nine different reference tracking tasks without requiring any a priori model information or manual parameter tuning. Over all systems and tasks, AI-MOLE rapidly learns to track the references without requiring any manual parameter tuning at all, even if only input/output information is available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of road vehicles at an acceptable level requires the absence of any unreasonable risk arising from all potential hazards linked to the intended au-tomated driving function and its implementation. The assurance that there are no unreasonable risks stemming from hazardous behaviours associated to functional insufficiencies is denoted as safety of intended functionality (SOTIF), a concept outlined in the ISO 21448 standard. In this context, the acquisition of real driving data is considered essential for the verification and validation. For this purpose, we are currently developing a method with which data collect-ed representatively from production vehicles can be modelled into a knowledge-based system in the future. A system that represents the probabilities of occur-rence of concrete driving scenarios over the statistical population of road traffic and makes them usable. The method includes the qualitative and quantitative ab-straction of the drives recorded by the sensors in the vehicles, the possibility of subsequent wireless transmission of the abstracted data from the vehicles and the derivation of the distributions and correlations of scenario parameters. This paper provides a summary of the research project and outlines its central idea. To this end, among other things, the needs for statistical information and da-ta from road traffic are elaborated from ISO 21448, the current state of research is addressed, and methodical aspects are discussed.</description>

      <title>PAAM: A Framework for Coordinated and Priority-Driven Accelerator Management in ROS 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Priority-driven Accelerator Access Management (PAAM) framework for multi-process robotic applications built on top of the Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 middleware platform. The framework addresses the issue of predictable execution of time- and safety-critical callback chains that require hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs. PAAM provides a standalone ROS executor that acts as an accelerator resource server, arbitrating accelerator access requests from all other callbacks at the application layer. This approach enables coordinated and priority-driven accelerator access management in multi-process robotic systems. The framework design is directly applicable to all types of accelerators and enables granular control over how specific chains access accelerators, making it possible to achieve predictable real-time support for accelerators used by safety-critical callback chains without making changes to underlying accelerator device drivers. The paper shows that PAAM also offers a theoretical analysis that can upper bound the worst-case response time of safety-critical callback chains that necessitate accelerator access. This paper also demonstrates that complex robotic systems with extensive accelerator usage that are integrated with PAAM may achieve up to a 91\% reduction in end-to-end response time of their critical callback chains.</description>

      <title>Multiple Estimation Models for Discrete-time Adaptive Iterative Learning Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11892v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article focuses on making discrete-time Adaptive Iterative Learning Control (ILC) more effective using multiple estimation models. Existing strategies use the tracking error to adjust the parametric estimates. Our strategy uses the last component of the identification error to tune these estimates of the model parameters. We prove that this strategy results in bounded estimates of the parameters, and bounded and convergent identification and tracking errors. We emphasize that the proof does not use the key technical lemma. Rather, it uses the properties of square-summable sequences. We extend this strategy to include multiple estimation models and show that all the signals are bounded, and the errors converge. It is also shown that this works whether we switch between the models at every instant and every iteration or at the end of every iteration. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method with a faster convergence using multiple estimation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to analyze how the trade-off between the modeling error, the terminal value function error, and the prediction horizon affects the performance of a nominal receding-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) controller. By developing a novel perturbation result of the Riccati difference equation, a novel performance upper bound is obtained and suggests that for many cases, the prediction horizon can be either one or infinity to improve the control performance, depending on the relative difference between the modeling error and the terminal value function error. The result also shows that when an infinite horizon is desired, a finite prediction horizon that is larger than the controllability index can be sufficient for achieving a near-optimal performance, revealing a close relation between the prediction horizon and controllability. The obtained suboptimality performance bound is also applied to provide novel sample complexity and regret guarantees for nominal receding-horizon LQ controllers in a learning-based setting.</description>

      <title>Strong Mixed-Integer Formulations for Transmission Expansion Planning with FACTS Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transmission Network Expansion Planning (TNEP) problems find the most economical way of expanding a given grid given long-term growth in generation capacity and demand patterns. The recent development of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices, which can dynamically re-route power flows by adjusting individual branches' impedance, call for their integration into TNEP problems. However, the resulting TNEP+FACTS formulations are significantly harder to solve than traditional TNEP instances, due to the nonlinearity of FACTS behavior. This paper proposes a new mixed-integer formulation for TNEP+FACTS, which directly represents the change in power flow induced by individual FACTS devices. The proposed formulation uses an extended formulation and facet-defining constraints, which are stronger than big-M constraints typically used in the literature. The paper conducts numerical experiments on a synthetic model of the Texas system with high renewable penetration. The results demonstrate the computational superiority of the proposed approach, which achieves a 4x speedup over state-of-the-art formulations, and highlight the potential of FACTS devices to mitigate congestion.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Unscented Kalman Filter Design for Agricultural Anaerobic Digestion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15958v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic operation of biological processes, such as anaerobic digestion (AD), requires reliable process monitoring to guarantee stable operating conditions at all times. Unscented Kalman filters (UKF) are an established tool for nonlinear state estimation, and there exist numerous variants of UKF implementations, treating state constraints, improvements of numerical performance and different noise cases. So far, however, a unified comparison of proposed methods emphasizing the algorithmic details is lacking. The present study thus examines multiple unconstrained and constrained UKF variants, addresses aspects crucial for direct implementation and applies them to a simplified AD model. The constrained UKF considering additive noise delivered the most accurate state estimations. The long run time of the underlying optimization could be vastly reduced through pre-calculated gradients and Hessian of the associated cost function, as well as by reformulation of the cost function as a quadratic program. However, unconstrained UKF variants showed lower run times at competitive estimation accuracy. This study provides useful advice to practitioners working with nonlinear Kalman filters by paying close attention to algorithmic details and modifications crucial for successful implementation.</description>

      <title>MPC-Inspired Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Model-Free Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05332v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new class of parameterized controllers, drawing inspiration from Model Predictive Control (MPC). The controller resembles a Quadratic Programming (QP) solver of a linear MPC problem, with the parameters of the controller being trained via Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) rather than derived from system models. This approach addresses the limitations of common controllers with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or other general neural network architecture used in DRL, in terms of verifiability and performance guarantees, and the learned controllers possess verifiable properties like persistent feasibility and asymptotic stability akin to MPC. On the other hand, numerical examples illustrate that the proposed controller empirically matches MPC and MLP controllers in terms of control performance and has superior robustness against modeling uncertainty and noises. Furthermore, the proposed controller is significantly more computationally efficient compared to MPC and requires fewer parameters to learn than MLP controllers. Real-world experiments on vehicle drift maneuvering task demonstrate the potential of these controllers for robotics and other demanding control tasks.</description>

      <title>Global Geolocated Realtime Data of Interfleet Urban Transit Bus Idling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban transit bus idling is a contributor to ecological stress, economic inefficiency, and medically hazardous health outcomes due to emissions. The global accumulation of this frequent pattern of undesirable driving behavior is enormous. In order to measure its scale, we propose GRD-TRT- BUF-4I (Ground Truth Buffer for Idling) an extensible, realtime detection system that records the geolocation and idling duration of urban transit bus fleets internationally. Using live vehicle locations from General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Realtime, the system detects approximately 200,000 idling events per day from over 50 cities across North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia. This realtime data was created to dynamically serve operational decision-making and fleet management to reduce the frequency and duration of idling events as they occur, as well as to capture its accumulative effects. Civil and Transportation Engineers, Urban Planners, Epidemiologists, Policymakers, and other stakeholders might find this useful for emissions modeling, traffic management, route planning, and other urban sustainability efforts at a variety of geographic and temporal scales.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode Fault Diagnosis Datasets of Gearbox Under Variable Working Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gearbox is a critical component of electromechanical systems. The occurrence of multiple faults can significantly impact system accuracy and service life. The vibration signal of the gearbox is an effective indicator of its operational status and fault information. However, gearboxes in real industrial settings often operate under variable working conditions, such as varying speeds and loads. It is a significant and challenging research area to complete the gearbox fault diagnosis procedure under varying operating conditions using vibration signals. This data article presents vibration datasets collected from a gearbox exhibiting various fault degrees of severity and fault types, operating under diverse speed and load conditions. These faults are manually implanted into the gears or bearings through precise machining processes, which include health, missing teeth, wear, pitting, root cracks, and broken teeth. Several kinds of actual compound faults are also encompassed. The development of these datasets facilitates testing the effectiveness and reliability of newly developed fault diagnosis methods.</description>

      <title>Breaking Symmetries Leads to Diverse Quadrupedal Gaits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry manifests itself in legged locomotion in a variety of ways. No matter where a legged system begins to move periodically, the torso and limbs coordinate with each other's movements in a similar manner. Also, in many gaits observed in nature, the legs on both sides of the torso move in exactly the same way, sometimes they are just half a period out of phase. Furthermore, when some animals move forward and backward, their movements are strikingly similar as if the time had been reversed. This work aims to generalize these phenomena and propose formal definitions of symmetries in legged locomotion using group theory terminology. Symmetries in some common quadrupedal gaits such as pronking, bounding, half-bounding, and galloping have been discussed. Moreover, a spring-mass model has been used to demonstrate how breaking symmetries can alter gaits in a legged system. Studying the symmetries may provide insight into which gaits may be suitable for a particular robotic design, or may enable roboticists to design more agile and efficient robot controllers by using certain gaits.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Steady-State Solutions to the Equations Governing Fluid Flow in Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04494v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The steady-state solution of fluid flow in pipeline infrastructure networks driven by junction/node potentials is a crucial ingredient in various decision-support tools for system design and operation. While the nonlinear system is known to have a unique solution (when one exists), the absence of a definite result on the existence of solutions hobbles the development of computational algorithms, for it is not possible to distinguish between algorithm failure and non-existence of a solution. In this letter, we show that for any fluid whose equation of state is a scaled monomial, a unique solution exists for such nonlinear systems if the term solution is interpreted in terms of potentials and flows rather than pressures and flows. However, for gases following the CNGA equation of state, while the question of existence remains open, we construct an alternative system that always has a unique solution and show that the solution to this system is a good approximant of the true solution. The existence result for flow of natural gas in networks also applies to other fluid flow networks such as water distribution networks or networks that transport carbon dioxide in carbon capture and sequestration. Most importantly, our result enables correct diagnosis of algorithmic failure, problem stiffness, and non-convergence in computational algorithms.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Mitigating System-Level Anomalies of Vision-Based Controllers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars and drones, have made significant strides in recent years by leveraging visual inputs and machine learning for decision-making and control. Despite their impressive performance, these vision-based controllers can make erroneous predictions when faced with novel or out-of-distribution inputs. Such errors can cascade to catastrophic system failures and compromise system safety. In this work, we introduce a run-time anomaly monitor to detect and mitigate such closed-loop, system-level failures. Specifically, we leverage a reachability-based framework to stress-test the vision-based controller offline and mine its system-level failures. This data is then used to train a classifier that is leveraged online to flag inputs that might cause system breakdowns. The anomaly detector highlights issues that transcend individual modules and pertain to the safety of the overall system. We also design a fallback controller that robustly handles these detected anomalies to preserve system safety. We validate the proposed approach on an autonomous aircraft taxiing system that uses a vision-based controller for taxiing. Our results show the efficacy of the proposed approach in identifying and handling system-level anomalies, outperforming methods such as prediction error-based detection, and ensembling, thereby enhancing the overall safety and robustness of autonomous systems.</description>

Abstract: Learning-based methods, particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), hold great promise for streamlining deployment, enhancing performance, and achieving generalization in the control of autonomous multirotor aerial vehicles. Deep RL has been able to control complex systems with impressive fidelity and agility in simulation but the simulation-to-reality transfer often brings a hard-to-bridge reality gap. Moreover, RL is commonly plagued by prohibitively long training times. In this work, we propose a novel asymmetric actor-critic-based architecture coupled with a highly reliable RL-based training paradigm for end-to-end quadrotor control. We show how curriculum learning and a highly optimized simulator enhance sample complexity and lead to fast training times. To precisely discuss the challenges related to low-level/end-to-end multirotor control, we also introduce a taxonomy that classifies the existing levels of control abstractions as well as non-linearities and domain parameters. Our framework enables Simulation-to-Reality (Sim2Real) transfer for direct RPM control after only 18 seconds of training on a consumer-grade laptop as well as its deployment on microcontrollers to control a multirotor under real-time guarantees. Finally, our solution exhibits competitive performance in trajectory tracking, as demonstrated through various experimental comparisons with existing state-of-the-art control solutions using a real Crazyflie nano quadrotor. We open source the code including a very fast multirotor dynamics simulator that can simulate about 5 months of flight per second on a laptop GPU. The fast training times and deployment to a cheap, off-the-shelf quadrotor lower the barriers to entry and help democratize the research and development of these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety in the face of uncertainty is a key challenge in robotics. We introduce a real-time capable framework to generate safe and task-efficient robot motions for stochastic control problems. We frame this as a chance-constrained optimisation problem constraining the probability of the controlled system to violate a safety constraint to be below a set threshold. To estimate this probability we propose a Monte--Carlo approximation. We suggest several ways to construct the problem given a fixed number of uncertainty samples, such that it is a reliable over-approximation of the original problem, i.e. any solution to the sample-based problem adheres to the original chance-constraint with high confidence. To solve the resulting problem, we integrate it into our motion planner VP-STO and name the enhanced framework Chance-Constrained (CC)-VPSTO. The strengths of our approach lie in i) its generality, without assumptions on the underlying uncertainty distribution, system dynamics, cost function, or the form of inequality constraints; and ii) its applicability to MPC-settings. We demonstrate the validity and efficiency of our approach on both simulation and real-world robot experiments.</description>

      <title>Inferentialist Resource Semantics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems modelling, a system typically comprises located resources relative to which processes execute. One important use of logic in informatics is in modelling such systems for the purpose of reasoning (perhaps automated) about their behaviour and properties. To this end, one requires an interpretation of logical formulae in terms of the resources and states of the system; such an interpretation is called a resource semantics of the logic. This paper shows how inferentialism -- the view that meaning is given in terms of inferential behaviour -- enables a versatile and expressive framework for resource semantics. Specifically, how inferentialism seamlessly incorporates the assertion-based approach of the logic of Bunched Implications, foundational in program verification (e.g., as the basis of Separation Logic), and the renowned number-of-uses reading of Linear Logic. This integration enables reasoning about shared and separated resources in intuitive and familiar ways, as well as about the composition and interfacing of system components.</description>

      <title>Convex Reformulation of LMI-Based Distributed Controller Design with a Class of Non-Block-Diagonal Lyapunov Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses a distributed state feedback controller design problem for continuous-time linear time-invariant systems by means of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). As the exact convexification is still open, the block-diagonal relaxation of Lyapunov functions has been prevalent despite its conservatism. In this work, we target a class of non-block-diagonal Lyapunov functions that has the same sparsity as distributed controllers. By leveraging a block-diagonal factorization of sparse matrices and Finsler's lemma, we first present a (nonlinear) matrix inequality for stabilizing distributed controllers with such Lyapunov functions, which boils down to a necessary and sufficient condition for such controllers if the sparsity pattern is chordal. As a relaxation of the inequality, we derive an LMI that completely covers the conventional relaxation and then provide analogous results for $H_\infty$ control.
