      <title>Implementing Optimal Taxation: A Constrained Optimization Framework for Tax Reform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While optimal taxation theory provides clear prescriptions for tax design, translating these insights into actual tax codes remains difficult. Existing work largely offers theoretical characterizations of optimal systems, while practical implementation methods are scarce. Bridging this gap involves designing tax rules that meet theoretical goals, while accommodating administrative, distributional, and other practical constraints that arise in real-world reform. We develop a method casting tax reform as a constrained optimization problem by parametrizing the entire income tax code as a set of piecewise linear functions mapping tax-relevant inputs into liabilities and marginal rates. This allows users to impose constraints on marginal rate schedules, limits on income swings, and objectives like revenue neutrality, efficiency, simplicity, or distributional fairness that reflect both theoretical and practical considerations. The framework is computationally tractable for complex tax codes and flexible enough to accommodate diverse constraints, welfare objectives and behavioral responses. Whereas existing tools are typically used for ex-post `what-if' analysis of specific reforms, our framework explicitly incorporates real-world reform constraints and jointly optimizes across the full tax code. We illustrate the framework in several simulated settings, including a detailed reconstruction of the Dutch income tax system. For the Dutch case, we generate a family of reforms that smooth existing spikes in marginal tax rates to any desired cap, reduce the number of rules, and impose hard caps on income losses households can experience from the reform. We also introduce \texttt{TaxSolver}, an open-source package, allowing policymakers and researchers to implement and extend the framework.</description>

      <title>The Sleeping Beauty Problem: Sleeping Kelly is a Thirder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sleeping Beauty problem is a problem of imperfect recall that has received considerable attention. One approach to solving the Sleeping Beauty problem is to allow Sleeping Beauty to make decisions based on her beliefs, and then characterize what it takes for her decisions to be "rational". In particular, she can be allowed to make monetary bets based on her beliefs, with the assumption that she wants to gain wealth rather than lose it. However, this approach is often coupled with the assumption that Sleeping Beauty should maximize the expected value of her bets. Here, show that Sleeping Beauty maximizes the expected growth rate of her wealth as a "thirder" sizing bets using the Kelly Criterion under multiplicative dynamics. Furthermore, this position is shown to be impervious to Dutch books. By contrast, the "halfer" position is shown to be vulnerable to Dutch books under similar circumstances.</description>

      <title>A Blessing in Disguise: How DeFi Hacks Trigger Unintended Liquidity Injections into US Money Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Do vulnerabilities in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) destabilize traditional short-term funding markets? While the prevailing "Contagion Hypothesis" posits that the liquidation of stablecoin reserves triggers fire-sale spirals that transmit distress to traditional markets , we document a robust "Flight-to-Quality" effect to the contrary. In the wake of major DeFi exploits, spreads on 3-month AA-rated commercial paper (CP) exhibit a paradoxical narrowing. We identify a "liquidity recycling" mechanism driving this outcome: capital fleeing DeFi protocols is re-intermediated into the traditional financial system via Prime Money Market Funds (MMFs) , where strict regulatory constraints (e.g., SEC Rule 2a-7) compel these funds to purchase high-quality paper. Our estimates indicate that this institutional demand shock quantitatively overwhelms the supply shock driven by stablecoin issuer redemptions. Rather than acting as vectors of financial contagion , these crypto native shocks serve as an inadvertent "safety valve" in segmented markets , providing transient liquidity support and effectively subsidizing borrowing costs for high-grade issuers in the real economy.</description>
