      <title>The Space-Based Time-Domain Revolution in Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based time-domain telescopes such as CoRoT, Kepler/K2 and TESS have profoundly impacted astrophysics over the past two decades. Continuous light curves with high cadence and high photometric precision are now available for millions of sources within our galaxy and beyond. In addition to revolutionizing exoplanet science, the data have enabled breakthroughs ranging from the solar system to stellar interiors, the transient universe, and active galaxies. The key summary points of this review are: (1) Stellar astrophysics has been transformed by the ability to probe the internal structures of stars, test the physics of stellar convection, connect stellar rotation and magnetic activity, and reveal complex variability in young stars. (2) Ages of stellar populations probe the formation history of our Milky Way, and binary star variability enables the detection of "dark" galactic populations such as solar-mass black holes and neutron stars. (3) Early-time observations of explosive transients provide new insights into the progenitors of supernovae, while the quasi-periodic variability of galaxies probes the physics of accretion processes onto supermassive black holes and the tidal disruption of stars. (4) Observations of solar system objects reveal asteroid compositions through their rotation periods and amplitudes, constrain the cloud structure of ice giants, and allow the discovery of new objects in the outer solar system. (5) Open data policies and software have contributed to remarkable scientific productivity and enabled discoveries by citizen scientists, including new exoplanets and exotic variability in mature Sun-like stars.</description>

      <title>Detailed Chemical Abundance Analysis of the Brightest Stars in the Turranburra and Willka Yaku Stellar Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of the three brightest known stars from each of the Turranburra and Willka Yaku stellar streams using high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectra. Abundances for 27 elements, ranging from carbon to dysprosium, were derived. Our results support the original classification that Turranburra, with a low average metallicity of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]=-2.45} \pm 0.07$, likely originates from a dwarf-galaxy progenitor. Willka Yaku has a low average metallicity of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]=-2.35 \pm 0.03}$ with a small scatter in the abundances, consistent with a globular cluster progenitor as suggested by previous studies. Both streams exhibit mild enhancements in neutron-capture elements, with averages of $\mathrm{[Eu II/Fe]}=$ $0.47 \pm{0.09}$ for Turranburra and $0.44 \pm{0.05}$ for Willka Yaku, consistent with enrichment from an $r$-process event. A similar enrichment is observed in other stellar streams, and we further discuss this signature as it relates to the potential enrichment histories of these two streams.</description>

      <title>Beyond prewhitening: detection of gravity modes and their period spacings in slowly pulsating B stars using the multitaper F-test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravity modes in main-sequence stars have traditionally been studied using a prewhitening approach, which iteratively identifies modes in the Fourier domain and subsequently tunes their frequencies, amplitudes, and phases through time-domain regression. While effective, this method becomes inefficient when analysing large volumes of long time-series data and often relies on subjective stopping criteria to determine the number of iterations. We aim to perform frequency extraction of gravity modes in slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars using a statistically robust, data-driven approach based on advanced power spectrum and harmonic analysis techniques. Our approach employs the multitaper non-uniform fast Fourier transform, mtNUFFT, a power spectrum estimator that addresses several statistical limitations of traditional methods such as the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We apply its extension, the multitaper F-test, to extract coherent gravity modes from 4-year Kepler light curves of SPB stars and to search for period spacing patterns among the extracted modes. The multitaper F-test enables fast and accurate extraction of the properties of gravity modes with quasi-infinite lifetimes, preferentially selecting modes that exhibit purely periodic behaviour. Although the method typically extracts fewer frequencies than conventional prewhitening, it recovers most known modes and, in some cases, reveals new ones. We also find evidence for gravity modes with long but finite lifetimes, and detect more than one period spacing pattern in some of the studied SPB stars. Overall, the multitaper F-test offers a more objective and statistically sound alternative to prewhitening. It scales efficiently to large datasets containing thousands of pulsators, and has the potential to facilitate mode identification and to distinguish between the different excitation mechanisms operating in SPB stars.</description>

      <title>Stellar properties and chemical features of the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars observed by GALAH DR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars (GCNS) comprises approximately 330 000 stars within 100 pc of the Sun, as observed by Gaia data release 3 (Gaia DR3). Meanwhile, the GALAH DR4 survey has spectroscopically characterised nearly one million stars, delivering detailed chemical abundances (up to 30 elements). We present a joint analysis of the $\sim$ 6 000 stars common to both catalogues, offering initial insights into the stellar and chemical properties of the solar neighborhood. Our preliminary results indicate that the majority of these stars are FGK main-sequence objects, with some A-type interlopers (with effective temperatures ranging between 3 000 and 8 000 K), with median ages of $\sim$ 1.6 Gyr (ranging from 0.10 to 14.79 Gyr), and metal-poorer when compared to the Sun: [Fe/H] $\approx$ -0.19 dex. Additionally, most of the stars are disc members, with some local halo (high-velocity) stars identified. Building on this foundation, future work will deeper exploit the full spectroscopic information and orbital parameters from value-added catalogues to refine Galactic component classifications (thin-thick disc versus halo membership), perform detailed chemical profiling, and deliver a comprehensive chemo-dynamical characterisation of the solar neighborhood. This will provide new insights into the formation and evolution of nearby stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Hipparcos, Gaia, and RVs reveal that the radio emitting F star HD 220242 has an M dwarf companion, a likely source of the radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of circularly polarized, low frequency radio emission offers the tantalizing possibility of the observation of interactions between stars and their possible substellar companions, as well as direct emission from exoplanets. Additional follow up of systems with radio emission is key to understanding the true origin of the emission, since multiple astrophysical mechanisms can plausibly lead to such signals. While nineteen M dwarfs were detected by LOFAR in circular polarization as part of the V-LoTSS survey, HD~220242 is the only F star to have a circularly polarized low frequency radio detection in the same survey. We conducted radial velocity follow up with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder and combined these observations with additional archival RVs and \textit{Hipparcos}-\textit{Gaia} proper motion accelerations to determine that HD~220242 has a stellar companion with P=16.79$\pm$0.04\,yrs and a mass of $0.619\pm0.014$\,M$_\odot$. We use Spectral Energy Distribution fitting and lack of any UV excess to rule out a co-evolved white dwarf companion and confirm that the companion is an M dwarf star. Given that F stars lack the coronal properties to produce such coherent emission, and the companion mass and lack of UV excess are consistent with an M dwarf, the radio emission is most plausibly associated with the companion.</description>

      <title>Refined M-type Star Catalog from LAMOST DR10: Measurements of Radial Velocities, $T_\text{eff}$, log $g$, [M/H] and [$\alpha$/M]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise stellar parameters for M-type stars, the Galaxy's most common stellar type, are crucial for numerous studies. In this work, we refined the LAMOST DR10 M-type star catalog through a two-stage process. First, we purified the catalog using techniques including deep learning and color-magnitude diagrams to remove 22,496 non-M spectra, correct 2,078 dwarf/giant classifications, and update 12,900 radial velocities. This resulted in a cleaner catalog containing 870,518 M-type spectra (820,493 dwarfs, 50,025 giants). Second, applying a label transfer strategy using values from APOGEE DR16 for parameter prediction with a ten-fold cross-validated CNN ensemble architecture, we predicted $T_\text{eff}$, $\log g$, [M/H], and [$\alpha$/M] separately for M dwarfs and giants. The average internal errors for M dwarfs/giants are respectively: $T_\text{eff}$ 30/17 K, log $g$ 0.07/0.07 dex, [M/H] 0.07/0.05 dex, and [$\alpha$/M] 0.02/0.02 dex. Comparison with APOGEE demonstrates external precisions of 34/14 K, 0.12/0.07 dex, 0.09/0.04 dex, and 0.03/0.02 dex for M dwarfs/giants, which represents precision improvements of over 20\% for M dwarfs and over 50\% for M giants compared to previous literature results. The catalog is available at https://nadc.china-vo.org/res/r101668/.</description>

      <title>Detailed theoretical analysis of core Helium-burning stars: Mixed mode patterns I. Impact of the He-flash discontinuity and of induced semi-convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space missions like CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS have made asteroseismology a powerful probe of stellar interiors. Red giants are key targets thanks to their rich mixed-mode oscillation spectra, which reveal properties of both core and envelope. However, current models of core helium-burning red giants still fail to fully reproduce observed oscillation patterns, largely due to uncertainties in mixing processes such as overshooting and semi-convection. This motivates the need for better seismic constraints to refine stellar models. We investigate how internal structural features shape asteroseismic signatures in core helium-burning stars, focusing on the links between seismic properties and internal chemical profiles. Using an updated version of the Liege stellar evolution code and its adiabatic oscillation code, we compute and analyse mixed-mode patterns for a range of stellar models. Our results show that sharp chemical gradients and central overshooting strongly influence the mixed-mode spectra. Changes in overshooting modify the extent of the semi-convective region, altering the local Brunt-Vaisala frequency and thus the observed period spacing. Variations in overshooting are compensated by shifts in semi-convective layers, keeping the total mixed-core size nearly constant across models. As a result, stellar evolution is only mildly affected, while the seismic signatures, especially the Brunt-Vaisala frequency profile, are highly sensitive to these internal adjustments.</description>

      <title>FAUST XXX: Dust enhancement in the young binary L1551 IRS 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young binary stars with discs provide unique laboratories to study the earliest stages of planet formation in star-forming environments. The detection of substructure in discs around Class I protostars challenges current models of disc evolution, suggesting that planets may form earlier than previously expected ($&lt;1$ Myr). In the context of the ALMA Large Program FAUST, we present observations of the circumbinary disc (CBD) around the young binary system L1551 IRS 5. The CBD exhibits two prominent over-densities in the continuum emission at the edge of the cavity, with the Northern over-density being about 20% brighter than the Southern one. By analysing the disc morphology and kinematics of L1551 IRS 5, we delineate dynamical constraints on the binary's orbital parameters. Additionally, we present 3D hydrodynamical models of the CBD to predict both the dust and the gas surface densities. Then, we compare the resulting synthetic observations with ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.3 mm and the C$^{18}$O line emission. Our analysis suggests that the density enhancements observed with ALMA in L1551 IRS 5 can be caused by interactions between the binary stars and the CBD, leading to dust concentration within the disc. We conclude that the observed over-density corresponds to a location where could potentially grow under favourable conditions.</description>

      <title>Does the Babcock-Leighton dynamo operate in rapidly rotating solar-type stars? Exploration using a 3D dynamo model at different rotation rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Babcock-Leighton dynamo, which relies on the generation of a poloidal field through the decay and dispersal of tilted bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs), is a promising paradigm for explaining the features of the solar magnetic cycle. In rapidly rotating stars, BMRs are expected to emerge at high latitudes, which are less efficient in generating the poloidal field due to poor cross-equatorial cancellation. The operation of the Babcock-Leighton dynamo in rapidly rotating stars is therefore questionable. We, for the first time, using a 3D kinematic dynamo model, STABLE, explore this question. By taking large-scale flows from mean-field hydrodynamics models for stars rotating at different speeds, We conduct a series of dynamo simulations in rapidly rotating stars, exploring the following four cases of spot deposition, each based on a different assumption about toroidal flux tube rise: (i) radial rise, (ii) parallel rise to the rotation axis, (iii) parallel rise combined with an increase in Joy's law slope with the stellar rotation rate, and (iv) increasing time delay and spot size. We find cyclic magnetic fields in all cases except case IV of the 1-day rotating star, for which the magnetic field is irregular. For the parallel-rise cases, the magnetic field becomes quadrupolar, and for all other cases, it is dipolar. Our work demonstrates that the Babcock-Leighton dynamo may operate even in rapidly rotating stars with starspots appearing at higher latitudes.</description>

      <title>The SALT survey of helium-rich hot subdwarfs: final sample and classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A medium-resolution spectroscopic survey of helium-rich hot subdwarfs has been carried out using the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Objectives include the discovery of exotic hot subdwarfs, resolving distinct subclasses, identifying evolutionary sequences, and establishing the past and future histories of many of these unusual stars. This paper extends the sample described by Jeffery et al. (2021) (arXiv:2011.09523) from 100 to 697 stars. It describes the selection criteria and presents spectral classifications based on the MK-like Drilling system. The sample includes 283 extremely helium-rich hot subdwarfs, 17 extreme helium stars, 110 intermediate helium-rich hot subdwarfs, as well as 21 helium-rich stars of other types. It now represents the largest homogeneous sample of both "normal" He-sdOs and "luminous" or "hot" He-sdOs. Interesting stars discovered include magnetic hot subdwarfs, extremely hot pre-white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs, including hot subdwarfs showing NV emission, one short-period binary, new extreme helium stars and several double-subdwarf candidates. The data form the basis for kinematic and model atmosphere analyses to follow.</description>

      <title>Stellar Evolution in Close Binaries: Processes and Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss some aspects of stellar evolution in binary systems. While single stars can swell following the chemical evolution of their interior, stars belonging to binary systems cannot overflow the size of the Roche lobe and hydrostatic equilibrium is strictly impossible. The system is forced to exchange mass between its members through the inner Lagrangian point. In the first part of the paper, we discuss the standard evolution of binaries that have a non-degenerate donor star and a compact companion. We show that the model fails when to account for the occurrence of binary pulsars when they predict a long-standing mass transfer episode. Models including irradiation feedback and evaporation in close binaries are examined next. Following these sections, we discuss the case of systems with a black hole (BH). We show that if BHs are born non-rotating, binary interaction seems insufficient to speed them up, an indication that BH rotation is a feature present at birth. Finally, we discuss Blue Straggler Stars detected in open and globular clusters. Since they cannot be understood as single-born stars, we evaluate one of the proposed channels is mass transfer in close binaries, and discuss its viability and the limitations of the present models.</description>

      <title>Lateral Deformation of Large-scale Coronal Mass Ejections during the Transition from Non-radial to Radial Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09937</link>

Abstract: Many coronal mass ejections (CMEs) initially propagate non-radially, and then transition to radial propagation in the corona. This directional transition is a significant process that determines a CME's space weather effects but remains poorly understood. Based on multi-wavelength observations, we investigate the transition from non-radial to radial propagation in the low corona for two large-scale CMEs from the same active region on the solar limb. In the beginning, both CMEs move in a non-radial direction, beneath a system of overlying loops that are roughly parallel to the flux-rope axis. The CMEs laterally deform by bulging their upper flanks in the non-radial stage toward the higher corona, which results in the transition to a radial propagation direction approximately 25$^\circ$ away from the eruption site. After the directional transition, the non-radial-stage upper flank becomes the leading edge in the radial stage. Although the overlying loops do not strap over the flux rope, their strong magnetic tension force constrains the radial expansion of part of the CME during the transition by acting on the flux-rope legs. A major portion of the filament is displaced to the southern part of a CME in the radial stage, which implies the complexity of observational CME features. This study presents the first investigation of the lateral deformation during the transition of CMEs from non-radial to radial in the low corona, and makes an essential contribution to the complete CME evolution picture.</description>

      <title>Decisively Demonstrating Roman CGI's TTR5 Requirement by Reimaging a Newly-Discovered Brown Dwarf Orbiting a Bright Accelerating Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Roman Coronagraph project HLC/575 nm observations of a newly-discovered brown dwarf (HIP 71618 B) from the Subaru/OASIS survey of young accelerating stars, which is supported by NASA headquarters with the directive to identify targets for the Roman Coronagraph that could fulfill TTR5 requirements and be observed during the technology demonstration phase. The target and multiple bright PSF references are within/close to the Roman Continuous Viewing Zone. A high SNR detection of this companion would singlehandedly fulfill TTR5 and would be the first optical detection of a companion at $&lt;$10$^{-6}$ contrast.
  Roman CPP reference star vetting prioritizing stars that can be paired with HIP 71618 would aid the execution of a successful technology demonstration. Additional similar targets may be discovered from OASIS over the next few years that could increase CGI scheduling flexibility and enhance its scientific and technical return. A close collaborative partnership with the CPP team could ensure that they are schedulable.</description>

      <title>Transient protostellar cores in high mass star forming regions revealed by time-resolved synthetic imaging of dust emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection between dense gas cores and their infant protostars is key to understanding how stars form in molecular clouds. In this paper we investigate the properties, persistence, and protostellar content of cores that would be identified by a dendrogram analysis of 1.3 mm ALMA images. We use a time series of synthetic images produced by post-processing a simulation of star formation in a massive globally collapsing clump, with polaris to calculate dust radiative transfer and CASA to generate synthetic ALMA data. Identifying sinks in the simulation with protostars, we find that most dendrogram-identified cores do not contain any protostars, with many cores being transient features associated with clumpy flow along feeder filaments. Cores with protostars generally host &lt;4, and protostellar mass is not strongly correlated with the mass of the parent cores due to their transience and shifting boundaries. Calculating observationally-relevant intensity-weighted average temperatures for all cores, we find that even at early times the core temperature distribution spans tens of Kelvin, and its width increases with time. The 1.3 mm peak and integrated intensity of the brightest mm core do not increase monotonically as the most massive associated protostar grows, indicating it cannot be assumed that brighter mm sources host more massive protostars. Leveraging the time domain, we test observational properties that have been proposed as potential evolutionary indicators and find that only the total 1.3 mm flux density of the region, the total 1.3 mm flux density in cores, and the number of cores show strong, statistically significant correlation with time.</description>

      <title>Formation of circumstellar material during double-white-dwarf mergers and the early excess emissions in Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early excess emission observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within $\sim1$ day of explosion provides a critical window into their progenitor systems. In the present study, we investigate formation of the circumstellar matter (CSM) in double white-dwarf (WD) mergers. We further study the interaction between the CSM and the SN ejecta. We first model the orbital evolution and super-Eddington mass transfer/ejection in the double WD systems. We then conduct hydrodynamical and light-curve (LC) simulations of the SN-CSM interaction, assuming a prompt SN Ia explosion in a context of the carbon-ignited violent merger (C-ignited VM). Our simulations show that at the moment of the merger, the binary system has the CSM distribution following $\rho_{\mathrm{CSM}}\simeq D(r/10^{14}\ \mathrm{cm})^{-3.5}\ (D\simeq 10^{-14}\text{--}10^{-13}\ \rm g\ cm^{-3})$. The simulated LCs reproduce the early flux excesses across optical to UV bands, as well as their color evolution, observed in the VM candidates, i.e., 03fg/02es-like SNe Ia. This supports that 03fg/02es-like objects originate from the VM explosions. We also discuss the case of the helium-ignited VM, which might be realized in some WD-WD mergers depending on the He content in the system. Focused here is the timing when the explosion is initiated, and we find that the explosion is initiated after the companion WD is, at least partially, tidally disrupted also in this case; we thus expect the formation of the CSM through the mass transfer phase also for the helium-ignited VM scenario.</description>

      <title>Stationary Stars Are Axisymmetric in Higher Curvature Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The final equilibrium stage of stellar evolution can result in either a black hole or a compact object such as a white dwarf or neutron star. In general relativity, both stationary black holes and stationary stellar configurations are known to be axisymmetric, and black hole rigidity has been extended to several higher curvature modifications of gravity. In contrast, no comparable result had previously been established for stationary stars beyond general relativity. In this work we extend the stellar axisymmetry theorem to a broad class of diffeomorphism invariant metric theories. Assuming asymptotic flatness and standard smoothness requirements, we show that the Killing symmetry implied by thermodynamic equilibrium inside the star uniquely extends to the exterior region, thereby enforcing rotational invariance. This demonstrates that axisymmetry of stationary stellar configurations is not a feature peculiar to Einstein gravity but a universal property of generally covariant gravitational theories, persisting even in the presence of higher curvature corrections.</description>

      <title>Estimating stellar atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances using fully connected residual network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances are traditionally determined using template matching techniques based on high-resolution spectra. However, these methods are sensitive to noise and unsuitable for ultra-low-resolution data. Given that the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will acquire large volumes of ultra-low-resolution spectra, developing effective methods for ultra-low-resolution spectral analysis is crucial. In this work, we investigated the Fully Connected Residual Network (FCResNet) for simultaneously estimating atmospheric parameters ($T_\text{eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H]) and elemental abundances ([C/Fe], [N/Fe], [Mg/Fe]). We trained and evaluated FCResNet using CSST-like spectra (\textit{R} $\sim$ 200) generated by degrading LAMOST spectra (\textit{R} $\sim$ 1,800), with reference labels from APOGEE. FCResNet significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods (KNN, XGBoost, SVR) and CNN in prediction precision. For spectra with g-band signal-to-noise ratio greater than 20, FCResNet achieves precisions of 78 K, 0.15 dex, 0.08 dex, 0.05 dex, 0.10 dex, and 0.05 dex for $T_\text{eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], [C/Fe], [N/Fe] and [Mg/Fe], respectively, on the test set. FCResNet processes one million spectra in only 42 seconds while maintaining a simple architecture with just 348 KB model size. These results suggest that FCResNet is a practical and promising tool for processing the large volume of ultra-low-resolution spectra that will be obtained by CSST in the future.</description>

      <title>Generation of proton beams at switchback boundary-like rotational discontinuities in the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alfv\'enic rotational discontinuities (RDs) are abundant in the inner heliosphere and can be used to model the boundary of switchbacks, i.e. Alfv\'enic magnetic kinks. To investigate the effects of RDs on proton kinetics, we model a pair of switchback-boundary-like RDs with a hybrid Particle-In-Cell (PIC) approach in a 2D system. We find that, at one of the boundary RDs, a significant population of protons remains trapped over long times, creating a secondary beam-like component with temperature anisotropy $T_\perp/T_\|\gtrsim4$ in the proton velocity distribution function that excites ion cyclotron waves within the downstream portion of the transition layer. Further analysis suggests that the static electric field in the vicinity of the RD is the key factor in trapping the protons. This work indicates that switchback boundaries could represent a viable environment for the creation of proton beams in the heliosphere; it also highlights the need to investigate RD sub-structures, especially the embedded current systems of interplanetary RDs. Finally, this paper underscores the importance of high-resolution observations of the solar wind velocity distributions around RDs.</description>

      <title>Isotopomer-Specific Carbon Isotope Ratio of Complex Organic Molecules in Star-Forming Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution and sensitivity ALMA observations have unveiled the carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C) of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in a low-mass protostellar source. To understand the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH$_{3}$OH) are slightly enriched in $^{13}$C compared to the local ISM (by $\sim$ 10 $\%$), while those from C and C$^{+}$ are depleted in $^{13}$C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas ($&gt;$ 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in $^{13}$C compared to the observations. Thus, We additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H$_{2}$O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H$_2$CO ice or \ce{C2O} ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form \ce{^13C}-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate $^{13}$C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic ray ionization rate on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of COMs.</description>

      <title>Stellar masses and mass ratios for Gaia open cluster members</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Unresolved binaries in star clusters can bias stellar and cluster mass estimates, making their proper treatment essential for studying cluster dynamics and evolution. Aims: We aim to develop a fast and robust framework for jointly deriving stellar masses and multiplicity statistics of member stars, together with optimal cluster parameters. Methods: We use Gaia DR3 parallaxes together with multi-band photometry of open cluster (OC) members to infer stellar masses and binary mass-ratios through simulation-based inference (SBI), while iteratively fitting the cluster parameters. The validation of our SBI framework on simulated clusters demonstrates that the inclusion of infrared photometry significantly improves the detection of low mass-ratio binaries. The minimum mass-ratio threshold for reliably identifying unresolved binaries depends on cluster properties and the available photometry, but typically lies below $q=0.5$. Results: Applying our method to 42 well-populated OCs, we derive a catalogue of stellar masses and mass-ratios for 27201 stars, achieving typical uncertainties of 0.08 in $q$ and $0.01\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ in the primary stellar mass. We analyse the archetype OCs M67 and NGC 2360 in detail, including mass segregation and mass-ratio distribution among other characteristics, while deriving multiplicity fractions for the rest of the sample. We find evidence that the high mass-ratio ($q\geq 0.6$) binary fraction shows a strong correlation with the age and a weak anti-correlation with the cluster metallicity. Furthermore, the variation of the binary fraction with stellar mass in OCs shows strong accordance with the observed dependence for field stars heavier than $\gtrsim0.6\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Conclusions: Our work paves a path for future population-level investigations of multiplicity statistics and precision stellar masses in extended samples of OCs.</description>

      <title>A Stellar Magnesium to Silicon ratio in the atmosphere of an exoplanet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elemental compositions of exoplanets encode information about their formation environments and internal structures. While volatile ratios such as carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) are used to trace formation location, the rock-forming elements - magnesium (Mg), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) - govern interior mineralogy and are commonly assumed to reflect the host star's abundances. Yet this assumption remains largely untested. Ultra-hot Jupiters, gas-giant exoplanets with dayside temperatures above 3000 K, provide rare access to refractory elements that remain gaseous. Here we present high-resolution thermal emission spectroscopy of the exoplanet WASP-189b (Teq = 3354^{+27}_{-34} K) obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) on Gemini South. We detect neutral iron (Fe I), magnesium (Mg I), silicon (Si I), water (H_2O), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydroxyl (OH) at signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 4, and retrieve their elemental abundances. We show that the Mg/Si, Fe/Mg, and Si/Fe ratios are consistent with stellar values, while the refractory-to-volatile ratio is enhanced by roughly a factor of ~2. These findings demonstrate that giant-planet atmospheres can preserve stellar-like rock-forming ratios, providing an empirical validation of the stellar-proxy assumption that underpins planetary composition and formation models across exoplanet systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very low-mass main-sequence stars reveal some curious trends in observed rotation period distributions that require abating the spin-down that standard rotational evolution models would otherwise imply. By dynamically coupling magnetically mediated spin-down to tidally induced spin-up from close orbiting substellar companions, we show that tides from sub-stellar companions may explain these trends. In particular, brown dwarf companions can delay the spin-down and explain the dearth of field, late-type M dwarfs with intermediate rotation periods. We find that tidal forces also strongly influence stellar X-ray activity evolution, so that methods of gyrochronological aging must be generalized for stars with even sub-stellar companions. We also discuss how the theoretical predictions of the spin evolution model can be used with future data to constrain the population distribution of companion orbital separations.</description>

      <title>Metal-poor single Wolf-Rayet stars: The interplay of optically thick winds and rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) hosts 12 known Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, seven of which are apparently single. Their formation is a challenge for current stellar evolution models because line-driven winds are generally assumed to be quenched at a metallicity of Z &lt; 0.004. Here, we present a set of mesa models of single stars with zero-age main sequence masses of 20 - 80 Msun considering different initial rotation speeds ({\Omega} = 0 - 0.7 {\Omega}_c), metallicities (Z = 0.002 - 0.0045), and wind mass-loss models (optically thin and thick winds). We show that if we account for optically thick winds, fast rotating ({\Omega} = 0.6 {\Omega}_c) single metal-poor O-type stars (with M &gt; 20 Msun) shed their envelope and become WR stars even at the low metallicity of the SMC. The luminosity, effective temperature, evolutionary timescale, surface abundance, and rotational velocity of our simulated WR stars are compatible to the WRs observed in the SMC. We speculate that this scenario can also alleviate the excess of giant stars across the Humphreys-Davidson limit. Our results have key implications for black hole masses, (pair instability) supernova explosions, and other observable signatures.</description>

Abstract: Mass loss shapes the fate of massive stars; however, the physical mechanism causing it remains uncertain. We present a comprehensive analysis of seven red supergiants, for which we searched evidence of episodic mass loss, in three low-metallicity galaxies: NGC~6822, IC~10, and WLM. Initially, the spectral classification of their optical spectra was refined and compared to previous reported classifications, finding four sources that display spectral variability. We derived the physical properties of five of them using the \textsc{marcs} atmospheric models corrected for nonlocal thermal equilibrium effects to measure stellar properties from our new near-infrared spectra, such as the effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and microturbulent velocity. Additional empirical and theoretical methods were employed to calculate effective temperatures, finding consistent results. We constructed optical and infrared light curves, discovering two targets in NGC~6822 with photometric variability between 1 and 2.5 mag in amplitude in r and ~ 0.5 mag in the mid-infrared. Furthermore, we discovered a candidate-dimming event in one of these sources. Periods for three red supergiants were determined using epoch photometry, which were consistent with the empirical estimations from literature period-luminosity relations. Our comprehensive analysis of all the available data for each target provides evidence for episodic mass loss in four red supergiants.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Masses and Radiative Transfer Modeling of HD 698: a Be Binary in Evolutionary Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02523</link>

Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the early post-mass-transfer binary HD 698 (V742 Cas) combining high-resolution optical spectroscopy, long-baseline interferometry, and radiative-transfer modeling. Counter-phased radial-velocity curves yield a circular orbit with P=55.927+/-0.001 d and component masses M_Be=7.48+/-0.07 M_sun and M_comp=1.23+/-0.02 M_sun. The Be primary is traced by broad H alpha wings, while narrow metallic absorption lines arise from a slowly rotating companion. The interferometric separation implies a dynamical distance of 888+/-5 pc. The spectral energy distribution is reproduced with E(B-V)=0.321+/-0.016 and a viscous decretion disk of base density rho_0~5x10^-12 g cm^-3 at r=R_eq, declining radially as rho(r)~r^-n with n=3.0. The companion is luminous and inflated, with T_eff=10.0(+0.2,-0.1) kK, R_comp=13.1+/-0.2 R_sun, and log(L/L_sun)=3.19, contributing significantly to the flux (L_comp/L_Be~0.3). Spectral line mismatches further suggest a hydrogen-poor, CNO-processed atmosphere, consistent with a stripped-envelope star. HD 698 thus adds to the emerging class of Be+bloated OB binaries, capturing a brief post-mass-transfer phase when the donor remains spectroscopically detectable prior to the subdwarf stage.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Multi-Period Analysis of the Ellipsoidal Variable Candidate TIC~470127886 from TESS Photometry</title>

Abstract: We present the first detailed photometric characterization of TIC 470127886, a previously unstudied multi-periodic variable star discovered in TESS photometry. Analysis of 145,374 high-cadence observations spanning 696 days (944-day baseline, 2023 January-2024 October) across 10 sectors (60, 59, 58, 53, 52, 73, 86, 79, 78, 85) reveals complex periodic variability with a primary period of 5.544527 +/- 0.004307 days and false alarm probability 1.47 x 10^-87. Lomb-Scargle analysis identifies three significant periods at 5.545, 5.801, and 8.874 days with amplitudes of 15,702, 12,772, and 12,670 ppm. The phase-folded light curve shows smooth, sinusoidal morphology consistent with ellipsoidal variation from tidal distortion in a close binary, with no eclipse features. A three-component sinusoidal model, appropriate for ellipsoidal variables, provides excellent fit quality. Validation tests confirm signal authenticity and persistence, and systematic checks verify no contamination from nearby stars (&gt;3 mag fainter). We classify TIC 470127886 as an ellipsoidal variable candidate with 0.70 confidence, with multi-period behavior suggesting additional variability mechanisms beyond tidal distortion. This work demonstrates high-precision characterization of complex multi-periodic variables in TESS photometry.</description>

      <title>Resolving Interchange Reconnection Dynamics in a Fan-Spine-like Topology Observed by Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01209</link>

Abstract: Interchange reconnection is believed to play a significant role in the production of solar jets and solar wind. However, the dynamics of interchange reconnection in the low corona might be more complex than recognized before in higher temporal and spatial resolutions. Using unprecedentedly high-resolution observations from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) onboard the Solar Orbiter, we analyze the dynamics of interchange reconnection in a small-scale fan-spine-like topology. Interchange reconnection that continuously occurs around the multi-null points of the fan-spine-like system exhibits a quasi-periodicity of ~200 s, nearly covering the entire evolution of this system. Continuous evolution and reversal of multiple current sheets are observed over time near the null point. These results reveal that the dynamics of interchange reconnection are likely modulated by the emerging magnetic structures, such as mini-filaments and emerging arcades. Moreover, a curtain-like feature with a width of 1.7 Mm is also observed near the interchange reconnection region and persistently generates outflows, which is similar to the separatrix curtain reported in the pseudo-streamer structure. This study not only demonstrates the complex and variable reconnection dynamics of interchange reconnection within small-scale fan-spine topology but also provides insights into the self-similarity of magnetic field configurations across multiple temporal and spatial scales.</description>

      <title>Collapsar Disk Outflows III: Detectable Neutrino and Gravitational Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from accretion disks formed during the failed collapse of a rotating massive star (a collapsar). Following black hole formation, a neutrino-cooled, shocked accretion disk forms, which displays non-spherical oscillations for a period of seconds before becoming advective and exploding the star. We compute the neutrino and GW signals (matter quadrupole, frequencies $\lesssim 100$ Hz) from collapsar disks using global axisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic simulations. The neutrino signal with typical energies of O$(10)$ MeV is maximal during the neutrino-cooled (NDAF) phase that follows shock formation. This phase lasts for a few seconds and is easily detectable within O$(10-100)$ kpc by the IceCube Neutrino Telescope. Additional neutrino signatures from a precursor equatorial shock and by stochastic accretion plumes during the advective phase are detectable within the galaxy. The GW signal during the NDAF phase is detectable in the galaxy by current and next-generation ground-based observatories. The explosion (memory) GW signal is similar to that of standard core-collapse supernovae and can be probed with a deci-Hertz space-based detector. Shock oscillations during the NDAF phase impart time variations with frequency O$(10-100)$ Hz to the neutrino and GW signals, encoding information about the shock dynamics and inner disk. These time variations can be detectable in neutrinos by IceCube within O$(1-10)$ kpc depending on progenitor model, flavor transformation scenario, and detailed properties of the angular momentum transport mechanism.</description>

      <title>The FAST-SETI Milky Way Globular Cluster Survey I: A Pilot Multibeam On-the-Fly Search of Five Globular Clusters at L-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a narrowband technosignature search toward five Milky Way globular clusters (NGC 6171, NGC 6218, NGC 6254, NGC 6838, and IC 1276) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) 19-beam L-band receiver (1.05-1.45 GHz). We adapt the MultiBeam Point-source Scanning (MBPS) strategy to extended targets by gating detections to generalized on-target windows (gOTWs), i.e. the time intervals when a beam main lobe intersects a buffered cluster mask, and by enforcing the deterministic multibeam illumination sequence as a geometry test. Dynamic spectra with frequency resolution about 7.5 Hz and time resolution about 10 s are searched with turboSETI over drift rates |nu_dot| &lt;= 4 Hz s^-1 at signal-to-noise ratio S/N &gt;= 10. From about 2.75e5 raw hits across both linear polarizations, none survive the gOTW gating, array-wide simultaneity veto, in-stripe ordering, and single-drift coherence checks, yielding a robust null result. With system equivalent flux density SEFD about 1.5 Jy and an effective 60 s per illuminated crossing, our per-crossing flux density threshold is S_min about 0.50 Jy, corresponding to minimum isotropic-equivalent radiated power EIRP_min in the range (0.72-1.8)e16 W for cluster distances 4-6.5 kpc; when multiple illuminated crossings occur, non-coherent stacking improves sensitivity by up to sqrt(N). To our knowledge this is the first FAST technosignature survey dedicated to globular clusters and the first to use MBPS as the primary observing strategy. These limits disfavor bright, persistent, isotropic L-band beacons above the stated thresholds during our epochs and establish a scalable blueprint, based on geometry-aware gating and verification, for multi-epoch MBPS campaigns that expand signal morphologies and combine passes to deepen constraints on transmitters in dense stellar systems.</description>

      <title>Questions related to the Deflection of Light by Gravity determined by Soldner, Einstein and Schwarzschild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Before we discuss the deflection of light in a gravitational field, we give a brief overview of some basic physical formulas on photon properties, generation and propagation. The much debated problems of the redshift and the photon propagation in a gravitational field is then considered and applied to the calculation of the speed of light. Many citations are given in direct quotations to avoid any misunderstandings. If the quotations are in German, an English translation is provided. Based on this speed, calculated and measured results are recalled on the deflection of light, with emphasis on the deflection near the Sun. We conclude that the speed of light and the deflection angle can be determined by energy and momentum conservation principles.</description>
