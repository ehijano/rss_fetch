      <title>Influence of the Deformation of Coronal Mass Ejections on Their In-Situ Fitting with Circular-Cross-Section Flux Rope Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the properties, especially the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) invariants, of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) measured in-situ is key to bridging the CME properties from the Sun to interplanetary space. In order to investigate CMEs from the in-situ measurements that provide a one-dimensional (1-D) cut of the CME parameters over the spacecraft trajectory, various magnetic flux rope (MFR) models have been developed, among which the models with a circular cross-section are the most popular and widely used. CMEs are found to be deformed during their propagation in interplanetary space, in which the cross-section may be flattened in the direction of propagation, i.e., to develop an elliptical or even pancake-like shape. We use numerical MHD simulations in 2.5-D to investigate the influence of the CME deformation on the in-situ fitting using two linear force-free MFR models with a circular cross-section, and we focus on the axial and poloidal magnetic fluxes, which are conserved in the ideal MHD frame and simulations. We quantitatively compare the fitted axial and poloidal fluxes with those in simulations. We find that both models underestimate the axial flux compared to that in simulations, and such underestimation depends on the CME deformation. However, the fitting of the poloidal flux is independent of the deformation. We discuss the reasons for the axial flux underestimation and the implication of the CME deformation for the CME in-situ fitting.</description>

      <title>Backreaction of perturbations around a stable Light Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light rings (LRs) - closed circular orbits of null geodesics - are key features of both black holes and horizonless ultracompact objects. While unstable LRs are relevant for the observation of black hole images, stable LRs have been suspected to trigger instabilities, namely in exotic compact objects that could mimic black holes. The underlying mechanism behind this instability remains poorly understood, but a key missing piece is how the backreaction of a perturbation around the stable LR modifies the surrounding spacetime. In this work, some progress in this direction is provided by examining a conceptually simple, yet instructive, toy model: continuum-shell stars, supported solely by tangential pressures. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we show how perturbations around the stable LR deepen the geodesic potential and shifts its location inward, potentially amplifying any instability associated with the LR. By then extending the analysis to more general stars with nonzero radial pressure, we find that the same phenomenon can be expected to persist under reasonable assumptions.</description>

      <title>Plasma Compressibility and the Generation of Electrostatic Electron Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the generation of Electrostatic (ES) Electron Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (EKHI) in collisionless plasma with a step-function electron velocity shear akin to that developed in the electron diffusion region in magnetic reconnection. In incompressible plasma, ES EKHI doesn't arise in any velocity shear profile due to the decoupling of the electric potential from the electron momentum equation. Instead a fluid-like Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) can arise. However, in compressible plasma, the compressibility couples the electric potential with the electron dynamics, leading to the emergence of a new ES mode EKHI on Debye length $\lambda_{De}$, accompanied by the co-generation of an electron acoustic-like wave. The minimum threshold of ES EKHI is $\Delta \mathbf{U}&gt; 2c_{se}$, i.e., the electron velocity shear larger than twice the electron acoustic speed $c_{se}$. The corresponding growth rate is $Im(\omega) = ((\Delta \mathbf{U}/c_{se})^2 - 4)^{1/2} \omega_{pe}$, where $\omega_{pe}$ is the electron plasma frequency.</description>
