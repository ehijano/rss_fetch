      <title>Measuring the Black Hole and Accretion Parameters of Sagittarius A* from EHT Observations using a Semi-Analytic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration produced the first image of the apparent shadow of the central black hole of Sagittarius\,A$^*$ (\sgra). \sgra source structure varies significantly on timescales shorter than the duration of an observation, preventing improved data coverage through Earth rotation aperture synthesis. This rapid variability provides the opportunity to quantify intrinsic variability and separate time-variable emission features from stable signatures of strong gravity and the accretion environment. To infer the properties \sgra and its surrounding accretion flow, we perform Bayesian inference on a series of EHT data segments (``snapshots''). We directly fit parameters of a semi-analytic emission model jointly with complex station gains to snapshot visibilities, then extract estimates of the time-averaged, persistent source structure and temporal variability by stacking snapshots in a Bayesian hierarchical model. This approach successfully reproduces parameters of General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics simulations using synthetic EHT observations. Even with physically motivated assumptions about the \sgra environment, black hole spin and magnetic field parameters are poorly constrained by 2017 EHT observations. Our inference constrains other parameters, favoring a nearly face-on observer inclination ($\theta_{\rm o} = 9.2\degree \pm 3.6 \degree \pm_{\rm v} 11.6\degree$), an emission peak near the horizon ($R_{\rm peak} = 4.9 \pm 0.1 \pm_{\rm v} 0.5\,GM/c^2$), near-vertical projected spin position angle ($p.a. = 7.3\degree \pm 7.08 \degree \pm_{\rm v} 43.5\degree$ counterclockwise from vertical), and dominant emission $43.4\degree \pm 2.0\degree \pm_{\rm v} 5.9\degree$ above the equatorial plane, where we separate average structure uncertainty ($\pm$) from the impacts of temporal variability and model misspecification ($\pm_{\rm v}$).</description>

      <title>Hot, Retrograde Tilted MADs: Misaligned, Precessing, and Shaped by Electromagnetic Torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tilted accretion disks in the magnetically arrested (MAD) state may be present in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei such as Sgr A* and M87. We have carried out 3D global GRMHD simulations to study the evolution of these accretion flows as a function of black hole spin and misalignment angle. Prograde MADs align with the spin through a two-stage process: an initial rapid alignment phase that operates on the magnetic flux saturation timescale, followed by a slower, spin-independent phase. In contrast, retrograde MADs remain persistently misaligned regardless of the black hole spin, displaying solid-body precession at rates four times higher than weakly magnetized flows at the same spin magnitude. By deriving torque equations in ideal GRMHD and evaluating them in a frame aligned with instantaneous disk orientation, we demonstrate that electromagnetic (EM) torques always act to align the disk with the BH spin, but are countered by opposing hydrodynamic fluxes in retrograde flows. We further develop a preliminary empirical model to explain the cause of two-stage prograde alignment and discuss the possibility of alignment in the retrograde MAD. Strongly magnetized, retrograde, misaligned accretion disks provide a candidate scenario for the low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in black hole X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>GRBAlpha, VZLUSAT-2 and GRBBeta -- GRB observations with CubeSats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results from GRBAlpha, VZLUSAT-2 and GRBBeta CubeSats and their on-board gamma-ray detectors for monitoring transients are summarised in this article. GRBAlpha was a 1U CubeSat launched in March 2021 to a 550 km altitude polar orbit carrying a CsI(Tl) scintillator gamma-ray burst (GRB) detector with a sensitive range of approximately 30-900 keV. It successfully operated for over four years until June 2025 when it de-orbited. VZLUSAT-2 was a 3U CubeSat launched in January 2022 to a 535 km altitude polar orbit and de-orbited in November 2025 after almost four years of smooth operation. It carried on board two GRB detectors very similar to the one used on GRBAlpha. Both missions have detected about 360 gamma-ray transients, including over 170 long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and including the most intense GRB ever recorded GRB 221009A and the second brightest GRB 230307A. The new family member, GRBBeta 2U CubeSat, integrated at Masaryk University, was launched in July 2024 to a 580 km altitude, 62 degree inclination orbit. It has been detecting GRBs since its launch without any trouble. Gamma-ray detectors on these nanosatellites are based on CsI(Tl) scintillator readout by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). These missions also provide a unique opportunity to study the radiation damage of SiPMs in the low Earth orbit environment and monitor the radiation belts. We have demonstrated that CubeSats can be used in missions lasting beyond three years and routinely detect GRBs.</description>

      <title>Investigating Twin Star Equation of States in Light of Recent Astrophysical Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twin stars are predicted to exist in nature if the hadron-to-quark phase transition is strong enough to form a new branch of hybrid stars, separated from the branch of neutron stars. We adopt an agnostic approach, using transition energy density, transition pressure, the discontinuity strength, and a constant speed of sound for quark matter as our parameter space to construct a large possibility of hybrid equations of state, and thereby encapsulating a comprehensive picture of the twin star scenario. First, we report the complete conditions on our parameter space imposed by the general relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium solutions. For a fixed transition energy density and speed of sound for quark matter, we define distinct ranges of transition pressures based on the allowed strengths of discontinuity. Below a maximum transition pressure, a range of discontinuity exists that increases as the transition pressure decreases. Thereby, we identify the loci of the limits on discontinuities as the `witch-hat' curves. Based on the causality limit, the witch-hat curves can be punctured or incomplete. Strong constraints on this picture are drawn from the inferences from GW170817 and the NICER measurements. We computed the maximum mass for twin stars to be $2.05~M_\odot$, the allowed strongest discontinuity in rest-mass density to be $7.76\rho_\mathrm{sat}$, and the upper bound on transition rest-mass density to be $4.03\rho_\mathrm{sat}$. Subsequently, we compute the implications of the stiffness of the quark matter equation of state on this picture. Different confidence levels for observational inferences are considered to assess the extent of inclusion (and rejection) of hybrid equations of state and, consequently, their effects on the limits of the maximum mass of twin stars and phase transition properties.</description>

      <title>Pushchino Multibeam Pulsar Search. X. Observations of pulsars at declinations above $+53^o$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search for pulsars was carried out using a Large Phased Array (LPA) radio telescope at a frequency of 110.4 MHz with a time resolution of 3.072 ms and a frequency resolution of 19.5 kHz with a 2.5 MHz bandwidth used. The survey was conducted in a site with declinations of $+53^\circ &lt; \delta &lt; +87^\circ$. The viewing area is approximately 4100 sq.deg. The search was carried out using Fourier power spectra. To increase sensitivity, multiple observations were made in each direction in the sky, and the resulting power spectra were summarized. This made it possible to increase sensitivity by about 5-10 times, depending on the direction in the sky. A blind search opened 35 known pulsars. Estimates of the flux density for 33 pulsars have been obtained.</description>

      <title>[HP99] 159 -- Properties of the first Supersoft X-ray Source with a Helium star donor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [HP99] 159 is remarkable as the first supersoft X-ray source (SSS) identified with an evolved helium star donor. With a likely orbital period of 1.164 d or 2.327 d, the origin of the SSS component is controversial, with the two current models being either steady He-burning on the white dwarf surface, or that it is a helium nova in the decaying phase. To help resolve this issue we present extensive new long-term spectroscopy (with SALT) and photometry (at SAAO and with OGLE) of [HP99] 159 which (a) supports 2.327 d as the orbital period, and (b) finds only a small He II radial velocity modulation. The latter is surprising as it implies a very low inclination system, whereas our light curve modelling suggests $i{\sim}50^\circ$, and hence that the He II must be produced in outflowing material further above, or beyond, the disc. We find that the decaying nova model cannot fit our OGLE light curve and the observed SSS flux level. [HP99] 159 has been essentially constant as an SSS over several decades, implying a sustained high level of mass-transfer from its He star donor, making it the only confirmed single-degenerate scenario SN Ia progenitor. We have updated the known SSS binary parameters and find a clear $\sim$1.5 mag difference in their $M_{\rm V}$ when compared to the $M_{\rm V} - \Sigma$ properties of LMXBs, likely due to the larger irradiated areas and more luminous donors.</description>

      <title>A compact object with a K type star companion in the solar neighborhood: a wide post common envelope binary with a white dwarf candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs) consisting of a white dwarf (WD) plus a main-sequence (MS) star can constrain current prescriptions of common envelope evolution (CEE) and calibrate theoretical models of binary formation and evolution. Most PCEBs studied to date have typical orbital periods of hours to a few days and can be well explained by assuming inefficient CEE to expel the envelope. However, there are currently several systems with relatively wide orbital periods ($&gt;$18 days). To explain these wide PCEBs, additional sources of energy have been suggested to be taken into account. Here, we present the discovery and observational characterization of a compact object ($M\,\geq\,0.58\,\rm M_{\odot}$) with a K-type star companion in the solar neighborhood ($d\sim 112$ pc) and an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb}\sim 14$ days. The compact object binary is likely to be a system consisting of a WD and a barium dwarf. Such a system with an orbital period within the gap between tight and wide binaries provides a test of whether additional energy sources are required to explain its formation. Using binary evolution models, we investigate the evolutionary history of this wide PCEB system and find that the observed properties of this source can be explained without invoking any extra energy source.</description>

      <title>proto-Lightspeed: a high-speed, ultra-low read noise imager on the Magellan Clay Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: proto-Lightspeed is a new instrument that has been commissioned on the Nasmyth East port of the Magellan Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory to deliver high-speed optical imaging with deep sub-electron read noise. Making use of commercial re-imaging lenses and the ORCA-Quest 2 camera from Hamamatsu, proto-Lightspeed images a field $1'$ in diameter at up to $200$ Hz or windowed fields at higher rates, up to 6600 Hz for a $1.6''\times 1'$ field of view. proto-Lightspeed delivers seeing-limited image quality in the $g'$, $r'$, and $i'$ bands and adjustable magnification for pixel scales between $0.017''-0.050''$. proto-Lightspeed is well suited to studying compact binary systems, exoplanet transits, rapid flaring associated with accretion, periodic optical emission from pulsars, occultations of background stars by small trans-Neptunian Objects, and any other rapidly variable source. proto-Lightspeed will be a P.I. instrument beginning in 2026B, available for use by members of the Magellan Consortium. In this paper, we discuss the design and performance of the instrument, results from its two commissioning runs, and plans for a facility instrument, Lightspeed, to support simultaneous multicolor imaging across a $7'\times4'$ field.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength Study of A Superflare on RS CVn-type Star HD22468 Triggered at Hard X-ray by SVOM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of stellar flares at hard X-ray is still rare at the current stage. A transient was recently detected by the hard X-ray camera, ECLAIRs onboard the SVOM mission at 11:39:01.2UT on 2025, January 09. Simultaneous monitor in the optical band on the ground by SVOM/GWAC and follow-up spectroscopy enable us to confirm that the transient is caused by a superflare on HD~22468, a RS CVn-type star. The bolometric energy released in the flare is estimated to be $\sim7.2\times10^{37}-1.7\times10^{38}\ \mathrm{erg}$. The hard X-ray spectra of the event at the peak can be reproduced by the ``apec'' model of a hot plasma with a temperature of $106^{+27}_{-22}$~MK. In the optical range, the H$\alpha$ emission-line profile obtained at $\sim1.7$ hrs after the trigger shows a bulk blueshift of $-96\pm20\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, which can be explained by either a chromospheric evaporation or a prominence eruption. The ejected mass is estimated to be $3.9\times10^{20}$ g for the evaporating plasma, and to be $3.2\times10^{21}\ \mathrm{g}&lt;M_{\mathrm{p}}&lt;8.8\times10^{21}\ \mathrm{g}$ for the erupted prominence.</description>

      <title>Thick Lunar Crust Amplifies Gravitational-Wave Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) in the $10^{-3}-0.1$ Hz band encode unique signatures of the early universe and merging compact objects, but they are beyond the reach of existing observatories. Theoretical models suggest that the Moon could act as a resonant detector, but the unknown influence of its rugged surface and heterogeneous interior has cast doubt on this prospect. Here, we resolve this long-standing uncertainty by constructing the first high-resolution, structurally realistic model of the lunar GW response. We achieve this by combining high-fidelity spectral-element simulations with the analytical power of normal-mode perturbation theory, thereby resolving topographical effects down to $3.7$ km grid spacing while maintaining the capacity to discern global free-oscillation patterns. This dual-methodology approach not only recovers the expected predominant quadrupole ($l=2$) oscillation mode, but also exposes a systematic signal amplification of $(10-20)\%$ in thick-crust regions. This enhancement is traced by our normal-mode analysis to a mode-coupling process, in which the original quadrupolar oscillation induced by the passing GWs distributes energy into a series of higher-order modes, the hybridized eigenmodes of the laterally heterogeneous Moon. Near certain eigen-frequencies and at specific locations, we observe up to tenfold amplification, highlighting the power of numerical simulations in resolving these structurally fine-tuned features. Our work establishes the Moon as an accurately calibrated resonant GW detector, and the resulting amplification maps provide quantitative guide for the optimal landing site selection.</description>

      <title>Universal relation between dipole polarizability of finite nuclei and neutron-star compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear equation of state, which determines the structure and properties of neutron stars, remains subject to substantial theoretical uncertainties, leading to model dependence in predicted observables. Universal relations have emerged as a powerful tool to mitigate this dependence by linking neutron star observables in a framework-independent manner. In this work, we introduce a new universal relation that \emph{bridges} finite nuclei and neutron stars through the dimensionless quantity $\zeta = \beta_{1.4}\tilde{L}^{-1}$, which couples the compactness of a $1.4~M_{\odot}$ neutron star to the slope of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation. The relation is examined under a broad set of relativistic energy density functionals with point-coupling and meson-exchange interactions, as well as non-relativistic Skyrme functionals. We demonstrate that $\zeta$ exhibits a strong exponential correlation with the electric dipole polarizability $\alpha_D$ in finite nuclei across all considered equations of state. By exploiting experimental $\alpha_D$ data for selected neutron-rich nuclei, we constrain $\zeta$ and translate these constraints into equation-of-state-independent bounds on the neutron star radius $R_{1.4}$ and the symmetry-energy slope $L$, providing insights into the properties of neutron star matter.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of AGN feedback in the X-ray bright East and Southwest arms of M87, mapped by XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the central galaxy in the nearest cluster, M87 provides the best spatial resolution for disentangling the complex interactions between AGN jets and the surrounding environment. We investigate the velocity structure of the multitemperature X-ray gas in M87, particularly in the eastern and southwestern arms associated with past AGN outbursts, using high-resolution spectroscopy from XRISM/Resolve. We analyze a mosaic of XRISM/Resolve observations covering the core of M87, fitting single- and multi-temperature models to spectra extracted from different regions and energy bands. We assess the line-of-sight velocities and velocity dispersions of the hotter ambient and cooler uplifted gas phases, and evaluate systematic uncertainties related to instrumental gain calibration. The hotter ICM phase, traced by Fe He-$\alpha$ emission, shows velocity dispersions below $\sim100$ km/s, and no significant velocity shifts between the arms and a relaxed offset region, suggesting limited dynamical impact from older AGN lobes. In contrast, the cooler gas phase appears to exhibit larger line of sight velocity gradients up to several hundred km/s as well as a higher velocity dispersion than the ambient hot phase, although these conclusions remain tentative pending improvements in the robustness of the gain calibration at lower energies. The first microcalorimeter-resolved map of gas dynamics in M87 supports the uplift scenario for the X-ray arms, with the cooler gas in the east and southwest seemingly moving in opposite directions along the line of sight. The kinetic energy is a small fraction of the gravitational potential energy associated with the gas uplift, and XRISM further suggests that AGN-driven motions may be short-lived in the hot ambient ICM. These constraints provide important input towards shaping future models of AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>Drawing the line between explosion and collapse in electron-capture supernovae -- I. Impact of conductive flame speeds and ignition conditions on the explosion mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) are commonly thought to result in a collapse to a neutron star. Recent work has shown that a thermonuclear explosion is also a possible outcome. The division between the two regimes has not yet been mapped out. In this study, we investigate the conditions under which the transition from thermonuclear explosion to collapse occurs, and what physical mechanisms drive each outcome. We conducted a parameter study of 56 3D hydrodynamic simulations of ECSN in ONe white dwarfs using a level set based flame model implemented in the Leafs code. We varied both the ignition location and the central density at ignition to determine the conditions of the transition regime. Additionally, we explored two different laminar flame parameterizations and how they impact the simulation outcome. From our parameter study, we find a transition density in the range of $\log\rho_c^{ini}=10.0$ and $10.15$ g cm$^{-3}$, depending on the ignition location and utilized laminar flame speed parameterization. Importantly, we find that for sufficiently high central densities, the burned ashes can sink into the core and trap large amounts of neutron-rich material in the bound remnant. In the transition regime between explosion and collapse, we find that the laminar flame speed plays a critical role by suppressing the formation of instabilities and thereby reducing the nuclear energy generation needed to overcome the collapse. We find that a thermonuclear explosion is possible for a wide range of parameters, whereby a more off-center ignition allows for higher central densities to still result in an explosion. Both the conditions at ignition and the flame physics are critical in determining the outcome. Detailed 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the preceding stellar evolution and the ignition process of the thermonuclear flame are necessary to accurately predict the outcome of ECSNe.</description>

      <title>Science Opportunities of Wet Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals (wet EMRIs), which arise from stellar-mass black holes inspiral into supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the gas-rich environments of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), are primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) for space-borne detectors like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji. Unlike "dry EMRIs", which form through gravitational scattering in nuclear star clusters, wet EMRIs are naturally accompanied by interactions with accretion disks, offering rich multi-messenger science opportunities. They are distinct in generating transient electromagnetic (EM) signals, such as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), which serve as valuable probes of accretion disk physics and SMBH environments. Their GW signals provide an unprecedented precision of the order of $O(10^{-4}\sim 10^{-6})$ in measuring SMBH mass and spin, enabling the calibration of traditional EM techniques and offering insights into jet formation models. Additionally, wet EMRIs serve as bright and dark sirens for cosmology, facilitating percent-level precision measurements of Hubble parameter through AGN host identification or statistical association. These systems hold immense potential for advancing our understanding of black hole dynamics, accretion physics, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>The role of migration traps in the formation of binary black holes in AGN disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) forming in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) represent a promising channel for gravitational-wave production. BBHs are often assumed to form at migration traps, i.e. radial locations where the Type I migration of embedded stellar-mass black holes (BHs) transitions from outwards to inwards. In this work, we test this assumption by explicitly simulating the radial migration of BH pairs in AGN disks under different torque prescriptions, including thermal effects and the switch to Type II migration. We map where and when binaries form as a function of supermassive BH (SMBH) mass, disk viscosity, and migrating BH mass. We find that, for SMBH masses below $10^8 M_\odot$, the majority of pair-up events occur near migration traps ($\gtrsim 80\%$). In contrast, for higher SMBH masses, differential migration dominates and off-trap pair-ups can prevail. Certain disk configurations (e.g., $\alpha = 0.01$, $M_\bullet &lt; 10^6 M_\odot$) present a significant overdensity of pair-ups even in the absence of traps due to traffic-jam accumulations where the gamma profile changes slope sharply. We also investigate hierarchical BBH formation, showing that higher-generation pair-ups cluster more tightly around trap or traffic-jam radii. Our results provide realistic prescriptions for BBH pair-up locations and timescales, highlighting the limitations of assuming fixed BBH formation sites.</description>

      <title>Captured are circularized: A relativistic treatment of extreme mass ratio inspirals crossing accretion disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A small body orbiting around an accreting massive object and periodically crossing its accretion disk is a common configuration in astrophysics. In this work, we investigate the secular evolution of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which a stellar-mass object (SMO), e.g., a star or a stellar-mass black hole (sBH), collides with the accretion disk of a central supermassive black hole (SMBH), within a fully relativistic framework. We find (1) the disk always tends to align the SMO no matter what the initial orbital inclination $\iota$ relative to the disk is, (2) the final orbital eccentricity of the SMO captured by the disk is always low though the orbital eccentricity may temporarily grow when the orbital inclination $\iota$ is large and the SMO is an sBH, and (3) via collisions with the accretion disk only, only a small fraction of sBHs that are initially close to the SMBH and close to the disk can be captured by the disk within typical disk lifetime of active galactic nuclei. Two-body scatterings between SMOs in the nuclear stellar cluster play an essential role in randomly kicking sBHs towards the disk and boosting the capture rate.</description>

      <title>Precision Determination of Scintillation Screen Parameters from Annual Modulation Measurement of Pulsar Scintillation Arc Curvature with the FAST Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar scintillation observations have revealed ubiquitous discrete scintillation screens in the interstellar medium. A major obstacle in identifying the nature of these screens is the uncertainty in their distances, which prevents precise correlation with known structures in the Milky Way. We used the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to observe PSR B1237+25, PSR 1842+14, and PSR 2021+51. We detected 10 scintillation arcs in PSR B1237+25, 1 in PSR 1842+14, and at least 6 in PSR 2021+51. By modeling the annual modulation of these scintillation arcs, we constrained the distances of the scintillation screens, as well as the anisotropic scattering directions and the projected velocities in those directions. The scintillation screens are distributed throughout the entire paths between Earth and the pulsars. Among these, the distance to the main scintillation screen toward PSR B1237+25 is $267^{+32}_{-28}$ pc, the scintillation screen toward PSR B1842+14 is at a distance of $240^{+210}_{-120}$ pc, and the main scintillation screen toward PSR B2021+51 is located at $887^{+167}_{-132}$ pc. Several screens in our sample appear at distances coinciding with the Local Bubble boundary, particularly the brightest scintillation arc toward PSR B1237+25. We provide a substantial sample of scintillation screen measurements, revealing the rich plasma density fluctuation structures present in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>SCATTER Common Envelope Formalism for Triples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many stars are components of triple-star systems, or of higher-order multiples. In such systems mass transfer is common, and when the transfer is dynamically unstable, a common envelope forms. As such, it is important to be able to compute the post-common-envelope orbital separations among the various stars comprising the system, and to determine whether the common envelope induces mergers or makes later mergers inevitable. In this paper we compute the results of common-envelope evolution for triples. We employ the SCATTER formalism, a new approach to the computation of post-common-envelope separations. This work has applications to gravitational-wave mergers, Type Ia supernovae, and a broad range of other highly energetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Potential divergence in tracing $\mu$ and $\tau$ flavors of astrophysical neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive general formulas for three flavor fractions $(\eta^{}_e , \eta^{}_\mu , \eta^{}_\tau)$ of the high-energy neutrinos originating from a remote astrophysical source by using their flavor ratios $(f^{}_e , f^{}_\mu , f^{}_\tau)$ observed at a neutrino telescope, and diagnose a potential divergence associated with $\eta^{}_\mu$ and $\eta^{}_\tau$ as an unavoidable consequence of the $\mu$-$\tau$ interchange symmetry exhibiting in the $3\times 3$ lepton flavor mixing matrix $U$. We present a complete set of analytical expressions for $(\eta^{}_e , \eta^{}_\mu , \eta^{}_\tau)$ as functions of two typical $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetry breaking parameters in the standard parametrization of $U$, and apply it to the recent IceCube all-sky neutrino flux data ranging from 5 TeV to 10 PeV in the assumption that the relevant sources have a common flavor composition. We also explain why only $\eta^{}_e$ and $\eta^{}_\mu + \eta^{}_\tau$ can be extracted from a precision measurement of $f^{}_e$ and $f^{}_\mu = f^{}_\tau$ in the exact $\mu$-$\tau$ flavor symmetry limit.</description>

      <title>JWST Confirmation of a Runaway Supermassive Black Hole via its Supersonic Bow Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of a candidate runaway supermassive black hole at the tip of a 62 kpc-long linear feature at z=0.96. The JWST data show a sharp kinematic discontinuity at the tip, with a radial velocity change of $\approx 600$ km/s across 0.1'' (1 kpc). The velocity gradient, together with the projected post-shock flow velocity of $\approx 300$ km/s, is well described by a simple shock-compression model of a supersonic object, with a velocity of $v_{BH} = 954^{+110}_{-126}$ km/s and an inclination $i=29^{+6}_{-3}$ deg. The previously puzzling kinematics along the linear feature, with the observed radial velocity decreasing from $\approx 300$ km/s near the tip to $\approx 100$ km/s closer to the former host galaxy, are naturally explained as gradual downstream mixing of shocked gas with the circumgalactic medium through turbulent entrainment. The bow shock interpretation is further supported by the morphology of the gas at the tip of the wake and an analysis of the [OIII]/H$\alpha$, [NII]/H$\alpha$, [SII]/H$\alpha$, and [SIII]/[SII] line ratios. The line ratios are consistent with fast radiative shocks and rapid cooling, with best-fit shock velocities that are in agreement with expectations from the black hole velocity and the shock geometry. Energy conservation over the lifetime of the wake suggests a SMBH mass of $M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$. These results confirm that the wake is powered by a supersonic runaway supermassive black hole, a long-predicted consequence of gravitational-wave recoil or multi-body ejection from galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of periodic orbits and gravitational waves in a deformed Schwarzschild black hole spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00550v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate periodic orbits of test particles around a deformed Schwarzschild black hole and the resulting gravitational waves. Firstly, we examine the properties of circular orbits and find that circular orbits could disappear when the deformation is large enough. Then, using an orbital taxonomy, we characterize various periodic orbits with a set of triples, which describes the zoom-whirl behaviours. We also calculate the gravitational waveform signals generated by different periodic orbits, revealing the influence of the deformation on the gravitational wave, which can be potentially picked up by future space-based detectors.</description>
