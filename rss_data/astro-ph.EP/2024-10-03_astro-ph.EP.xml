      <title>On the early thermal processing of planetesimals during and after the giant planet instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Born as ice-rich planetesimals, cometary nuclei were gravitationally scattered onto their current orbits in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud during the giant planets' dynamical instability in the early stages of our Solar System's history. Here, we model the thermal evolution of planetesimals during and after the giant planet instability. We couple an adapted thermal evolution model to orbital trajectories provided by \textit{N}-body simulations to account for the planetesimals' orbital evolution, a parameter so far neglected by previous thermal evolution studies. Our simulations demonstrate intense thermal processing in all planetesimal populations, concerning mainly the hyper-volatile ice content. Unlike previous predictions, we show that hyper-volatile survival was possible in a significant number of planetesimals of the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud. Planetesimals ejected into the interstellar space proved to be the most processed, while planetesimals ending in the Oort Cloud were the least processed population. We show that processing differences between populations are a direct consequence of their orbital evolution patterns, and that they provide a natural explanation for the observed variability in the abundance ratios of CO on cometary populations and on the recent observations of long-distance CO-driven activity on inbound Long-period Comets.</description>

      <title>Ejected from home: C/1980 E1 (Bowell) and C/2024 L5 (ATLAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Natural interstellar objects do not form isolated in deep space, but escape their natal planetary systems. Early removal from their home star systems via close flybys with still-forming planets could be the dominant ejection mechanism. However, dynamically evolved planetary systems such as the Solar System may also be a significant source of natural interstellar objects.
  Aims. We studied the dynamical evolution of two unusual Solar System hyperbolic comets, C/1980 E1 (Bowell) and C/2024 L5 (ATLAS), to investigate the circumstances that led them to reach moderate Solar System excess hyperbolic speeds.
  Methods. We used N-body simulations and statistical analyses to explore the planetary encounters that led to the ejection of C/1980 E1 and C/2024 L5, and studied their pre- and post-encounter trajectories.
  Results. We confirm that C/1980 E1 reached its present path into interstellar space after an encounter with Jupiter at 0.23 au on December 9, 1980. C/2024 L5 was scattered out of the Solar System following a flyby to Saturn at 0.003 au on January 24, 2022. Integrations backward in time show that C/1980 E1 came from the inner Oort cloud but C/2024 L5 could be a former retrograde, inactive Centaur. The receding velocities of C/1980 E1 and C/2024 L5 when entering interstellar space will be 3.8 and 2.8 km/s, moving towards Aries and Triangulum, respectively.
  Conclusions. Our results for two comets ejected from the Solar System indicate that dynamically evolved planetary systems can be effective sources of interstellar objects and provide constraints on their velocity distribution.</description>

      <title>Evidence that Planets in the Radius Gap Do Not Resemble Their Neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets in compact multi-transiting systems tend to exhibit self-similarity with their neighbors, a phenomenon commonly called "peas-in-a-pod". Previous studies have identified that this self-similarity appears independently among super-Earths and sub-Neptunes orbiting the same star. In this study, we investigate whether the peas-in-a-pod phenomenon holds for planets in the radius gap between these two categories (located at $\sim$1.8$R_{\oplus}$). Employing the Kepler sample of planets in multi-transiting systems, we calculate the radius ratios between radius gap planets and their neighbors. We find that in systems in possession of a radius gap planet, there is a statistically significant deficit of planet pairs with radius ratios near unity, at the level of $3-4\sigma$. We find that neighbors to radius gap planets actually exhibit reverse size-ordering (that is, a larger inner planet is followed by an outer smaller planet) more often than they exhibit self-similarity. We go on to compare whether the period ratios between neighboring planets also differ, and find that radius gap planets are likelier to reside in mean motion resonance with neighbors, compared to non-gap planets (particularly in the 3:2 configuration). We explore the possibility that systems with a radius gap planet may be modified by a process other than photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. The appearance in tandem of unusual size-ordering of gap planets in multi-planet systems, together with unusual spacing, furnishes potential supporting evidence in favor of giant impacts sculpting the radius distribution to some degree.</description>

      <title>Polarized Signatures of the Earth Through Time: An Outlook for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for life beyond the Solar System remains a primary goal of current and near-future missions, including NASA's upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). However, research into determining the habitability of terrestrial exoplanets has been primarily focused on comparisons to modern-day Earth. Additionally, current characterization strategies focus on the unpolarized flux from these worlds, taking into account only a fraction of the informational content of the reflected light. Better understanding the changes in the reflected light spectrum of the Earth throughout its evolution, as well as analyzing its polarization, will be crucial for mapping its habitability and providing comparison templates to potentially habitable exoplanets. Here we present spectropolarimetric models of the reflected light from the Earth at six epochs across all four geologic eons. We find that the changing surface albedos and atmospheric gas concentrations across the different epochs allow the habitable and non-habitable scenarios to be distinguished, and diagnostic features of clouds and hazes are more noticeable in the polarized signals. We show that common simplifications for exoplanet modeling, including Mie scattering for fractal particles, affect the resulting planetary signals and can lead to non-physical features. Finally, our results suggest that pushing the HWO planet-to-star flux contrast limit down to 1 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ could allow for the characterization in both unpolarized and polarized light of an Earth-like planet at any stage in its history.</description>

      <title>The Thermal Structure and Composition of Jupiter's Great Red Spot From JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) was mapped by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/Mid-Infrared Instrument (4.9-27.9 micron) in July and August 2022. These observations took place alongside a suite of visual and infrared observations from; Hubble, JWST/NIRCam, Very Large Telescope/VISIR and amateur observers which provided both spatial and temporal context across the jovian disc. The stratospheric temperature structure retrieved using the NEMESIS software revealed a series of hot-spots above the GRS. These could be the consequence of GRS-induced wave activity. In the troposphere, the temperature structure was used to derive the thermal wind structure of the GRS vortex. These winds were only consistent with the independently determined wind field by JWST/NIRCam at 240 mbar if the altitude of the Hubble-derived winds were located around 1,200 mbar, considerably deeper than previously assumed. No enhancement in ammonia was found within the GRS but a link between elevated aerosol and phosphine abundances was observed within this region. North-south asymmetries were observed in the retrieved temperature, ammonia, phosphine and aerosol structure, consistent with the GRS tilting in the north-south direction. Finally, a small storm was captured north-west of the GRS that displayed a considerable excess in retrieved phosphine abundance, suggestive of vigorous convection. Despite this, no ammonia ice was detected in this region. The novelty of JWST required us to develop custom-made software to resolve challenges in calibration of the data. This involved the derivation of the "FLT-5" wavelength calibration solution that has subsequently been integrated into the standard calibration pipeline.</description>

      <title>BEBOP VI. Enabling the detection of circumbinary planets orbiting double-lined binaries with the DOLBY method of radial-velocity extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circumbinary planets - planets that orbit both stars in a binary system - offer the opportunity to study planet formation and orbital migration in a different environment compare to single stars. However, despite the fact that &gt; 90% of binary systems in the solar neighbourhood are spectrally resolved double-lined binaries, there has been only one detection of a circumbinary planet orbitting a double-lined binary using the radial velocity method so far. Spectrally disentangling both components of a binary system is hard to do accurately. Weak spectral lines blend with one another in a time-varying way, and inaccuracy in spectral modelling can lead to an inaccurate estimation of the radial-velocity of each component. This inaccuracy adds scatter to the measurements that can hide the weak radial-velocity signature of circumbinary exoplanets. We have obtained new high signal-to-noise and high-resolution spectra with the SOPHIE spectrograph, mounted on the 193cm telescope at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP) for six, bright, double-lined binaries for which a circumbinary exoplanet detection has been attempted in the past. To extract radial-velocities we use the DOLBY code, a recent method of spectral disentangling using Gaussian processes to model the time-varying components. We analyse the resulting radial-velocities with a diffusive nested sampler to seek planets, and compute sensitivity limits.
  We do not detect any new circumbinary planet. However, we show that the combination of new data, new radial-velocity extraction methods, and new statistical methods to determine a dataset's sensitivity to planets leads to an approximately one order of magnitude improvement compared to previous results. This improvement brings us into the range of known circumbinary exoplanets and paves the way for new campaigns of observations targeting double-lined binaries.</description>

      <title>Leaning Sideways: VHS 1256-1257 b is a Super-Jupiter with a Uranus-like Obliquity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain the angular momentum architecture of VHS J125601.92-125723.9, a 140 $\pm$ 20 Myr old hierarchical triple system composed of a low-mass binary and a widely-separated planetary-mass companion VHS 1256 b. VHS 1256 b has been a prime target for multiple characterization efforts, revealing the highest measured substellar photometric variability to date and the presence of silicate clouds and disequilibrium chemistry. Here we add a key piece to the characterization of this super-Jupiter on a Tatooine-like orbit; we measure its spin-axis tilt relative to its orbit, i.e. the obliquity of VHS 1256 b. We accomplish this by combining three measurements. We find a projected rotation rate $v \sin{i_p} = 8.7 \pm 0.1 \,\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ for VHS 1256 b using near-IR high-resolution spectra from Gemini/IGRINS. Combining this with a published photometric rotation period indicates that the companion is viewed edge-on, with a line-of-sight spin axis inclination of $i_{\rm p} = 90^\circ \pm 18^\circ$. We refit available astrometry measurements to confirm an orbital inclination of $i_{\rm o} = 23 \substack{+10 \\ -13}^\circ$. Taken together, VHS 1256 b has a large planetary obliquity of $\psi = 90^\circ \pm 25^\circ$. In total, we have three measured angular momentum vectors for the system: the binary orbit normal, companion orbit normal, and companion spin axis. All three are misaligned with respect to each other. Although VHS 1256 b is tilted like Uranus, their origins are distinct. We rule out planet-like scenarios including collisions and spin-orbit resonances, and suggest that top-down formation via core/filament fragmentation is promising.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the era of NASA's Apollo missions Keith S.~Runcorn proposed an explanation of discrepancy between the Moon's negligible global magnetic field and magnetised samples of lunar regolith, based on identical vanishing of external magnetic field of a spherical shell, magnetized by an internal source which is no longer present. We revisit and generalize the Runcorn's result, showing that it is a consequence of a (weighted) orthogonality of gradients of harmonic functions on a spherical shell in arbitrary number of dimensions. Furthermore, we explore bounds on external magnetic field in the case when the idealized spherical shell is replaced with a more realistic geometric shape and when the thermoremanent magnetization susceptibility deviates from the spherical symmetry. Finally, we analyse a model of thermoremanent magnetization acquired by crustal inward cooling of a spherical astrophysical body and put some general bounds on the associated magnetic field.</description>

      <title>GPI 2.0: Exploring The Impact of Different Readout Modes on the Wavefront Sensor's EMCCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) is a high contrast imaging instrument that aims to detect and characterize extrasolar planets. GPI is being upgraded to GPI 2.0, with several subsystems receiving a re-design to improve its contrast. To enable observations on fainter targets and increase performance on brighter ones, one of the upgrades is to the adaptive optics system. The current Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (WFS) is being replaced by a pyramid WFS with an low-noise electron multiplying CCD (EMCCD). EMCCDs are detectors capable of counting single photon events at high speed and high sensitivity. In this work, we characterize the performance of the HN\"u 240 EMCCD from N\"uv\"u Cameras, which was custom-built for GPI 2.0. Through our performance evaluation we found that the operating mode of the camera had to be changed from inverted-mode (IMO) to non-inverted mode (NIMO) in order to improve charge diffusion features found in the detector's images. Here, we characterize the EMCCD's noise contributors (readout noise, clock-induced charges, dark current) and linearity tests (EM gain, exposure time) before and after the switch to NIMO.</description>

      <title>TESS Asteroseismic Masses and Radii of Red Giants with (and without) Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of asteroseismically derived surface gravities, masses, and radii of a sample of red giant stars both with and without confirmed planetary companions using TESS photometric light curves. These red giants were drawn from radial velocity surveys, and their reported properties in the literature rely on more traditional methods using spectroscopy and isochrone fitting. Our asteroseismically derived surface gravities achieved a precision of $\sim$0.01 dex; however, they were on average $\sim$0.1~dex smaller than the literature. The systematic larger gravities of the literature could plausibly present as a systematic overestimation of stellar masses, which would in turn lead to overestimated planetary masses of the companions. We find that the fractional discrepancies between our asteroseismically-determined parameters and those previously found are typically larger for stellar radii ($\sim$10% discrepancy) than for stellar masses ($&lt;5$% discrepancy). However, no evidence of a systematic difference between methods was found for either fundamental parameter. Two stars, HD~100065 and HD~18742, showed significant disagreement with the literature in both mass and radii. We explore the impacts on updated stellar properties on inferred planetary properties and caution that red giant radii may be more poorly constrained than uncertainties suggest.</description>

      <title>Spin-Polarized Electrons from Magnetically Aligned Grains and Chiral Symmetry Breaking: Effects of Cosmic Rays in Protostellar Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy spin-polarized electrons (SPEs) are thought to cause symmetry breaking and could explain the origin of homochirality of prebiotic molecules such as amino acids and sugars. Here we study the effect of cosmic rays (CRs) on the emission of SPEs from aligned grains in dense protostellar environments and explore the SPE effects on chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules. We first show that icy grains in protostellar environments can align with magnetic fields due to magnetically enhanced radiative torque mechanism. We then study the production of thermal electrons by CR ionization of the H$_2$ gas and the CR-induced UV radiation using the attenuated CR spectra in dense cores obtained from a continous slowing down model. Next, we show that thermal electrons with initial random spins captured by aligned grains will quickly become spin-polarized due to the Barnett effect, converting unpolarized incident electrons into SPEs. We calculate the rate of photoemission of such SPEs by CRs-induced UV radiation and secondary electron emission from aligned grains and find that the photoemission by CRs-induced UV radiation is dominant. Finally, we calculate the total production rate of SPEs inside aligned dust grains by CRs. Low-energy secondary SPEs from aligned grains induced by CRs would cause the chiral asymmetry of chiral prebiotic molecules formed in the ice mantle of aligned grains, in analogous to UV circularly polarized light. We propose that amino acids and sugars of chiral assymmetry detected in meteorite/asteroids/comets might be formed in the ice mantle of grains under the irradiation of SPEs released from aligned grains by CRs in protostellar environments.</description>

      <title>A novel neural network-based approach to derive a geomagnetic baseline for robust characterization of geomagnetic indices at mid-latitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geomagnetic indices derived from ground magnetic measurements characterize the intensity of solar-terrestrial interaction. The \textit{Kp} index derived from multiple magnetic observatories at mid-latitude has commonly been used for space weather operations. Yet, its temporal cadence is low and its intensity scale is crude. To derive a new generation of geomagnetic indices, it is desirable to establish a geomagnetic `baseline' that defines the quiet-level of activity without solar-driven perturbations. We present a new approach for deriving a baseline that represents the time-dependent quiet variations focusing on data from Chambon-la-For\^et, France. Using a filtering technique, the measurements are first decomposed into the above-diurnal variation and the sum of 24h, 12h, 8h, and 6h filters, called the daily variation. Using correlation tools and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we identify parameters that dominantly correlate with the daily variation. Here, we predict the daily `quiet' variation using a long short-term memory neural network trained using at least 11 years of data at 1h cadence. This predicted daily quiet variation is combined with linear extrapolation of the secular trend associated with the intrinsic geomagnetic variability, which dominates the above-diurnal variation, to yield a new geomagnetic baseline. Unlike the existing baselines, our baseline is insensitive to geomagnetic storms. It is thus suitable for defining geomagnetic indices that accurately reflect the intensity of solar-driven perturbations. Our methodology is quick to implement and scalable, making it suitable for real-time operation. Strategies for operational forecasting of our geomagnetic baseline 1 day and 27 days in advance are presented.</description>

      <title>A solar rotation signature in cosmic dust: frequency analysis of dust particle impacts on the Wind spacecraft</title>

Abstract: Dust particle impacts on the Wind spacecraft were detected with its plasma wave instrument Wind/WAVES. Frequency analysis on this dust impact time series revealed spectral peaks indicative of a solar rotation signature. We investigated whether this solar rotation signature is embedded in the interplanetary or interstellar dust (ISD) and whether it is caused by co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs), by the sector structure of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), or by external effects. We performed frequency analysis on subsets of the data to investigate the origin of these spectral peaks, comparing segments of Wind's orbit when the spacecraft moved against or with the ISD inflow direction and comparing the time periods of the ISD focusing and defocusing phases of the solar magnetic cycle. A superposed epoch analysis of the number of dust impacts during CIRs was used to investigate the systematic effect of CIRs. Case studies of time periods with frequent or infrequent occurrences of CIRs were compared to synthetic data of dust impacts affected by CIRs. We performed similar case studies for time periods with a stable or chaotic IMF sector structure. The superposed epoch analysis was repeated for a time series of the spacecraft floating potential. Spectral peaks were found at the solar rotation period of ~27d and its harmonics at 13.5d and 9d. This solar rotation signature may affect both interplanetary and ISD. The appearance of this signature correlates with the occurrence of CIRs but not with the stability of the IMF sector structure. The CIRs cause, on average, a reduction in the number of dust impact detections. Periodic changes of the spacecraft's floating potential were found to partially counteract this reduction by enhancing the instrument's sensitivity to dust impacts; these changes of the floating potential are thus unlikely to be the cause of the solar rotation signature.</description>

      <title>A simple model for the emergence of relaxation-oscillator convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth's tropics are characterized by quasi-steady precipitation with small oscillations about a mean value, which has led to the hypothesis that moist convection is in a state of quasi-equilibrium (QE). In contrast, very warm simulations of Earth's tropical convection are characterized by relaxation-oscillator-like (RO) precipitation, with short-lived convective storms and torrential rainfall forming and dissipating at regular intervals with little to no precipitation in between. We develop a model of moist convection by combining a zero-buoyancy model of bulk-plume convection with a QE heat engine model, and we use it to show that QE is violated at high surface temperatures. We hypothesize that the RO state emerges when the equilibrium condition of the convective heat engine is violated, i.e., when the heating rate times a thermodynamic efficiency exceeds the rate at which work can be performed. We test our hypothesis against one- and three-dimensional numerical simulations and find that it accurately predicts the onset of RO convection. The proposed mechanism for RO emergence from QE breakdown is agnostic of the condensable, and can be applied to any planetary atmosphere undergoing moist convection. To date, RO states have only been demonstrated in three-dimensional convection-resolving simulations, which has made it seem that the physics of the RO state requires simulations that can explicitly resolve the three-dimensional interaction of cloudy plumes and their environment. We demonstrate that RO states also exist in single-column simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium with parameterized convection, albeit in a different surface temperature range and with much longer storm-free intervals.</description>

      <title>Shadows Wreak Havocs in Transition Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that shadows cast on a proto-planetary disk can drive it eccentric. Stellar irradiation dominates heating across much of these disks, so an uneven illumination can have interesting dynamical effects. Here, we focus on transition disks. We carry out 3D Athena++ simulations, using a constant thermal relaxation time to describe the disk's response to changing stellar illumination. We find that an asymmetric shadow, a feature commonly observed in real disks, perturbs the radial pressure gradient and distorts the fluid streamlines into a set of twisted ellipses. Interactions between these streamlines have a range of consequences. For a narrow ring, an asymmetric shadow can sharply truncate its inner edge, possibly explaining the steep density drop-offs observed in some disks and obviating the need for massive perturbers. For a wide ring, such a shadow can dismantle it into two (or possibly more) eccentric rings. These rings continuously exert torque on each other and drive gas accretion at a healthy rate, even in the absence of disk viscosity. Signatures of such twisted eccentric rings may have already been observed as, e.g., twisted velocity maps inside gas cavities. We advocate for more targeted observations, and for a better understanding on the origin of such shadows.</description>

      <title>Pebble-driven migration of low-mass planets in the 2D regime of pebble accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: &lt;Context&gt; Pebbles drifting past a disk-embedded low-mass planet develop asymmetries in their distribution and exert a substantial gravitational torque on the planet, thus modifying its migration rate. &lt;Aims&gt; Our aim is to assess how the distribution of pebbles and the resulting torque change in the presence of pebble accretion, focusing on its 2D regime. &lt;Methods&gt; First, we performed 2D high-resolution multi-fluid simulations with Fargo3D but found that they are impractical for resolving pebble accretion due to the smoothing of the planetary gravitational potential. To remove the smoothing and directly trace pebbles accreted by the planet, we developed a new code, Deneb, which evolves an ensemble of pebbles, represented by Lagrangian superparticles, in a steady-state gaseous background. &lt;Results&gt; For small and moderate Stokes numbers, St $\lesssim 0.1$, pebble accretion creates two underdense regions with a front-rear asymmetry with respect to the planet. The underdensity trailing the planet is more extended. The resulting excess of pebble mass in front of the planet then makes the pebble torque positive and capable of outperforming the negative gas torque. Pebble accretion thus enables outward migration (previously thought to occur mainly for St $\gtrsim 0.1$) in a larger portion of the parameter space. It occurs for the planet mass $M_{pl}\lesssim3\,M_{\oplus}$ and for all the Stokes numbers considered in our study, St $\in$ [$10^{-2}, 0.785$], assuming a pebble-to-gas mass ratio of $Z = 0.01$. &lt;Conclusions&gt; If some of the observed planets underwent outward pebble-driven migration during their accretion, the formation sites of their progenitor embryos could have differed greatly from the usual predictions of planet formation models. To enable an update of the respective models, we provide a scaling law for the pebble torque that can be readily incorporated in N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Semi-convective Staircases in Rotating Flows: Consequences for Fuzzy Cores in Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observational constraints on the internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that these planets have ``fuzzy" cores, i.e., gradients of the concentration of heavy elements that might span a large fraction of the planet's radius. These cores could be composed of a semi-convective staircase, i.e., multiple convective layers separated by diffusive interfaces arising from double-diffusive instabilities. However, to date, no study has demonstrated how such staircases can avoid layer mergers and persist over evolutionary time scales. In fact, previous work has found that these mergers occur rapidly, leading to only a single convective layer. Using 3D simulations, we demonstrate that rotation prolongs the lifetime of a convective staircase by increasing the timescale for both layer merger and erosion of the interface between the final two layers. We present an analytic model for the erosion phase, predicting that rotation increases the erosion time by a factor of approximately $\mathrm{Ro}^{-1/2}$, where $\mathrm{Ro}$ is the Rossby number of the convective flows (the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time). For Jovian conditions at early times after formation (when convection is vigorous enough to mix a large fraction of the planet), we find the erosion time to be roughly $10^{9}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the non-rotating case and $10^{11}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the rotating case. If these timescales are confirmed with a larger suite of numerical simulations, the existence of convective staircases within the deep interiors of giant planets is a strong possibility, and rotation could be an important factor in the preservation of their fuzzy cores.</description>

      <title>Polar Neptunes are Stable to Tides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an intriguing and growing population of Neptune-sized planets with stellar obliquities near $\sim90^{\circ}$. One previously proposed formation pathway is a disk-driven resonance, which can take place at the end stages of planet formation in a system containing an inner Neptune, outer cold Jupiter, and protoplanetary disk. This mechanism occurs within the first $\sim10$ Myr, but most of the polar Neptunes we see today are $\sim$Gyrs old. Up until now, there has not been an extensive analysis of whether the polar orbits are stable over $\sim$Gyr timescales. Tidal realignment mechanisms are known to operate in other systems, and if they are active here, this would cause theoretical tension with a primordial misalignment story. In this paper, we explore the effects of tidal evolution on the disk-driven resonance theory. We use both $N$-body and secular simulations to study tidal effects on both the initial resonant encounter and long-term evolution. We find that the polar orbits are remarkably stable on $\sim$Gyr timescales. Inclination damping does not occur for the polar cases, although we do identify sub-polar cases where it is important. We consider two case study polar Neptunes, WASP-107 b and HAT-P-11 b, and study them in the context of this theory, finding consistency with present-day properties if their tidal quality factors are $Q \gtrsim 10^4$ and $Q \gtrsim 10^5$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Short-Period Variables in TESS Full-Frame Image Light Curves Identified via Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission measured light from stars in ~85% of the sky throughout its two-year primary mission, resulting in millions of TESS 30-minute cadence light curves to analyze in the search for transiting exoplanets. To search this vast dataset, we aim to provide an approach that is both computationally efficient, produces highly performant predictions, and minimizes the required human search effort. We present a convolutional neural network that we train to identify short period variables. To make a prediction for a given light curve, our network requires no prior target parameters identified using other methods. Our network performs inference on a TESS 30-minute cadence light curve in ~5ms on a single GPU, enabling large scale archival searches. We present a collection of 14156 short-period variables identified by our network. The majority of our identified variables fall into two prominent populations, one of short-period main sequence binaries and another of Delta Scuti stars. Our neural network model and related code is additionally provided as open-source code for public use and extension.</description>
