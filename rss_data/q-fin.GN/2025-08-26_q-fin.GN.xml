      <title>Solution to the Equity Premium Puzzle with Time Varying Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article's aim is to provide a solution to the Equity Premium Puzzle with a derived model. The derived model which depends on Consumption Capital Asset Pricing Model gives a solution to the puzzle with the values of coefficient of relative risk aversion around 4.40 by assuming the subjective time discount factors as 0.97, 0.98 and 0.99. These values are found compatible with empirical literature. Moreover, the risk-free asset and equity investors are determined as insufficient risk-loving investors in 1977, which can be considered a type of risk-averse behavior. The risk attitude determination also confirms the validity of the model. Hence, it can be stated that calculated values and risk behavior determination demonstrate the correctness of the derived model because test results are robust.</description>

      <title>Modeling the impact of Climate transition on real estate prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a model to quantify the impact of the climate transition on a property in housing market. We begin by noting that property is an asset in an economy. That economy is organized in sectors, driven by its productivity which is a multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while the climate transition is declined thanks to the carbon price, a continuous deterministic process. We then extend the sales comparison approach and the income approach to valuate an energy inefficient real estate asset. We obtain its value as the difference between the price of an equivalent efficient building following an exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck as well as the actualized renovation costs and the actualized sum of the future additional energy costs (before and after the renovation date). These costs are due to the inefficiency of the building, before an optimal renovation date which depends on the carbon price process. Moreover, since the renovation increases the efficiency of the building, which is random, the future additional energy costs become smaller and even zero if the optimal energy efficiency is reached. Finally, we carry out simulations based on the French economy and the house price index of France. The findings support the conclusion that the order of magnitude of the depreciation obtained by our model is the same as the empirical observations.</description>
