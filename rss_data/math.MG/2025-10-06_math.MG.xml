      <title>Large Deviations Principle for Isoperimetry and Its Equivalence to Nonlinear Log-Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the large deviations principle (which concerns sequences of exponentially small sets) for the isoperimetric problem on product Riemannian manifolds $M^{n}$ equipped with product probability measures $\nu^{\otimes n}$, where $M$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying curvature-dimension bound $\mathrm{CD}(0,\infty)$. When the probability measure ${\nu}$ satisfies a specific light-tail condition, we establish an exact characterization of the large deviations asymptotics for the isoperimetric profile, which shows a precise equivalence between these asymptotic isoperimetric inequalities and nonlinear log-Sobolev inequalities. It is observed that the product of two relative entropy typical sets or their one-sided versions (or the product of two empirically typical sets) forms an asymptotically optimal solution to the isoperimetric problem. The proofs in this paper rely on tools from information theory, optimal transport, and geometric measure theory.</description>

      <title>Distinct Distances on Pfaffian Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Pach and de Zeeuw's bound for distinct distances between points on two curves, from algebraic curves to Pfaffian curves. Pfaffian curves include those that can be defined by any combination of elementary functions, including exponential and logarithmic functions, rational and irrational powers, trigonometric functions and their inverses, integration, and more. The bound remains $\Omega(\min\{m^{3/4}n^{3/4},m^2,n^2\})$, as obtained from the proximity technique of Solymosi and Zahl.</description>

      <title>Exponential valuations on lattice polygons valued at formal power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify valuations on lattice polygons with values in the ring of formal power series that commute with the action of the affine unimodular group. A typical example of such valuations is induced by the Laplace transform, but as it turns out there are many more. The classification is done in terms of formal power series that satisfy certain functional equations. We align our classification with the decomposition into so-called dilative components.</description>

      <title>Optimal Regularization Under Uncertainty: Distributional Robustness and Convexity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regularization is a central tool for addressing ill-posedness in inverse problems and statistical estimation, with the choice of a suitable penalty often determining the reliability and interpretability of downstream solutions. While recent work has characterized optimal regularizers for well-specified data distributions, practical deployments are often complicated by distributional uncertainty and the need to enforce structural constraints such as convexity. In this paper, we introduce a framework for distributionally robust optimal regularization, which identifies regularizers that remain effective under perturbations of the data distribution. Our approach leverages convex duality to reformulate the underlying distributionally robust optimization problem, eliminating the inner maximization and yielding formulations that are amenable to numerical computation. We show how the resulting robust regularizers interpolate between memorization of the training distribution and uniform priors, providing insights into their behavior as robustness parameters vary. For example, we show how certain ambiguity sets, such as those based on the Wasserstein-1 distance, naturally induce regularity in the optimal regularizer by promoting regularizers with smaller Lipschitz constants. We further investigate the setting where regularizers are required to be convex, formulating a convex program for their computation and illustrating their stability with respect to distributional shifts. Taken together, our results provide both theoretical and computational foundations for designing regularizers that are reliable under model uncertainty and structurally constrained for robust deployment.</description>

      <title>At most 10 cylinders mutually touch: a Ramsey-theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Littlewood asked for the maximum number $N$ of congruent infinite cylinders that can be arranged in $\mathbb{R}^3$ so that every pair touches. We improve upon the proof of the second author that $N \leq 18$ to show that $N \leq 10$. Together with the lower bound established by Boz\'oki, Lee, and R\'onyai, this shows that $N \in \{7,8,9,10\}$. Our method is based on linear algebra and Ramsey theory, and makes partial use of computer verification. We also provide a completely computer-free proof that $N \leq 12$.</description>

      <title>Disintegrating the curve complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a finite sequence of graphs, beginning with the curve graph and ending with a graph quasi-isometric to a tree. There is a Lipschitz map from one graph in the sequence to the next. This sequence was first introduced by Hamenst\"adt. We prove (as conjectured by Hamenst\"adt) that the graphs in this sequence are hyperbolic and that the coarse fibers of the maps in the sequence are quasi-trees. This gives an upper bound on the asymptotic dimension of each graph in the sequence and as a result, an upper bound on the asymptotic dimension of the curve graph. Additionally, we show that the action of the mapping class group on each graph in the sequence is acylindrical, and classify the boundary and actions of individual mapping classes for each graph in the sequence.</description>

      <title>Optimal frames for Phase Retrieval from Edge Vectors of Optimal Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to characterize the optimal frame for phase retrieval, defined as the frame whose condition number for phase retrieval attains its minimal value. In the context of the two-dimensional real case, we reveal the connection between optimal frames for phase retrieval and the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem, originally proposed by Reinhardt in 1922. Our work establishes that every optimal solution to the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem inherently leads to an optimal frame in ${\mathbb R}^2$. By recasting the optimal polygons problem as one concerning the discrepancy of roots of unity, we characterize all optimal polygons. Building upon this connection, we then characterize all optimal frames with $m$ vectors in ${\mathbb R}^2$ for phase retrieval when $m \geq 3$ has an odd factor. As a key corollary, we show that the harmonic frame $E_m$ is {\em not} optimal for any even integer $m \geq 4$. This finding disproves a conjecture proposed by Xia, Xu, and Xu (Math. Comp., 90(356): 2931-2960). Previous work has established that the harmonic frame $E_m \subset {\mathbb R}^2$ is indeed optimal when $m$ is an odd integer.
  Exploring the connection between phase retrieval and discrete geometry, this paper aims to illuminate advancements in phase retrieval and offer new perspectives on the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem.</description>

      <title>Edge-to-edge Tilings of the Sphere by Angle Congruent Pentagons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Congruent polygons are congruent in angles as well as in edge lengths. We concentrate on the angle aspect, and investigate how tilings of the sphere by congruent pentagons can be determined by the angle information only. We also investigate how the features of tilings are changed under reductions, i.e., by ignoring the difference among the angles.</description>

      <title>Busemann Functions in the Wasserstein Space: Existence, Closed-Forms, and Applications to Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Busemann function has recently found much interest in a variety of geometric machine learning problems, as it naturally defines projections onto geodesic rays of Riemannian manifolds and generalizes the notion of hyperplanes. As several sources of data can be conveniently modeled as probability distributions, it is natural to study this function in the Wasserstein space, which carries a rich formal Riemannian structure induced by Optimal Transport metrics. In this work, we investigate the existence and computation of Busemann functions in Wasserstein space, which admits geodesic rays. We establish closed-form expressions in two important cases: one-dimensional distributions and Gaussian measures. These results enable explicit projection schemes for probability distributions on $\mathbb{R}$, which in turn allow us to define novel Sliced-Wasserstein distances over Gaussian mixtures and labeled datasets. We demonstrate the efficiency of those original schemes on synthetic datasets as well as transfer learning problems.</description>

      <title>A Tauberian approach to metric scaling limits of random discrete structures, with an application to random planar maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove sandwich theorems and a Tauberian theorem in the space of compact metric measure spaces, endowed with the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov (GHP) topology. These results hold with respect to a close relative of Gromov's Lipschitz order. As a proof-of-concept of a general method to prove metric scaling limits of random discrete structures, we give an application to the theory of random planar maps: the Brownian sphere is the scaling limit in the GHP topology of irreducible quandrangulations. Our main inputs are (i) the convergence of general quadrangulations to the Brownian sphere (Le Gall, 2013; Miermont, 2013); and (ii) couplings where irreducible quadrangulations of the hexagon are "grown" by face-openings (Addario-Berry, 2016).</description>

      <title>Two nearly equal distances in $R^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.01055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A point set $P \subset {\Bbb{R}}^d$ is {\it separated} if the minimum distance between any two points in $P$ is at least $1$. For $d \ne 4,5,$ we determine, for every $t_1,t_2 \ge 1$, and for $n$ at least a suitable $n_d$, the maximum number of point pairs in a separated $n$-element point set in ${\Bbb{R}}^d$, with distances in the set $[t_1,t_1 + 1]\cup[t_2,t_2 + 1]$. For $d=4,5$ we establish a weaker, similar asymptotic estimate. Recently N. Frankl and A. Kupavskii have generalized this result to unions of $k\ge 2$ intervals. We also determine the maximum number of point pairs in an $n$-element point set in ${\Bbb{R}}^d$, whose distances belong to the union of $k \ge 2$ intervals of the form $[t_i, t_i(1 + \varepsilon)]$, where $t_i &gt; 0$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ is small.</description>

      <title>Reverse Isoperimetric Properties of Thick $\lambda$-Concave Bodies in the Hyperbolic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we address the reverse isoperimetric inequality for convex bodies with uniform curvature constraints in the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$. We prove that the\textit{ thick $\lambda$-sausage} body, that is, the convex domain bounded by two equal circular arcs of curvature $\lambda$ and two equal arcs of hypercircle of curvature $1 / \lambda$, is the unique minimizer of area among all bodies $K \subset \mathbb{H}^2$ with a given length and with curvature of $\partial K$ satisfying $1 / \lambda \leq \kappa \leq \lambda$ (in a weak sense). We call this class of bodies \textit{thick $\lambda$-concave} bodies, in analogy to the Euclidean case where a body is $\lambda$-concave if $0 \leq \kappa \leq \lambda$. The main difficulty in the hyperbolic setting is that the inner parallel bodies of a convex body are not necessarily convex. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce an extra assumption of thickness $\kappa \geq 1/\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Concrete convergence rates for common fixed point problems under Karamata regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Karamata regular operators, which is a notion of regularity that is suitable for obtaining concrete convergence rates for common fixed point problems. This provides a broad framework that includes, but goes beyond, H\"olderian error bounds and H\"older regular operators. By concrete, we mean that the rates we obtain are explicitly expressed in terms of a function of the iteration number $k$ instead, of say, a function of the iterate $x^k$. While it is well-known that under H\"olderian-like assumptions many algorithms converge linearly/sublinearly (depending on the exponent), little it is known when the underlying problem data does not satisfy H\"olderian assumptions, which may happen if a problem involves exponentials and logarithms. Our main innovation is the usage of the theory of regularly varying functions which we showcase by obtaining concrete convergence rates for quasi-cylic algorithms in non-H\"olderian settings. This includes certain rates that are neither sublinear nor linear but sit somewhere in-between, including a case where the rate is expressed via the Lambert W function. Finally, we connect our discussion to o-minimal geometry and show that, under mild assumptions, definable operators in any o-minimal structure are always Karamata regular.</description>

Abstract: We investigate what we term "generalized sup-convolutions". We show that functional inequalities that enjoy an interpretation as sup-convolution inequalities can be deduced from the special case of indicator functions corresponding to a geometric inequality. As consequences we derive a Borell-Brascamp Lieb inequality for the Gaussian Brunn-Minkowski inequality and give a functional analog of the log-Brunn Minkowski conjecture. Though we focus on Euclidean applications, our results are general and can be directly applied in more abstract settings, like groups or even topological measure spaces without algebraic structure, we instantiate this claim with a Borell-Brascamp-Lieb type inequality for nilpotent Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Computing the number of realisations of a rigid graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02988</link>

Abstract: A graph is said to be rigid if, given a generic realisation of the graph as a bar-and-joint framework in the plane, there exist only finitely many other realisations of the graph with the same edge lengths modulo rotations, reflections and translations. In recent years there has been an increase of interest in determining exactly what this finite amount is, hereon known as the realisation number. Combinatorial algorithms for the realisation number were previously known for the special cases of minimally rigid and redundantly rigid graphs. In this paper we provide a combinatorial algorithm to compute the realisation number of any rigid graph, and thus solve an open problem of Jackson and Owen. We then adapt our algorithm to compute: (i) spherical realisation numbers, and (ii) the number of rank-3 PSD matrix completions of a generic partial matrix.</description>
