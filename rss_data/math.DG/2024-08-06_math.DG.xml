      <title>Remarks on $\mathrm{Sp}(1)$-Seiberg-Witten equation over $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the $\mathrm{Sp}(1)$-Seiberg-Witten equation over a closed hyperbolic $3$-manifold ${\mathbb H}^3/\Gamma$ always admits a canonical irreducible solution induced by the hyperbolic metric. We also prove that the Zariski tangent space of the moduli space at this canonical solution is same as the Zariski tangent space of the moduli space of locally conformally flat structures at the hyperbolic metric. This space is again same as the space of trace-free Codazzi tensors and carries an injection to $H^1(\Gamma,\mathbb R^{3,1})$, the first group cohomology of the $\Gamma$-module $\mathbb R^{1,3}$. In particular, if $H^1(\Gamma,\mathbb R^{3,1})=0$ then the canonical irreducible solution is infinitesimally rigid. We also prove that the $\mathrm{Sp}(1)$-Seiberg-Witten equation over $S^1\times \Sigma$ has no irreducible solutions and the moduli space of reducible solutions is same as the moduli space of flat $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-connections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The methods of Information geometry have been glowing up to develop various subjects of theoretical physics, including quantum information systems. The present article has two purposes. The first one is to develop general theory of homogeneous statistical manifolds. In particular we construct explicit examples of homogeneous statistical manifolds of low dimension. The second purpose is to classify $3$-dimensional Lie groups admitting non-trivial conjugate symmetric left invariant statistical structure.</description>

      <title>Volume renormalization of higher-codimension singular Yamabe spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an embedded closed submanifold $\Sigma^n$ in the closed Riemannian manifold $M^{n + k}$, where $k &lt; n + 2$, we define extrinsic global conformal invariants of $\Sigma$ by renormalizing the volume associated to the unique singular Yamabe metric with singular set $\Sigma$. In case $n$ is odd, the renormalized volume is an absolute conformal invariant, while if $n$ is even, there is a conformally invariant energy term given by the integral of a local Riemannian invariant. In particular, the volume gives a global conformal invariant of a knot embedding in the three-sphere. We extend the construction of energies for even $n$ to general codimension by considering formal solutions to the singular Yamabe problem; except that, for each fixed $n$, there are finitely many $k &gt; n + 2$, which we identify, for which the smoothness of the formal solution is obstructed and we obtain instead a pointwise conformal invariant. We compute the new quantities in several cases.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Structure of Higher Algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of a \emph{higher-order algebroid}, as introduced in \cite{MJ_MR_HA_comorph_2018}, generalizes the concepts of a higher-order tangent bundle $\tau^k_M: \mathrm{T}^k M \rightarrow M$ and a (Lie) algebroid. This idea is based on a (vector bundle) comorphism approach to (Lie) algebroids and the reduction procedure of homotopies from the level of Lie groupoids to that of Lie algebroids. In brief, an alternative description of a Lie algebroid $(A, [\cdot, \cdot], \sharp)$ is a vector bundle comorphism $\kappa$ defined as the dual of the Poisson map $\varepsilon: \mathrm{T}^\ast A \rightarrow \mathrm{T} A^\ast$ associated with the Lie algebroid $A$. The framework of comorphisms has proven to be a suitable language for describing higher-order analogues of Lie algebroids from the perspective of the role played by (Lie) algebroids in geometric mechanics. In this work, we uncover the classical algebraic structures underlying the mysterious description of higher-order algebroids through comorphisms. For the case where $k=2$, we establish one-to-one correspondence between higher-order Lie algebroids and pairs consisting of a two-term representation (up to homotopy) of a Lie algebroid and a morphism to the adjoint representation of this algebroid.</description>

      <title>Plane wave limits of Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the covariant formulation of Penrose's plane wave limit by Blau et al., we construct for any Riemannian metric $g$ a family of "plane wave limits" of one higher dimension. These limits are taken along geodesics of $g$, yield simpler metrics of Lorentzian signature, and are isometric invariants. They can also be seen to arise locally from a suitable expansion of $g$ in Fermi coordinates, and they directly encode much of $g$'s geometry. For example, normal Jacobi fields of $g$ are encoded as geodesics of its plane wave limits. Furthermore, $g$ will have constant sectional curvature if and only if each of its plane wave limits is locally conformally flat. In fact $g$ will be flat, or Ricci-flat, or geodesically complete, if and only if all of its plane wave limits are, respectively, the same. Many other curvature properties are preserved in the limit, including certain inequalities, such as signed Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>The Steklov spectrum of convex polygonal domains I: spectral finiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the Steklov eigenvalue problem on convex polygons, focusing mainly on the inverse Steklov problem. Our primary finding reveals that, for almost all convex polygonal domains, there exist at most finitely many non-congruent domains with the same Steklov spectrum. Moreover, we obtain explicit upper bounds for the maximum number of mutually Steklov isospectral non-congruent polygonal domains. Along the way, we obtain isoperimetric bounds for the Steklov eigenvalues of a convex polygon in terms of the minimal interior angle of the polygon.</description>

      <title>Integrable hierarchies and F-manifolds with compatible connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that F-manifolds with compatible connection $(\nabla,\circ,e)$ are the geometric counterpart of integrable systems of quasilinear first order evolutionary PDEs. We consider F-manifolds equipped with an Euler vector field and assume that the operator $L=E\circ$ is regular. This generalises previous results in the semisimple context. As an example we study regular F-manifolds with compatible connection $(\nabla,\circ,e,E)$ associated with integrable hierarchies obtained from the solutions of the equation $d\cdot d_L \,a_0=0$ by applying the construction of [27]. We show that $n$-dimensional F-manifolds associated to operators $L$ with $r\le n$ Jordan blocks $L_\alpha$ of size $m_\alpha$ are classified by $n$ arbitrary functions of a single variable, where each block $L_\alpha$ contributes with $m_\alpha$ functions of the variable appearing in the diagonal of the block. In the case of a single Jordan block of arbitrary size we show that flat connections $\nabla$ correspond to linear solutions $a_0$. This generalises part of the construction of [31] where special linear solutions were considered. We illustrate the construction in dimensions $2,3,$ and $4$ for any choice of Jordan canonical form and any choice of the corresponding solution $a_0$. In these dimensions we have that linear solutions define bi-flat F-manifolds, and that the special linear solutions studied in [31] are related to Riemannian F-manifolds with Killing unit vector field. We conjecture that this is true in general.</description>

      <title>Differential Cohomology as Diffeological Homotopy Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin homotopies, introduced by Caetano-Picken, serve to axiomatize the holonomy of connections on principal bundles. This approach has been generalized to higher non-abelian bundles with connection through transport functors and higher holonomies, at least in dimension two and partially in dimension three. In this thesis, we introduce a new variant of thin homotopy based on the definition of skeletal diffeologies introduced recently by Kihara and show that, in the abelian setting, ordinary differential cohomology can be completely recovered in terms of the homotopy theory of skeletal diffeological spaces. Specifically, to any smooth manifold and non-negative integer $k$, we associate a $k$-skeletal simplicial presheaf such that its $k$th cohomology with values in the circle group is isomorphic to the abelian group of Cheeger-Simons differential characters. Further, we relate these higher holonomies to the only other existing model in the literature, developed by Gajer based on the geometric loop group. The main motivation for us is to provide a model where the differential refinement is established by refining the underlying space, rather than the coefficient object. This has the advantage of possible generalizations to non-abelian differential cohomology.</description>

      <title>On Hermitian manifolds with vanishing curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.03666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Hermitian metrics with vanishing holomorphic curvature on compact complex manifolds with pseudoeffective canonical bundle are conformally balanced. Pluriclosed metrics with vanishing holomorphic curvature on compact K\"ahler manifolds are shown to be K\"ahler and hence, are completely classified. We prove that Hermitian metrics with vanishing real bisectional curvature on complex manifolds in the Fujiki class C are K\"ahler and thus fall under the same classification. Finally, we formalize the notion of `altered' curvatures, which force distinguished metric structures when mandated to coincide with their `standard' counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07501v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to initiate the study of estimates of the non-classical structure in the generalized Schottky group theory. In fact, in this paper, we have investigated the non-classical Schottky structure on a type of generalized Schottky group (for instance Fuchsian Schottky groups) in the hyperbolic plane with boundary. A Schottky group is said to be non-classical if the curves used in the Schottky construction are Jordan curves. More precisely, in this manuscript, we have provided a structure of the rank $2$ non-classical Fuchsian Schottky groups by utilizing two suitable hyperbolic M\"obius transformations on the upper-half plane model. In particular, we have derived two non-trivial examples of non-classical Fuchsian Schottky groups in the upper-half plane with the circle at infinity as the boundary.</description>

Abstract: We show the existence of some special coordinate systems for expressing maps with branch points. These coordinates allow obtaining an explicit representation formula of branch immersions and understanding the regularity of some fundamental elements in the theory of R. D. Gulliver, R. Osserman and H. L. Royden. For conformal maps, we prove that these coordinates exist with certain regularity if and only if the mean curvature vector extends and is in a particular H\"older space. In the general case, we characterize this type of coordinate system. Also, using these coordinates, we study the regularity and behavior of curvatures near branch points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [CFS], the author and collaborators construct infinitely many nonlocal $s$-minimal hypersurfaces (via min-max methods) on any closed $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$, obtaining an analogue of Yau's conjecture for $s\in(0,1)$. The present article proves a Weyl Law for the fractional perimeters of these hypersurfaces, and it shows their convergence as $s\to 1$ (for $n=3$) to smooth classical minimal surfaces. Our results are used in particular to give a novel proof of the density and equidistribution of classical minimal surfaces for generic metrics in three dimensions, showcasing nonlocal minimal surfaces also as a new approximation theory for the area functional.</description>

      <title>Higher order obstructions to Riccati-type equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop new techniques in order to deal with Riccati-type equations, subject to a further algebraic constraint, on Riemannian manifolds $(M^3,g)$. We find that the obstruction to solve the aforementioned equation has order $4$ in the metric coefficients and is fully described by an homogeneous polynomial in $\mathrm{Sym}^{16}TM$. Techniques from real algebraic geometry, reminiscent of those used for the "PositiveStellen-Satz " problem, allow determining the geometry in terms of explicit exterior differential systems. Analysis of the latter shows flatness for the metric $g$; in particular we complete the classification of asymptotically harmonic manifolds of dimension $3$, establishing those are either flat or real hyperbolic spaces.</description>

      <title>Pressure gaps, geometric potentials, and nonpositively curved manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a general pressure gap criterion for closed rank 1 manifolds whose singular sets are given by codimension 1 totally geodesic flat subtori. As an application, we show that under certain curvature constraints, potentials that decay faster than geometric potentials (towards to the singular set) have pressure gaps and have no phase transitions. Along the way, we prove that geometric potentials are H\"older continuous near singular sets.</description>

      <title>Optimality Conditions for Interval-Valued Optimization Problems on Riemannian Manifolds Under a Total Order Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores fundamental properties of convex interval-valued functions defined on Riemannian manifolds. The study employs generalized Hukuhara directional differentiability to derive KKT-type optimality conditions for an interval-valued optimization problem on Riemannian manifolds. Based on type of functions involved in optimization problems, we consider the following cases:
  1. objective function as well as constraints are real-valued;
  2. objective function is interval-valued, and constraints are real-valued;
  3. objective function as well as constraints are interval-valued.
  The whole theory is justified with the help of examples. The order relation that we use throughout the paper is a total order relation defined on the collection of all closed and bounded intervals in $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Fun with Flags: Robust Principal Directions via Flag Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04071v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA), along with its extensions to manifolds and outlier contaminated data, have been indispensable in computer vision and machine learning. In this work, we present a unifying formalism for PCA and its variants, and introduce a framework based on the flags of linear subspaces, ie a hierarchy of nested linear subspaces of increasing dimension, which not only allows for a common implementation but also yields novel variants, not explored previously. We begin by generalizing traditional PCA methods that either maximize variance or minimize reconstruction error. We expand these interpretations to develop a wide array of new dimensionality reduction algorithms by accounting for outliers and the data manifold. To devise a common computational approach, we recast robust and dual forms of PCA as optimization problems on flag manifolds. We then integrate tangent space approximations of principal geodesic analysis (tangent-PCA) into this flag-based framework, creating novel robust and dual geodesic PCA variations. The remarkable flexibility offered by the 'flagification' introduced here enables even more algorithmic variants identified by specific flag types. Last but not least, we propose an effective convergent solver for these flag-formulations employing the Stiefel manifold. Our empirical results on both real-world and synthetic scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of our novel algorithms, especially in terms of robustness to outliers on manifolds.</description>

      <title>On the improved convergence of lifted distributional Gauss curvature from Regge elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Regge finite element functions are not continuous, useful generalizations of nonlinear derivatives like the curvature, can be defined using them. This paper is devoted to studying the convergence of the finite element lifting of a generalized (distributional) Gauss curvature defined using a metric tensor approximation in the Regge finite element space. Specifically, we investigate the interplay between the polynomial degree of the curvature lifting by Lagrange elements and the degree of the metric tensor in the Regge finite element space. Previously, a superconvergence result, where convergence rate of one order higher than expected, was obtained when the approximate metric is the canonical Regge interpolant of the exact metric. In this work, we show that an even higher order can be obtained if the degree of the curvature lifting is reduced by one polynomial degree and if at least linear Regge elements are used. These improved convergence rates are confirmed by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Patterson-Sullivan theory for coarse cocycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a theory of Patterson--Sullivan measures associated to coarse cocycles of convergence groups. This framework includes Patterson-Sullivan measures associated to the Busemann cocycle on the geodesic boundary of a Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces and Patterson-Sullivan measures on flag manifolds associated to Anosov (or more general transverse) subgroups of semisimple Lie groups, as well as more examples. Under some natural geometric assumptions on the coarse cocycle, we prove existence, uniqueness, and ergodicity results.</description>

      <title>Concurrent normals problem for convex polytopes and Euclidean distance degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is conjectured since long that for any convex body $P\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ there exists a point in its interior which belongs to at least $2n$ normals from different points on the boundary of $P$. The conjecture is known to be true for $n=2,3,4$.
  We treat the same problem for convex polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It turns out that the PL concurrent normals problem differs a lot from the smooth one. One almost immediately proves that a convex polytope in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has $8$ normals to its boundary emanating from some point in its interior. Moreover, we conjecture that each simple polytope in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has a point in its interior with $10$ normals to the boundary. We confirm the conjecture for all tetrahedra and triangular prisms and give a sufficient condition for a simple polytope to have a point with $10$ normals.
  Other related topics (average number of normals, minimal number of normals from an interior point, other dimensions) are discussed.</description>
