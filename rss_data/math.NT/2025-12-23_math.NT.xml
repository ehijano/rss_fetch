      <title>Classical Ap\'ery-Like Series and Their Cyclotomic Parametric Analogues via Contour Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method based on contour integration to investigate a class of cyclotomic parametric Ap\'ery-like series. The general term of such series involves a parametric central binomial coefficient, which is defined via the Gamma function. Using this approach, we express a family of cyclotomic Ap\'ery-like series in terms of multiple polylogarithms, cyclotomic Hurwitz zeta values, Riemann zeta values and $\log(2)$. In particular, we provide several illustrative examples and corollaries, which enable us to recover a number of known results on Ap\'ery-like series. At the same time, we have also left open two questions regarding Ap\'ery-like series. Moreover, by considering integrals of the generating function for Fuss-Catalan numbers, we derive an alternative expression for a classical Ap\'ery-like series. Combining this with known results allows us to establish several identities for multiple polylogarithm functions.</description>

      <title>How often are $ \lfloor {n^{\alpha}} \rfloor $ and $ \lfloor {n^{\beta}} \rfloor $ simultaneously primes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ \lfloor {x} \rfloor $ denote the greatest integer less than or equal to a real number $x$. Given real numbers $0&lt;\alpha_1 &lt; \alpha_2 &lt; \cdots&lt; \alpha_k &lt; 1$ satisfying a certain condition, we show that there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ for which all of $ \lfloor{n^{\alpha_1}}\rfloor, \lfloor{n^{\alpha_2}}\rfloor,\ldots, \lfloor{n^{\alpha_k}}\rfloor $ are prime numbers. Our approach relies on establishing a simultaneous equidistribution theorem for $ \lfloor{n^{\alpha_i}}\rfloor $ across $k$-many arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>A Flanking Pattern in a Sum-of-Divisors Congruence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider composite $n$ satisfying the congruence $$n \cdot \sigma_k(n) \equiv 2 \pmod{\phi(n)},$$ and show a "flanking" structure: $14$ appears in both $S_{k-1}$ and $S_{k+1}$ whenever certain values of $n$ appear in $S_k$; and, moreover, $14$ is the only (nontrivial) case of this property. Along the way, we derive a new characterization of the $n$ that appear in the sets $S_{k}$.</description>

      <title>Explicit Lower Bounds for Dirichlet Series of Higher Power Representation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Dirichlet-type series generated by representation functions that count the number of ways an integer can be expressed as a sum of 'k' signed higher even powers. By combining generalized theta generating functions with a family of generalized cotangent series introduced in previous work, we derive two distinct explicit lower bounds for these series. The first estimate arises from a geometric restriction of the lattice to its diagonal, while the second utilizes Holder's inequality on the integral representation of the series. The methods presented here avoid modular techniques and offer a flexible analytic framework for higher-power representation problems.</description>

      <title>Trigonometric Determinants via special values of Dirichlet $L$-Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the determinants involving some trigonometric functions. We establish a connection between these determinants and the special values of Dirichlet L-functions, thereby extending Guo's results to arbitrary positive integers n. In addition, we also prove a conjecture raised by Zhi-Wei Sun. Our main tool is the spectral decomposition of some linear operators. By the same method we obtain an explicit formula for the determinants of sine matrices. This formula is expressed as a product of Gauss sums attached to Dirichlet characters.</description>

      <title>The basis functions of Fourier interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basis functions of the Fourier interpolation formula of Radchenko and Viazovska, constructed by means of weakly holomorphic modular forms for the Hecke theta group, are entire functions of order $2$ having interesting time-frequency properties. We give precise size estimates and study the distribution of zeros of these functions. We give in particular asymptotic estimates for the location and the number of extraneous zeros on or close to the real line. This result reveals the surprising existence of Fourier nonuniqueness pairs whose apparent ``excess'' compared to the Fourier uniqueness pair of Radchenko and Viazovska may be made arbitrarily large. Our estimates also show that the basis functions fail to yield a Riesz basis in the Hilbert space used by Kulikov, Nazarov, and Sodin in their recent study of Fourier uniqueness pairs. Some numerical data are presented, suggesting additional fine scale properties.</description>

      <title>The Minkowski dimension of the image of an arboreal Galois representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f:\mathbb{P}^1\to\mathbb{P}^1$ be a rational map of degree $d\geq2$ defined over a number field $K$ and let $\alpha\in\mathbb{P}^1(K)$. We consider the lower and upper Minkowski dimensions of the arboreal Galois group $G_{f,\alpha}$ associated to the pair $(f,\alpha)$, which is naturally a subgroup of the automorphism group of the infinite $d$-ary rooted tree whose vertices are indexed by the backward orbit $f^{-\infty}(\alpha)$. We state conjectures on the existence of Minkowski dimension, as well as proposed characterizations of cases in which it takes its minimal and maximal values. We establish basic cases in which the upper Minkowski dimension of $G_{f,\alpha}$ is not maximal, and we establish basic cases in which it is minimal. We show that abelian automorphism groups always have vanishing Minkowski dimension, and as a consequence, that one of our conjectures implies a conjecture of Andrews-Petsche on pairs $(f,\alpha)$ with abelian arboreal Galois group.</description>

      <title>Fake Mobius-type Functions on the Unit Circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study \emph{fake Mobius-type functions on the unit circle}: multiplicative functions $\mathfrak f$ determined by prime-power data $\mathfrak f(p^k)=\varepsilon_k\in\mathbb S^1\cup\{0\}$, independent of $p$. Their Dirichlet series admits the Euler product \[ F_{\mathfrak f}(s)=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\mathfrak f(n)}{n^s} =\prod_p g(p^{-s}),\qquad g(u)=\sum_{k\ge0}\varepsilon_k u^k, \] and a canonical zeta-factorization \[ F_{\mathfrak f}(s)=\zeta(s)^{\,z}\,\zeta(2s)^{\,w}\,G_{\mathfrak f}(s), \qquad z=\varepsilon_1,\ \ w=\varepsilon_2-\frac{\varepsilon_1(\varepsilon_1+1)}{2}, \] where $G_{\mathfrak f}(s)$ is a holomorphic Euler product on $\Re s&gt;1/3$.
  Assuming the Riemann hypothesis and simplicity of zeros, we derive a general explicit and asymptotic formula for the summatory functions $A_{\mathfrak f}^{\exp}(x)$ of the form \[ A_{\mathfrak f}^{\exp}(x) -\Delta_1(x;z,w) = \Delta_{1/2}(x;z,w)\;+\;\sum_{\rho}\Delta_\rho(x;z,w,\mathfrak f)\;+\;\mathcal E(x), \] where $\Delta_1(x;z,w)$ is the main term coming from the $s=1$ singularity of $\zeta(s)^z$, $\Delta_{1/2}(x;z,w)$ is the secondary term coming from the $s=1/2$ singularity of $\zeta(2s)^w$, the terms $\Delta_\rho(x;z,w,\mathfrak f)$ arise from the singularities of $\zeta(s)^z$ at nontrivial zeros $\rho$ of $\zeta(s)$, and $\mathcal E(x)$ is an error term. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of \emph{bias} at the natural scale $x^{1/2}(\Log x)^{w-1}$ and obtain an explicit criteria distinguishing persistent, apparent, and unbiased behavior in this regime.
  The present paper treats the major parameter region \[ -1\le\Re(z)\le1,\qquad -2\le\Re(w)&lt;1, \] and we choose to defer the complementary ranges of $(z,w)$ to a future paper as a different analytic approach is required there.</description>

      <title>On Factoring and Power Divisor Problems via Rank-3 Lattices and the Second Vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic algorithm based on Coppersmith's method that employs a rank-3 lattice to address factoring-related problems. An interesting aspect of our approach is that we utilize the second vector in the LLL-reduced basis to avoid trivial collisions in the Baby-step Giant-step method, rather than the shortest vector as is commonly used in the literature. Our results are as follows:
  1. Compared to the result by Harvey and Hittmeir (Math. Comp. 91 (2022), 1367 - 1379), who achieved a complexity of O( N^(1/5) log^(16/5) N / (log log N)^(3/5)) for factoring a semiprime N = pq, we demonstrate that in the balanced p and q case, the complexity can be improved to O( N^(1/5) log^(13/5) N / (log log N)^(3/5) ).
  2. For factoring sums and differences of powers, that is, numbers of the form N = a^n plus or minus b^n, we improve Hittmeir's result (Math. Comp. 86 (2017), 2947 - 2954) from O( N^(1/4) log^(3/2) N ) to O( N^(1/5) log^(13/5) N ).
  3. For the problem of finding r-power divisors, that is, finding all integers p such that p^r divides N, Harvey and Hittmeir (Proceedings of ANTS XV, Research in Number Theory 8 (2022), no. 4, Paper No. 94) recently directly applied Coppersmith's method and achieved a complexity of O( N^(1/(4r)) log^(10+epsilon) N / r^3 ). By using faster LLL-type algorithms and sieving on small primes, we improve their result to O( N^(1/(4r)) log^(7+3 epsilon) N / ((log log N minus log(4r)) r^(2+epsilon)) ). The worst-case running time for their algorithm occurs when N = p^r q with q on the order of N^(1/2). By focusing on this case and employing our rank-3 lattice approach, we achieve a complexity of O( r^(1/4) N^(1/(4r)) log^(5/2) N ).
  In conclusion, we offer a new perspective on these problems, which we hope will provide further insights.</description>

      <title>On the radii of Voronoi cells of rings of integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the time of Minkowski a basic problem in number theory has been to find lower bounds for the absolute value $\Delta(K)$ of the discriminant of a number field $K$ in terms of the degree $n(K)$ of $K$. In this paper we study another measure of the size of $K$ given by the covering radius $\mu(K)$ of the ring of integers $O_K$ of $K$. Here $\mu(K)$ is the $L^2$ radius $||V_2(K)||_2$ of the $L^2$ Voronoi cell $V_2(K)$ of $O_K$, where $V_2(K)$ is the set of points in $\mathbb{R} \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}} K$ that are at least as close to the origin as they are to any non-zero element of $O_K$. To put a limit on what lower bounds one can prove for $\mu(K)$ in terms of $n(K)$, we study infinite families of $K$ of increasing degree for which $\mu(K)$ can be bounded above by an explicit power of $n(K)$. We also study analogous questions when the $L^2$ norm is replaced by the $L^\infty$ norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Erd\H{o}s' ternary conjecture and by recent work of Cui--Ma--Jiang [``Geometric progressions meet Cantor sets'', \textit{Chaos Solitons Fractals} \textbf{163} (2022), 112567.] on intersections between geometric progressions and Cantor-like sets in standard bases, we study the corresponding problem in the Zeckendorf numeration system. We prove that, for any fixed finite set of forbidden binary patterns, any integers $u\ge 1$, $q\ge 2$, and any window size $M$, the set of exponents $n$ for which the Zeckendorf expansion of $u q^n$ avoids the forbidden patterns within its $M$ least significant digits is either finite or ultimately periodic.</description>

      <title>The monodromy of cyclic Pryms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The {\em Prym} of a cyclic covering of smooth projective curves is the ``new'' part of the Jacobian: the quotient of the Jacobian of the covering curve by the Jacobians of the intermediate covers. Given a family of such coverings, the fundamental group of the base of the family acts on the Tate modules of the Pryms, and the image of this representation is a key ingredient in answering arithmetic statistics questions about the distribution of the group structure of the $L$-torsion of a random Prym in the family. (Over ${\mathbb{F}}_q$, the action of Frobenius is roughly uniformly distributed over the {\em arithmetic} monodromy, a coset of the image of the fundamental group of the base change to $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_q$ (the {\em geometric} monodromy).) In the present note, we show for a number of natural families that (with limited exceptions) the geometric monodromy is sandwiched between a certain unitary group and its derived subgroup. In particular, this holds for the one-parameter families obtained by starting with any fixed cover and varying one (tame) ramification point. As an application, we deduce analogous largeness results for the monodromy of the Selmer groups of elliptic surfaces with $j=0$ or $j=1728$, by relating them to cyclic covers of degree 6 or 4 respectively, implying that their Selmer groups do not satisfy the standard heuristics. For instance, for eliptic surfaces with $j=0$ of sufficiently large height over ${\mathbb{P}}^1_{{\mathbb{F}}_q}$, the average size of the $l$-Selmer group is $l+3+o_q(1)$ when $l$ (fixed) and $q$ (large) are both 1 mod 3, compared to $l+1+o_q(1)$ for general elliptic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Alternating Power Difference and Matrix Symmetry: Closed-Form Formulas for the First Appearance Degree $m_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on an integer-valued function $f_A(\sigma) := \operatorname{tr}(A P_\sigma)$ defined uniformly from a specific square matrix $A$ of order $n$ and a permutation $\sigma$ on the symmetric group $S_n$. The main objective of this study is to investigate in detail the algebraic behavior of the Alternating Power Difference (APD), denoted as $APD_m(f_A)$, and its first appearance degree $m_1(f_A)$ for this function $f_A$ across various matrix classes. Specifically, we address special matrices such as shifted $r$-th power lattices, Vandermonde matrices, and circulant matrices, analyzing the phenomenon where the value of $APD_m(A)$ remains zero as $m$ increases until a specific degree (the first appearance phenomenon). In particular, we explore closed-form formulas for the first appearance degree $m_1(A)$ and the first appearance value $APD_{m_1}(A)$, presenting Conjectures that hold across multiple matrix classes. These results suggest a deep relationship between the structure of matrices and the analytical properties of functions on the symmetric group, providing new perspectives in matrix theory and combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a higher dimensional generalization of affine buildings and introduce a new structure, which we call Babel buildings. These buildings are non-connected, non-convex metric spaces of non-positive curvature. Despite their non-standard properties, Babel buildings provide an effective framework for studying the structure of groups acting on them. We analyze the metric and nesting structures of Babel buildings and derive key results regarding the group actions consistent with this new framework.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of varieties over the maximal Kummer extension of a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective geometrically connected variety defined over a number field $K$. We prove that the geometric \'etale cohomology of $X$ with $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$-coefficients has finitely many classes invariant under the Galois group of the maximal Kummer extension of $K$ in odd degrees. In particular, every abelian variety has finite torsion over the maximal Kummer extension. This improves results by R\"ossler and the second author as well as Murotani and Ozeki. We also show that finiteness of torsion of a given abelian variety over non-abelian solvable extensions of $K$ is not controlled by the Galois group of the extension.</description>

      <title>The Kontsevich invariant and the action of the Grothendieck--Teichm\"{u}ller group on $2$-component string links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kontsevich invariant of links is independent of the choice of associator, whereas for tangles this is not the case in general. In this paper, we focus on $2$-component string links and investigate to what extent the Kontsevich invariant depends on the choice of associator. As an application, we show that the action of the unipotent part of the Grothendieck--Teichm\"{u}ller group on the algebra of proalgebraic $2$-component string links is non-trivial, which provides a partial answer to a problem posed by Furusho.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we make explicit the correspondence between Harish-Chandra parameters and Langlands-Vogan parameters for symplectic groups and orthogonal groups of equal rank over reals. As an application, we reformulate Moeglin's results and Paul's work on the Howe correspondence for symplectic-orthogonal dual pairs using Langlands-Vogan parameters.</description>

      <title>De Rham affineness of the Nygaard filtered prismatization in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a perfect ring of characteristic $p&gt;0$, and let $R$ be an animated $k$-algebra. This note aims to show that the Nygaard filtered prismatization $R^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$ of $R$ is naturally isomorphic, as a stack over $k^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$, to the relative spectrum over $k^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$ of the Rees algebra of the Nygaard filtered prismatic cohomology of $R$ relative to $k$. In doing so, we axiomatise the functorial affineness property displayed by the relative Nygaard filtered prismatization, and dub it de Rham affineness after the fundamental example of the functor sending an animated ring to its relative de Rham stack. While we treat this concept as an organising tool for the author's forthcoming work on the syntomification of Frobenius liftable schemes, we are able to frame some questions based on a structural theorem of independent interest: a functor to stacks which is de Rham affine often arises via ring stacks through transmutation.</description>

      <title>Ulrich complexity and Picard rank of bidouble Planes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the Picard number and the Ulrich complexity of general bidouble covers of the projective plane, providing the first systematic study of Ulrich bundles on non-cyclic abelian covers. For a bidouble plane branched along three smooth curves of degrees $n_1,n_2,n_3$, we show that $\rho(S)=1$ unless $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ belongs to an explicit list, thereby extending Buium's classical results on double planes to the non-cyclic case. As an application, we determine the range of branch degrees for which Ulrich line bundles could exist, and we show that every even bidouble plane carries a special rank-two Ulrich bundle. Our method combines the invariant-theoretic decomposition of $H^2(S,\mathbb{Q})$ under the Galois group with cohomological criteria for Ulrich bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.05240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a conditional proof of the Uniform Boundedness Conjecture of Morton and Silverman in the case of polynomials over number fields, assuming a standard conjecture in arithmetic geometry. Our technique simultaneously yields a dynamical analogue of Lang's conjecture on minimal canonical heights for these maps. We obtain similar results for non-isotrivial polynomials over a function field of characteristic zero. When the latter are unicritical of degree at least 5, the results hold unconditionally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distribution of primes raising the level of even Galois representations of tetrahedral type is studied. Data are presented on primes $v\leq 10^8$ raising the level of $3$-adic even representations of various conductors. Based on the data, a conjecture is formulated concerning the distribution of certain lines in the plane. By an application of Wiles' formula, the conjecture is shown to imply that the density of primes raising the level of a $p$-adic even representation is $$\frac{p-1}{p},$$ in agreement with the density of $2/3$ for $p=3$ observed in the data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\lambda$ be a self-dual Hecke character over an imaginary quadratic field $K$ of infinity type $(1,0)$. Let $\ell$ and $p$ be primes which are coprime to $6N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}({\mathrm cond}(\lambda))$. We determine the $\ell$-adic valuation of Hecke $L$-values $L(1,\lambda\chi)/\Omega_K$ as $\chi$ varies over $p$-power order anticyclotomic characters over $K$. As an application, for $p$ inert in $K$, we prove the vanishing of the $\mu$-invariant of Rubin's $p$-adic $L$-function, leading to the first results on the $\mu$-invariant of imaginary quadratic fields at non-split primes.
  Our approach and results complement the work of Hida and Finis. The approach is rooted in the arithmetic of a CM form on a definite Shimura set.The application to Rubin's $p$-adic $L$-function also relies on the proof of his conjecture. Along the way, we present an automorphic view on Rubin's theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the counting function of rational approximations with given bounds on the denominator and satisfying the critical Dirichlet exponent on the sphere $S^d$, $d\geq 3$. We give an effective estimate for this counting function, with an error term of square root order, analogous to the optimal estimate in the Euclidean setting. We also show that the counting function has vanishing third and higher correlations and derive a Central Limit Theorem describing its fluctuations. We prove these results using arguments from homogeneous dynamics on the space of orthogonal lattices, in particular effective multiple equidistribution of all orders, which we establish for spherical averages and which could be useful for other applications.</description>

Abstract: We revisit certain one-parameter families of affine covers arising naturally from Euler's integral representation of hypergeometric functions. We introduce a partial compactification of this family. We show that the zeta function of the fibers in the family can be written as an explicit product of $L$-series attached to nondegenerate hypergeometric motives and zeta functions of tori, twisted by Hecke Grossencharacters. This permits a combinatorial algorithm for computing the Hodge numbers of the family.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. We prove bounds on short Dirichlet character sums evaluated at a class of homogeneous polynomials in arbitrary dimensions. In every dimension, this bound is nontrivial for sums over boxes with side lengths as short as $p^{1/4 + \kappa}$ for any $\kappa&gt;0$. Our methods capitalize on the relationship between characters mod $p$ and characters over finite field extensions as well as bounds on the multiplicative energy of sets in products of finite fields.</description>

Abstract: Let $E_1, \ldots, E_s $ be $s$, not necessary distinct, elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. We give upper bounds on the frequency of $s$-tuples of points in $E_1(\mathbb{Q})\times \ldots \times E_s(\mathbb{Q})$ whose denominators or $x$-coordinates are multiplicatively dependent. More precisely, we give such bounds in two scenarios: one in which we fix $s$ non-torsion $\mathbb{Q}$-rational points $P_i \in E_i(\mathbb{Q})$ and arbitrary $\mathbb{Q}$-rational points $Q_i \in E_i(\mathbb{Q})$, $i =1, \ldots, s$, and we count $s$-tuples \[ (n_1P_1+Q_1,\ldots, n_sP_s+Q_s) \in E_1(\mathbb{Q}) \times \ldots \times E_s(\mathbb{Q}) \] with $n_1, \ldots, n_s$ in an arbitrary interval of length $N$, and the second in which we count points $(P_1,\ldots,P_s) \in E_1(\mathbb{Q}) \times \ldots \times E_s(\mathbb{Q})$ of bounded canonical height.</description>

      <title>On Some Generalisations of Gauss Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce integer sequences satisfying new congruence properties inspired by the Euler and Gauss congruences, which we call Euler-Gauss sequences. Noting that every Gauss sequence is an Euler-Gauss sequence, we compare them with certain generalisations of Gauss sequences and provide several counterexamples. In particular, the Smallest Prime Factor (SPF) and Greatest Prime Factor (GPF) sequences (suitably defined at 1) studied extensively by Erdos and Alladi arise as natural examples of Euler-Gauss sequences that are not Gauss sequences. We further extend these congruence-based integer sequences to a q-analog setting and establish characteristic properties that reveal their structure and fill gaps in the literature on q-Gauss sequences. In recent works, q-Gauss sequences have been shown to admit interesting combinatorial interpretations and to exhibit the Cyclic Sieving Phenomenon (CSP). Not only do our q-Euler-Gauss sequences satisfy the standard CSP with some restriction, but we also derive a new CSP condition for the SPF and GPF sequences, not hitherto known in the literature.</description>

      <title>Unit-generated orders of real quadratic fields I. Class number bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unit-generated orders of a quadratic field are orders of the form $\mathcal{O} = \mathbb{Z}[\varepsilon]$, where $\varepsilon$ is a unit in the quadratic field. If the order $\mathcal{O}$ is a maximal order of a real quadratic field, then the quadratic number field is necessarily of a restricted form, being of narrow Richaud--Degert type. However, every real quadratic field contains infinitely many distinct unit-generated orders. They are parametrized as $\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{O}_{n}^{\pm}$ having quadratic discriminants $\Delta(\mathcal{O}) = \Delta_{n}^{+} = n^2 - 4$ (for $n \geq 3$) and $\Delta(\mathcal{O}) = \Delta_{n}^{-} = n^2 + 4$ (for $n \geq 1$). We show the (wide or narrow) class numbers of unit-generated orders satisfy $\log \left|{\rm Cl}(\mathcal{O})\right| \sim \log \frac{1}{2}\left|\Delta(\mathcal{O})\right|$ as $\left|\Delta(\mathcal{O})\right| \to \infty$, using a result of L.-K. Hua. We deduce that there are finitely many unit-generated quadratic orders of class number one and finitely many unit-generated quadratic orders whose class group is $2$-torsion. We classify all unit-generated real quadratic maximal orders having class number one. We provide numerical lists of quadratic unit-generated orders whose class groups are $2$-torsion for $\Delta \leq 10^{10}$, for both wide and narrow class groups, which are conjecturally complete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present methods to compute Selmer groups associated to mod p Galois representations rho over a number field K, with a particular focus on comparing their ranks with periods coming from cohomology classes associated to rho by Serre's conjecture. This provides evidence for a loose version of a "mod p Bloch-Kato conjecture", where the vanishing of a period is predicted to capture the presence of rank in a Selmer group. Our methods are explicit, and implemented in Magma.</description>

Let $\mathcal{W}$ be an additive complement of $\mathcal{S}$ and $$ f(n)=\#\big\{(w,m^2)\in \mathcal{W}\times \mathcal{S}: n=w+m^2\big\}. $$ It is proved that there is a positive constant $c_{\mathcal{W}}$ (depending at most on $\mathcal{W}$) such that $$ \sum_{n\le N}f(n)-N\ge c_{\mathcal{W}}N $$ for infinitely many positive integers $N$, which makes some progress on a 1993 conjecture of Cilleruelo. As consequences of this result, we answer negatively a 2001 problem of Ruzsa as well as a 2017 problem of Ben Green.</description>

      <title>Polynomial densities and Heilbronn's criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heilbronn gave a sufficient condition for a number field with a totally ramified prime to fail to be norm-Euclidean. We say that Heilbronn's criterion applies to a polynomial $f$ if it applies to the number field $K=\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f)$ generated by $f$.
  Suppose $n\geq 3$ is odd and $p\geq 5$ is prime with $\gcd(p-1,n)=1$. Let ${F}_{p,n}$ denote the collection of monic polynomials $f\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree $n$ that are Eisenstein at the prime $p$. We order our polynomials by the natural height $\mathrm{Ht}(f)$. Define $\delta_{p,n}(X)$ to be the proportion of polynomials $f\in {F}_{p,n}$ with $\mathrm{Ht}(f)\leq X$ for which Heilbronn's criterion applies. One has $$\liminf_{X\to\infty}\delta_{p,n}(X)\geq \max\left\{\frac{2}{27}\,,\;1-\varepsilon(p)\right\}\,,$$ where $\varepsilon(p)\to 0$ and is effectively computable. In particular, the lower density tends to $1$ as $p\to\infty$ uniformly in $n$. We also give a version of this result where we weaken the condition on $\gcd(p-1,n)$.
  As a corollary, we show that given an integer $n\geq 2$, a positive proportion of Eisenstein polynomials of degree $n$ fail to generate norm-Euclidean fields.</description>

      <title>An arithmetic Yau-Zaslow formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15788v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an arithmetic refinement of the Yau-Zaslow formula by replacing the classical Euler characteristic in Beauville's argument by a "motivic Euler characteristic", related to the work of Levine. Our result implies similar formulas for other related invariants, including a generalisation of a formula of Kharlamov and Rasdeaconu on counting real rational curves on real K3 surfaces, and Saito's determinant of cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a natural birational invariant for varieties over finite fields and show that its vanishing on projective space is equivalent to the Tate conjecture, the Beilinson conjecture, and the Grothendieck--Serre semi-simplicity conjecture for all smooth projective varieties over finite fields. We further show that the Tate, Beilinson, and 1-semi-simplicity conjecture in half of the degrees implies those conjectures in all degrees.</description>

      <title>Overlapping substitutions and tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of (geometric) substitution rule to obtain overlapping substitutions. Our motivating example is the substitution presented in Ziherl, Dotera and Bekku \cite{DBZ}, which features a substitution matrix with non-integer entries. We give the meaning of such a matrix by showing that the right Perron--Frobenius eigenvector encodes the patch frequency of the resulting tiling. The patch frequencies are shown to be uniformly convergent, implying that the corresponding dynamical system is uniquely ergodic. Under mild assumptions, we further prove that the associated expansion constant is always an algebraic integer. In general, overlapping substitutions may yield a patch with illegal (partial) overlaps of tiles, even if it is locally consistent. We provide a sufficient condition for an overlapping substitution to be consistent, ensuring that no such illegal tiles emerge. Finally, we construct many intriguing one-dimensional overlapping substitutions and present higher dimensional examples from Delone multi-sets with inflation symmetry.</description>

      <title>The shrinking target and recurrence problem for non-autonomous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the shrinking target and recurrence set associated to non-autonomous measure-preserving systems on compact metric spaces, establishing zero-one criteria in the spirit of classical Borel-Cantelli results.
  Our first main theorem gives a quantitative shrinking target result for non-autonomous systems under a uniform mixing condition, providing asymptotics with an optimal error term. This general result is applicable to certain families of inner functions, yielding concrete applications such as patterns of zeros in the multibase expansion. Turning to recurrence, we establish new zero-measure laws for non-autonomous systems. In the autonomous case, we prove a zero-one criterion for recurrence sets of centred, one-component inner functions via Markov partitions and distortion estimates. Together, these results provide a unified framework for shrinking target and recurrence problems in both autonomous and non-autonomous dynamics.</description>
