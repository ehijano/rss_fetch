      <title>Comment on "Fully gapped superconductivity and topological aspects of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor TaReSi"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper [T. Shang et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 224504 (2023)], the authors study the physical properties of TaReSi compounds having Ima2 structure. This noncentrosymmetric structure is proposed to be the source of topological properties for mentioned compound. However, for a correct description of topological features, it is important to recognize the correct structure of the compound at low temperature. In this Comment, we show that Ima2 cannot be realized by TaReSi and is unstable at low temperature. The Ima2 structure contains the soft modes at S (1/2,0,0) point, which leads to the stable structure with Cm symmetry. Notably, the stable Cm system also has a noncentrosymmetric structure, which can be the actual source of topological properties.</description>

      <title>Probing the superconducting gap structure of ScRuSi via $\mu$SR and first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a thorough investigation into the superconducting state of the ruthenium-based ternary equiatomic compound ScRuSi. Our analysis combines experimental techniques, including muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) and low-temperature resistivity measurements, with theoretical insights derived from first-principles calculations. The low-temperature resistivity measurements reveal a distinct superconducting phase transition in the orthorhombic structure of ScRuSi at a critical temperature ($T_\text{C}$) of $2.5$ K. Further, the TF-$\mu$SR analysis yields a gap-to-critical-temperature ratio of $2\Delta/k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{C} = 2.71$, a value consistent with results obtained from previous heat capacity measurements. The temperature dependence of the superconducting normalized depolarization rate is fully described by the isotropic $s$-wave gap model. Additionally, zero-field $\mu$SR measurements indicate that the relaxation rate remains nearly identical below and above $T_\text{C}$. This observation strongly suggests the preservation of time-reversal symmetry within the superconducting state. By employing the McMillan-Allen-Dynes equation, we calculate a $T_\text{C}$ of $2.11$ K from first-principles calculations within the density functional theory framework. This calculated value aligns closely with the experimentally determined critical temperature. The coupling between the low-frequency phonon modes and the transition metal d-orbital states play an important role in governing the superconducting pairing in ScRuSi. The combination of experimental and theoretical approaches provides a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the superconducting nature of ScRuSi, offering insights into its critical temperature, pairing symmetry, and the underlying electron-phonon coupling mechanism.</description>

      <title>Exploring Superconductivity in Ba$_{3}$Ir$_{4}$Ge$_{16}$: Experimental and Theoretical Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore both experimental and theoretical aspects of the superconducting properties in the distinctive layered caged compound, Ba$_{3}$Ir$_{4}$Ge$_{16}$. Our approach integrates muon spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements with magnetization and heat capacity experiments, accompanied by first-principle calculations. The compound's bulk superconductivity is unequivocally established through DC magnetization measurements, revealing a critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$) of 5.7 K. A noteworthy characteristic observed in the low-temperature superfluid density is its saturating behavior, aligning with the features typical of conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors. The assessment of moderate electron-phonon coupling superconductivity is conducted through transverse field $\mu$SR measurements, yielding a superconducting gap to $T_\mathrm{C}$ ratio ($2\Delta(0)/k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{C}$) of 4.04, a value corroborated by heat capacity measurements. Crucially, zero field $\mu$SR measurements dismiss the possibility of any spontaneous magnetic field emergence below $T_\mathrm{C}$, highlighting the preservation of time-reversal symmetry. Our experimental results are reinforced by first-principles density functional calculations, underscoring the intricate interplay between crystal structure and superconducting order parameter symmetry in polyhedral caged compounds. This comprehensive investigation enhances our understanding of the nuanced relationship between crystal structure and superconductivity in such unique compounds.</description>

      <title>Strengthening of the superconductivity by real space decimation of the flat band states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to standard BCS superconductivity, that in flat bands (FBs) possesses an interesting degree of freedom that enables the control of the superfluid weight (SFW), referred to as the quantum metric (QM). In the present work, we consider the stub lattice and study the impact of the dilution of FB eigenstates on superconductivity. Among the most remarkable results, it is revealed that the SFW can be boosted by the decimation of the FB eigenstates. In addition, it is shown that the widely used uniform pairing hypothesis systematically predicts the suppression of the SFW, appears misleading and qualitatively incorrect. With the great progress in nanotechnologies, we believe that our findings could be realised and tested experimentally in covalent organic frameworks or in decorated structures in which defects/vacancies/ad-atoms are created/deposited in a controlled manner and even in multilayered structures with intercalated atoms.</description>

      <title>Prediction of superconductivity in Bilayer Kagome borophene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The element boron has long been central to two-dimensional superconducting materials, and numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of superconductivity in various boron-based structures. Recent work introduced a new variant: Bilayer Kagome borophene, characterized by its bilayer Kagome lattice with van Hove singularity. Using first-principles calculations, our research investigates the unique electronic structure and superconducting properties of Bilayer Kagome borophene (BK-borophene) through first-principles calculations. BK-borophene is identified as a single-gap superconductor with an initial superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 11.0 K. By strategically doping the material to align its Fermi level with the Van Hove singularity, Tc is significantly enhanced to 30.0 K. The results contribute to the existing understanding of BK-borophene, highlighting its potential as a member of the expanding family of two-dimensional superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Specific heat analyses on optical-phonon-derived uniaxial negative thermal expansion system $Tr$Zr$_{2}$ ($Tr$ = Fe and Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, huge uniaxial negative thermal expansion (NTE) along a $c$-axis has been observed in transition-metal ($Tr$) zirconides $Tr$Zr$_{2}$ with a tetragonal CuAl$_{2}$-type structure. In a recent study on FeZr$_{2}$ [M. Xu et al., Nat. Commun. 14, 4439 (2023)], the importance of optical phonons to the emergence of the $c$-axis NTE in FeZr$_{2}$ has been proposed. In this study, the physical properties of $Tr$Zr$_{2}$ ($Tr$ = Fe and Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$) have been studied by specific heat, sound velocity measurements, and theoretical phonon calculations to discuss the importance of optical phonons to the emergence of the $c$-axis NTE in CoZr$_{2}$ and FeZr$_{2}$. From analyses of lattice specific heat, we found that Ni substitution results in a systematic decrease in oscillator strength for the Einstein modes with 8.74 meV (CoZr$_{2}$). From phonon calculations, the low-energy optical phonon branches at the $\Gamma$ point were observed for CoZr$_{2}$ and FeZr$_{2}$ with $c$-axis NTE, but not in NiZr$_{2}$ with positive thermal expansion. The enhancement of phonon density of states near the above-mentioned optical phonon energy in CoZr$_{2}$ and FeZr$_{2}$ is consistent with the specific heat analyses. We propose the importance of the low-energy optical phonons to the emergence of the $c$-axis NTE in TrZr$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from domain wall fluctuations in sliding ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayers of two-dimensional van der Waals materials that lack an inversion centre can show a novel form of ferroelectricity, where certain stacking arrangements of the two layers lead to an interlayer polarization. Under an external out-of-plane electric field, a relative sliding between the two layers can occur accompanied by an inter-layer charge transfer and a ferroelectric switching. We show that the domain walls that mediate ferroelectric switching are a locus of strong attractive interactions between electrons. The attraction is mediated by the ferroelectric domain wall fluctuations, effectively driven by the soft interlayer shear phonon. We comment on the possible relevance of this attraction mechanism to the recent observation of an interplay between sliding ferroelectricity and superconductivity in bilayer $\text{T$_d$-MoTe}_2$. We also discuss the possible role of this mechanism in the superconductivity of moir\'e bilayers.</description>

      <title>Quantum interference between quasi-2D Fermi surface sheets in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: UTe$_2$ is a spin-triplet superconductor candidate for which high quality samples with long mean free paths have recently become available, enabling quantum oscillation measurements to probe its Fermi surface and effective carrier masses. It has recently been reported that UTe$_2$ possesses a 3D Fermi surface component [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 036501 (2023)]. The distinction between 2D and 3D Fermi surface sections in triplet superconductors can have important implications regarding the topological properties of the superconductivity. Here we report the observation of oscillatory components in the magnetoconductance of UTe$_2$ at high magnetic fields. We find that these oscillations are well described by quantum interference between quasiparticles traversing semiclassical trajectories spanning magnetic breakdown networks. Our observations are consistent with a quasi-2D model of this material's Fermi surface based on prior dHvA-effect measurements. Our results strongly indicate that UTe$_2$ -- which exhibits a multitude of complex physical phenomena -- possesses a remarkably simple Fermi surface consisting exclusively of two quasi-2D cylindrical sections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03844v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the electron-phonon coupling is quadratic in the phonon coordinates, electrons can pair to form bipolarons due to phonon zero-point fluctuations, a purely quantum effect. We study superconductivity originating from this pairing mechanism in a minimal model and reveal that, in the strong coupling regime, the critical temperature ($T_c$) is only mildly suppressed by the coupling strength, in stark contrast to the exponential suppression in linearly coupled systems, thus implying higher optimal $T_c$ values. We demonstrate that large coupling constants of this flavor are achieved in known materials such as perovskites, and discuss strategies to realize such superconductivity using superlattices.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of superconductors: from Lorentz to Galilei at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the derivation of the electrodynamics of superconductors coupled to the electromagnetic field from a Lorentz-invariant bosonic model of Cooper pairs. Our results are obtained at zero temperature where, according to the third law of thermodynamics, the entropy of the system is zero. In the nonrelativistic limit we obtain a Galilei-invariant superconducting system which differs with respect to the familiar Schr\"odinger-like one. From this point of view, there are similarities with the Pauli equation of fermions which is derived from the Dirac equation in the nonrelativistic limit and has a spin-magnetic field term in contrast with the Schr\"odinger equation. One of the peculiar effects of our model is the decay of a static electric field inside a superconductor exactly with the London penetration length. In addition, our theory predicts a modified D'Alembert equation for the massive electromagnetic field also in the case of nonrelativistic superconducting matter. We emphasize the role of the Nambu-Goldstone phase field which is crucial to obtain the collective modes of the superconducting matter field. In the special case of a nonrelativistic neutral superfluid we find a gapless Bogoliubov-like spectrum, while for the charged superfluid we obtain a dispersion relation that is gapped by the plasma frequency.</description>

      <title>Universal low-temperature fluctuation of unconventional superconductors revealed: 'Smoking gun' leaves proper bosonic superfluidity the last theory standing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-temperature thermal fluctuations offer an essential window in characterizing the true nature of a quantum state of matter, a quintessential example being Fermi liquid theory. Here, we examine the leading thermal fluctuation of the superfluid density across numerous families ranging from relatively conventional to highly unconventional superconductors (MgB$_2$, bismuthates, doped buckyballs, heavy fermions, UTe$_2$, doped SrTiO$_3$, Chevrel clusters, intermetallics, organic superconductors, transition metal dichalcogenides, ruthenates, iron-pnictides, cuprates, and kagome metals). Amazingly, in all of them an unprecedented universal $T^3$ depletion materializes in the low-temperature superfluid density, even in the believed-to-be-conventional MgB$_2$. This reveals a new quantum superfluid state of matter and requires a necessary change of paradigm in describing modern superconductors. We demonstrate that such unorthodox yet generic behavior can be described by a strictly Galilean consistent theory of bosonic superfluidity hosting a long-lived 'true condensate'.</description>

      <title>Flat bands and distinct density wave orders in correlated Kagome superconductor CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ has attracted much recent attention due to the coexistence of multiple exotic orders and the associated proposals to mimic unconventional high temperature superconductors. Nevertheless, magnetism and strong electronic correlations -- two essential ingredients for unconventional superconductivity, are absent in this V-based Kagome metal. CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ is a newly discovered Cr-based parallel of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, in which magnetism appears with charge density wave and superconductivity at different temperature and pressure regions. Enhanced electronic correlations are also suggested by theoretical proposals due to the calculated flat bands. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission measurements and first-principles calculations on this new material system. Electron energy bands and the associated orbitals are resolved. Flat bands are observed near the Fermi level. Doping dependent measurements on Cs(Cr$_x$V$_{1-x}$)$_3$Sb$_5$ reveal a gradually enhanced band renormalization from CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, accompanied by distinct spatial symmetry breaking states in the phase diagram.</description>

Abstract: Quantum fluctuations in low-dimensional systems and near quantum phase transitions have significant influences on material properties. Yet, it is difficult to experimentally gauge the strength and importance of quantum fluctuations. Here we provide a resonant inelastic x-ray scattering study of magnon excitations in Mott insulating cuprates. From the thin film of SrCuO$_2$, single- and bi-magnon dispersions are derived. Using an effective Heisenberg Hamiltonian generated from the Hubbard model, we show that the single-magnon dispersion is only described satisfactorily when including significant quantum corrections stemming from magnon-magnon interactions. Comparative results on La$_2$CuO$_4$ indicate that quantum fluctuations are much stronger in SrCuO$_2$ suggesting closer proximity to a magnetic quantum critical point. Monte Carlo calculations reveal that other magnetic orders may compete with the antiferromagnetic N\'eel order as the ground state. Our results indicate that SrCuO$_2$ - due to strong quantum fluctuations - is a unique starting point for the exploration of novel magnetic ground states.</description>

Abstract: The inherent complexity of system-bath interactions often requires making critical approximations, which we here show to have a radical influence on the renormalization group flow and the resulting phase diagram. Specifically, for the Caldeira-Leggett model Schmid and Bulgadaev (SB) predicted a phase transition, whose experimental verification in resistive superconducting circuits is currently hotly debated. For normal metal and Josephson junction array resistors, we show that the mapping to Caldeira-Leggett is only exact when artificially decompactifying the superconducting phase. Retaining phase compactness immediately leads to a phase diagram depending on four instead of two parameters. While we still find an SB-like transition in the transmon regime, the critical parameter is controlled exclusively by the capacitive coupling. In contrast, the Cooper pair box maps to the anisotropic Kondo model, where a pseudo-ferromagnetic phase is not allowed for regular electrostatic interactions.</description>

Abstract: First of all we shortly illustrate how the symplectic quantization scheme [Gradenigo and Livi, 2021] can be applied to a relativistic field theory with self-interaction. Taking inspiration from the stochastic quantization method by Parisi and Wu, this procedure is based on considering explicitly the role of an intrinsic time variable, associated with quantum fluctuations. The major part of this paper is devoted to showing how the symplectic quantization scheme can be extended to the non-relativistic limit for a Schr\"odinger-like field. Then we also discuss how one can obtain from this non-relativistic theory a linear Schr\"odinger equation for the single-particle wavefunction. This further passage is based on a suitable coarse-graining procedure, when self-interaction terms can be neglected, with respect to interactions with any external field. In the Appendix we complete our survey on symplectic quantization by discussing how this scheme applies to a non-relativistic particle under the action of a generic external potential.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of local magnetism and superconductivity in the heavy-fermion CeRh$_2$As$_2$ revealed by $\mu$SR studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting (SC) state ($T_\mathrm{c}$ = 0.3 K) of the heavy-fermion compound CeRh$_2$As$_2$, which undergoes an unusual field-induced transition to another high-field SC state, emerges from an unknown ordered state below $T_\mathrm{o}$ = 0.55 K. While an electronic multipolar order of itinerant Ce-4$f$ states was proposed to account for the $T_\mathrm{o}$ phase, the exact order parameter has not been known to date. Here, we report on muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) studies of the magnetic and SC properties in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ single crystals at low temperatures. We reveal a magnetic origin of the $T_\mathrm{o}$ order by identifying a spontaneous internal field below $T_\mathrm{o}$ = 0.55 K. Furthermore, we find evidence of a microscopic coexistence of local magnetism with bulk superconductivity. Our findings open the possibility that the $T_\mathrm{o}$ phase involves both dipole and higher order Ce-4$f$ moment degrees of freedom and accounts for the unusual non-Fermi liquid behavior.</description>
