      <title>Multi-MeV electrons observed by CRRES during solar cycle 22</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) observed the response of the Van Allen radiation belts to peak solar activity within solar cycle 22. This study analyses the occurrence and loss timescales of relativistic electrons within the CRRES High Energy Electron Fluxometer (HEEF) dataset, including during several large geomagnetic storms that flooded the slot region with multi-MeV electrons and which allow the first definitive multi-MeV lifetimes to be calculated in this region. The HEEF loss timescales are otherwise broadly in agreement with those from later solar cycles but differences include longer-lasting sub-MeV electrons near the inner region of the outer belt and faster decaying multi-MeV electrons near geosynchronous orbit. These differences are associated with higher levels of geomagnetic activity, a phenomenon that enables the spread in the results to be parameterised accordingly. The timescales generally appear well-bounded by Kp-dependent theoretical predictions but the variability within the spread is however not always well-ordered by geomagnetic activity. This reveals the limits of pitch-angle diffusion in accounting for the decay of elevated electron fluxes following geomagnetic storms.</description>

      <title>Exploring nonlinearities in a positive ion-negative ion (PINI) plasma: can other processes mimic debris-induced effects?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, an analysis of nonlinear waves and structures induced by an external charged debris in a positive ion-negative ion (PINI) plasma is presented. The results obtained are compared with findings from available experiments involving PINI plasma. The process of formation of different nonlinear structures is examined theoretically through a forced Koretweg-de Vries (fKdV) equation, which is also verified with a multi-fluid flux-corrected transport simulation code (mFCT). Various processes which are responsible for different nonlinear waves and structures excited by differently charged external debris are pointed out. This work also points out the similarities in different nonlinear structures excited by an external charged debris and the underlying processes (this work) and those observed experimentally through processes that do not involve any external debris.</description>

      <title>Runaway electron generation in disruptions mitigated by deuterium and noble gas injection in SPARC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the critical challenges in future high current tokamaks is the avoidance of runaway electrons during disruptions. Here, we investigate disruptions mitigated with combined deuterium and noble gas injection in SPARC. We use multi-objective Bayesian optimization of the densities of the injected material, taking into account limits on the maximum runaway current, the transported fraction of the heat loss, and the current quench time. The simulations are conducted using the numerical framework DREAM (Disruption Runaway Electron Analysis Model). We show that during deuterium operation, runaway generation can be avoided with material injection, even when we account for runaway electron generation from DD-induced Compton scattering. However, when including the latter, the region in the injected-material-density space corresponding to successful mitigation is reduced. During deuterium-tritium operation, acceptable levels of runaway current and transported heat losses are only obtainable at the highest levels of achievable injected deuterium densities. Furthermore, disruption mitigation is found to be more favourable when combining deuterium with neon, compared to deuterium combined with helium or argon.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Magnetohydrodynamic Modelling of Flux Pumping in ASDEX Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sawtooth-free hybrid scenario has been achieved recently in ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) with applied non-inductive current sources and auxiliary heating [A. Burckhart et al 2023 Nucl. Fusion 63 126056]. Control experiments in AUG suggest that the self-regulating magnetic flux pumping mechanism, characterized by anomalous current redistribution, is responsible for clamping the central safety factor (q_0) close to unity, thereby preventing the sawtooth onset. This work presents a numerical and theoretical investigation of flux pumping in the AUG hybrid scenario based on the two-temperature, visco-resistive, full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model with the JOREK code. To quantitatively model the flux pumping, we choose realistic parameters, plasma configurations, and source terms based on AUG experiments. During the initial saturation stage of the unstable 1/1 quasi-interchange mode (on millisecond timescales), q_0 exhibits fast under-damped oscillation and reaches a value closer to unity, which is attributed to the self-regulation of core plasma and the fast dynamo effect on the order of V/m. On the longer resistive diffusion timescale of seconds, the slow negative dynamo effect on the order of mV/m induced by the 1/1 MHD instability plays an effective role in flux pumping, which provides quantitative agreement with experimental observations for the first time. The final saturated 1/1 MHD instability exhibits features of the quasi-interchange mode and tearing mode, and the associated convective plasma flow velocity is a few m/s. The toroidal negative electric field from the slow dynamo dominantly offsets the positive current drive and continuously redistributes the current density and pressure. As a result, q_0 is maintained close to unity due to the low-shear profiles of current density and pressure in the plasma core, and the system enters a sawtooth-free and quasi-stationary helical state.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal tapering in meter-scale gas jets for increased efficiency of laser plasma accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern laser plasma accelerators (LPAs) often require plasma waveguides tens of cm long to propagate a high-intensity drive laser pulse. Tapering the longitudinal gas density profile in 10 cm scale gas jets could allow for single stage laser plasma acceleration well beyond 10 GeV with current petawatt-class laser systems. Via simulation and interferometry measurements, we show density control by longitudinally adjusting the throat width and jet angle. Density profiles appropriate for tapering were calculated analytically and via particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, and were matched experimentally. These simulations show that tapering can increase electron beam energy using 19 J laser energy from ~9 GeV to &gt;12 GeV in a 30 cm plasma, and the accelerated charge by an order of magnitude.

      <title>Magnetic Reconnection in a Compact Magnetic Dome: Chromospheric Emissions and High-velocity Plasma Flows</title>

Abstract: Magnetic reconnection at small spatial scales is a fundamental driver of energy release and plasma dynamics in the lower solar atmosphere. We present observations of a brightening in an active region, captured in high-resolution data from the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) using the Visible Broadband Imager (VBI) and the Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP). The event exhibits Ellerman bomb-like morphology in the H$\beta$ filter, associated with flux cancellation between a small negative polarity patch adjacent to opposite-polarity plage. Additionally, it displays enhanced emissions in Ca II K, hot elongated features containing Alfv\'enic plasma flows, and cooler blue-shifted structures. We employ multi-line, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) inversions of the spectropolarimetric data to infer the stratification of the physical parameters of the atmosphere. Furthermore, we use the photospheric vector magnetogram inferred from the ViSP spectra as a boundary condition for nonlinear force-free field extrapolations, revealing the three-dimensional distribution of squashing factors. We find significant enhancements in temperature, velocity, and microturbulence confined to the upper photosphere and low chromosphere. Our findings provide observational evidence of low-altitude magnetic reconnection along quasi-separatrix layers in a compact fan-spine-type configuration, highlighting the complex interplay between magnetic topology, energy release, and plasma flows.</description>
