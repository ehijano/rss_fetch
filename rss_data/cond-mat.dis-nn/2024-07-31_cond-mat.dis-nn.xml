      <title>Statistical Localization of Electromagnetic Signals in Disordered Time-Varying Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the statistical properties of electromagnetic signals after different times of duration within one-dimensional local-disordered time-varying cavities, where both spatial and temporal disorders are added. Our findings reveal that, in the vast majority of cases, adequate temporal disorder in local space can make the electromagnetic field statistically localized, obeying a normal distribution at a specific point in time of arbitrary location within the cavity. We employ the concept of disordered space-time crystals and leverage Lindeberg's and Lyapunov's theorems to theoretically prove the normal distribution of the field values. Furthermore, we find that with the increase of energy provided by time variation, the probability of extreme fields will significantly increase and the field intensity eventually is de-normalized, that is, deviating from the normal distribution. This study not only sheds light on the statistical properties of transient signals in local-disordered time-varying systems but also paves the way for further exploration in wave dynamics of analogous systems.</description>

      <title>Hyperoptimized approximate contraction of tensor networks for rugged-energy-landscape spin glasses on periodic square and cubic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining the low-energy configurations of spin glasses that have rugged energy landscapes is of direct relevance to combinatorial optimization and fundamental science. Search-based heuristics have difficulty with this task due to the existence of many local minima that are far from optimal. The work of [M. M. Rams et al., Phys. Rev. E 104, 025308 (2021)] demonstrates an alternative that can bypass this issue for spin glasses with planar or quasi-planar geometry: sampling the Boltzmann distribution via approximate contractions of tensor networks. The computational complexity of this approach is due only to the complexity of contracting the network, and is therefore independent of landscape ruggedness. Here we initiate an investigation of how to take this approach beyond (quasi-)planar geometry by utilizing hyperoptimized approximate contraction of tensor networks [J. Gray and G. K.-L. Chan, Phys. Rev. X 14, 011009 (2024)]. We perform tests on the periodic square- and cubic-lattice, planted-solution Ising spin glasses generated with tile planting [F. Hamze et al., Phys. Rev. E 97, 043303 (2018)] for up to 2304 (square lattice) and 216 (cubic lattice) spins. For a fixed bond dimension, the time complexity is quadratic. With a bond dimension of only four, over the tested system sizes the average solution quality in the most rugged instance class remains at ~1% (square lattice) or ~10% (cubic lattice) of optimal. These results encourage further investigation of tensor network contraction for rugged-energy-landscape spin-glass problems, especially given that this approach is not limited to the Ising (i.e., binary) or two-body (i.e., quadratic) settings.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Static and Dynamical Properties of Random Anisotropy Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently observed scaling in the random-anisotropy model of amorphous or sintered ferromagnets is derived by an alternative method and extended for studying the dynamical properties in terms of the Landau-Lifshitz equations for spin blocks. Switching to the rescaled exchange and anisotropy constants allows one to investigate the dynamics by using a reduced number of variables, which greatly speeds up computations. The proposed dynamical scaling is applied to the problem of microwave absorption by a random anisotropy magnet. The equivalence of the rescaled model to the original atomic model is confirmed numerically. The method is proposed as a powerful tool in studying static and dynamic properties of systems with quenched randomness.</description>

      <title>Interpretable correlator Transformer for image-like quantum matter data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their inherent capabilities of capturing non-local dependencies, Transformer neural networks have quickly been established as the paradigmatic architecture for large language models and image processing. Next to these traditional applications, machine learning methods have also been demonstrated to be versatile tools in the analysis of image-like data of quantum phases of matter, e.g. given snapshots of many-body wave functions obtained in ultracold atom experiments. While local correlation structures in image-like data of physical systems can reliably be detected, identifying phases of matter characterized by global, non-local structures with interpretable machine learning methods remains a challenge. Here, we introduce the correlator Transformer (CoTra), which classifies different phases of matter while at the same time yielding full interpretability in terms of physical correlation functions. The network's underlying structure is a tailored attention mechanism, which learns efficient ways to weigh local and non-local correlations for a successful classification. We demonstrate the versatility of the CoTra by detecting local order in the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, and show that local gauge constraints in one- and two-dimensional lattice gauge theories can be identified. Furthermore, we establish that the CoTra reliably detects non-local structures in images of correlated fermions in momentum space (Cooper pairs) and that it can distinguish percolating from non-percolating images.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Fluctuations of Correlation Functions: Spin and Random Matrix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral statistics and correlations are the usual way to study the presence or absence of quantum chaos in quantum systems. We present our investigation on the study of the fluctuation average and variance of certain correlation functions as a diagnostic measure of quantum chaos and to possibly characterize quantum systems based on it. These quantities are related to eigenvector distribution and eigenvector correlation. Using the Random Matrix Theory certain analytical expressions of these quantities, for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble case, were calculated before. So as a first step, we study these quantities for the Gaussian unitary ensemble case numerically, and deduce certain analytical results for the same. We then carry out our investigations in physical system, such as the mixed-field Ising model. For this model, we find that although the eigenvalue statistics follow the behaviour of corresponding random matrices, the fluctuation average and variance of these correlation functions deviate from the expected random matrix theory behaviour. We then turn our focus on the Rosenzweig-Porter model of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble and Gaussian Unitary Ensemble types. By using the fluctuation average and variance of these correlations, we identify the three distinct phases of these models: the ergodic, the fractal, and the localized phases. We provide an alternative way to study and distinguish the three phases and firmly establish the use of these correlation fluctuations as an alternative way to characterize quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Retinomorphic Machine Vision in a Network Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing prevalence of AI, demand increases for efficient machine learning hardware. Physical systems are sought which combine image feature detection with the essential nonlinearity for tasks such as image classification. Existing physical hardware typically detects features linearly, then employs digital processing for nonlinear activation. Biological vision systems excel at nonlinear image processing. The retina detects features in ganglion cells via lateral inhibition, where neighbouring cells nonlinearly compete for activation.
  We present a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' machine vision platform using an on-chip semiconductor network laser. The system detects multiple features in parallel via spatially-overlapping lasing modes, with integrated nonlinearity provided by antagonistic gain competition between modes - a photonic analogue of retinal inhibition. Parallel feature-detection enhances efficiency relative to feature-detection schemes which operate sequentially or via multiple device copies, with Si-compatible processing and a compact micron-scale footprint relative to existing mm-scale systems. We report 98.05% accuracy on MNIST-digits and 87.85% on Fashion-MNIST, with strong performance on short training datasets.</description>

      <title>Parametric Matrix Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11694v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general class of machine learning algorithms called parametric matrix models. In contrast with most existing machine learning models that imitate the biology of neurons, parametric matrix models use matrix equations that emulate the physics of quantum systems. Similar to how physics problems are usually solved, parametric matrix models learn the governing equations that lead to the desired outputs. Parametric matrix models can be efficiently trained from empirical data, and the equations may use algebraic, differential, or integral relations. While originally designed for scientific computing, we prove that parametric matrix models are universal function approximators that can be applied to general machine learning problems. After introducing the underlying theory, we apply parametric matrix models to a series of different challenges that show their performance for a wide range of problems. For all the challenges tested here, parametric matrix models produce accurate results within an efficient and interpretable computational framework that allows for input feature extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum metric due to vacancies in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random vacancies in a graphene monolayer induce defect states that are known to form a narrow impurity band centered around zero energy at half-filling. We use a space-resolved formulation of the quantum metric and establish a strong enhancement of the electronic correlations in this impurity band. The enhancement is primarily due to strong correlations between pairs of vacancies situated on different sublattices at anomalously large spatial distances. We trace the strong enhancement to both the multifractal vacancy wave functions, which ties the system exactly at the Anderson insulator transition for all defect concentrations, and preserving the chiral symmetry.</description>

      <title>Witnessing Disorder in Quantum Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are no clean samples in nature. Therefore, when we come to discuss the entanglement properties of quantum materials, the effects of disorder must be taken into account. This question is of particular interest for high-entangled states, such as quantum spin liquids, which lie outside the Landau paradigm for classifying phases of matter. In this work, we explore what experimentally-accessible measures, in the form of concurrence, residual tangle and quantum Fisher information, can teach us about the entanglement in the presence of disorder. As a representative example, we consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLL) and disorder-driven random singlet (RS) states found in antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains. Using quantum Fisher information and residual tangle, we demonstrate that both TLL and RS states exhibit multi-partite entanglement. In the case of the RS state, we attribute this to entanglement localized below a crossover length scale. We further show that the order of disorder average matters in calculating measures like concurrence, and that this can lead to false inferences when interpreting experiment. None the less, correctly interpreted, these witnesses provide useful information about the effects of disorder. We explore how information about the central charge of the TLL can be extracted from the low-temperature behavior of concurrence, and conjecture that this analysis can be extended to the effective central charge of the RS state. Finally, we establish how RS and TLL states can be distinguished through the growth of multi-partite entanglement, as witnessed by the equal-time structure factor. These results establish that, used carefully, experiments based on entanglement witnesses can provide important information about quantum spin systems in the presence of disorder.</description>
