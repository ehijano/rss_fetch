      <title>Regularity for Weak Solutions to First-Order Local Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish interior regularity results for first-order, stationary, local mean-field game (MFG) systems. Specifically, we study solutions of the coupled system consisting of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation $H(x, Du, m) = 0$ and a transport equation $-\operatorname{div}(m D_pH(x, Du, m)) = 0$ in a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Under suitable structural assumptions on the Hamiltonian $H$, without requiring monotonicity of the system, convexity of the Hamiltonian, separability in variables, or smoothness beyond basic continuity in $(p,m)$, we introduce a notion of weak solutions that allows the application of techniques from elliptic regularity theory. Our main contribution is to prove that the value function $u$ is locally H\"older continuous in $\Omega$. The proof leverages the connection between first-order MFG systems and quasilinear equations in divergence form, adapting classical techniques to handle the specific structure of MFG systems.</description>

      <title>$C^1$ type regularization for point vortices on $\mathbb S^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a series of classic vorticity solutions for incompressible Euler equation on $\mathbb S^2$, which constitute the $C^1$ type regularization for a general traveling point vortex system. The construction is accomplished by applying tangent mapping on $\mathbb S^2$ and Lyapunov--Schmidt reduction argument. Using the fixed-point theorem and a finite dimensional equation on vortex dynamics, we prove that the vortices are located near a nondegenerate critical point of Kirchhoff--Routh function. Moreover, in the tangent space at each vortex center, the scaled stream function is verified as a perturbation of the ground state for generalized plasma problem. Some other qualitative and quantitative estimates for the regularization series are also obtained in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalized derivative nonlinear Schr\''odinger equation. We prove existence of wave operator under an explicit smallness of the given asymptotic states. Our method bases on studying the associated system used in \cite{Tinpaper4}. Moreover, we show that if the initial data is small enough in $H^2(\mathbb{R})$ then the associated solution scatters up to a Gauge transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the uniqueness of the following positive solutions of anisotropic elliptic equation: \begin{equation}\nonumber
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  -\Delta^F _p u&amp;=u^q \quad \text{in} \quad \Omega,
  u&amp;=0 \quad \text{on} \quad \partial \Omega,
  \end{aligned}
  \right. \end{equation} where $p&gt;\frac{3}{2}$ is a constant. We utilize the linearized method to derive the uniqueness results, which extends the conclusion obtained by L. Brasco and E. Lindgren.</description>

      <title>Strict rearrangement inequalities: nonexpansivity and periodic Gagliardo seminorms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the behavior of the periodic Gagliardo seminorm under two types of rearrangements, namely under a periodic, and respectively a cylindrical, symmetric decreasing rearrangement. Our two main results are P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} type inequalities for these rearrangements. We also deal with the cases of equality.
  Our method uses, among others, some classical nonexpansivity results for rearrangements for which we provide some slight improvements. Our proof is based on the ideas of [Frank and Seiringer, Non-linear ground state representations and sharp Hardy inequalities, J. Funct. Anal., 2008], where a new proof to deal with the cases of equality in the nonexpansivity theorem was given, albeit in a special case involving the rearrangement of only one function.</description>

      <title>Global fractional Sobolev regularity for fully nonlinear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fractional regularity estimates up to the boundary for solutions to fully nonlinear elliptic equations with measurable ingredients. Specifically, under the assumption of uniform ellipticity of the operator, we demonstrate that viscosity solutions to a second-order operator satisfy a fractional Laplacian equation. This result implies that the solutions are globally of class $W^{\gamma, p}$, for $\gamma \in (1,2)$, with appropriate estimates. Consequently, these solutions exhibit differentiability of order strictly greater than one, without requiring any additional assumptions regarding the operator, such as convexity or concavity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine boundary regularity for a fully nonlinear free transmission problem. We argue using approximation methods, comparing the operators driving the problem with a limiting profile. Working natural conditions on the data of the problem, we produce regularity estimates in Sobolev and $C^{1,{\rm Log-Lip}}$-spaces. Our findings extend recent developments in the literature to the free boundary setting.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-Time Estimates on the Size of Chaos for Interacting Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any weakly interacting particle system with bounded kernel, we give uniform-in-time estimates of the $L^2$ norm of correlation functions, provided that the diffusion coefficient is large enough. When the condition on the kernels is more restrictive, we can remove the dependence of the lower bound for diffusion coefficient on the initial data and estimate the size of chaos in a weaker sense. Based on these estimates, we may study fluctuation around the mean-field limit.</description>

      <title>Multi-soliton solutions of Klein-Gordon-Zakharov system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the Klein-Gordon-Zakharov system with a focus on identifying multi-soliton solutions. Specifically, for a given number $N$ of solitons, we demonstrate the existence of a multi-soliton solution that asymptotically converges, in the energy space, to the sum of these solitons. Our proof extends and builds upon the previous results in \cite{cote, cotem, IA} concerning the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation and the generalized Klein-Gordon equation. In contrast to the method used in \cite{cotem} to establish the existence of multi-solitons for the Klein-Gordon equation, where the difficulty arises from the directions imposed by the coercivity property, requiring the identification of eigenfunctions of the coercivity operator to derive new control estimates, the structure of the present system allows for a more refined result. Specifically, the directional constraints can be eliminated by employing orthogonality arguments derived from localization and modulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Optimal higher derivative estimates for solutions of the Lam\'e system with closely spaced hard inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate higher derivative estimates for the Lam\'e system with hard inclusions embedded in a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. As the distance $\varepsilon$ between two closely spaced hard inclusions approaches zero, the stress in the narrow regions between the inclusions increases significantly. This stress is captured by the gradient of the solution. The key contribution of this paper is a detailed characterization of this singularity, achieved by deriving higher derivative estimates for solutions to the Lam\'e system with partially infinite coefficients. These upper bounds are shown to be sharp in two and three dimensions when the domain exhibits certain symmetries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to precisely quantify the singular behavior of higher derivatives in the Lam\'e system with hard inclusions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by a paper by T. Chakradhar, K. Gittins, G. Habib and N. Peyerimhoff, we analyze their conjecture that the ground state energy of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator on the disk tends to $+\infty$ as the magnetic field tends to $+\infty$. This is an important step towards the analysis of the curvature effect in the case of general domains in $\mathbb R^2$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we are concerned with a nonlinear wave equation with variable exponents. A distributive delay is imposed into the damping term with variable exponents nonlinearity. Firstly, we show that the global nonexistence time can be dominated. Secondly, global existence of solutions is shown under some suitable conditions on the initial data. Finally, the decay rates of that solutions are established as well.</description>

      <title>Mass-Conserving Weak Solutions to the Continuous Nonlinear Fragmentation Equation in the Presence of Mass Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical model for the continuous nonlinear fragmentation equation is considered in the presence of mass transfer. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of mass-conserving weak solutions to the nonlinear fragmentation equation with mass transfer for collision kernels of the form $\Phi(x,y) = \kappa(x^{{\sigma_1}} y^{{\sigma_2}} + y^{{\sigma_1}} x^{{\sigma_2}})$, $\kappa&gt;0$, $0 \leq {\sigma_1} \leq {\sigma_2} \leq 1$, and ${\sigma_1} \neq 1$ for $(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}_+^2$, with integrable daughter distribution functions, thereby extending previous results obtained by Giri \&amp; Lauren\c cot (2021). In particular, the existence of at least one global weak solution is shown when the collision kernel exhibits at least linear growth, and one local weak solution when the collision kernel exhibits sublinear growth. In both cases, finite superlinear moment bounds are obtained for positive times without requiring the finiteness of initial superlinear moments. Additionally, the uniqueness of solutions is confirmed in both cases.</description>

      <title>A hyperbolic relaxation system of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with artificial compressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new hyperbolic approximation to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by incorporating a first-order relaxation and using the artificial compressibility method. With two relaxation parameters in the model, we rigorously prove the asymptotic limit of the system towards the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations as both parameters tend to zero. Notably, the convergence of the approximate pressure variable is achieved by the help of a linear `auxiliary' system and energy-type error estimates of its differences with the two-parameter model and the Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the even and odd Jacobi heat kernels defined in the context of the multidimensional double cone and its surface, the multidimensional hyperboloid and its surface, and the multidimensional paraboloid and its surface. By integrating the framework of Jacobi polynomials on these domains, as analyzed by Xu, with contemporary methods developed by Nowak, Sj\"ogren, and Szarek for obtaining sharp estimates of the spherical heat kernel, we establish genuinely sharp estimates for the even and odd Jacobi heat kernel in the double conic settings, and for the even Jacobi heat kernel on hyperbolic settings. We also discuss the limitations encountered in extending these results to the remaining settings.</description>

Abstract: Direct and inverse initial-boundary problems on a bounded interval for systems of quasilinear evolution equations with general nonlinearities are considered. In the case of inverse problems conditions of integral overdetermination are introduced and right-hand sides of equations of special types are chosen as controls. Results on well-posedness of such problems are established. Assumptions on smallness of the input data or smallness of a time interval are required.</description>

      <title>Horizontal mean curvature flow as a scaling limit of a mean field equation in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive curvature flows in the Heisenberg group by formal asymptotic expansion of a nonlocal mean-field equation under the anisotropic rescaling of the Heisenberg group. This is motivated by the aim of connecting mechanisms at a microscopic (i.e. cellular) level to macroscopic models of image processing through a multiscale approach. The nonlocal equation, which is very similar to the Ermentrout-Cowan equation used in neurobiology, can be derived from an interacting particle model. As sub-Riemannian geometries play an important role in the models of the visual cortex proposed by Petitot and Citti-Sarti, this paper provides a mathematical framework for a rigorous upscaling of models for the visual cortex from the cell level via a mean field equation to curvature flows which are used in image processing. From a pure mathematical point of view, it provides a new approximation and regularization of Heisenberg mean curvature flow. Using the local structure of the rototranslational group, we extend the result to cover the model by Citti and Sarti. Numerically, the parameters in our algorithm interpolate between solving an Ementrout-Cowan type of equation and a Bence-Merriman-Osher algorithm type algorithm for sub-Riemannian mean curvature. We also reproduce some known exact solutions in the Heisenberg case.</description>

      <title>Large time behavior of solution to a parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with weak singular sensitivity and logistic kinetics: Boundedness, persistence, stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the long-term behavior of positive solutions for the following parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis competition system with weak singular sensitivity and logistic source
  \begin{equation}
  \label{abstract-eq} \begin{cases} u_t=\Delta u-\chi \nabla\cdot (\frac{u}{v^{\lambda}} \nabla v) +ru- \mu u^2, \quad &amp;x\in \Omega,\cr 0=\Delta v- \alpha v +\beta u,\quad &amp;x\in \Omega, \cr \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial \nu}=0,\quad &amp;x\in\partial\Omega, \end{cases}\, \end{equation} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N (N \ge 2)$ is a smooth bounded domain, the parameters $\chi,\, r, \, \mu, \, \alpha,\,\beta$ are positive constants and $\lambda \in (0,1).$
  In this article, for all suitably smooth initial data $u_0\in C^0(\bar\Omega)$ with $u_0 \not \equiv 0,$ it has been proven that:
  First, there exists $\mu &gt; \mu_1^*(p,\lambda,\chi,\beta)$ such that any globally defined positive solution is $L^p(\Omega)$-bounded with $p \ge 2.$ Next, there exists $\mu &gt; \mu_2^*(N,\lambda,\chi,\beta)$ such that any globally defined classical solutions is globally bounded. Third, there exists $\mu &gt; \mu_3^*(N,\lambda,\chi,\beta)$ such that any globally defined positive solution is uniformly bounded above and below eventually by some positive constants that are independent of its initial function $u_0.$ Last, there exists $\mu &gt; \mu_4^*(N,\lambda,\chi,\alpha,\beta,r,\Omega)$ such that any globally bounded classical solution to system (0.1) exponentially converges to the constant steady state $(\frac{r}{\mu},\frac{\beta}{\alpha}\frac{r}{\mu}).$</description>

      <title>Low-Regularity Local Well-Posedness for the Elastic Wave System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the elastic wave system in three spatial dimensions. For admissible harmonic elastic materials, we prove a desired low-regularity local well-posedness result for the corresponding elastic wave equations. For such materials, we can split the dynamics into the divergence-part and the curl-part, and each part satisfies a distinct coupled quasilinear wave system with respect to different acoustical metrics. Our main result is that the Sobolev norm $H^{3+}$ of the divergence-part (the faster-wave part) and the $H^{4+}$ of the curl-part (the slower-wave part) can be controlled in terms of initial data for short times. We note that the Sobolev norm assumption $H^{3+}$ is optimal for the divergence-part. This marks the first favorable low-regularity local well-posedness result for a wave system with multiple wave speeds.</description>

      <title>Variational methods for scaled functionals with applications to the Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson-Slater equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop novel variational methods for solving scaled equations that do not have the mountain pass geometry, classical linking geometry based on linear subspaces, or $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry, and therefore cannot be solved using classical variational arguments. Our contributions here include new critical group estimates for scaled functionals, nonlinear saddle point and linking geometries based on scaling, a notion of local linking based on scaling, and scaling-based multiplicity results for symmetric functionals. We develop these methods in an abstract setting involving scaled operators and scaled eigenvalue problems. Applications to subcritical and critical Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson-Slater equations are given.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study $(p,q)$-extension operators of Sobolev spaces, based on the duality of composition operators within these spaces. We construct Sobolev extension operators in H\"older singular domains using corresponding reflections.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Strichartz estimates, including estimates involving spatial derivatives, for radial wave equations with potentials in similarity variables. This is accomplished for all spatial dimensions $d\geq 3$ and almost all regularities above energy and below the threshold $\frac d2$. These estimates provide a unified framework that allows one to derive optimal blowup stability result for a wide range of energy supercritical nonlinear wave equations. To showcase their usefulness, an optimal blowup stability result for the quintic nonlinear wave equation is also obtained.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the existence of standing wave solutions for quasilinear Schrodinger systems. To address the challenges posed by non differentiability, we adopt the dual approach introduced by Colin and Jeanjean. The existence of solutions is established using Del Pino and Felmer's penalization technique, with refinements inspired by Alves' arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence, non-existence, and multiplicity of positive solutions to a class of quasilinear Schrodinger equations with a prescribed mass condition in higher dimensions. Using the dual approach, the equation is transformed into a corresponding semilinear form. A global branch approach is employed to address nonlinearities that may be mass subcritical, critical, or supercritical. This study further examines the asymptotic behavior of positive solutions as the parameter approaches zero or infinity and identifies a continuum of unbounded solutions within the functional space under consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the existence, non-existence, and uniqueness results for nonlocal elliptic equations involving logarithmic Laplacian, and subcritical, critical, and supercritical logarithmic nonlinearities. The Poho\u zaev's identity and D\'iaz-Saa type inequality are proved, which are of independent interest and can be applied to a larger class of problems. Depending upon the growth of nonlinearities and regularity of the weight function, we study the small-order asymptotic of nonlocal weighted elliptic equations involving the fractional Laplacian of order $2s.$ We show that the least energy solutions of a weighted nonlocal problem with superlinear or sublinear growth converge to a nontrivial nonnegative least-energy solution of Br\'ezis-Nirenberg type and logistic-type limiting problem respectively involving the logarithmic Laplacian.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study a large class of nonlinear stochastic wave equations that arise in laser generation models and models for propagation in random media in a unified mathematical framework. Continuous and pulse-wave propagation models, free electron laser generation models, as well as laser-plasma interaction models have been cast in a convenient and unified abstract framework as semilinear evolution equations in a Hilbert space to enable stochastic analysis. We formulate Ito calculus and white noise calculus methods of treating stochastic terms and prove existence and uniqueness of mild solutions.</description>

      <title>Pointwise dispersive estimates for Schrodinger and wave equations in a conical singular space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the pointwise decay estimates for the Schr\"odinger and wave equations on a product cone $(X,g)$, where the metric $g=dr^2+r^2 h$ and $X=C(Y)=(0,\infty)\times Y$ is a product cone over the closed Riemannian manifold $(Y,h)$ with metric $h$. Under the assumption that the conjugate radius $\epsilon$ of $Y$ satisfies $\epsilon&gt;\pi$, we prove the pointwise dispersive estimates for the Schr\"odinger and half-wave propagator in this setting. The key ingredient is the modified Hadamard parametrix on $Y$ in which the role of the conjugate points does not come to play if $\epsilon&gt;\pi$. In a work in progress, we will further study the case that $\epsilon\leq\pi$ in which the role of conjugate points come. A new finding is that a threshold of the {conjugate radius} of $Y$ for $L^p$-estimates in this setting is the magical number $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Fine structure of rupture set for semilinear elliptic equation with singular nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stationary solutions of semilinear elliptic equation with singular nonlinearity $$ \Delta u=u^{-p}+f,\,\,u\geq 0\text{ in }\Omega\subset\R^n, $$ where $ n\geq 2 $, $ p&gt;1 $, $ \Omega $ is a bounded domain, and $ f\in L^q(\Omega) $ with $ \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2p}&lt;\frac{q}{n} $. We establish a sharp estimate for the Minkowski content of the rupture set $ \{u=0\} $ and demonstrate that this set is $ (n-2) $-rectifiable. For this, we examine the stratification of the rupture set based on the symmetry properties of tangent functions, leading to the proof of $ k $-rectifiability for each $ k $-stratum. As a significant byproduct of our analysis, we improve the integrability of $ D^ju $ with $ j\in\mathbb{Z}_+ $ to the optimal Lorentz space $ L^{\frac{2(p+1)}{j(p+1)-2},\infty} $, under the assumption that $ D^{j-1}f $ is bounded. As an application of our results in the static case of the equation, for a class of suitable weak solutions to the three-dimensional evolutional problem $$ \partial_tu=\Delta u-u^{-p},\,\,u\geq 0\text{ in }(\Omega\subset\R^3)\times(0,T), $$ where $ p&gt;3 $ and $ T&gt;0 $, we show that $ \{u(\cdot,t)=0\} $ is $ 1 $-rectifiable for a.e. $ t\in(0,T) $.</description>

Abstract: In this article we consider the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, with time-dependent potential, in space dimensions $n=1, 2$ and $3$, with nonlinearity $|u|^{p-1} u$, $p$ an odd integer, satisfying $p \geq 5$ in dimension $1$, $p \geq 3$ in dimension $2$ and $p=3$ in dimension $3$. We also allow a metric perturbation, assumed to be compactly supported in spacetime, and nontrapping. We work with module regularity spaces, which are defined by regularity of order $k \geq 2$ under the action of certain vector fields generating symmetries of the free Schr\"odinger equation. We solve the large data final state problem, with final state in a module regularity space, and show convergence of the solution to the final state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a quasilinear elliptic and critical problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions in presence of the anisotropic $p$-Laplacian. The critical exponent is the usual $p^{\star}$ such that the embedding $W^{1,p}_{0}(\Omega) \subset L^{p^{\star}}(\Omega)$ is not compact. We prove the existence of a weak positive solution in presence of both a $p$-linear and a $p$-superlinear perturbation. In doing this, we have to perform several precise estimates of the anisotropic Aubin-Talenti functions which can be of interest for further problems. The results we prove are a natural generalization to the anisotropic setting of the classical ones by Brezis-Nirenberg \cite{BN}.</description>

      <title>Stress concentration between two adjacent rigid particles in Navier-Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the stress concentration problem that occurs when two convex rigid particles are closely immersed in a fluid flow. The governing equations for the fluid flow are the stationary incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We establish precise upper bounds for the gradients and second-order derivatives of the fluid velocity as the distance between particles approaches zero, in dimensions two and three. The optimality of these blow-up rates of the gradients is demonstrated by deriving corresponding lower bounds. New difficulties arising from the nonlinear term in the Navier-Stokes equations is overcome. Consequently, the blow up rates of the Cauchy stress are studied as well.</description>

      <title>The role of the dimension in uniqueness results for the stationary quasi-geostrophic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a Liouville-type theorem for the stationary fractional quasi-geostrophic equation in various dimensions. Indeed, our analysis focuses on dimensions n = 2, 3, 4 and we explore the uniqueness of weak solutions for this fractional system. We demonstrate here that, under some specific Lebesgue integrability information, the only admissible solution to the stationary fractional quasi-geostrophic system is the trivial one and this result provides a comprehensive understanding of how the dimension in connection to the fractional power of the Laplacian influences the uniqueness properties of weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of L\'evy Fokker--Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hermite polynomials, which are associated to a Gaussian weight and solve the Laplace equation with a drift term of linear growth, are classical in analysis and well-understood via ODE techniques. Our main contribution is to give explicit Euclidean formulae of the fractional analogue of Hermite polynomials, which appear as eigenfunctions of a L\'evy Fokker-Planck equation. We will restrict, without loss of generality, to radially symmetric functions.
  A crucial tool in our analysis is the Mellin transform, which is essentially the Fourier transform in logarithmic variable and which turns weighted derivatives into multipliers. This allows to write the weighted space in the fractional case that replaces the usual $L_r^2(\mathbb R^n, e^{|x|^2/4})$.
  After proving compactness, we obtain a exhaustive description of the spectrum of the L\'evy Fokker--Planck equation and its dual, the fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck problem, which forms a basis thanks to the spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators. As a corollary, we obtain a full asymptotic expansion for solutions of the fractional heat equation.</description>

      <title>Bifurcating solitonic vortices in a strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The specific geometry of a strip provides connections between solitons and solitonic vortices, which are vortices with a solitonic behaviour in the infinite direction of the strip. We show that there exist stationary solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with k vortices on a transverse line, which bifurcate from the soliton solution as the width of the strip is increased. After decomposing into Fourier series with respect to the transverse variable, the construction of these solitonic vortices is achieved by relying on a careful analysis of the linearized operator around the soliton solution: we apply a fixed point argument to solve the equation in the directions orthogonal to the kernel of the linearized operator, and then handle the direction corresponding to the kernel by an inverse function theorem.</description>

      <title>On an eigenvalue problem associated with mixed operators under mixed boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of eigenvalue problems involving both local as well as nonlocal operators, precisely the classical Laplace operator and the fractional Laplace operator in the presence of mixed boundary conditions, that is
  \begin{equation} \label{1}
  \left\{\begin{split} \mathcal{L}u\: &amp;= \lambda u,~~u&gt;0~ \text{in} ~\Omega,
  u&amp;=0~~\text{in} ~~{U^c},
  \mathcal{N}_s(u)&amp;=0 ~~\text{in} ~~{\mathcal{N}},
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}&amp;=0 ~~\text{in}~~ \partial \Omega \cap \overline{\mathcal{N}},
  \end{split} \right.\tag{$P_\lambda$} \end{equation}
  where $U= (\Omega \cup {\mathcal{N}} \cup (\partial\Omega\cap\overline{\mathcal{N}}))$, $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is a non empty open set, $\mathcal{D}$, $\mathcal{N}$ are open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus{\bar{\Omega }}$ such that $\overline{{\mathcal{D}} \cup {\mathcal{N}}}= \mathbb{R}^n\setminus{\Omega}$, $\mathcal{D} \cap {\mathcal{N}}= \emptyset $ and $\Omega\cup \mathcal{N}$ is a bounded set with smooth boundary, $\lambda &gt;0$ is a real parameter and
  $$\mathcal{L}= -\Delta+(-\Delta)^{s},~ \text{for}~s \in (0, 1).$$ We establish the existence and some characteristics of the first eigenvalue and associated eigenfunctions to the above problem, based on the topology of the sets $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{N}$. Next, we apply these results to establish bifurcation type results, both
  from zero and infinity for the problem \eqref{ql} which is an asymptotically linear problem inclined with $(P_\lambda)$.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for the dynamic fractional $\Phi^4$ model on $\mathbb{T}^3$ in the full subcritical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a priori bounds for the dynamic fractional $\Phi^4$ model on $\mathbb{T}^3$ in the full subcritical regime using the framework of Hairer's regularity structures theory. Assuming the model bounds our estimates imply global existence of solutions and existence of an invariant measure. We extend the method developed for the usual heat operator by Chandra, Moinat and Weber [CMW23] to the fractional heat operator, thereby treating a more physically relevant model. A key ingredient in this work is the development of localised multilevel Schauder estimates for the fractional heat operator which is not covered by Hairer's original work. Furthermore, the algebraic arguments from [CMW23] are streamlined significantly.</description>

      <title>The nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the initial-boundary value problem for both the linear Schr\"odinger equation and the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the half-space in higher dimensions ($n\ge 2$). First, the forced linear problem is solved on the half-space via the Fokas method and then using the obtained solution formula new and interesting linear estimates are derived with data and forcing in appropriate spaces. Second, the well-posedness of the nonlinear problem on the half-space is proved with initial data in Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{R}^n_+)$, with $s&gt;\frac{n}{2}-1$, and boundary data in natural Bourgain spaces $\mathcal{B}^s$ that reflect the boundary regularity of the linear problem. The proof method consists of showing that the iteration map defined via the Fokas solution formula is a contraction by establishing sharper trilinear estimates. The presence of the boundary introduces solution spaces that involve temporal Bourgain spaces.</description>

      <title>Systems of Wave Equations on Asymptotically de Sitter Vacuum Spacetimes in All Even Spatial Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second paper of a two part work that establishes a definitive quantitative nonlinear scattering theory for asymptotically de Sitter vacuum solutions $(M,g)$ in $(n+1)$ dimensions with $n\geq4$ even, which are determined by small scattering data at $\mathscr{I}^{\pm}.$ In this paper we prove quantitative estimates for systems of wave equations on the $(M,g)$ backgrounds. The systems considered include the Einstein vacuum equations commuted with suitable time-dependent vector fields, where we treat the nonlinear terms as general inhomogeneous factors. The estimates obtained are essential in establishing sharp top order estimates for the scattering map of the Einstein vacuum equations, taking asymptotic data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ to asymptotic data at $\mathscr{I}^+$.</description>

Abstract: The paper contains a review of results on linear systems of ordinary differential equations of an arbitrary order on a finite interval with the most general inhomogeneous boundary conditions in Sobolev spaces. The character of the solvability of such problems is investigated, their Fredholm properties are established, and their indexes and the dimensions of their kernels and co-kernels are found. In addition, necessary and sufficient conditions of continuity in the parameter of the solutions of the introduced classes of boundary-value problems in Sobolev spaces of an arbitrary order are obtained.</description>

      <title>Approximate peak time to time-domain fluorescence diffuse optical tomography for nonzero fluorescence lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns an inverse problem for fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FDOT) reconstructing locations of multiple point targets from the measured temporal response functions. The targets are multiple fluorescent point objects with a nonzero fluorescence lifetime at unknown locations. Peak time, when the temporal response function of the fluorescence reaches its maximum, is a robust parameter of the temporal response function in FDOT because it is most less suffered by the artifacts, such as noise, and is easily determined by experiments. We derive an approximate peak time equation based on asymptotic analysis in an explicit way in the case of nonzero fluorescence lifetime when there are single and multiple point targets. The performance of the approximation is numerically verified. Then, we develop a bisection algorithm to reconstruct the location of a single point target from the algorithm proposed in [4] for the case of zero fluorescence lifetime. Moreover, we propose a boundary-scan algorithm for the reconstruction of locations of multiple point targets. Finally, several numerical experiments are implemented to show the efficiency and robustness of the addressed algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We study the convergence of two of the most widely used and intuitive approaches for computing the spectra of differential operators with quasiperiodic coefficients: the supercell method and the superspace method. In both cases, Floquet-Bloch theory for periodic operators can be used to compute approximations to the spectrum. We illustrate our results with examples of Schr\"odinger and Helmholtz operators.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we conduct a parameter error analysis for the 3D modified Leray-$\alpha$ model using both analytical and numerical approaches. We first prove the global well-posedness and continuous dependence of initial data for the assimilated system. Furthermore, given sufficient conditions on the physical parameters and norms of the true solution, we demonstrate that the true solution can be recovered from the approximation solution, with an error determined by the discrepancy between the true and approximating parameters. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the convergence criteria.</description>

Abstract: We study the global existence, uniqueness and exponential stability of mild solutions to the Boussinesq systems equipped with a generalized gravitational field on the framework of non-compact Riemannian manifolds. We work on some manifolds satisfying some bounded and negative conditions on curvature tensors. We consider a couple of Stokes and heat semigroups associated with the corresponding linear system which provides a vectorial matrix semigoup. By using dispersive and smoothing estimates of the vectorial matrix semigroup we establish the global-in-time existence and uniqueness of mild solutions for linear systems. Next, we can pass from the linear system to the semilinear systems to obtain the well-posedness by using fixed point arguments. Moreover, we will prove the exponential stability of such solutions by using Gronwall's inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the patch problem for the $\alpha$-SQG system with the values $\alpha=0$ and $\alpha= \frac{1}{2}$ being the 2D Euler and the SQG equations respectively. It is well-known that the Euler patches are globally wellposed in non-endpoint $C^{k,\beta}$ H\"older spaces, as well as in $W^{2,p},$ $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ spaces. In stark contrast to the Euler case, we prove that for $0&lt;\alpha&lt; \frac{1}{2}$, the $\alpha$-SQG patch problem is strongly illposed in \emph{every} $C^{2,\beta} $ H\"older space with $\beta&lt;1$. Moreover, in a suitable range of regularity, the same strong illposedness holds for \emph{every} $W^{2,p}$ Sobolev space unless $p=2$.</description>

As a consequence, we enhance the well-posedness level of the periodic quintic Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation to $s &gt; \frac{131}{624}\sim 0.21$, which is an improvement on the results of De Silva, Pavlovi\'c, Staffilani, &amp; Tzirakis, Li, Wu, &amp; Xu, and Schippa. We also present conditional results, dependent on improvements on the count of lattice points in thin annuli.</description>

      <title>Sign-changing bubbling solutions for an exponential nonlinearity in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quite differently from those perturbation techniques in \cite{DM}, we use the assumption of a $C^1$-stable critical point to construct positive or sign-changing bubbling solutions to the boundary value problem $-\Delta u=\lambda u|u|^{p-2}e^{|u|^p}$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition in a bounded, smooth planar domain $\Omega$, when $0&lt;p&lt;2$ and $\lambda&gt;0$ is a small parameter. A sufficient condition on the intersection between the nodal line of these sign-changing solutions and the boundary of the domain is founded. Moreover, for $\lambda$ small enough, we prove that when $\Omega$ is an arbitrary bounded domain, this problem has not only at least two pairs of bubbling solutions which change sign exactly once and whose nodal lines intersect the boundary, but also a bubbling solution which changes sign exactly twice or three times; when $\Omega$ has an axial symmetry, this problem has a bubbling solution which alternately changes sign arbitrarily many times along the axis of symmetry through the domain.</description>

      <title>Blow-Up Dynamics for the $L^2$ critical case of the $2$D Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the blow-up dynamics for the $L^2$ critical two-dimensional Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} \partial_t u+\partial_{x_1} (\Delta u+u^3)=0, \mbox{ } x=(x_1,x_2)\in \mathbb{R}^2, \mbox{ } t \in \mathbb{R}\\ u(0,x_1,x_2)=u_0(x_1,x_2)\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^2), \end{cases} \end{equation*} with initial data $u_0$ slightly exceeding the mass of the ground state $Q$. Employing methodologies analogous to the Martel-Merle-Raphael blow-up theory for $L^2$ critical equations, more precisely for the critical NLS equation and the quintic generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation, we categorize the solution behaviors into three outcomes: asymptotic stability, finite-time blow-up, or divergence from the soliton's vicinity. The construction of the blow-up solution involves the bubbling of the solitary wave which ensures the universal behavior and stability of the blow-up.</description>

      <title>$L_p$-estimates for parabolic equations in divergence form with a half-time derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the unique solvability of solutions in Sobolev spaces to linear parabolic equations in a more general form than those in the literature. A distinguishing feature of our equations is the inclusion of a half-order time derivative term on their right-hand side. We anticipate that such equations will prove useful in various problems involving time evolution terms. Notably, the coefficients of the equations exhibit significant irregularity, being merely measurable with respect to the temporal variable or one spatial variable.</description>

      <title>Sharp $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ estimates for fully non-linear elliptic equations on compact complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the sharp $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ estimates for fully non-linear elliptic equations on compact complex manifolds. For the case of K\"ahler manifolds, we prove that the oscillation of any admissible solution to a degenerate fully non-linear elliptic equation satisfying several structural conditions can be controlled by the $\mathrm{L}^1(\log\mathrm{L})^n(\log\log\mathrm{L})^r(r&gt;n)$ norm of the right-hand function (in a regularized form). This result improves that of Guo-Phong-Tong. In addition to their method of comparison with auxiliary complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations, our proof relies on an inequality of H\"older-Young type and an iteration lemma of De Giorgi type. For the case of Hermitian manifolds with non-degenerate background metrics, we prove a similar $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ estimate which improves that of Guo-Phong. An explicit example is constucted to show that the $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ estimates given here may fail when $r\leqslant n-1$. The construction relies on a gluing lemma of smooth, radial, strictly plurisubharmonic functions.</description>

      <title>Global existence and asymptotic behavior for diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi equations with Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi equation $$u_t-\Lap u = |\nabla u|^p$$ with $p&gt;1$, in a smooth bounded domain of $\RN$ with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and $W^{1,\infty}$ initial data. We show that all solutions exist globally, are bounded and converge in $W^{1,\infty}$ norm to a constant as $t\to\infty$, with a uniform exponential rate of convergence given by the second Neumann eigenvalue. This improves previously known results, which provided only an upper polynomial bound on the rate of convergence and required the convexity of the domain. Furthermore, we extend these results to a rather large class of nonlinearities $F(\nabla u)$ instead of~$|\nabla u|^p$.</description>

      <title>Spectral estimates on hyperbolic surfaces and a necessary condition for observability of the heat semigroup on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is a continuation of arXiv:2401.14977. We study the concentration properties of spectral projectors on manifolds, in connection with the uncertainty principle. In arXiv:2401.14977, the second author proved an optimal uncertainty principle for the spectral projector of the Laplacian on the hyperbolic half-plane. The aim of the present work is to generalize this condition to surfaces with hyperbolic ends. In particular, we tackle the case of cusps, in which the volume of balls of fixed radius is not bounded from below. We establish that spectral estimates hold from sets satisfying a thickness condition, with a proof based on propagation of smallness estimates of Carleman and Logunov--Malinnikova type. We also prove the converse, namely the necessary character of the thickness condition, on any smooth manifold with Ricci curvature bounded from below.</description>

Abstract: We are concerned with the mixed local/nonlocal Schr\"{o}dinger equation
  \begin{equation}
  - \Delta u + (-\Delta)^s u+u = u^{p+1} \quad \hbox{in $\mathbb{R}^n$,}
  \end{equation}
  for arbitrary space dimension $n\geqslant1$, $s\in(0,1)$, and $p\in(0,2^*-2)$ with $2^*$ the critical Sobolev exponent.
  We provide the existence and several fundamental properties of nonnegative solutions for the above equation. And then, we prove that, if $s$ is close to $0$ and $1$, respectively, such equation then possesses a unique (up to translations) ground state, which is nondegenerate.</description>

Abstract: Here we give a survey of consequences from the theory of the Beltrami equations in the complex plane $\mathbb C$ to generalized Cauchy-Riemann equations $\nabla v = B \nabla u$ in the real plane $\mathbb R^2$ and clarify the relationships of the latter to the $A-$harmonic equation ${\rm div} A\,{\rm grad}\, u = 0$ with matrix valued coefficients $A$ that is one of the main equations of the potential theory, namely, of the hydro\-mechanics (fluid mechanics) in anisotropic and inhomogeneous media. The survey includes various types of results as theorems on existence, representation and regularity of their solutions, in particular, for the main boundary value problems of Hilbert, Dirichlet, Neumann, Poincare and Riemann.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional Burgers' equation linearized at a stationary shock, and investigate its null-controllability cost with a control at the left endpoint. We give an upper and a lower bound on the control time required for this cost to remain bounded in the vanishing viscosity limit, as well as a rough description of an admissible control. The proof relies on complex analysis and adapts methods previously used to tackle the same issue with a constant transport term.</description>

      <title>Bilinear optimal control for a fractional diffusive equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a bilinear optimal control for an evolution equation involving the fractional Laplace operator of order $0&lt;s&lt;1$. We first give some existence and uniqueness results for the considered evolution equation. Next, we establish some weak maximum principle results allowing us to obtain more regularity of our state equation. Then, we consider an optimal control problem which consists to bring the state of the system at final time to a desired state. We show that this optimal control problem has a solution and we derive the first and second order optimality conditions. Finally, under additional assumptions on the initial datum and the given target, we prove that local uniqueness of optimal solutions can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Decay and non-decay for the massless Vlasov equation on subextremal and extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the massless Vlasov equation on the exterior of the subextremal and extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetimes. We prove that moments decay at an exponential rate in the subextremal case and at a polynomial rate in the extremal case. This polynomial rate is shown to be sharp along the event horizon. In the extremal case we show that transversal derivatives of certain components of the energy momentum tensor do not decay along the event horizon if the solution and its first time derivative are initially supported on a neighbourhood of the event horizon. The non-decay of transversal derivatives in the extremal case is compared to the work of Aretakis on instability for the wave equation. Unlike Aretakis' results for the wave equation, which exploit a hierarchy of conservation laws, our proof is based entirely on a quantitative analysis of the geodesic flow and conservation laws do not feature in the present work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the construction of a theory of distributions (generalized functions) with a ``thick submanifold'', that is, a new theory of thick distributions on $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose domain contains a smooth submanifold on which the test functions may be singular. We define several operations, including ``thick partial derivatives'', and clarify their connection with their classical counterparts in Schwartz distribution theory. We also introduce and study a number of special thick distributions, including new thick delta functions, or more generally thick multilayer distributions along a submanifold.</description>
