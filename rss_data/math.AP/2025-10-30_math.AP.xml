      <title>Solutions to Second-Order Nonlocal Evolution Equations Governed by Non-Autonomous Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main contributions include proving sufficient conditions for the existence of solution to a second order problem with nonzero nonlocal initial conditions, and providing a comprehensive analysis using fundamental solutions and fixed-point techniques. The theoretical results are illustrated through applications to partial differential equations, including vibrating viscoelastic membranes with time-dependent material properties and nonlocal memory effects.</description>

      <title>Bochner-Riesz means on a conical singular manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sharp $L^p$-boundedness criterion for Bochner-Riesz multipliers on flat cones $X = (0,\infty) \times \mathbb{S}_\sigma^1$. The operator $S_\lambda^\delta(\Delta_X)$ is bounded on $L^p(X)$ for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, $p \neq 2$, if and only if $\delta &gt; \delta_c(p,2) = \max\left\{ 0, 2\left| 1/2 - 1/p \right| - 1/2 \right\}$. This result is also applicable to the infinite sector domain with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary, resolving the critical exponent problem in this wedge setting.</description>

      <title>A one-dimensional Stefan problem for the heat equation with a nonlinear boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional one-phase Stefan problem for the heat equation with a nonlinear boundary condition. We show that all solutions fall into one of three distinct types: global-in-time solutions with exponential decay, global-in-time solutions with non-exponential decay, and finite-time blow-up solutions. The classification depends on the size of the initial function. Furthermore, we describe the behavior of solutions at the blow-up time.</description>

      <title>Time-periodic boundary effects on the shocks for scalar conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the asymptotic stabilities of the inviscid and viscous shocks for the scalar conservation laws on the half-line $(-\infty,0)$ with shock speed $s&lt;0$, subjected to the time-periodic boundary condition, which arises from the classical piston problems for fluid mechanics. Despite the importance, how time-periodic boundary conditions affect the long-time behaviors of Riemann solutions has remained unclear. This work addresses this gap by rigorously proving that in both inviscid and viscous case, the asymptotic states of the solutions under the time-periodic boundary conditions are not only governed by the shifted background (viscous) shocks, but also coupled with the time-periodic boundary solution induced by the time-periodic boundary. Our analysis reveals that these effects manifest as a propagating "boundary wave", which influences the shock dynamics.</description>

      <title>Sharp embeddings and existence results for Logarithmic $p$-Laplacian equations with critical growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a new $p$-Logarithmic Sobolev inequality and optimal continuous and compact embeddings into Orlicz-type spaces of the function space associated with the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian. As an application of these results, we study a class of Dirichlet boundary value problems involving the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian and critical growth nonlinearities perturbed with superlinear-subcritical growth terms. By employing the method of the Nehari manifold, we prove the existence of a nontrivial weak solution.
  Lastly, we conduct an asymptotic analysis of a weighted nonlocal, nonlinear problem governed by the fractional $p$-Laplacian with superlinear or sublinear type non-linearity, demonstrating the convergence of least energy solutions to a non-trivial, non-negative least energy solution of a Brezis-Nirenberg type or logistic-type problem, respectively, involving the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian as the fractional parameter $s \to 0^+$.
  The findings in this work serve as a nonlinear analogue of the results reported in \cite{Angeles-Saldana, Arora-Giacomoni-Vaishnavi, Santamaria-Saldana}, thereby extending their scope to a broader variational framework.</description>

      <title>Coupling local and nonlocal total variation flow for image despeckling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal equations effectively preserve textures but exhibit weak regularization effects in image denoising, whereas local equations offer strong denoising capabilities yet fail to protect textures. To integrate the advantages of both approaches, this paper investigates a coupled local-nonlocal total variation flow for image despeckling. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution for the proposed equation. Several properties, including the equivalent forms of the weak solution and its asymptotic behavior, are derived. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the weak solutions of the proposed equation converge to the weak solution of the classical total variation flow under kernel rescaling. The importance of coupling is highlighted through comparisons with local and nonlocal models for image despeckling.</description>

      <title>Complete spectrum of the Robin eigenvalue problem on the ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the following Robin eigenvalue problem \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} -\Delta u=\mu u\,\, &amp;\text{in}\,\, B,\\ \partial_\texttt{n} u+\alpha u=0 &amp;\text{on}\,\, \partial B \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} on the unit ball of $\mathbb{R}^N$. We obtain the complete spectral structure of this problem. In particular, for $\alpha&gt;0$, we find that the first eigenvalue is $k_{\nu,1}^2$ and the second eigenvalue is exactly $k_{\nu+1,1}^2$, where $k_{\nu+l,m}$ is the $m$th positive zero of $kJ_{\nu+l+1}(k)-(\alpha+l) J_{\nu+l}(k)$. Moreover, when $\alpha\in(-1,0)$, the first eigenvalue is $-\widehat{k}_{\nu,1}^2$ where $\widehat{k}_{\nu,1}$ denotes the unique zero of $\alpha I_{\nu}(k)+kI_{\nu+1}(k)$, and the second eigenvalue is exactly $k_{\nu+1,1}^2$. Furthermore, for $\alpha=-1$, the first eigenvalue is $-\widehat{k}_{\nu,1}^2$ and the second eigenvalue is exactly $0$. Our conclusions indicate the ratio $\mu_2/\mu_1$ may be positive, negative or zero according to the suitable ranges of the parameter $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Tangential approach in the Dirichlet problem for elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that solvability of the $\mathrm{L}^{p}$-Dirichlet problem for elliptic equations $Lu:=-\mathrm{div}(A\nabla u)=0$ with real-valued, bounded and measurable coefficients $A$ on Lipschitz domains $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{1+n}$ is characterised by a quantitative absolute continuity of the associated $L$-harmonic measure. We prove that this local $A_{\infty}$ property is sufficient to guarantee that the nontangential convergence afforded to $\mathrm{L}^{p}$ boundary data actually improves to a certain \emph{tangential} convergence when the data has additional (Sobolev) regularity. Moreover, we obtain sharp estimates on the Hausdorff dimension of the set on which such convergence can fail. This extends results obtained by Dorronsoro, Nagel, Rudin, Shapiro and Stein for classical harmonic functions in the upper half-space.</description>

      <title>Improved Gevrey Class Regularity of the Kadomtsev Petviashvili Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we improve and extend the results obtained by Boukarou et al. \cite{boukarou1} on the Gevrey regularity of solutions to a fifth-order Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP)-type equation. We establish Gevrey regularity in the time variable for solutions in $2+1$ dimensions, providing a sharper result obtained through a new analytical approach. Assuming that the initial data are Gevrey regular of order $\sigma \geq 1$ in the spatial variables, we prove that the corresponding solution is Gevrey regular of order $5 \sigma$ in time. Moreover, we show that the function $u(x, y, t)$, viewed as a function of $t$, does not belong to $G^z$ for any $1 \leq z&lt;5 \sigma$. The proof simultaneously treats all three variables $x, y$, and $t$, and employs the method of majorant series, precisely tracking the influence of the higher-order dispersive term $\partial_x^5 u$ together with the lower-order terms $\alpha \partial_x^3 u, \partial_x^{-1} \partial_y^2 u$, and $u \partial_x u$.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flow Sampler-based Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mathematically principled PDE gradient flow framework for distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Exploiting the recent advances in the intersection of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and gradient flow theory, we show that our theoretical framework can be implemented as practical algorithms for sampling from worst-case distributions and, consequently, DRO. While numerous previous works have proposed various reformulation techniques and iterative algorithms, we contribute a sound gradient flow view of the distributional optimization that can be used to construct new algorithms. As an example of applications, we solve a class of Wasserstein and Sinkhorn DRO problems using the recently-discovered Wasserstein Fisher-Rao and Stein variational gradient flows. Notably, we also show some simple reductions of our framework recover exactly previously proposed popular DRO methods, and provide new insights into their theoretical limit and optimization dynamics. Numerical studies based on stochastic gradient descent provide empirical backing for our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A game-theoretic approach to the parabolic normalized p-Laplacian obstacle problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a probabilistic representation for the solution of the parabolic obstacle problem associated with the normalized $p$-Laplacian. We introduce a zero-sum stochastic tug-of-war game with noise in a space-time cylinder, where one player has the option to stop the game at any time to collect a payoff given by an obstacle function. We prove that the value functions of this game exist, satisfy a dynamic programming principle, and converge uniformly to the unique viscosity solution of the continuous obstacle problem as the step size $\varepsilon$ tends to zero.</description>

      <title>A parallel solver for random input problems via Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve expansion and diagonalized coarse grid correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to enhancing the computational efficiency of traditional parallel-in-time methods for solving stochastic initial-value problems. The standard parareal algorithm often suffers from slow convergence when applied to problems with stochastic inputs, primarily due to the poor quality of the initial guess. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid parallel algorithm, termed KLE-CGC, which integrates the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve (KL) expansion with the coarse grid correction (CGC). The method first employs the KL expansion to achieve a low-dimensional parameterization of high-dimensional stochastic parameter fields. Subsequently, a generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) spectral surrogate model is constructed to enable rapid prediction of the solution field. Utilizing this prediction as the initial value significantly improves the initial accuracy for the parareal iterations. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided, establishing that the proposed framework retains the same theoretical convergence rate as the standard parareal algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that KLE-CGC maintains the same convergence order as the original algorithm while substantially reducing the number of iterations and improving parallel scalability.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the magnetic Ginzburg-Landau equation via vortex tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the numerical simulation of the 2D magnetic time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations in the regime of small but finite (inverse) Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\epsilon$ and constant (order $1$ in $\epsilon$) applied magnetic field. In this regime, a well-known feature of the TDGL equation is the appearance of quantized vortices with core size of order $\epsilon$. Moreover, in the singular limit $\epsilon \searrow 0$, these vortices evolve according to an explicit ODE system. In this work, we first introduce a new numerical method for the numerical integration of this limiting ODE system, which requires to solve a linear second order PDE at each time step. We also provide a rigorous theoretical justification for this method that applies to a general class of 2D domains. We then develop and analyze a numerical strategy based on the finite-dimensional ODE system to efficiently simulate the infinite-dimensional TDGL equations in the presence of a constant external magnetic field and for small, but finite, $\epsilon$. This method allows us to avoid resolving the $\epsilon$-scale when solving the TDGL equations, where small values of $\epsilon$ typically require very fine meshes and time steps. We provide numerical examples on a few test cases and justify the accuracy of the method with numerical investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the minimization of integral functionals in one dimension and their approximation by $r$-adaptive finite elements. Including the grid of the FEM approximation as a variable in the minimization, we are able to show that the optimal grid configurations have a well-defined limit when the number of nodes in the grid is being sent to infinity. This is done by showing that the suitably renormalized energy functionals possess a limit in the sense of $\Gamma$-convergence. We provide numerical examples showing the closeness of the optimal asymptotic mesh obtained as a minimizer of the $\Gamma$-limit to the optimal finite meshes.</description>

      <title>On a semi-discrete model of Maxwell's equations in three and two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a geometric, structure-preserving semi-discrete formulation of Maxwell's equations in both three- and two-dimensional settings within the framework of discrete exterior calculus. This approach preserves the intrinsic geometric and topological structures of the continuous theory while providing a consistent spatial discretization. We analyze the essential properties of the proposed semi-discrete model and compare them with those of the classical Maxwell's equations. As a special case, the model is illustrated on a combinatorial two-dimensional torus, where the semi-discrete Maxwell's equations take the form of a system of first-order linear ordinary differential equations. An explicit expression for the general solution of this system is also derived.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Lorentzian isoperimetric inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish optimal stability estimates in terms of the Fraenkel asymmetry with universal dimensional constants for a Lorentzian isoperimetric inequality due to Bahn and Ehrlich and, as a consequence, for a special version of a Lorentzian isoperimetric inequality due to Cavalletti and Mondino. For the Bahn--Ehrlich inequality the Fraenkel asymmetry enters the stability result quadratically like in the Euclidean case while for the Cavalletti--Mondino inequality the Fraenkel asymmetry enters linearly. As it turns out, refining the latter inequality through an additional geometric term allows us to recover the more common quadratic stability behavior. Along the way, we provide simple self-contained proofs for the above isoperimetric-type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Quantization property of n-Laplacian mean field equation and sharp Moser-Onofri inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the following $n$-Laplacian mean field equation \[ \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} { - \Delta_n u = \lambda e^u} &amp; {\rm in} \ \ \Omega, \\ {\ \ \ \ u = 0} &amp;\ {\rm on}\ \partial \Omega, \end{array}} \right. \] \[\] where $\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^n \ (n\geq 2)$ and $- \Delta_n u =-{\rm div}(|\nabla u|^{n-2}\nabla u)$. We first establish the quantization property of solutions to the above $n$-Laplacian mean field equation. As an application, combining the Pohozaev identity and the capacity estimate, we obtain the sharp constant $C(n)$ of the Moser-Onofri inequality in the $n$-dimensional unit ball $B^n:=B^n(0,1)$, $$\mathop {\inf }\limits_{u \in W_0^{1,n}(B^n)}\frac{1}{ n C_n}\int_{B^n} | \nabla u|^n dx- \ln \int_{B^n} {e^u} dx\geq C(n),$$ which extends the result of Caglioti-Lions-Marchioro-Pulvirenti in \cite{Caglioti} to the case of $n$-dimensional ball. Here $C_n=(\frac{n^2}{n-1})^{n-1} \omega_{n-1}$ and $\omega_{n-1}$ is the surface measure of $B^n$. For the Moser-Onofri inequality in a general bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we apply the technique of $n$-harmonic transplantation to give the optimal concentration level of the Moser-Onofri inequality and obtain the criterion for the existence and non-existence of extremals for the Moser-Onofri inequality.</description>

      <title>Long-time Confinement near Special Vortex Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we control the growth of the support of particular solutions to the Euler two-dimensional equations, whose vorticity is concentrated near special vortex crystals. These vortex crystals belong to the classical family of regular polygons with a central vortex, where we choose a particular intensity for the central vortex to have strong stability properties. A special case is the regular pentagon with no central vortex which also satisfies the stability properties required for the long-time confinement to work.</description>

      <title>Degenerate singular Kirchhoff problems in Musielak-Orlicz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study quasilinear elliptic Kirchhoff equations driven by a non-homogeneous operator with unbalanced growth and right-hand sides that consist of sub-linear, possibly singular, and super-linear reaction terms. Under very general assumptions we prove the existence of at least two solutions for such problems by using the fibering method along with an appropriate splitting of the associated Nehari manifold. In contrast to other works our treatment is very general, with much easier and shorter proofs as it was done in the literature before. Furthermore, the results presented in this paper cover a large class of second-order differential operators like the $p$-Laplacian, the $(p,q)$-Laplacian, the double phase operator, and the logarithmic double phase operator.</description>

      <title>On action rate admissibility criteria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03491v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate new admissibility criteria for initial value problems motivated by the least action principle. These are applied to a two-dimensional Riemann initial value problem for the isentropic compressible Euler fluid flow. It is shown that the criterion prefers the 2-shock solution to solutions obtained by convex integration by Chiodaroli and Kreml or to the hybrid solutions recently constructed by Markfelder and Pellhammer.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a second order, linear, fully decoupled, and unconditionally energy stable scheme for solving the Erickson-Leslie model. This approach integrates the pressure correction method with a scalar auxiliary variable technique. We rigorously demonstrate the unconditional energy stability of the proposed scheme.

      <title>Homogenization of elasto-plastic plate equations with vanishing hardening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of thin heterogeneous elastoplastic plates in the framework of linearized elastoplasticity, focusing on the regime where the plate thickness vanishes much faster than the characteristic scale of the material's periodic microstructure. In contrast to earlier analyzes that required restrictive geometric assumptions on admissible yield surfaces, our approach accommodates general relations between phases without imposing any specific ordering.
  The analysis proceeds in two main steps. First, we rigorously derive a heterogeneous plate model with both isotropic and kinematic hardening through a dimension reduction procedure based on evolutionary $\Gamma$-convergence. This result extends existing plate models for homogeneous materials to the heterogeneous setting and allows for general forms of hardening and dissipation potentials. In the second step, we perform two-scale homogenization while simultaneously letting the hardening tend to zero. This process yields an effective elasto-perfectly plastic plate model and, crucially, provides a characterization of the dissipation potential at the interfaces between different phases. The resulting dissipation functional takes the form of a non-local inf-convolution of the traces of plastic strains on both sides of the interface, reflecting the Kirchhoff-Love structure of admissible displacements.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions and incompressible limit of two-dimensional isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations with ripped density and large initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the global existence of weak solutions of the isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations with ripped density in the whole plane provided the bulk viscosity coefficient is properly large. Moreover, we show that such solutions converge globally in time to a weak solution of the inhomogeneous incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations when the bulk viscosity coefficient tends to infinity. In particular, the initial energy can be arbitrarily large and vacuum states are allowed in interior regions. Our analysis depends on the effective viscous flux and a Desjardins-type logarithmic interpolation inequality as well as structure of the system under consideration. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first incompressible limit of the isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations for the large bulk viscosity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Cauchy problem for the coupled generalized Korteweg-de Vries system driven by white noise. We prove local well-posedness for data in $ H^{s} \times H^{s},$ with $ s&gt;1/2$. The key ingredients that we used in this paper are multilinear estimates in Bourgain spaces, the It\^o formula and a fixed point argument. Our result improves the local well-posedness result of Gomes and Pastor \cite{gomes2021solitary}.</description>

      <title>On a parabolic curvature lower bound generalizing Ricci flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport plays a major role in the study of manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded below. Some results in this setting have been extended to super Ricci flows, revealing a unified approach to analysis on Ricci nonnegative manifolds and Ricci flows. However we observe that the monotonicity of Perelman's functionals ($\mathcal{F}$, $\mathcal{W}$, reduced volume), which hold true for Ricci flows and Ricci nonnegative manifolds, cannot be strictly generalized to super Ricci flows. In 2010 Buzano introduced a condition which still generalizes Ricci flows and Ricci nonnegative manifolds, and on which Perelman's monotonicities do hold. We provide characterizations of this condition using optimal transport and understand it heuristically as Ricci nonnegativity of the space-time. This interpretation is consistent with its equivalence to Ricci nonnegativity on Perelman's infinite dimensional manifold.
  More precisely, we prove that for smooth evolutions of Riemannian manifolds, this condition is equivalent to a Bochner inequality (resembling Perelman's Harnack inequality but for the forward heat flow), a gradient estimate for the heat flow, a Wasserstein contraction along the adjoint heat flow, the convexity of a modified entropy along Wasserstein geodesics, and an Evolutionary Variational Inequality (EVI). The optimal transport statements use Perelman's $L$ distance as cost, as first studied on Ricci flows by Topping and by Lott. We also consider dimensionally improved and weighted versions of these conditions. The dimensional Bochner inequality and all gradient estimates for the forward heat equation, along with the EVIs, appear to be new even for general Ricci flows, and are related to the Hamiltonian perspective on the $L$ distance. Most of our proofs do not use tensor calculus or Jacobi fields, suggesting the possibility of future extensions to more singular settings.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of oscillations for axisymmetric solar backgrounds with differential rotation and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19386v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>A Convolutional Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Network (C-HiDeNN) Framework for Non-linear Finite Element Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for the Convolutional Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Network (C-HiDeNN) tailored for nonlinear finite element analysis. Building upon the structured foundation of HiDeNN, C-HiDeNN introduces a convolution operator to enhance numerical approximation. A distinctive feature of C-HiDeNN is its higher-order accurate approximation achieved through an expanded set of parameters, such as the polynomial order 'p,' dilation parameter 'a,' patch size 's,' and nodal position 'X'. These parameters function as the functional equivalents of weights and biases within each C-HiDeNN patch. In addition, C-HiDeNN can be selectively applied to regions requiring high resolution to adaptively improve local prediction accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we provide numerical examples in the context of nonlinear finite element analysis. The results show that our approach achieves significantly higher accuracy than conventional Finite Element Method (FEM) while substantially reducing computational costs.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian heat flows on directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a semigroup framework for Laplacians on directed hypergraphs, extending the classical heat flow models on graphs and establishing hypergraphs as prototypical models for non-Markovian diffusion. We apply spectral surgery methods to derive eigenvalue bounds, thus describing large-time behaviour of the heat flow. Unlike on standard graphs, heat flows on directed hypergraphs may lose positivity and/or $\infty$-contractivity, yet can recover them eventually or asymptotically under specific combinatorial configurations: examples based on duals of oriented graph and realisations of the Fano plane illustrate these phenomena.
  Our approach combines combinatorial, order-theoretic and linear-algebraic methods.</description>
