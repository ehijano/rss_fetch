      <title>Forecasting Commodity Price Shocks Using Temporal and Semantic Fusion of Prices Signals and Agentic Generative AI Extracted Economic News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of commodity price spikes is vital for countries with limited economic buffers, where sudden increases can strain national budgets, disrupt import-reliant sectors, and undermine food and energy security. This paper introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that combines historical commodity price data with semantic signals derived from global economic news, using an agentic generative AI pipeline. The architecture integrates dual-stream Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms to fuse structured time-series inputs with semantically embedded, fact-checked news summaries collected from 1960 to 2023. The model is evaluated on a 64-year dataset comprising normalized commodity price series and temporally aligned news embeddings. Results show that the proposed approach achieves a mean AUC of 0.94 and an overall accuracy of 0.91 substantially outperforming traditional baselines such as logistic regression (AUC = 0.34), random forest (AUC = 0.57), and support vector machines (AUC = 0.47). Additional ablation studies reveal that the removal of attention or dimensionality reduction leads to moderate declines in performance, while eliminating the news component causes a steep drop in AUC to 0.46, underscoring the critical value of incorporating real-world context through unstructured text. These findings demonstrate that integrating agentic generative AI with deep learning can meaningfully improve early detection of commodity price shocks, offering a practical tool for economic planning and risk mitigation in volatile market environments while saving the very high costs of operating a full generative AI agents pipeline.</description>

      <title>Proactive Market Making and Liquidity Analysis for Everlasting Options in DeFi Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Everlasting options, a relatively new class of perpetual financial derivatives, have emerged to tackle the challenges of rolling contracts and liquidity fragmentation in decentralized finance markets. This paper offers an in-depth analysis of markets for everlasting options, modeled using a dynamic proactive market maker. We examine the behavior of funding fees and transaction costs across varying liquidity conditions. Using simulations and modeling, we demonstrate that liquidity providers can aim to achieve a net positive PnL by employing effective hedging strategies, even in challenging environments characterized by low liquidity and high transaction costs. Additionally, we provide insights into the incentives that drive liquidity providers to support the growth of everlasting option markets and highlight the significant benefits these instruments offer to traders as a reliable and efficient financial tool.</description>

      <title>Hedging with memory: shallow and deep learning with signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of path signatures in a machine learning context for hedging exotic derivatives under non-Markovian stochastic volatility models. In a deep learning setting, we use signatures as features in feedforward neural networks and show that they outperform LSTMs in most cases, with orders of magnitude less training compute. In a shallow learning setting, we compare two regression approaches: the first directly learns the hedging strategy from the expected signature of the price process; the second models the dynamics of volatility using a signature volatility model, calibrated on the expected signature of the volatility. Solving the hedging problem in the calibrated signature volatility model yields more accurate and stable results across different payoffs and volatility dynamics.</description>

      <title>American Option Pricing Under Time-Varying Rough Volatility: A Signature-Based Hybrid Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a modular framework that extends the signature method to handle American option pricing under evolving volatility roughness. Building on the signature-pricing framework of Bayer et al. (2025), we add three practical innovations. First, we train a gradient-boosted ensemble to estimate the time-varying Hurst parameter H(t) from rolling windows of recent volatility data. Second, we feed these forecasts into a regime switch that chooses either a rough Bergomi or a calibrated Heston simulator, depending on the predicted roughness. Third, we accelerate signature-kernel evaluations with Random Fourier Features (RFF), cutting computational cost while preserving accuracy. Empirical tests on S&amp;P 500 equity-index options reveal that the assumption of persistent roughness is frequently violated, particularly during stable market regimes when H(t) approaches or exceeds 0.5. The proposed hybrid framework provides a flexible structure that adapts to changing volatility roughness, improving performance over fixed-roughness baselines and reducing duality gaps in some regimes. By integrating a dynamic Hurst parameter estimation pipeline with efficient kernel approximations, we propose to enable tractable, real-time pricing of American options in dynamic volatility environments.</description>

      <title>Optimal Fees for Liquidity Provision in Automated Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive liquidity providers (LPs) in automated market makers (AMMs) face losses due to adverse selection (LVR), which static trading fees often fail to offset in practice. We study the key determinants of LP profitability in a dynamic reduced-form model where an AMM operates in parallel with a centralized exchange (CEX), traders route their orders optimally to the venue offering the better price, and arbitrageurs exploit price discrepancies. Using large-scale simulations and real market data, we analyze how LP profits vary with market conditions such as volatility and trading volume, and characterize the optimal AMM fee as a function of these conditions. We highlight the mechanisms driving these relationships through extensive comparative statics, and confirm the model's relevance through market data calibration. A key trade-off emerges: fees must be low enough to attract volume, yet high enough to earn sufficient revenues and mitigate arbitrage losses. We find that under normal market conditions, the optimal AMM fee is competitive with the trading cost on the CEX and remarkably stable, whereas in periods of very high volatility, a high fee protects passive LPs from severe losses. These findings suggest that a threshold-type dynamic fee schedule is both robust enough to market conditions and improves LP outcomes.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic universal moment matching properties of normal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moment matching is an easy-to-implement and usually effective method to reduce variance of Monte Carlo simulation estimates. On the other hand, there is no guarantee that moment matching will always reduce simulation variance for general integration problems at least asymptotically, i.e. when the number of samples is large. We study the characterization of conditions on a given underlying distribution $X$ under which asymptotic variance reduction is guaranteed for a general integration problem $\mathbb{E}[f(X)]$ when moment matching techniques are applied. We show that a sufficient and necessary condition for such asymptotic variance reduction property is $X$ being a normal distribution. Moreover, when $X$ is a normal distribution, formulae for efficient estimation of simulation variance for (first and second order) moment matching Monte Carlo are obtained. These formulae allow estimations of simulation variance as by-products of the simulation process, in a way similar to variance estimations for plain Monte Carlo. Moreover, we propose non-linear moment matching schemes for any given continuous distribution such that asymptotic variance reduction is guaranteed.</description>
