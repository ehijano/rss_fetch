      <title>Labeled histories and maximally probable labeled topologies with multifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mathematical phylogenetics, labeled histories describe the sequences by which sets of labeled lineages coalesce to a shared ancestral lineage. We study labeled histories for at-most-$r$-furcating trees. Consider a rooted leaf-labeled tree in which internal nodes each have $i$ offspring, and $i$ is permitted to range from 2 to $r$ across internal nodes, for a specified value of $r$. For labeled topologies with $n$ leaves, we enumerate the total number of labeled histories with at-most-$r$-furcation. We enumerate the labeled histories possessed by a specific at-most-$r$-furcating labeled topology. We then demonstrate that the maximally probable at-most-$r$-furcating unlabeled topology on $n \geq 2$ leaves -- the unlabeled topology whose labelings have the largest number of labeled histories -- is the maximally probable strictly bifurcating unlabeled topology on $n$ leaves. Finally, we enumerate labeled histories for at-most-$r$-furcating labeled topologies in a setting that permits simultaneous branchings. We similarly reduce the problem of identifying the maximally probable at-most-$r$-furcating unlabeled topology on $n \geq 2$ leaves, allowing simultaneity, to that of identifying the maximally probable strictly bifurcating unlabeled topology on $n$ leaves, with simultaneity; we conjecture the shape of this bifurcating unlabeled topology. The computations contribute to the study of multifurcation, which arises in various biological processes, and they connect to analogous mathematical settings involving precedence-constrained scheduling.</description>

      <title>A model for mosquito-borne epidemic outbreaks with information-dependent protective behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model for a mosquito-borne epidemic outbreak in which humans can adopt protective behaviour against vector bites depending on information on the past and present prevalence. Assuming that mosquitoes can also feed on other non-competent hosts (i.e. hosts that cannot infect others), we first review some results from the literature by showing that protective behaviour may either decrease or increase the value of the reproduction number of the epidemic depending on multiple elements. Then, assuming that changes in opinion occur much faster than the spread of the disease, we exploit an approach based on the Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory to reduce the two-group model to a model for a homogeneous host population. Then, we use the resulting model to investigate the effect of information-induced behavioural changes on the transient dynamics of the epidemic, discussing the case when protective measures induced an outbreak with a low attack rate. We illustrate how behavioural changes might either help in containing an epidemic outbreak or make the epidemic last longer, even triggering recurrent damped epidemic waves. We conclude with numerical simulations to illustrate our analytical results.</description>

      <title>Local equations for the generalized Lotka-Volterra model on sparse asymmetric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real ecosystems are characterized by sparse and asymmetric interactions, posing a major challenge to theoretical analysis. We introduce a new method to study the generalized Lotka-Volterra model with stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs. By deriving local Fokker-Planck equations and employing a mean-field closure, we can efficiently compute stationary states for both symmetric and asymmetric interactions. We validate our approach by comparing the results with the direct integration of the dynamical equations and by reproducing known results and, for the first time, we map the phase diagram for sparse asymmetric networks. Our framework provides a versatile tool for exploring stability in realistic ecological communities and can be generalized to applications in different contexts, such as economics and evolutionary game theory.</description>

      <title>Stochastic neutral fractions and the effective population size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a general structured population is modelled using a general stochastic differential equation (SDE) with an infinite decomposability property. This property allows the population to be divided into an arbitrary number of allelic components, also known as stochastic neutral fractions. When demographic noise is small, a fast-slow principle provides a general formula for the effective population size in structured populations. To illustrate this approach, we revisit several examples from the literature, including expansion fronts.</description>
