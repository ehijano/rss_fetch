      <description>arXiv:2407.08809v1 Announce Type: new

      <title>Twist equivalence for Nichols algebras over Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bazlov generalized the construction of Fomin-Kirillov algebras to arbitrary finite Coxeter groups. They are quadratic approximations of Nichols algebras associated with the conjugacy class of reflections and a (rack) 2-cocycle q^+ with values in {-1,1}. We prove that q^+ is twist-equivalent to the constant cocycle q^-=-1, generalising a result of Vendramin. As a consequence, the Nichols algebras associated with the two different cocycles have the same Hilbert series and one is quadratic if and only if the other is quadratic. We further apply a recent result of Heckenberger, Meir and Vendramin to classify the finite-dimensional Nichols algebras of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over the dihedral group or order 2n, where n=r or n=2r with r odd and not a power of 3.</description>

      <title>General and Special Projectivity Groups in Spherical Buildings of Simply Laced Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the special and general projectivity groups attached to simplices F of spherical buildings and study those in the simply laced irreducible thick case. If the residue of F is irreducible, we determine the permutation group of the projectivity groups of F acting on the residue of F. This pins down the exact structure and action of the Levi complement of the corresponding parabolic subgroup in the simple Chevalley group, revealing three special cases for the exceptional types E_6, E_7 and E_8. Furthermore, we establish a general diagrammatic rule to decide when exactly the special and general projectivity groups of F coincide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for determining whether a character belongs to $\Sigma^m$. In order to apply it we just need to know that the ambient group is of type $\mathrm{FP}_m$ or of type $\mathrm{F}_2$ and that the word problem is solvable for this group. Then finite data is sufficient proof of membership in $\Sigma^m$, not just for the given character but also for a neighborhood of it.</description>

Abstract: We show that the intersection of the rational derived series of a one-relator group is rationally perfect and is normally generated by a single element. As a corollary, we characterise precisely when a one-relator group is residually rationally solvable.</description>

      <title>Coarse obstructions to cocompact cubulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide geometric methods to both lower- and upper-bound the large-scale dimension of CAT(0) cube complexes quasiisometric to a given group $G$. When these bounds overlap, this provides obstructions to $G$ being cocompactly cubulated. More strongly, it prevents $G$ from being a coarse median space.
  As applications, we show that many free-by-cyclic groups cannot be cocompactly cubulated, and that any tubular group with a coarse median is virtually compact special.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming G\"{o}del's axiom of constructibility $\bold V=\bold L,$ we present a characterization of those groups $L$ for which there exist arbitrarily large groups $H$ such that $aut(H) \cong L$. In particular, we show that it suffices to have one such group $H$ such that the size of its center is bigger than $ 2^{|L |+\aleph_0}$.</description>

      <title>Combination theorems in convex projective geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a general combination theorem for discrete subgroups of $\mathrm{PGL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ preserving properly convex open subsets in the projective space $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, in the spirit of Klein and Maskit. We use it in particular to prove that a free product of two $(\mathbb{Z}$-)linear groups is again ($\mathbb{Z}$-)linear, and to construct Zariski-dense discrete subgroups of $\mathrm{PGL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ which are not lattices but contain a lattice of a smaller higher-rank simple Lie group. We also establish a version of our combination theorem for discrete groups that are convex cocompact in $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ in the sense of arXiv:1704.08711. In particular, we prove that a free product of two convex cocompact groups is convex cocompact, which implies that the free product of two Anosov groups is Anosov. We also prove a virtual amalgamation theorem over convex cocompact subgroups generalizing work of Baker-Cooper.</description>

      <title>Membership problems for positive one-relator groups and one-relation monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by approaches to the word problem for one-relation monoids arising from work of Adian and Oganesian (1987), Guba (1997), and Ivanov, Margolis and Meakin (2001), we study the submonoid and rational subset membership problems in one-relation monoids and in positive one-relator groups. We give the first known examples of positive one-relator groups with undecidable submonoid membership problem, and apply this to give the first known examples of one-relation monoids with undecidable submonoid membership problem. We construct several infinite families of one-relation monoids with undecidable submonoid membership problem, including examples that are defined by relations of the form $w=1$ but which are not groups, and examples defined by relations of the form $u=v$ where both of $u$ and $v$ are non-empty. As a consequence we obtain a classification of the right-angled Artin groups that can arise as subgroups of one-relation monoids. We also give examples of monoids with a single defining relation of the form $aUb = a$, and examples of the form $aUb=aVa$, with undecidable rational subset membership problem. We give a one-relator group defined by a freely reduced word of the form $uv^{-1}$ with $u, v$ positive words, in which the prefix membership problem is undecidable. Finally, we prove the existence of a special two-relator inverse monoid with undecidable word problem, and in which both the relators are positive words. As a corollary, we also find a positive two-relator group with undecidable prefix membership problem. In proving these results, we introduce new methods for proving undecidability of the rational subset membership problem in monoids and groups, including by finding suitable embeddings of certain trace monoids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that if $G$ is a group and $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of finite index $k$, then $x^k \in H$ for every $x \in G$. We examine finite groups $G$ with the property that $x^k \in H$ for every subgroup $H$ of $G$, where $k$ is the index of $H$ in $G$. We prove that a finite group $G$ satisfies this property if and only if $G$ is nilpotent.</description>

      <title>Representation growth of Fuchsian groups and modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a cocompact, oriented Fuchsian group which is not on an explicit finite list of possible exceptions and $q$ a sufficiently large prime power not divisible by the order of any non-trivial torsion element of $\Gamma$. Then $|\mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,\mathrm{GL}_n(q))|\sim c_{q,n} q^{(1-\chi(\Gamma))n^2}$, where $c_{q,n}$ is periodic in $n$. As a function of $q$, $c_{q,n}$ can be expressed as a Puiseux series in $1/q$ whose coefficients are periodic in $n$ and $q$. Moreover, this series is essentially the $q$-expansion of a meromorphic modular form of half-integral weight.</description>

      <title>The geometry of conjugation in Euclidean isometry groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the geometry of conjugation within any split subgroup $H$ of the full isometry group $G$ of $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. We prove that for any $h \in H$, the conjugacy class $[h]_H$ of $h$ is described geometrically by the move-set of its linearization, while the set of elements conjugating $h$ to a given $h'\in [h]_H$ is described by the the fix-set of its linearization. Examples include all affine Coxeter groups, certain crystallographic groups, and the group $G$ itself.</description>

      <title>The geometry of conjugation in affine Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop new and precise geometric descriptions of the conjugacy class $[x]$ and coconjugation set $\operatorname{C}(x,x') = \{ y \in \overline{W} \mid yxy^{-1} = x' \}$ for all elements $x,x'$ of any affine Coxeter group $\overline{W}$. The centralizer of $x$ in $\overline{W}$ is the special case $\operatorname{C}(x,x)$. The key structure in our description of the conjugacy class $[x]$ is the mod-set ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w) = (w-\operatorname{I})R^\vee$, where~$w$ is the finite part of $x$ and $R^\vee$ is the coroot lattice. The coconjugation set $\operatorname{C}(x,x')$ is then described by ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w')$ together with the fix-set of $w'$, where $w'$ is the finite part of $x'$. For any element $w$ of the associated finite Weyl group $W$, the mod-set of $w$ is contained in the classical move-set ${Mov}(w) = \operatorname{Im}(w - \operatorname{I})$. We prove that the rank of ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w)$ equals the dimension of ${Mov}(w)$, and then further investigate type-by-type the surprisingly subtle structure of the $\mathbb{Z}$-module ${Mod}_\overline{W}(w)$. As corollaries, we determine exactly when ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w) = {Mov}(w) \cap R^\vee$, in which case our closed-form descriptions of conjugacy classes and coconjugation sets are as simple as possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:math/0205314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let G be a finite group, and $g \geq 2$. We study the locus of genus g curves that admit a G-action of given type, and inclusions between such loci. We use this to study the locus of genus g curves with prescribed automorphism group G. We completely classify these loci for g=3 (including equations for the corresponding curves), and for $g \leq 10$ we classify those loci corresponding to "large" G.</description>
