      <title>On the twin-width of smooth manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on Whitney's classical method of triangulating smooth manifolds, we show that every compact $d$-dimensional smooth manifold admits a triangulation with dual graph of twin-width at most $d^{O(d)}$. In particular, it follows that every compact 3-manifold has a triangulation with dual graph of bounded twin-width. This is in sharp contrast to the case of treewidth, where for any natural number $n$ there exists a closed 3-manifold such that every triangulation thereof has dual graph with treewidth at least $n$. To establish this result, we bound the twin-width of the incidence graph of the $d$-skeleton of the second barycentric subdivision of the $2d$-dimensional hypercubic honeycomb. We also show that every compact, piecewise-linear (hence smooth) $d$-dimensional manifold has triangulations where the dual graph has an arbitrarily large twin-width.</description>

      <title>Complexity of 2D Snake Cube Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a chain of $HW$ cubes where each cube is marked "turn $90^\circ$" or "go straight", when can it fold into a $1 \times H \times W$ rectangular box? We prove several variants of this (still) open problem NP-hard: (1) allowing some cubes to be wildcard (can turn or go straight); (2) allowing a larger box with empty spaces (simplifying a proof from CCCG 2022); (3) growing the box (and the number of cubes) to $2 \times H \times W$ (improving a prior 3D result from height $8$ to $2$); (4) with hexagonal prisms rather than cubes, each specified as going straight, turning $60^\circ$, or turning $120^\circ$; and (5) allowing the cubes to be encoded implicitly to compress exponentially large repetitions.</description>

      <title>Better Diameter Algorithms for Bounded VC-dimension Graphs and Geometric Intersection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for algorithms finding the diameter in graphs of bounded distance Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, in (parameterized) subquadratic time complexity. The class of bounded distance VC-dimension graphs is wide, including, e.g. all minor-free graphs.
  We build on the work of Ducoffe et al. [SODA'20, SIGCOMP'22], improving their technique. With our approach the algorithms become simpler and faster, working in $\mathcal{O}(k \cdot n^{1-1/d} \cdot m \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(n))$ time complexity for the graph on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, where $k$ is the diameter and $d$ is the distance VC-dimension of the graph. Furthermore, it allows us to use the improved technique in more general setting. In particular, we use this framework for geometric intersection graphs, i.e. graphs where vertices are identical geometric objects on a plane and the adjacency is defined by intersection. Applying our approach for these graphs, we partially answer a question posed by Bringmann et al. [SoCG'22], finding an $\mathcal{O}(n^{7/4} \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(n))$ parameterized diameter algorithm for unit square intersection graph of size $n$, as well as a more general algorithm for convex polygon intersection graphs.</description>
