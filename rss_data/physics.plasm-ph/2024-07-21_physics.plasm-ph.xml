      <title>Deriving improved plasma fluid equations from collisional kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing a quantitative understanding of wave plasma processes in the lower ionosphere requires a reasonably accurate theoretical description of the underlying physical processes. For such highly collisional plasma environment as the E-region ionosphere, kinetic theory represents the most accurate theoretical description of wave processes. For the analytical treatment, however, the collisional kinetic theory is extremely complicated and succeeds only in a limited number of physical problems. To date, most research applied oversimplified fluid models that lack a number of critical kinetic aspects, so that the coefficients in the corresponding fluid equations are often accurate only to an order of magnitude. This paper presents the derivation for the highly collisional, partially magnetized case relevant to E-region conditions. It provides a more accurate reduction of the ion and, especially, electron kinetic equations to the corresponding 5-moment fluid equations by using a new set of analytic approximations. This derivation results in more accurate fluid-model set of equations appropriate for most E-region problems. The results of this paper could be used for a routine practical analysis when working with actual data. The improved equations can also serve as a basis for more accurate plasma fluid computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Ionization Dynamics in Intense Laser-Produced Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ionization dynamic of argon plasma irradiated by an intense laser is investigated to understand transient physics in dynamic systems. This study demonstrates that significant delayed ionization responses and stepwise ionization processes are crucial factors in determining the ionization state of such systems. When an intense laser begins to ionize an initially cold argon plasma, the conditions change rapidly, leading to a delayed response in ionization. Consequently, the dynamics do not reach a steady state, even if the electron temperature and density appear unchanged, particularly when the atomic transition process is not sufficiently rapid compared to the relevant time scales. Furthermore, in this case, numerous highly excited states are created primarily through collisional excitation. Thus, even low-energy photons can predominantly ionize plasmas, challenging the conventional belief that such photon energies insufficient to overcome the binding energy of bound electrons typically contribute less to the ionization. These findings underscore the necessity of incorporating these processes in ionization modeling within radiation hydrodynamic simulations for various laser-plasma experiments.</description>

      <title>Adapted Swin Transformer-based Real-Time Plasma Shape Detection and Control in HL-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of magnetic confinement plasma control, the accurate feedback of plasma position and shape primarily relies on calculations derived from magnetic measurements through equilibrium reconstruction or matrix mapping method. However, under harsh conditions like high-energy neutron radiation and elevated temperatures, the installation of magnetic probes within the device becomes challenging. Relying solely on external magnetic probes can compromise the precision of EFIT in determining the plasma shape. To tackle this issue, we introduce a real-time, non-magnetic measurement method on the HL-3 tokamak, which diagnoses the plasma position and shape via imaging. Particularly, we put forward an adapted Swin Transformer model, the Poolformer Swin Transformer (PST), to accurately and fastly interpret the plasma shape from the Charge-Coupled Device Camera (CCD) images. By adopting multi-task learning and knowledge distillation techniques, the model is capable of robustly detecting six shape parameters under disruptive conditions such as a divertor shape and gas injection, circumventing global brightness changes and cumbersome manual labeling. Specifically, the well-trained PST model capably infers R and Z within the mean average error below 1.1 cm and 1.8 cm, respectively, while requiring less than 2 ms for end-to-end feedback, an 80 improvement over the smallest Swin Transformer model, laying the foundation for real-time control. Finally, we deploy the PST model in the Plasma Control System (PCS) using TensorRT, and achieve 500 ms stable PID feedback control based on the PST-computed horizontal displacement information. In conclusion, this research opens up new avenues for the practical application of image-computing plasma shape diagnostic methods in the realm of real-time feedback control.</description>

      <title>Ray tracing methods for wave propagation in moving anisotropic media : application to magnetized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of a wave in a medium is generally affected when the medium is moving with respect to the observer. Because plasma equilibria often involve plasma flows, for instance in astrophysics or in magnetic confinement nuclear fusion devices, understanding the effect of motion on plasma waves is important. Meanwhile, the presence of a background magnetic field in a plasma makes it anisotropic. To address this problem, we derive here ray tracing equations for the trajectory of rays propagating in a moving anisotropic medium. The proposed approach is to use an effective dispersion relation for the moving medium as seen from the laboratory, obtained by performing a Lorentz transformation of the dispersion relation known for the medium at rest. This formalism is illustrated by considering the standard ordinary and extraordinary modes in a magnetized plasma at rest. Although we work here at lowest order in the geometrical optics approximation, this method is a first step towards higher order expansions, as required for instance to capture polarization effects.</description>

      <title>Pseudoatom Molecular Dynamics Plasma Microfields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral line profiles are powerful diagnostic tools for both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, as their shape is sensitive to the plasma environment. The low-frequency component of the electric microfield is an important input for analytic line broadening codes. In this paper we detail a new method of calculating plasma microfields using configuration-resolved pseudoatom molecular dynamics. This approach accounts for both quantum atomic structure and N-body effects, similar to density functional theory molecular dynamics, but with less computational cost. We present pseudoatom microfields at conditions relevant for recent laboratory experiments. Compared to established microfield codes we find moderate deviations at solid density conditions and strong agreement at lower plasma densities.</description>

      <title>Bounding elastic photon-photon scattering at $\sqrt s \approx 1\,$MeV using a laser-plasma platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a direct search for elastic photon-photon scattering using x-ray and $\gamma$ photons from a laser-plasma based experiment. A gamma photon beam produced by a laser wakefield accelerator provided a broadband gamma spectrum extending to above $E_\gamma = 200$ MeV. These were collided with a dense x-ray field produced by the emission from a laser heated germanium foil at $E_x \approx 1.4$ keV, corresponding to an invariant mass of $\sqrt{s} = 1.22 \pm 0.22$ MeV. In these asymmetric collisions elastic scattering removes one x-ray and one high-energy $\gamma$ photon and outputs two lower energy $\gamma$ photons. No changes in the $\gamma$ photon spectrum were observed as a result of the collisions allowing us to place a 95% upper bound on the cross section of $1.5 \times 10^{15}\,\mu$b. Although far from the QED prediction, this represents the lowest upper limit obtained so far for $\sqrt{s} \lesssim 1$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Structure preserving hybrid Finite Volume Finite Element method for compressible MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we present a novel and efficient numerical method for the compressible viscous and resistive MHD equations for all Mach number regimes. The time-integration strategy is a semi-implicit splitting, combined with a hybrid finite-volume and finite-element (FE) discretization in space. The non-linear convection is solved by a robust explicit FV scheme, while the magneto-acoustic terms are treated implicitly in time. The resulting CFL stability condition depends only on the fluid velocity, and not on the Alfv\'enic and acoustic modes. The magneto-acoustic terms are discretized by compatible FE based on a continuous and a discrete de Rham complexes designed using Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC). Thanks to the use of FEEC, energy stability, magnetic-helicity conservation and the divergence-free conditions can be preserved also at the discrete level. A very efficient splitting approach is used to separate the acoustic and the Alfv\'enic modes in such a fashion that the original symmetries of the PDE governing equations are preserved. In this way, the algorithm relies on the solution of linear, symmetric and positive-definite algebraic systems, that are very efficiently handled by the simple matrix-free conjugate-gradient method. The resulting algorithm showed to be robust and accurate in low and high Mach regimes even at large Courant numbers. Non-trivial tests are solved in one-, two- and three- space dimensions to confirm the robustness, accuracy, and the low-dissipative and conserving properties of the final algorithm. While the formulation of the method is very general, numerical results for a second-order accurate FV-FE scheme will be presented.</description>
