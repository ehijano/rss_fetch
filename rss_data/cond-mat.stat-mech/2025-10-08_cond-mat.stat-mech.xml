      <title>Scalable accuracy gains from postselection in quantum error correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding stabilizer codes such as the surface and toric codes involves evaluating free-energy differences in a disordered statistical mechanics model, in which the randomness comes from the observed pattern of error syndromes. We study the statistical distribution of logical failure rates across observed syndromes in the toric code, and show that, within the coding phase, logical failures are predominantly caused by exponentially unlikely syndromes. Therefore, postselecting on not seeing these exponentially unlikely syndrome patterns offers a scalable accuracy gain. In general, the logical error rate can be suppressed from $p_f$ to $p_f^b$, where $b \geq 2$ in general; in the specific case of the toric code with perfect syndrome measurements, we find numerically that $b = 3.1(1)$. Our arguments apply to general topological stabilizer codes, and can be extended to more general settings as long as the decoding failure probability obeys a large deviation principle.</description>

      <title>Exact Quench Dynamics from Thermal Pure Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact solution for a quantum quench in an integrable system that reveals a new, coherent pathway to thermalization. In chaotic systems, thermalization is understood via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which implies that a quench from a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state should exhibit trivial dynamics. In contrast, integrable systems are expected to retain memory of their initial conditions in a non-thermal generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We show that a quench from a TPQ state in the integrable spin-1/2 XX chain defies both expectations. The system thermalizes to a canonical Gibbs ensemble, yet the entanglement dynamics are highly non-trivial, exhibiting a "double plateau" structure. We solve this process exactly using techniques in two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theories (CFT), an exact numerical method based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically exact quasiparticle picture. We prove that the non-trivial dynamics are the macroscopic signature of the coherent dephasing of the initial state's anomalous pairing correlations.</description>

      <title>Full counting statistics of electron-photon hybrid systems: Joint statistics and fluctuation symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-photon hybrid systems serve as ideal light-matter interfaces with broad applications in quantum technologies. These systems are typically operated dynamically under nonequilibrium conditions, giving rise to coupled electronic and photonic currents. Understanding the joint fluctuation behavior of these currents is essential for assessing the performance of light-matter interfaces that rely on electron-photon correlations. Here, we investigate the full counting statistics of coupled electronic and photonic currents in an experimentally feasible hybrid system composed of a double quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity. We employ the framework of quantum Lindblad master equation which is augmented with both electronic and photonic counting fields to derive their joint cumulant generating function--a treatment that differs significantly from existing studies, which typically focus on either electron or photon statistics separately. We reveal that the ratio between photonic and electronic currents, as well as their variances, can deviate from an expected quadratic scaling law in the large electron-photon coupling regime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that conventional modelings of photonic dissipation channels in quantum master equations must be modified to ensure that the joint cumulant generating function satisfies the fluctuation symmetry enforced by the fluctuation theorem. Our results advance the understanding of joint fluctuation behaviors in electron-photon hybrid systems and may inform the design of efficient quantum light-matter interfaces.</description>

      <title>Full Eigenstate Thermalization in Integrable Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis(ETH) is a standard tool to understand the thermalization properties of an isolated quantum system. Its generalization to higher order correlations of matrix elements of local operators, dubbed the full ETH, predicts the decomposition of higher-order correlation function into thermal free cumulants. In this work, we numerically test these predictions of full ETH using exact diagonalization of two spin models: the Ising and the XXZ Heisenberg models. The differences from the behavior of full ETH prediction in chaotic systems are highlighted and contrasted along the way. We also show that although in these integrable spin models the dynamics of the four-time correlators, specifically the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), is encoded in the fourth order free cumulant, it exhibits late-time dynamics that is different from nonintegrable systems.</description>

      <title>Analytic expressions for estimation of the critical properties of inhomogeneous Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many applications of spin models, the fast estimation of their critical temperatures and other physical properties is of great importance. In this work, we present the analytical expressions estimating the critical properties of inhomogeneous Ising models with ferromagnetic interactions. The expressions were obtained within the framework of the m-vicinity method. The accuracy of the critical temperature estimations was evaluated through comparison with Monte Carlo simulations. Special attention was given to the case when the model consists of two interacting interpenetrating homogeneous sublattices, and relationships for the compositional dependence of the critical temperature were derived.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the entropic role of hydration water in SOD1 partitioning within FUS condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological processes like the sequestration of Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1) into biomolecular condensates such as FUS and stress granules are essential to understanding disease mechanisms, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our study demonstrates that the hydration environment is crucial in these processes. Using the advanced CVF water model, which captures hydrogen-bond networks at the molecular level, we show how water greatly impacts SOD1's behavior, residency times, and transition rates between different associative states. Importantly, when water is included to hydrate an implicit solvent model (OPEP), we gain a new perspective on the free energy landscape of the system, leading to a conclusion that clarifies that suggested by OPEP alone. While the OPEP model indicated that Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) crowders reduce SOD1's partition coefficient (PC) mainly due to nonspecific interactions with BSA, our enhanced explicit-water approach reveals that the hydration entropy behavior in BSA drives the observed decrease in PC. This highlights that explicitly modeling water is essential for accurately understanding protein-crowder interactions and their biological relevance, emphasizing water's role in cellular phase separation and disease-related processes.</description>

      <title>Boundary criticality in two-dimensional correlated topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of a boundary enriches the nature of quantum phase transitions. However, the boundary critical phenomena in topological superconductors remain underexplored so far. Here, we investigate the boundary criticality in a two-dimensional correlated time-reversal-invariant topological superconductor tuned through a quantum phase transition into a trivial time-reversal-breaking superconductor. Using sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we chart the quantum phase diagram and reveal the boundary criticalities encompassing ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. Additionally, using renormalization group analysis, we compute the boundary critical exponent up to two loops. Remarkably, the simulations and two-loop renormalization group calculations consistently demonstrate that the presence of the boundary Majorana fermion at the special transition gives rise to a new type of boundary Gross-Neveu-Yukawa fixed point. We conclude with a discussion of possible experimental realizations in iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Cored product codes for quantum self-correction in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of self-correcting quantum memories in three dimensions is a long-standing open question at the interface between quantum computing and many-body physics. We take the perspective that large contributions to the entropy arising from fine-tuned spatial symmetries, including the assumption of an underlying regular lattice, are responsible for fundamental challenges to realizing self-correction. Accordingly, we introduce a class of disordered quantum codes, which we call "cored product codes". These codes are derived from classical factors via the hypergraph product but undergo a coring procedure which allows them to be embedded in a lower number of spatial dimensions while preserving code properties. As a specific example, we focus on a fractal code based on the aperiodic pinwheel tiling as the classical factor and perform finite temperature numerical simulations on the resulting three-dimensional quantum memory. We provide evidence that, below a critical temperature, the memory lifetime increases with system size for codes up to 60000 qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the activated random walk particle system, a model of self-organized criticality, on $\mathbb{Z}$ with i.i.d.-Bernoulli initial configuration. We show that at subcritical density, the system's odometer function, which counts the number of actions taken at each site, has a stretched exponential tail. It follows that the expected odometer at each site is finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate by atomistic simulations the memory behavior a model glass subjected to random driving protocols. The training consists of a random walk of forward and/or backward shearing sequences bounded by a maximal shear strain of absolute value {\gamma}T . We show that such a stochastic training protocol is able to record the training amplitude. Different read-out protocols are also tested and are shown to be able to retrieve the training amplitude. We then emphasize the ten- sorial character of the memory encoded in the glass sample and then characterize the anisotropic mechanical behavior of the trained samples.</description>

      <title>Recovery of the second law in fully quantum thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics investigates how robust the second law of thermodynamics serves as the unique fundamental law in the small quantum world. To tackle this problem, the quantum coherence constitutes a major difficulty of investigations, which provides severe constraints hindering the recovery of a single thermodynamic potential. Here we solve this long-standing problem of quantum information theory by revealing that the state convertibility under thermal operations is fully characterized by the second law of thermodynamics. Specifically, we prove that whether a quantum state with quantum coherence is convertible to another by a thermal operation with a correlated catalyst is completely determined by the free energy ordering. Unlike previous attempts, our setting does not resort to any additional external coherent assist, providing a faithful operational characterization of thermodynamic state transformation.</description>

      <title>Emergence of metastability on the hyperbolic lattice: Effects of boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Ising model on finite subgraphs of the hyperbolic lattice under minus boundary conditions and in the presence of a positive external field $h$. Interpreting the boundary as frozen or cold wall conditions, we show that, for small values of $h$, the system exhibits metastable behaviour. Our result is very surprising, since non-amenable graphs, such as hyperbolic lattices, feature exponentially growing boundaries, which typically destabilize local energy minima. In particular, we identify the unique metastable state and characterize the exit time from it. Furthermore, we establish asymptotic results for the distribution of the first hitting time and provide estimates for the spectral gap. Finally, we analyze the energy landscape and describe the nucleation mechanism for values of $h$ outside the metastable regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the formation of ice in small clusters of water molecules to the mass raids of army ant colonies, the emergent behavior of collectives depends critically on their size. At the same time, common wisdom holds that such behaviors are robust to the loss of individuals. This tension points to the need for a more systematic study of how number influences collective behavior. We initiate this study by focusing on collective behaviors that change abruptly at certain critical numbers of individuals. We show that a subtle modification of standard bifurcation analysis identifies such critical numbers, including those associated with discreteness- and noise-induced transitions. By treating them as instances of the same phenomenon, we show that critical numbers across physical scales and scientific domains commonly arise from competing feedbacks that scale differently with number. We then use this idea to find overlooked critical numbers in past studies of collective behavior and explore the implications for their conclusions. In particular, we highlight how deterministic approximations of stochastic models can fail near critical numbers. We close by distinguishing these qualitative changes from density-dependent phase transitions and by discussing how our approach could generalize to broader classes of collective behaviors.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Data and Tasks: Theories of Locality and Compositionality in Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, yet our understanding of how they learn remains limited. These models can learn high-dimensional tasks, which is generally statistically intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. This apparent paradox suggests that learnable data must have an underlying latent structure. What is the nature of this structure? How do neural networks encode and exploit it, and how does it quantitatively impact performance - for instance, how does generalization improve with the number of training examples? This thesis addresses these questions by studying the roles of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning representations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Performance Limits for Score-Based Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a fundamental connection between score-based diffusion models and non-equilibrium thermodynamics by deriving performance limits based on entropy rates. Our main theoretical contribution is a lower bound on the negative log-likelihood of the data that relates model performance to entropy rates of diffusion processes. We numerically validate this bound on a synthetic dataset and investigate its tightness. By building a bridge to entropy rates - system, intrinsic, and exchange entropy - we provide new insights into the thermodynamic operation of these models, drawing parallels to Maxwell's demon and implications for thermodynamic computing hardware. Our framework connects generative modeling performance to fundamental physical principles through stochastic thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Derivation of Bose-Einstein statistics from the uncertainty principle</title>

Abstract: The microstate of any degree of freedom of any classical dynamical system can be represented by a point in its two dimensional phase space. Since infinitely precise measurements are impossible, a measurement can, at best, constrain the location of this point to a region of phase space whose area is finite. This paper explores the implications of assuming that this finite area is bounded from below. I prove that if the same lower bound applied to every degree of freedom of a sufficiently cold classical dynamical system, the distribution of the system's energy among its degrees of freedom would be a Bose-Einstein distribution.</description>

      <title>The free propagator of strongly anisotropic systems with free surfaces</title>

Abstract: A brief overview of fluctuation-induced forces in statistical systems with film geometry at the critical point and the calculation of Casimir amplitudes, which characterize these forces quantitatively, is presented. Particular attention is paid to the special features of strongly anisotropic $m$-axis systems at the Lifshitz point, specifically, in the case of a "$perpendicular$" orientation of surfaces with free boundary conditions. Beyond the simplest one-loop approximation, calculations of Casimir amplitudes are impossible without knowledge of the Gaussian propagator, which corresponds to the lines of Feynman diagrams in the perturbation theory. We present an explicit expression for such a propagator in the case of an anisotropic system confined by parallel surfaces $perpendicular$ to one of the anisotropy axes. Using this propagator, we reproduce the one-loop result derived earlier in an essentially different way. The knowledge of the propagator provides the possibility of higher-order calculations in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Abrupt transitions in the optimization of diffusion with distributed resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brownian diffusion subject to stochastic resetting to a fixed position has been widely studied for applications to random search processes. In an unbounded domain, the mean first-passage time at a target site can be minimized for a convenient choice of the resetting rate. Here we study this optimization problem in one dimension when resetting occurs to random positions, chosen from a probability density function with compact support that does not include the target. Depending on the shape of this distribution, the optimal resetting rate either varies smoothly with the mean distance to the target, as in single-site resetting, or exhibits a discontinuity caused by the presence of a second local minimum in the mean first-passage time. These two regimes are separated by a critical line containing a singular point that we characterize through a Ginzburg-Landau theory. To quantify how useful is a given resetting point for the search, we calculate the probability density function of the last resetting position before absorption. The discontinuous transition separates two markedly different optimal strategies: one with a small resetting rate where the last path before absorption starts from a rather distant but likely position, while the other strategy has a large resetting rate, favoring last paths starting from not-so-likely points but which are closer to the target.</description>

      <title>FreeBird.jl: An Extensible Toolbox for Simulating Interfacial Phase Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present FreeBird, an extensible Julia-based platform for computational studies of phase equilibria at generic interfaces. The package supports a range of system configurations, from atomistic solid surfaces to coarse-grained lattice$-$gas models, with energies evaluated using classical interatomic potentials or lattice Hamiltonians. Both atomistic and lattice systems accommodate single- or multi-component mixtures with flexibly definable surface and lattice geometries. Implemented sampling algorithms include nested sampling, Wang$-$Landau sampling, Metropolis Monte Carlo, and, for tractable lattice systems, exact enumeration. Leveraging Julia's type hierarchies and multiple dispatch, FreeBird provides a modular interface that allows seamless integration of system definitions, energy evaluators, and sampling schemes. Designed for flexibility, extensibility, and performance, FreeBird offers a versatile framework for exploring the thermodynamics of interfacial phenomena.</description>

      <title>Duality between dissipation-coherence trade-off and thermodynamic speed limit based on thermodynamic uncertainty relation for stochastic limit cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive two fundamental trade-offs for general stochastic limit cycles in the weak-noise limit. The first is the dissipation-coherence trade-off, which was numerically conjectured and partially proved by Santolin and Falasco [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 057101 (2025)]. This trade-off bounds the entropy production required for one oscillatory period using the number of oscillations that occur before steady-state correlations are disrupted. The second is the thermodynamic speed limit, which bounds the entropy production with the Euclidean length of the limit cycle. These trade-offs are obtained by substituting mutually dual observables, derived from the stability of the limit cycle, into the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. This fact allows us to regard the dissipation-coherence trade-off as the dual of the thermodynamic speed limit. We numerically demonstrate these trade-offs using the noisy R\"{o}ssler model. We also apply the trade-offs to stochastic chemical systems, where the diffusion coefficient matrix may contain zero eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Interplay of order and disorder in two-dimensional critical systems with mixed boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spin systems such as the Ising model, the local order and disorder can be characterized by the order-parameter and energy density profiles $\langle \sigma ({\bf r}_1) \rangle$ and $\langle \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle$, respectively. Does increasing the order at ${\bf r}_1$ always decrease the disorder at ${\bf r}_2$? Does increasing the disorder at ${\bf r}_2$ always decrease the order at ${\bf r}_1$? The answer to these questions is contained in the cumulant response function $\langle\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle^{(\rm cum)}$. This correlation function vanishes in the unbounded bulk but not in systems with fixed-spin boundary conditions. Using the universal operator-product expansion of $\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf r}_2)$ and exact results for the Ising model, we analyze $\langle\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle^{(\rm cum)}$ in two-dimensional critical systems defined on the $x-y$ plane with mixed $+$ and $-$ boundary conditions. Particularly interesting behavior is found when either of the operators $\sigma$ or $\epsilon$ is located on a ``zero line" in the $x-y$ plane, along which $\langle\sigma ({\bf r})\rangle$ vanishes. Results for half-plane, triangular, and rectangular geometries are presented.</description>

      <title>Quantum memory at nonzero temperature in a thermodynamically trivial system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Passive error correction protects logical information forever in the thermodynamic limit by updating the system based only on local information and few-body interactions. A paradigmatic example is the classical two-dimensional Ising model: a Metropolis-style Gibbs sampler retains the sign of the initial magnetization (a logical bit) for thermodynamically long times in the low-temperature phase. Known models of passive quantum error correction similarly exhibit thermodynamic phase transitions to a low-temperature phase wherein logical qubits are protected by thermally stable topological order. Here, in contrast, we show that certain families of constant-rate classical and quantum low-density parity check codes have no thermodynamic phase transitions at nonzero temperature, but nonetheless exhibit ergodicity-breaking dynamical transitions: below a critical nonzero temperature, the mixing time of local Gibbs sampling diverges in the thermodynamic limit. Slow Gibbs sampling of such codes enables fault-tolerant passive quantum error correction using finite-depth circuits. This strategy is well suited to measurement-free quantum error correction and may present a desirable experimental alternative to conventional quantum error correction based on syndrome measurements and active feedback.</description>

      <title>Electricity at the macroscale and its microscopic origins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I define the fields that describe electrical macrostructure, and their rates of change, in terms of the microscopic charge density, electric field, electric potential, and their rates of change. To deduce these definitions, I lay some new foundations of a theory of how observable macroscopic fields are related to spatial averages of their microscopic counterparts.
  I find that the relationships between macroscopic fields are identical in form to the relationships between their microscopic counterparts, meaning that the $\vec{P}$ and ${\vec{D}}$ fields do not appear in them. Without invoking quantum mechanics, I derive the expressions for polarization current established by the Modern Theory of Polarization. I prove that the bulk-average electric potential, or mean inner potential, vanishes in a macroscopically-uniform charge-neutral material, and I show that when a crystal lattice lacks inversion symmetry, it does not imply the existence of macroscopic $\vec{E}$ or $\vec{P}$ fields in the crystal's bulk.
  I point out that symmetry is scale-dependent. Therefore, if anisotropy of the microstructure does not manifest as anisotropy of the macrostructure, it cannot be the origin of a macroscopic vector field. The macroscopic charge density vanishes in a material's bulk. Therefore, regardless of the microstructure, a macroscopic $\vec{E}$ field cannot emanate from the bulk. I find that all relationships between observable macroscopic fields can be expressed mathematically without introducing the polarization ($\vec{P}$) and electric displacement ($\vec{D}$) fields, neither of which is observable. I also show that most `quantum mechanical' aspects of the existing microscopic theory of electricity in materials are compatible with, or required features of, a statistical theory of classical particles whose charges and masses are comparable to those of electrons and nuclei.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of topological order parameter in SU($N$) spin models, $N$-ality transformation and ingappabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the ground-state expectation value of twisting operator is a topological order parameter for $\text{U}(1)$- and $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in one-dimensional "spin" systems -- it is quantized in the thermodynamic limit and can be used to identify different SPT phases and to diagnose phase transitions among them. We prove that this (non-local) order parameter must take values in $N$-th roots of unity, and its value can be changed by a generalized lattice translation acting as an $N$-ality transformation connecting distinct phases. This result also implies the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis ingappability for SU($N$) spins if we further impose a general translation symmetry. Furthermore, our exact result for the order parameter of SPT phases can predict a large number of LSM ingappabilities by the general lattice translation. We also apply the $N$-ality property to provide an efficient way to construct possible multi-critical phase transitions starting from a single Hamiltonian with a unique gapped ground state.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this paper, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</description>

      <title>Observation of Temperature Effects on False Vacuum Decay in Atomic Quantum Gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temperature plays a crucial role in metastable phenomena, not only by contributing to determine the state (phase) of a system, but also ruling the decay probability to more stable states. Such a situation is encountered in many different physical systems, ranging from chemical reactions to magnetic structures. The characteristic decay timescale is not always straightforward to estimate since it depends on the microscopic details of the system. A paradigmatic example in quantum field theories is the decay of the false vacuum, manifested via the nucleation of bubbles. In this paper, we measure the temperature dependence of the timescale for the false vacuum decay mechanism in an ultracold atomic quantum spin mixture which exhibits ferromagnetic properties. Our results show that the false vacuum decay rate scales with temperature as predicted by the finite-temperature extension of the instanton theory, and confirm atomic systems as an ideal platform where to study out-of-equilibrium field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spin-orbit-coupled systems the charge and spin transport are generally coupled to each other, namely a charge current will induce a spin current and vice versa. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry $T$, the cross-coupling transport coefficients describing how one process affects the other are constrained by the famous Onsager reciprocal relations. In this paper, we generalize the Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport to systems that break the time-reversal symmetry but preserve a combined symmetry of $T$ and some other symmetry operation $O$. We show that the symmetry or antisymmetry of the cross-coupling transport coefficients remains in place provided that the operator $O$ meets certain conditions. Among many candidate systems where our generalized Onsager relations apply, we focus on a conceptually simple and experimentally realized model in cold atomic systems for explicit demonstration and use these relations to predict highly non-trivial transport phenomena that can be readily verified experimentally.</description>

Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of conserved, non-commuting charges, and a fundamental goal is to determine the minimum energy of the system subject to constraints on the charges. Recently, [Liu et al., arXiv:2505.04514] proposed first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving a dual chemical potential maximization problem, and they proved that these algorithms converge to global optima by means of gradient-ascent approaches. In this paper, we benchmark these algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including one- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total x, y, and z magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code. Finally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as alternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed temperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these encoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical qubits.</description>

Abstract: Understanding flux string dynamics can provide insight into quark confinement and hadronization. First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have mostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the advent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to bridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one spatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time string dynamics of a $2\!+\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter. In the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through sharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a distinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a \textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from resonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball loops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with distinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances. Our findings serve as a guide for upcoming quantum simulators of non-Abelian LGTs.</description>

      <title>Birth of a gap: Critical phenomena in 2D Coulomb gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a family of radially symmetric Coulomb gas systems at inverse temperature $\beta = 2$. The family is characterised by the property that the density of the equilibrium measure vanishes on a ring at radius $r_*$, which lies strictly inside the droplet. The large $n$ expansion of the logarithm of the partition function is obtained up to a novel $n^{1/4}$ term. We perform a double scaling limit of the correlation kernel at the $n^{1/4}$ scale and obtain a new limiting kernel in the bulk, which differs from the well-known Ginibre kernel.</description>

      <title>ChromRec: Self-Assembly of Nucleosomes Driven by Directional Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center "recognition" potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</description>
