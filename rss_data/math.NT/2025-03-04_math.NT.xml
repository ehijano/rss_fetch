      <title>Congruences modulo arbitrary powers of $5$ and $7$ for Andrews and Paule's partition diamonds with $(n+1)$ copies of $n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Andrews and Paule introduced a partition function $PDN1(N)$ which denotes the number of partition diamonds with $(n+1)$ copies of $n$ where summing the parts at the links gives $N$. They also presented the generating function for $PDN1(n)$ and proved several congruences modulo 5,7,25,49 for $PDN1(n)$. At the end of their paper, Andrews and Paule asked for determining infinite families of congruences similar to Ramanujan's classical $ p(5^kn +d_k) \equiv 0 \pmod {5^k}$, where $24d_k\equiv 1 \pmod {5^k}$ and $k\geq 1$. In this paper, we give an answer of Andrews and Paule's open problem by proving three congruences modulo arbitrary powers of $5$ for $PDN1(n)$. In addition, we prove two congruences modulo arbitrary powers of $7$ for $PDN1(n)$, which are analogous to Watson's congruences for $p(n)$.</description>

      <title>$U$-Operators Acting on Harmonic Cocycles for $\mathrm{GL}_3$ and Their Slopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00141v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we describe a computational study of the action of the two natural $U$-operators acting on $\Gamma$-invariant spaces of harmonic cocycles for $\mathrm{GL}_3$ for certain congruence subgroups $\Gamma$, in a positive characteristic setting. The cocycle spaces we consider are conjecturally isomorphic to spaces of Drinfeld cusp forms of rank $3$ and level $\Gamma$ via an analogue of Teitelbaum's residue map. We give explicit descriptions of the spaces of harmonic cocycles as subspaces of the vector space of coefficients, and of the resulting $U$- and Hecke operators acting on these. We then implement these formulas in a computer algebra system. Using the resulting data of slopes (and characteristic polynomials) for the Hecke actions, we observe several patterns and interesting phenomena present in our slope tables. This appears to be the first such study in a $\mathrm{GL}_3$ setting.</description>

      <title>Congruent modular forms and anticyclotomic Iwasawa theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime. Consider normalized newforms $f_1,f_2$ that both satisfy the Heegner hypothesis for an imaginary quadratic field $K$ and suppose that they induce isomorphic residual Galois representations. In the work of Greenberg-Vatsal and Emerton-Pollack-Weston, the authors compare the cyclotomic Iwasawa $\mu$ and $\lambda$-invariants of $f_1$ and $f_2$. We extend this to the anticyclotomic indefinite setting by comparing the BDP $p$-adic $L$-functions attached to $f_1$ and $f_2$. Using this comparison, we obtain arithmetic implications for both generalized Heegner cycles and the Iwasawa main conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Euler-Kronecker constants in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2006, Ihara defined and systematically studied a generalization of the Euler-Mascheroni constant for all global fields, named the Euler-Kronecker constants. This paper examines their distribution across geometric quadratic extensions of a rational global function field, via the values of logarithmic derivatives of Dirichlet $L$-functions at 1. Using a probabilistic model, we show that the values converge to a limiting distribution with a smooth, positive density function, as the genii of quadratic fields approach infinity. We then prove a discrepancy theorem for the convergence of the frequency of these values, and obtain information about the proportion of the small values. Finally, we prove omega results on the extreme values. Our theorems imply new distribution results on the stable Taguchi heights and logarithmic Weil heights of rank 2 Drinfeld modules with CM.</description>

      <title>The WZ method and flawless WZ pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Kam Cheong Au discovered a powerful methodology of finding new Wilf-Zeilberger (WZ) pairs. He calls it WZ seeds and gives numerous examples of applications to proving longstanding conjectural identities for reciprocal powers of $\pi$ and their duals for Dirichlet $L$-values. In this note we explain how a modification of Au's WZ pairs together with a classical analytic argument allows one to obtain simpler proofs of his results. We illustrate our method with a few examples elaborated with assistance of Maple code that we have developed.</description>

      <title>Sub-Weyl bound for $GL(2)$ via trivial delta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ form $f$, we obtain the sub-Weyl bound \begin{equation*} L(1/2+it,f)\ll_{f,\varepsilon} t^{1/3-\delta+\varepsilon}, \end{equation*} where $\delta=1/174$, thereby crossing the Weyl barrier for the first time beyond $GL(1)$. The proof uses a refinement of the `trivial' delta method.</description>

      <title>On imaginary quadratic fields with non-cyclic class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed abelian group $H$, let $N_H(X)$ be the number of square-free positive integers $d\leq X$ such that H is a subgroup of $CL(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d}))$. We obtain asymptotic lower bounds for $N_H(X)$ as $X\to\infty$ in two cases: $H=\mathbb{Z}/g_1\mathbb{Z}\times (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^l$ for $l\geq 2$ and $2\nmid g_1\geq 3$, $H=(\mathbb{Z}/g\mathbb{Z})^2$ for $2\nmid g\geq 5$. More precisely, for any $\epsilon &gt;0$, we showed $N_H(X)\gg X^{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{3}{2g_1+2}-\epsilon}$ when $H=\mathbb{Z}/g_1\mathbb{Z}\times (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^l$ for $l\geq 2$ and $2\nmid g_1\geq 3$. For the second case, under a well known conjecture for square-free density of integral multivariate polynomials, for any $\epsilon &gt;0$, we showed $N_H(X)\gg X^{\frac{1}{g-1}-\epsilon}$ when $H=(\mathbb{Z}/g\mathbb{Z})^2$ for $ g\geq 5$. The first case is an adaptation of Soundararajan's results for $H=\mathbb{Z}/g\mathbb{Z}$, and the second conditionally improves the bound $X^{\frac{1}{g}-\epsilon}$ due to Byeon and the bound $X^{\frac{1}{g}}/(\log X)^{2}$ due to Kulkarni and Levin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the $3$-class groups $A_n$ of the fields $F_n$ in the cyclotomic $\mathbf{Z}_3$-extensions of the real quadratic fields of discriminant $f&lt;100,000$. In all cases the orders of $A_n$ remain bounded as $n$ goes to infinity. This is in agreement with Greenberg's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Solving an infinite number of purely exponential Diophantine equations with four terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important unsolved problem in Diophantine number theory is to establish a general method to effectively find all solutions to any given $S$-unit equation with at least four terms. Although there are many works contributing to this problem in literature, most of which handle purely exponential Diophantine equations, it can be said that all of them only solve finitely many equations in a natural distinction. In this paper, we study infinitely many purely exponential Diophantine equations with four terms of consecutive bases. Our result states that all solutions to the equation $n^x+(n+1)^y+(n+2)^z=(n+3)^w$ in positive integers $n,x,y,z,w$ with $n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$ are given by $(n,x,y,z,w)=(3,3,1,1,2), (3,3,3,3,3)$. The proof uses elementary congruence arguments developed in the study of ternary case, Baker's method in both rational and $p$-adic cases, and the algorithm of Bert\'ok and Hajdu based on a variant of Skolem's conjecture on purely exponential equations.</description>

      <title>Two characterizations of Bass orders via branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been known for some time that the orders in the four dimensional matrix algebra over a local field that can be written as a finite intersection of maximal orders are precisely those whose Gorenstein closure is Eichler. In this paper, a similar characterization is given for orders whose Gorenstein closure is a Bass order. A second characterization, this time for the Bass orders themselves, is given in terms of their branches, i.e., maximal subgraphs of the Bruhat-Tits tree whose vertices are orders containing them.</description>

Abstract: W. Schmidt, H. Montgomery, and J. Beck proved a result on irregularities of distribution with respect to $d$-dimensional balls. In this paper, we extend their result to any $d$-dimensional convex body with a smooth boundary and finite order of contact. As an intermediate step, we prove a geometric inequality for the Fourier transform of the characteristic function of a convex body.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In connection with Eisenstein series for the principal congruence subgroup $\Gamma(n)$, Hecke introduced certain numbers, of which he said that they are rational and cumbersome to calculate. We show, however, that these numbers are (essentially) generators of the $n$th cyclotomic field or its maximal real subfield. They arise from the well investigated {\em cotangent numbers} by matrix inversion, which is why we call them {\em inverse cotangent numbers}. We describe them as linear combinations of roots of unity with rational coefficients in a fairly closed form, provided that $n$ is square-free. We also exhibit a formula for these numbers in terms of generalized Bernoulli numbers and Gauss sums.</description>

      <title>On nearly holomorphic Drinfeld modular forms for admissible coefficient rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective and geometrically irreducible curve over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements and $K$ be its function field. Let $\infty$ be a fixed closed point on $X$ and $A$ be the ring of functions regular away from $\infty$. In the present paper, by generalizing the previous work of Chen and the first author, we introduce the notion of nearly holomorphic Drinfeld modular forms for congruence subgroups of $GL_2(K)$ as continuous but non-holomorphic functions on a certain subdomain of the Drinfeld upper half plane. By extending the de Rham sheaf to a compactification $\overline{M_I^2}$ of the Drinfeld moduli space $M_I^2$, we also describe such forms algebraically as global sections of an explicitly described sheaf on $\overline{M_I^2}$ as well as construct a comparison isomorphism between analytic and algebraic description of them. Furthermore, we show the transcendence of special values of nearly holomorphic Drinfeld modular forms at CM points and relate them to the periods of CM Drinfeld $A$-modules.</description>

Abstract: Using an application of Schmidt's Subspace Theorem, this paper gives new transcendence criteria for rapidly converging infinite products of algebraic numbers. The paper also improves existing criteria for irrationality of products and criteria for irrationality and transcendence of infinite series.

Abstract: Let $q$ be a non-degenerate quadratic form defined on an $F$ vector space $V$ and $a \in F$. We consider the Cayley graph on $V$ with generating set $\{x \in V \mid q(x) = a\}$ and study its diameter and girth. In particular, if $F$ is a finite field, we calculate these invariants and the number of cycles of minimal length in these graphs.</description>

      <title>The Fibonacci numbers are not a Heilbronn set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01788v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a real number $\theta$, let $\Vert\theta\Vert$ denote the distance from $\theta$ to the nearest integer. A set of positive integers $\mathcal H$ is a Heilbronn set if for every $\alpha\in \mathbb R$ and every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists $h\in\mathcal H$ such that $\Vert h\alpha\Vert&lt;\epsilon$ (see \cite{montgomery} 2.7). The natural numbers are a Heilbronn set by Dirichlet's approximation theorem. Vinogradov \cite{vinogradov} showed that for a natural number $k$, the $k$th powers of integers are a Heilbronn set. In this paper we give a constructive proof that the Fibonacci sequence is not a Heilbronn set, but conversely that almost all $\alpha$ satisfy $\liminf_{n\to\infty}\Vert F_n\alpha\Vert=0$. However, we exhibit a real number $\alpha$ such that $\Vert F_n\alpha\Vert&gt;0.14$ for all $n$.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for parabolic inductions and Jacquet modules in $\mathrm{GL}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present algorithms for computing parabolic inductions and Jacquet modules for the general linear group $G$ over a non-Archimedean local field. Given the Zelevinsky data or Langlands data of an irreducible smooth representation $\pi$ of $G$ and an essentially square-integrable representation $\sigma$, we explicitly determine the Jacquet module of $\pi$ with respect to $\sigma$ and the socle of the normalized parabolic induction $\pi \times \sigma$. Our result builds on and extends some previous work of M\oe glin-Waldspurger, Jantzen, M\'inguez, and Lapid-M\'inguez, and also uses other methods such as sequences of derivatives and an exotic duality. As an application, we give a simple algorithm for computing the highest derivative multisegment.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of RSA modulus applying even order elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An efficient integer factorization algorithm would reduce the security of all variants of the RSA cryptographic scheme to zero. Despite the passage of years, no method for efficiently factoring large semiprime numbers in a classical computational model has been discovered. In this paper, we demonstrate how a natural extension of the generalized approach to smoothness, combined with the separation of $2$-adic point orders, leads us to propose a factoring algorithm that finds (conjecturally) the prime decomposition $N = pq$ in subexponential time $L(\sqrt 2+o(1), \min(p,q))$. This approach motivated by the papers \cite{Len}, \cite{MMV} and \cite{PoZo} is based on a more careful investigation of pairs $(E,Q)$, where $Q$ is a point on an elliptic curve $E$ over $\Z _N$. Specifically, in contrast to the familiar condition that the largest prime divisor $P^+(\ord Q_p)$ of the reduced order $\ord Q_p$ does not divide $\#E(\F_q)$ we focus on the relation between $P^+(\ord Q_r)$ and the smallest prime number $l_{\min}(E,Q)$ separating the orders $\ord Q_p$ and $\ord Q_q$. We focus on the ${\calE}_2$ family of even order elliptic curves over $\Z_N$ since then the condition $l_{\min}(E,Q)\le 2$ holds true for large fraction of points $(x,y)\in E(\Z_N)$. Moreover if we know the pair $(E,Q)$ such that $P^+(\ord Q_r)\le t&lt;l_{\min}(E,Q)$ and $d=\max_{r\in \{p,q\}}(\ord Q_r)$ is large in comparison to $\min_{r\in \{p,q\}}|a_r(E)|\neq 0$ then we can decompose $N$ in deterministic time $t^{1+o(1)}$ by representing $N$ in base $d$.</description>

Abstract: We describe the asymptotic behavior of weighted factorization lengths on numerical semigroups. Our approach is geometric as opposed to analytic, explains the presence of Curry-Schoenberg B-splines as limiting distributions, and provides explicit error bounds (no implied constants left unspecified). Along the way, we explicitly bound the difference between the vector partition function and the number of integer points in the variable polytope for a $2 \times k$ matrix.</description>

Abstract: The separating Noether number $\beta_{\mathrm{sep}}(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is the minimal positive integer $d$ such that for every $G$-module $V$ there is a separating set of degree $\leq d$. In this manuscript, we investigate the separating Noether number $\beta_{\mathrm{sep}}(G)$. Among others, we obtain the exact value of $\beta_{\mathrm{sep}}(G)$ for finite abelian groups $G$, when either $G$ is a $p$-group or $\mathsf r(G)\in \{3,5\}$.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Lambda\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ be a lattice and let $Z\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ be a definable family in an o-minimal expansion of the real field, $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. A result of Barroero and Widmer gives sharp estimates for the number of lattice points in the fibers $Z_T=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n:(T,x)\in Z\}$. Here we give an effective version of this result for a family definable in a sharply o-minimal structure expanding $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. We also give an effective version of the Barroero and Widmer statement for sets definable in $\mathbb{R}_{\exp}$ by some existential formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize Cohen--Macaulay and $\varphi$-rational perfect schemes in terms of their perverse \'etale mod $p$ sheaves. Using inversion of adjunction, we prove that sufficiently small Schubert varieties in the Witt affine flag variety are perfections of globally $+$-regular varieties, and hence they are $\varphi$-rational. Our methods apply uniformly to all affine Schubert varieties in equicharacteristic, as well as classical Schubert varieties, thereby answering a question of Bhatt. As a corollary, we deduce that scheme-theoretic local models always have $\varphi$-split special fiber.</description>

      <title>Towards Graham's rearrangement conjecture via rainbow paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an old question in combinatorial group theory which can be traced back to a conjecture of Graham from 1971. Given a group $\Gamma$, and some subset $S\subseteq \Gamma$, is it possible to permute $S$ as $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_d$ so that the partial products $\prod_{1 \leq i \leq t} s_i$, $t\in [d]$ are all distinct? Most of the progress towards this problem has been in the case when $\Gamma$ is a cyclic group. We show that for any group $\Gamma$ and any $S \subseteq \Gamma$, there is a permutation of $S$ where all but a vanishing proportion of the partial products are distinct, thereby establishing the first asymptotic version of Graham's conjecture under no restrictions on $\Gamma$ or $S$.
  To do so, we explore a natural connection between Graham's problem and the following very natural question attributed to Schrijver. Given a $d$-regular graph $G$ properly edge-coloured with $d$ colours, is it always possible to find a rainbow path with $d-1$ edges? We settle this question asymptotically by showing one can find a rainbow path of length $d - o(d)$. While this has immediate applications to Graham's question for example when $\Gamma = \mathbb{F}_2^k$, our general result above requires a more involved result we obtain for the natural directed analogue of Schrijver's question.</description>

      <title>Analytic Continuation of Divergent Integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.06272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the improper integral of the monomial \(\mu(s) = \int_1^{\infty} x^{-s} \,dx \) as a continuous analogue of the infinite series representation of the Riemann $\zeta$-function, \(\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{-s}\). Both the monomial integral and the corresponding series converge for \(\mathrm{Re}(s) &gt; 1\) and diverge for \(s \in \mathbb{C}\) with \(\mathrm{Re}(s) \leq 1\). In this paper, we construct an analytic continuation of the divergent monomial integral to the entire complex plane, excluding a simple pole at \(s = 1\), mirroring the analytic continuation of the $\zeta$-function. By performing term-by-term integration of the monomial over successive integer intervals and leveraging Newton's generalization of the binomial theorem, we express the improper integral as a Dirichlet series. This approach establishes an elegant relationship between the \(\mu\)-function and the \(\zeta\)-function, leading to a functional equation that extends the divergent integral through analytic continuation and that the \(\mu\)-function is holomorphic everywhere except at \(s = 1\).</description>

      <title>An analogue of Kida's formula in graph theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\ell$ be a rational prime and let $p:Y\rightarrow X$ be a Galois cover of finite graphs whose Galois group is a finite $\ell$-group. Consider a $\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}$-tower above $X$ and its pullback along $p$. Assuming that all the graphs in the pullback are connected, one obtains a $\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}$-tower above $Y$. Under the assumption that the Iwasawa $\mu$-invariant of the tower above $X$ vanishes, we prove a formula relating the Iwasawa $\lambda$-invariant of the $\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}$-tower above $X$ to the Iwasawa $\lambda$-invariant of the pullback. This formula is analogous to Kida's formula in classical Iwasawa theory. We present an application to the study of structural properties of certain noncommutative pro-$\ell$ towers of graphs, based on an analogy with classical results of Cuoco on the growth of Iwasawa invariants in $\mathbb{Z}_\ell^2$-extensions of number fields. Our investigations are illustrated by explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Admissible pairs and $p$-adic Hodge structures II: The bi-analytic Ax-Lindemann theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reinterpret and generalize the construction of local Shimura varieties and their non-minuscule analogs by viewing them as moduli spaces of admissible pairs. Our main application is a bi-analytic Ax-Lindemann theorem comparing, in the basic case, rigid analytic subvarieties for the two distinct analytic structures induced by the Hodge and Hodge-Tate period maps and their lattice refinements. The theorem implies, in particular, that the only bi-analytic subdiamonds are special subvarieties, generalizing the bi-analytic characterization of special points given in Part I. These results suggest that there is a purely local, $p$-adic theory of bi-analytic geometry that runs in parallel to the global, archimedean theory of bi-algebraic geometry arising in the study of unlikely intersection and functional transcendence for Shimura varieties and more general period domains for variations of Hodge structure.</description>

      <title>Admissible pairs and $p$-adic Hodge structures I: Transcendence of the de Rham lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an algebraically closed non-archimedean extension $C/\mathbb{Q}_p$, we define a Tannakian category of $p$-adic Hodge structures over $C$ that is a local, $p$-adic analog of the global, archimedean category of $\mathbb{Q}$-Hodge structures in complex geometry. In this setting the filtrations of classical Hodge theory must be enriched to lattices over a complete discrete valuation ring, Fontaine's integral de Rham period ring $B^+_\mathrm{dR}$, and a pure $p$-adic Hodge structure is then a $\mathbb{Q}_p$-vector space equipped with a $B^+_\mathrm{dR}$-lattice satisfying a natural condition analogous to the transversality of the complex Hodge filtration with its conjugate. We show $p$-adic Hodge structures are equivalent to a full subcategory of basic objects in the category of admissible pairs, a toy category of cohomological motives over $C$ that is equivalent to the isogeny category of rigidified Breuil-Kisin-Fargues modules and closely related to Fontaine's $p$-adic Hodge theory over $p$-adic subfields. As an application, we characterize basic admissible pairs with complex multiplication in terms of the transcendence of $p$-adic periods. This generalizes an earlier result for one-dimensional formal groups and is an unconditional, local, $p$-adic analog of a global, archimedean characterization of CM motives over $\mathbb{C}$ conditional on the standard conjectures, the Hodge conjecture, and the Grothendieck period conjecture (known unconditionally for abelian varieties by work Cohen and Shiga and Wolfart).</description>

      <title>Motivic Gauss and Jacobi sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Gauss and Jacobi sums from a viewpoint of motives. We exhibit isomorphisms between Chow motives arising from the Artin-Schreier curve and the Fermat varieties over a finite field, that can be regarded as (and yield a new proof of) classically known relations among Gauss and Jacobi sums such as Davenport-Hasse's multiplication formula. As a key step, we define motivic analogues of the Gauss and Jacobi sums as algebraic correspondences, and show that they represent the Frobenius endomorphisms of such motives. This generalizes Coleman's result for curves. These results are applied to investigate the group of invertible Chow motives with coefficients in a cyclotomic field.</description>

      <title>Lifting Galois representations via Kummer flags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be either i) the absolute Galois group of a local field $F$, or ii) the topological fundamental group of a closed connected orientable surface of genus $g$. In case i), assume that $\mu_{p^2} \subset F$. We give an elementary and unified proof that every representation $\rho_1: \Gamma \to \mathbf{GL}_d(\mathbb{F}_p)$ lifts to a representation $\rho_2: \Gamma \to \mathbf{GL}_d(\mathbb{Z}/p^2)$. [In case i), it is understood these are continuous.] The actual statement is much stronger: for all $r \geq 1$, under "suitable" assumptions, triangular representations $\rho_r: \Gamma \to \mathbf{B}_d(\mathbb{Z}/p^r)$ lift to $\rho_{r+1}: \Gamma \to \mathbf{B}_d(\mathbb{Z}/p^{r+1})$, in the strongest possible step-by-step sense. Here "suitable" is made precise by the concept of $\textit{Kummer flag}$. An essential aspect of this work, is to identify the common properties of groups i) and ii), that suffice to ensure the existence of such lifts.</description>

      <title>Weighted sieves with switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weighted sieves are used to detect numbers with at most $S$ prime factors with $S \in \mathbb{N}$ as small as possible. When one studies problems with two variables in somewhat symmetric roles (such as Chen primes, that is primes $p$ such that $p+2$ has at most two prime factors), one can utilize the switching principle. Here we discuss how different sieve weights work in such a situation, concentrating in particular on detecting a prime along with a product of at most three primes.
  As applications, we improve on the works of Yang and Harman concerning Diophantine approximation with a prime and an almost prime, and prove that, in general, one can find a pair $(p, P_3)$ when both the original and the switched problem have level of distribution at least $0.267$.</description>

      <title>Weil-Barsotti formula for $\mathbf{T}$-modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the work of M. A. Papanikolas and N. Ramachandran [A Weil-Barsotti formula for Drinfeld modules, Journal of Number Theory 98, (2003), 407-431] the Weil-Barsotti formula for the function field case concerning $\Ext_{\tau}^1(E,C)$ where $E$ is a Drinfeld module and $C$ is the Carlitz module was proved. We generalize this formula to the case where $E$ is a strictly pure \tm module $\Phi$ with the zero nilpotent matrix $N_\Phi.$ For such a \tm module $\Phi$ we explicitly compute its dual \tm module ${\Phi}^{\vee}$ as well as its double dual ${\Phi}^{{\vee}{\vee}}.$ This computation is done in a a subtle way by combination of the \tm reduction algorithm developed by F. G{\l}och, D.E. K{\k e}dzierski, P. Kraso{\'n} [ Algorithms for determination of \tm module structures on some extension groups , arXiv:2408.08207] and the methods of the work of D.E. K{\k e}dzierski and P. Kraso{\'n} [On $\Ext^1$ for Drinfeld modules, Journal of Number Theory 256 (2024) 97-135]. We also give a counterexample to the Weil-Barsotti formula if the nilpotent matrix $N_{\Phi}$ is non-zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the average number of surjections from class groups of quadratic function fields over $\mathbb F_q(t)$ onto finite odd order groups $H$, once $q$ is sufficiently large. These yield the first known moments of these class groups, as predicted by the Cohen--Lenstra heuristics, apart from the case $H = \mathbb Z/3\mathbb Z$. The key input to this result is a topological one, where we compute the stable rational homology groups of Hurwitz spaces associated to non-splitting conjugacy classes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we provide a detailed study on effective versions of the celebrated Bilu's equidistribution theorem for Galois orbits of sequences of points of small height in the $N$-dimensional algebraic torus, identifying the qualitative dependence of the convergence in terms of the regularity of the test functions considered. We develop a general Fourier analysis framework that extends previous results obtained by Petsche (2005), and by D'Andrea, Narv\'aez-Clauss and Sombra (2017).</description>

      <title>Enhanced Algorithms for the Representation of integers by Binary Quadratic forms: Reduction to Subset Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present efficient algorithms for solving the Diophantine equation $f(x, y) = m$ for an arbitrary definite binary quadratic form $f$, given the factorization of $m$. While Cornacchia's algorithm to solve $x^2 + dy^2 = m$ is efficient in many cases, its runtime becomes exponentially large when $m$ is highly composite and encounters subtleties when generalized to arbitrary forms $f$. To address these issues, we give a reduction from our problem to an instance of the Subset sum, a weakly NP complete problem, allowing for more efficient solutions. Leveraging this approach, we develop deterministic algorithms that adapt to different cases based on $\mathrm{disc}(f)$ and $ m $. In particular, when $|\mathrm{disc}(f)| = \mathrm{polylog}(m) $, we provide a polynomial time solution that remains efficient regardless of the structure of $ m $. For more general cases, we present an algorithm that improves upon Cornacchia's method, achieving a quadratic speedup. Recently, the problem of representing integers by a form $ f $ found important applications in elliptic curves and isogeny based cryptography, where these algorithms are central to solving norm form equations.</description>

      <title>Mixed Berndt-Type Integrals and Generalized Barnes Multiple Zeta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we define and study four families of Berndt-type integrals, called mixed Berndt-type integrals, which contains (hyperbolic) sine and cosine functions in the integrand function. By contour integration, these integrals are first converted to some hyperbolic (infinite) sums of Ramanujan type, all of which can be calculated in closed forms by comparing both the Fourier series expansions and the Maclaurin series expansions of a few Jacobi elliptic functions. These sums can be expressed as rational polynomials of {\Gamma}(1/4) and {\pi}^{-1} which give rise to the closed formulas of the mixed Berndt-type integrals we are interested in. Moreover, we also present some interesting consequences and illustrative examples. Further, we define a generalized Barnes multiple zeta function, and find a classic integral representation of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function. Furthermore, we give an alternative evaluation of the mixed Berndt-type integrals in terms of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function. Finally, we obtain some direct evaluations of rational linear combinations of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Kundu--Ray, following from the $p$-adic Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for supersingular primes by Bernardi--Perrin-Riou and Kato's Main Conjecture, predicting an expression for the leading term (up to a $p$-adic unit) of a characteristic power series of Kobayashi's signed Selmer groups attached to elliptic curves $E/\mathbb{Q}$ with supersingular reduction at a prime $p&gt;2$ with $a_p=0$. The proof is deduced from a similar formula due to Perrin-Riou for a generator of her module of arithmetic $p$-adic $L$-functions with values in the Dieudonn\'{e} module of $E$.</description>

      <title>On the Smallest Support Size of Integer Solutions to Linear Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study the size of the support of integer solutions to linear equations $Ax=b, ~x\in\Z^n$ where $A\in\Z^{m\times n}, b\in\Z^n$. We give an upper bound on the smallest support size as a function of $A$, taken as a worst case over all $b$ such that the above system has a solution. This bound is asymptotically tight, and in fact matches the bound given in Aliev, Averkov, De Loera and Oertel Mathematical Programming 2022, while the proof presented here is simpler, relying only on linear algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of a diagonalization technique for multivariate homogeneous polynomials, that is, expressing them as sums of powers of independent linear forms. It is based on Harrison's center theory and consists of a criterion and a diagonalization algorithm. Detailed formulations and computational complexity of each component of the technique are given. The complexity analysis focuses on the impacts of the number of variables and the degree of given polynomials. We show that this criterion runs in polynomial time and the diagonalization process performs efficiently in numerical experiments. Other diagonalization techniques are reviewed and compared in terms of complexity.</description>

Abstract: We construct a new type of spectral sequences for the mixed Hodge structures on the cohomology of locally symmetric varieties. These spectral sequences converge to the edge components in the Hodge triangles, and the E1-terms are expressed by group cohomology associated to the cusps. They already degenerate at E1 in a certain range, which gives a simple expression of some Hodge components. An identity of holomorphic Euler numbers is obtained as a consequence.</description>

      <title>Transposes in the $q$-deformed modular group and their applications to $q$-deformed rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (right) \textit{q}-deformed rational numbers was originally introduced by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko, and its left variant by Bapat, Becker and Licata. These notions are based on continued fractions and the \textit{q}-deformed modular group actions. For any matrix in this group, Leclere and Morier-Genoud showed that its trace is a palindromic polynomial whose coefficients are all non-negative (up to $\pm q^{N}$ times ). In this paper, we define the \textit{$q$-transpose} for matrices in this group. Using this, we give new proofs of the above result and some others. We also give arithmetic properties on the left \textit{q}-rational numbers. Finally, we show that the conjecture of Kantarc{\i} O\u{g}uz on circular fence posets implies a conjecture on the normalized Jones polynomials of rational links.</description>

In particular, for pro-2 real projective groups we provide a presentation in terms of generators and relations, and a purely cohomological characterisation. As a consequence we explicitly reconstruct such groups from their mod 2 cohomology rings.</description>
