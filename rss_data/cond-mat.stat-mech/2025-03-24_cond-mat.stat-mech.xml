      <title>Ergodic behaviors in reversible 3-state cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical cellular automata represent a class of explicit discrete spacetime lattice models in which complex large-scale phenomena emerge from simple deterministic rules. With the goal to uncover different physically distinct classes of ergodic behavior, we perform a systematic study of three-state cellular automata (with a stable `vacuum' state and `particles' with $\pm$ charges). The classification is aided by the automata's different transformation properties under discrete symmetries: charge conjugation, spatial parity and time reversal. In particular, we propose a simple classification that distinguishes between types and levels of ergodic behavior in such system as quantified by the following observables: the mean return time, the number of conserved quantities, and the scaling of correlation functions. In each of the physically distinct classes, we present examples and discuss some of their phenomenology. This includes chaotic or ergodic dynamics, phase-space fragmentation, Ruelle-Pollicott resonances, existence of quasilocal charges, and anomalous transport with a variety of dynamical exponents.</description>

      <title>Lower limit of percolation threshold on a square lattice with complex neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the 60-year-old concept of long-range interaction in percolation problems introduced by Dalton, Domb, and Sykes, is reconsidered. With Monte Carlo simulation -- based on Newman-Ziff algorithm and finite-size scaling hypothesis -- we estimate 64 percolation thresholds for random site percolation problem on a square lattice with neighborhoods that contain sites from the 7th coordination zone. The percolation thresholds obtained range from 0.27013 (for the neighborhood that contains only sites from the 7th coordination zone) to 0.11535 (for the neighborhood that contains all sites from the 1st to the 7th coordination zone). Similarly to neighborhoods with smaller ranges, the power-law dependence of the percolation threshold on the effective coordination number with exponent close to -1/2 is observed. Finally, we empirically determine the limit of the percolation threshold on square lattices with complex neighborhoods. This limit scales with the inverse square of the mean radius of the neighborhood. The boundary of this limit is touched for threshold values associated with extended (compact) neighborhoods.</description>

      <title>Partition function for position-dependent mass systems from superestatistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show a connection between superstatistics and position-dependent mass (PDM) systems in the context of the canonical ensemble. The key point is to set the fluctuation distribution of the inverse temperature in terms od the system PDM. For PDMs associated to Tsallis and Kaniadakis nonextensive statistics, the pressure and entropy of the ideal gas result lower than the standard case but maintaining monotonic behavior. Gas of non-interacting harmonic oscillators provided with quadratic and exponential PDMs exhibit a behavior of standard ED harmonic oscillator gas and a linear specific heat respectively, the latter being consistent with Nernst's third law of thermodynamics. Thus, a combined PDM-superstatistics scenario offers an alternative way to study the effects of the inhomogeneities of PDM systems in their thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Coarsening in the Persistent Voter Model: analytical results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the coarsening dynamics of a simplified version of the persistent voter model in which an agent can become a zealot -- i.e. resistent to change opinion -- at each step, based on interactions with its nearest neighbors. We show that such a model captures the main features of the original, non-Markovian, persistent voter model. We derive the governing equations for the one-point and two-point correlation functions. As these equations do not form a closed set, we employ approximate closure schemes, whose validity was confirmed through numerical simulations. Analytical solutions to these equations are obtained and well agree with the numerical results.</description>

      <title>Observation of a generalized Gibbs ensemble in photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In generic classical and quantum many-body systems, where typically energy and particle number are the only conserved quantities, stationary states are described by thermal equilibrium. In contrast, integrable systems showcase an infinite hierarchy of conserved quantities that inhibits conventional thermalization, forcing relaxation to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), a concept first introduced in quantum many-body physics. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the emergence of a GGE in a photonic system. By investigating partially coherent waves propagating in a normal dispersion optical fiber, governed by the one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we directly measure the density of states of the spectral parameter (rapidity) to confirm the time invariance of the full set of conserved charges. We also observe the relaxation of optical power statistics to the GGE's theoretical prediction, obtained using the experimentally measured density of states. These complementary measurements unambiguously establish the formation of a GGE in our photonic platform, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for probing many-body integrability and bridging classical and quantum integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent lattice Monte Carlo method for active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing interest in the thermodynamic cost of dissipative structures formed by active particles. Given the strong finite-size effects of such systems, it is essential to develop efficient numerical approaches that discretize both space and time while preserving the original dynamics and thermodynamics of active particles in the continuum limit. To address this challenge, we propose two thermodynamically consistent kinetic Monte Carlo methods for active lattice gases, both of which correctly reproduce the continuum dynamics. One method follows the conventional Kawasaki dynamics, while the other incorporates an extra state-dependent prefactor in the transition rate to more accurately capture the self-propulsion velocity. We find that the error scales linearly with time step size and that the state-dependent prefactor improves accuracy at high P\'{e}clet numbers by a factor of $\mathrm{Pe}^2$. Our results are supported by rigorous proof of convergence as well as extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Wall torque controls curvature-driven propulsion in bacterial baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The persistent dynamics of active particles makes them explore extended portions of an obstacle's boundary during collisions. From impact to escape, the net applied forces depend on the curvature of the wall and increase in the presence of concave features. Here we systematically investigate the forces exerted by swimming bacteria on microfabricated structures, where the radii of curvature can be varied parametrically. We find that these micro-sails are propelled with a speed that scales linearly with curvature and is directed from concave to convex side along the axis of symmetry. By solving the collision problem for microswimmers with aligning torque interactions, we demonstrate that, unlike spherical active particles, curvature mainly affects cell orientation during sliding, leading to greater normal thrust on the concave side and an net applied thrust that scales linearly with curvature.</description>

      <title>The inconvenient truth about flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reanalyze the hydrodynamic theory of "flock" that is, polar ordered "dry" active fluids in two dimensions. For "Malthusian" flocks, in which birth and death cause the density to relax quickly, thereby eliminating density as a hydrodynamic variable, we are able to obtain two exact scaling laws relating the three scaling exponents characterizing the long-distance properties of these systems. We also show that it is highly plausible that such flocks display long-range order in two dimensions. In addition, we demonstrate that for "immortal" flocks, in which the number of flockers is conserved, the extra non-linearities allowed by the presence of an extra slow variable (number density) make it impossible to obtain any exact scaling relations between the exponents. We thereby demonstrate that several past published claims of exact exponents for Malthusian and immortal flocks are all incorrect.</description>

      <title>Geometrical fingerprints of shear transformation zones in network glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oxide glasses have the structure of disordered covalent networks that are accountable for their mechanical response. Identifying the topological phenomena of the elastic structural response, we statistically backpropagate local regions that have the highest susceptibility of rearrangement. Shear transformation zones in network glasses highly correlate with regions of the highest variance in their bond stretch distributions projected into the direction of macroscopic deformation. However, directional influence is significantly less essential than bond stretch variance, which shows that shear transformation zones in network glasses are mainly state-dependent. Exclusively depending on the local geometry of the initial material state, our indicators are physically informing and can be evaluated directly from images with insignificant computational effort.</description>

      <title>The Energy Barrier of Precritical Nuclei in Hard Spheres is Consistent with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on the origins of this discrepancy due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy.
  Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of \emph{pre--critical} nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been directly compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.</description>

      <title>Collective Foraging and Behavioural Syndromes in Ants: First-Passage Statistics with Heterogeneous Walkers on a Honeycomb Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavioral heterogeneities in animals, also known as syndromes, play a crucial role in understanding how natural populations flexibly adapt to environmental changes. In ant species like \textit{Aphaenogaster senilis}, two key roles in collective foraging are commonly recognised: scouts, who discover food patches, and recruits, who exploit these patches and transport food back to the nest. These roles involve distinct movement patterns and exploratory behaviours. In this chapter, we develop a correlated random walk model on a bounded honeycomb lattice to interpret and replicate empirical observations of foraging ants in an enclosed arena with honeycomb tiling. We do so by extending the theory of first-passage processes for $\mathcal{N}$ random walkers when individuals belong to a heterogeneous population. We apply this theory to examine how individual behavioural heterogeneity in ants affects collective foraging efficiency, focusing on first-passage time statistics for nest-to-patch and patch-to-patch movements. With the combined use of the mathematical model and the controlled experimental setup we evaluate (i) the impact of distinct movement strategies by scouts and recruits on finding food items and (ii) whether ants practice strict central place foraging or utilise previously discovered patches as starting points for further exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Schr\"odinger bridge is the most probable time-dependent probability distribution that connects an initial probability distribution $w_{i}$ to a final one $w_{f}$. The problem has been solved and widely used for the case of simple Brownian evolution (non-interacting particles). It is related to the problem of entropy regularized Wasserstein optimal transport. In this article, we generalize Brownian bridges to systems of interacting particles. We derive some equations for the forward and backward single particle ``wave-functions'' which allow to compute the most probable evolution of the single-particle probability between the initial and final distributions.</description>

      <title>The classical limit of Quantum Max-Cut</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known in physics that the limit of large quantum spin $S$ should be understood as a semiclassical limit. This raises the question of whether such emergent classicality facilitates the approximation of computationally hard quantum optimization problems, such as the local Hamiltonian problem. We demonstrate this explicitly for spin-$S$ generalizations of Quantum Max-Cut ($\mathrm{QMaxCut}_S$), equivalent to the problem of finding the ground state energy of an arbitrary spin-$S$ quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet ($\mathrm{QHA}_S$). We prove that approximating the value of $\mathrm{QHA}_S$ to inverse polynomial accuracy is QMA-complete for all $S$, extending previous results for $S=1/2$. We also present two distinct families of classical approximation algorithms for $\mathrm{QMaxCut}_S$ based on rounding the output of a semidefinite program to a product of Bloch coherent states. The approximation ratios for both our proposed algorithms strictly increase with $S$ and converge to the Bri\"et-Oliveira-Vallentin approximation ratio $\alpha_{\mathrm{BOV}} \approx 0.956$ from below as $S \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Opinion inertia and coarsening in the Persistent Voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Persistent Voter model (PVM), a variant of the Voter model (VM) that includes transient, dynamically-induced zealots. Due to peer reinforcement, the internal confidence $\eta_i$ of a normal voter increases by steps of size $\Delta\eta$ and once it gets above a given threshold, it becomes a zealot. Then, its opinion remains frozen until enough interactions with the opposite opinion occur and its confidence is reset. No longer a zealot, the regular voter may change opinion once again. This opinion inertia mechanism, albeit simplified, is responsible for an effective surface tension and the PVM has a crossover from a fluctuation-driven dynamics, as in the VM, to a curvature-driven one, as in the Ising Model at low temperature (IM0). The average time $\tau$ to attain consensus is non-monotonic on $\Delta\eta$ and has a minimum at $\Delta\eta_{\min}$. In this paper we clarify the mechanisms that accelerate the system towards consensus close to $\Delta\eta_{\min}$. Close to the crossover at $\Delta\eta_{\min}$, the intermediate region around the domains where the regular voters accumulate (the active region, AR) is large and the surface tension, albeit small, is still enough to keep the shape and reduce the fragmentation of the domains. The large size of the AR in the region of $\Delta\eta_{\min}$ has two important effects that accelerates the dynamics. First, it dislodges the zealots in the bulk of the domains and second, it maximally suppresses the slowly-evolving stripes that normally form in Ising-like models. This suggests the importance of understanding the role of the AR, where the change of opinion is facilitated, and the interplay between regular voters and zealots when attempting to disrupt polarized states.</description>

Abstract: Fractal geometry presents us with a self-similarity in their pattern at various length scales that is prevalent in our natural world. We present theoretical model of a Sierpinski gasket (SPG) fractal geometry with a deterministic perturbation in the form of a hierarchical distribution of magnetic flux. Such flux configuration induces a deterministic disorder in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases picked up by the electron wavefunction. Using the tight-binding formalism, we show that by tunning the strength of the hierarchy parameter of those AB phases, one can systematically engineer quantum states in a SPG fractal lattice. In addition to this, we have also observed that by controlling the strength of this hierarchy parameter in the magnetic flux, one can effectively regulate the persistent current in the SPG fractal structure. This characteristic is found to be true for various filling factors. Our results could be useful for designing nanoelectronic devices using molecular fractal structures fabricated by chemical synthesis technique.</description>

      <title>Angle-dependent planar thermal Hall effect by quasi-ballistic phonons in black phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the phonon thermal Hall effect in insulators is a matter of ongoing debate. The large amplitude of the signal in an elemental non-magnetic solid, such as black phosphorus (BP), calls for a minimal mechanism not invoking the spin degree of freedom. Here, we show that a longitudinal heat flow generates a transverse temperature gradient in BP even when the magnetic field, the heat current and the thermal gradient lie in the same plane. The phonon mean-free-path is close to the sample thickness. Therefore, it is unlikely that scattering by point-like symmetry-breaking defects play a major role. We show that the angular dependence of the signal can be mapped to the sum of two sinusoidal components each peaking when the magnetic field is parallel to a high symmetry. We propose that anharmonicity may play a major role and argue that the magnetic field can exert a torque on electric dipolar waves traveling with phonons.</description>

      <title>Persistent oscillation of a Cooper-pair condensate of topological defects in a nonintegrable quantum Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify persistent oscillations in a nonintegrable quantum Ising chain. In the integrable chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, the nature, origin, and decay of post-transition oscillations are tied to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Remarkably, when coupling to the next-nearest neighbor is added, the resulting nonintegrable ''zigzag'' chain (still in the quantum Ising universality class) supports persistent oscillation: Topological defects (kinks) appear as a result of the quantum phase transition. However, in a ''zigzag'' Ising chain defects can form Cooper pairs. The oscillation of the Cooper-pair condensate has a frequency that depends on the binding energy gap between the paired and the unpaired defects, so it can be excited by resonant driving. While one might have expected that the integrability-breaking ''zigzag'' coupling causes relaxation, the oscillations we identify are persistent: Their longevity in our simulations is likely limited only by numerical accuracy. This oscillation of the Cooper-pair condensate of kinks is a manifestation of quantum coherence and should be experimentally accessible.</description>

      <title>An analog of topological entanglement entropy for mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the convex-roof extension of quantum conditional mutual information ("co(QCMI)") as a diagnostic of topological order in a mixed state. We focus primarily on topological states subjected to local decoherence, and employ the Levin-Wen scheme to define co(QCMI), so that for a pure state, co(QCMI) equals topological entanglement entropy (TEE). By construction, co(QCMI) is zero if and only if a mixed state can be decomposed as a convex sum of pure states with zero TEE. We show that co(QCMI) is non-increasing with increasing decoherence when Kraus operators are proportional to the product of onsite unitaries. This implies that unlike a pure state transition between a topologically trivial and a non-trivial phase, the long-range entanglement at a decoherence-induced topological phase transition as quantified by co(QCMI) is less than or equal to that in the proximate topological phase. For the 2d toric code decohered by onsite bit/phase-flip noise, we show that co(QCMI) is non-zero below the error-recovery threshold and zero above it. Relatedly, the decohered state cannot be written as a convex sum of short-range entangled pure states below the threshold. We conjecture and provide evidence that in this example, co(QCMI) equals TEE of a recently introduced pure state. In particular, we develop a tensor-assisted Monte Carlo (TMC) computation method to efficiently evaluate the R\'enyi TEE for the aforementioned pure state and provide non-trivial consistency checks for our conjecture. We use TMC to also calculate the universal scaling dimension of the anyon-condensation order parameter at this transition.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scaling of connectivity metrics in river networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rivers exhibit fractal-like properties that are associated with scaling laws linking geometry and size. The optimal channel network (OCN) model, which is a mathematically tractable representation of river networks often used in theoretical studies, is based on the fractal properties of rivers and consequently reproduces geometric scaling laws. However, purely geometric relationships may not fully capture the interaction between river structure and species' movement strategies that is most relevant to many large-scale ecological processes. In contrast, connectivity, which is a concept that blends habitat geometry and individual movement, has been shown both theoretically and empirically to influence relevant large-scale ecological outcomes across a broad array of ecosystems. Here, we analyze networks from more than 1000 major rivers around the world, including the Amazon, Mississippi, and Nile, to investigate how river network connectivity metrics scale with system size. Specifically, we found clear power-law scaling of both the harmonic centrality and betweenness centrality network connectivity metrics. To assess the extent to which OCNs can capture these empirical connectivity patterns, we generated synthetic river networks by fitting an OCN model to each real river. We found excellent agreement between empirical and OCN-based scaling laws, supporting the notion that OCNs can accurately represent rivers in network-based models and analyses. Finally, we examined the robustness of the connectivity scaling laws to species movement strategies ranging from ideal shortest-path navigation to suboptimal random-path navigation. Surprisingly, we found that random navigation breaks the power-law scaling relationship for harmonic centrality, but not for betweenness centrality.</description>
