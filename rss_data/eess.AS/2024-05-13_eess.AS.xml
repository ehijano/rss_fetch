      <title>IPDnet: A Universal Direct-Path IPD Estimation Network for Sound Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting direct-path spatial feature is crucial for sound source localization in adverse acoustic environments. This paper proposes the IPDnet, a neural network that estimates direct-path inter-channel phase difference (DP-IPD) of sound sources from microphone array signals. The estimated DP-IPD can be easily translated to source location based on the known microphone array geometry. First, a full-band and narrow-band fusion network is proposed for DP-IPD estimation, in which alternating narrow-band and full-band layers are responsible for estimating the rough DP-IPD information in one frequency band and capturing the frequency correlations of DP-IPD, respectively. Second, a new multi-track DP-IPD learning target is proposed for the localization of flexible number of sound sources. Third, the IPDnet is extend to handling variable microphone arrays, once trained which is able to process arbitrary microphone arrays with different number of channels and array topology. Experiments of multiple-moving-speaker localization are conducted on both simulated and real-world data, which show that the proposed full-band and narrow-band fusion network and the proposed multi-track DP-IPD learning target together achieves excellent sound source localization performance. Moreover, the proposed variable-array model generalizes well to unseen microphone arrays.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Speech Enhancement Systems Through Listening Effort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding degraded speech is demanding, requiring increased listening effort (LE). Evaluating processed and unprocessed speech with respect to LE can objectively indicate if speech enhancement systems benefit listeners. However, existing methods for measuring LE are complex and not widely applicable. In this study, we propose a simple method to evaluate speech intelligibility and LE simultaneously without additional strain on subjects or operators. We assess this method using results from two independent studies in Norway and Denmark, testing 76 (50+26) subjects across 9 (6+3) processing conditions. Despite differences in evaluation setups, subject recruitment, and processing systems, trends are strikingly similar, demonstrating the proposed method's robustness and ease of implementation into existing practices.</description>

      <title>Music Emotion Prediction Using Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of recurrent neural networks to recognize emotions conveyed in music, aiming to enhance music recommendation systems and support therapeutic interventions by tailoring music to fit listeners' emotional states. We utilize Russell's Emotion Quadrant to categorize music into four distinct emotional regions and develop models capable of accurately predicting these categories. Our approach involves extracting a comprehensive set of audio features using Librosa and applying various recurrent neural network architectures, including standard RNNs, Bidirectional RNNs, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Initial experiments are conducted using a dataset of 900 audio clips, labeled according to the emotional quadrants. We compare the performance of our neural network models against a set of baseline classifiers and analyze their effectiveness in capturing the temporal dynamics inherent in musical expression. The results indicate that simpler RNN architectures may perform comparably or even superiorly to more complex models, particularly in smaller datasets. We've also applied the following experiments on larger datasets: one is augmented based on our original dataset, and the other is from other sources. This research not only enhances our understanding of the emotional impact of music but also demonstrates the potential of neural networks in creating more personalized and emotionally resonant music recommendation and therapy systems.</description>

      <title>Time-of-arrival Estimation and Phase Unwrapping of Head-related Transfer Functions With Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In binaural audio synthesis, aligning head-related impulse responses (HRIRs) in time has been an important pre-processing step, enabling accurate spatial interpolation and efficient data compression. The maximum correlation time delay between spatially nearby HRIRs has previously been used to get accurate and smooth alignment by solving a matrix equation in which the solution has the minimum Euclidean distance to the time delay. However, the Euclidean criterion could lead to an over-smoothing solution in practice. In this paper, we solve the smoothing issue by formulating the task as solving an integer linear programming problem equivalent to minimising an $L^1$-norm. Moreover, we incorporate 1) the cross-correlation of inter-aural HRIRs, and 2) HRIRs with their minimum-phase responses to have more reference measurements for optimisation. We show the proposed method can get more accurate alignments than the Euclidean-based method by comparing the spectral reconstruction loss of time-aligned HRIRs using spherical harmonics representation on seven HRIRs consisting of human and dummy heads. The extra correlation features and the $L^1$-norm are also beneficial in extremely noisy conditions. In addition, this method can be applied to phase unwrapping of head-related transfer functions, where the unwrapped phase could be a compact feature for downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Cross-Domain Audio-Visual Deception Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated deception detection is crucial for assisting humans in accurately assessing truthfulness and identifying deceptive behavior. Conventional contact-based techniques, like polygraph devices, rely on physiological signals to determine the authenticity of an individual's statements. Nevertheless, recent developments in automated deception detection have demonstrated that multimodal features derived from both audio and video modalities may outperform human observers on publicly available datasets. Despite these positive findings, the generalizability of existing audio-visual deception detection approaches across different scenarios remains largely unexplored. To close this gap, we present the first cross-domain audio-visual deception detection benchmark, that enables us to assess how well these methods generalize for use in real-world scenarios. We used widely adopted audio and visual features and different architectures for benchmarking, comparing single-to-single and multi-to-single domain generalization performance. To further exploit the impacts using data from multiple source domains for training, we investigate three types of domain sampling strategies, including domain-simultaneous, domain-alternating, and domain-by-domain for multi-to-single domain generalization evaluation. Furthermore, we proposed the Attention-Mixer fusion method to improve performance, and we believe that this new cross-domain benchmark will facilitate future research in audio-visual deception detection.

      <title>A framework of text-dependent speaker verification for chinese numerical string corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chinese numerical string corpus, serves as a valuable resource for speaker verification, particularly in financial transactions. Researches indicate that in short speech scenarios, text-dependent speaker verification (TD-SV) consistently outperforms text-independent speaker verification (TI-SV). However, TD-SV potentially includes the validation of text information, that can be negatively impacted by reading rhythms and pauses. To address this problem, we propose an end-to-end speaker verification system that enhances TD-SV by decoupling speaker and text information. Our system consists of a text embedding extractor, a speaker embedding extractor and a fusion module. In the text embedding extractor, we employ an enhanced Transformer and introduce a triple loss including text classification loss, connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss and decoder loss; while in the speaker embedding extractor, we create a multi-scale pooling method by combining sliding window attentive statistics pooling (SWASP) with attentive statistics pooling (ASP). To mitigate the scarcity of data, we have recorded a publicly available Chinese numerical corpus named SHALCAS22A (hereinafter called SHAL), which can be accessed on Open-SLR. Moreover, we employ data augmentation techniques using Tacotron2 and HiFi-GAN. Our method achieves an equal error rate (EER) performance improvement of 49.2% on Hi-Mia and 75.0% on SHAL, respectively.</description>

      <title>Towards an Accessible and Rapidly Trainable Rhythm Sequencer Using a Generative Stacked Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks and deep learning are often deployed for the sake of the most comprehensive music generation with as little involvement as possible from the human musician. Implementations in aid of, or being a tool for, music practitioners are sparse. This paper proposes the integration of generative stacked autoencoder structures for rhythm generation, within a conventional melodic step-sequencer. It further aims to work towards its implementation being accessible to the average electronic music practitioner. Several model architectures have been trained and tested for their creative potential. While the currently implementations do display limitations, they do represent viable creative solutions for music practitioners.</description>

      <title>Unified Video-Language Pre-training with Synchronized Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-language pre-training is a typical and challenging problem that aims at learning visual and textual representations from large-scale data in a self-supervised way. Existing pre-training approaches either captured the correspondence of image-text pairs or utilized temporal ordering of frames. However, they do not explicitly explore the natural synchronization between audio and the other two modalities. In this work, we propose an enhanced framework for Video-Language pre-training with Synchronized Audio, termed as VLSA, that can learn tri-modal representations in a unified self-supervised transformer. Specifically, our VLSA jointly aggregates embeddings of local patches and global tokens for video, text, and audio. Furthermore, we utilize local-patch masked modeling to learn modality-aware features, and leverage global audio matching to capture audio-guided features for video and text. We conduct extensive experiments on retrieval across text, video, and audio. Our simple model pre-trained on only 0.9M data achieves improving results against state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, qualitative visualizations vividly showcase the superiority of our VLSA in learning discriminative visual-textual representations.</description>

      <title>SoccerNet-Echoes: A Soccer Game Audio Commentary Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology in soccer offers numerous opportunities for sports analytics. Specifically, extracting audio commentaries with ASR provides valuable insights into the events of the game, and opens the door to several downstream applications such as automatic highlight generation. This paper presents SoccerNet-Echoes, an augmentation of the SoccerNet dataset with automatically generated transcriptions of audio commentaries from soccer game broadcasts, enhancing video content with rich layers of textual information derived from the game audio using ASR. These textual commentaries, generated using the Whisper model and translated with Google Translate, extend the usefulness of the SoccerNet dataset in diverse applications such as enhanced action spotting, automatic caption generation, and game summarization. By incorporating textual data alongside visual and auditory content, SoccerNet-Echoes aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for the development of algorithms specialized in capturing the dynamics of soccer games. We detail the methods involved in the curation of this dataset and the integration of ASR. We also highlight the implications of a multimodal approach in sports analytics, and how the enriched dataset can support diverse applications, thus broadening the scope of research and development in the field of sports analytics.</description>

      <title>Rene: A Pre-trained Multi-modal Architecture for Auscultation of Respiratory Diseases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel methodology utilizing a pre-trained speech recognition model for processing respiratory sound data. By incorporating medical record information, we introduce an innovative multi-modal deep-learning architecture, named Rene, which addresses the challenges of poor interpretability and underperformance in real-time clinical diagnostic response observed in previous respiratory disease-focused models. The proposed Rene architecture demonstrated significant improvements of 10.24%, 16.15%, 15.29%, and 18.90% respectively, compared to the baseline across four tasks related to respiratory event detection and audio record classification on the SPRSound database. In patient disease prediction tests on the ICBHI database, the architecture exhibited improvements of 23% in the mean of average score and harmonic score compared to the baseline. Furthermore, we developed a real-time respiratory sound discrimination system based on the Rene architecture, featuring a dual-thread design and compressed model parameters for simultaneous microphone recording and real-time dynamic decoding. Employing state-of-the-art Edge AI technology, this system enables rapid and accurate responses for respiratory sound auscultation, facilitating deployment on wearable clinical detection devices to capture incremental data, which can be synergistically evolved with large-scale models deployed on cloud servers for downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>FastSAG: Towards Fast Non-Autoregressive Singing Accompaniment Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singing Accompaniment Generation (SAG), which generates instrumental music to accompany input vocals, is crucial to developing human-AI symbiotic art creation systems. The state-of-the-art method, SingSong, utilizes a multi-stage autoregressive (AR) model for SAG, however, this method is extremely slow as it generates semantic and acoustic tokens recursively, and this makes it impossible for real-time applications. In this paper, we aim to develop a Fast SAG method that can create high-quality and coherent accompaniments. A non-AR diffusion-based framework is developed, which by carefully designing the conditions inferred from the vocal signals, generates the Mel spectrogram of the target accompaniment directly. With diffusion and Mel spectrogram modeling, the proposed method significantly simplifies the AR token-based SingSong framework, and largely accelerates the generation. We also design semantic projection, prior projection blocks as well as a set of loss functions, to ensure the generated accompaniment has semantic and rhythm coherence with the vocal signal. By intensive experimental studies, we demonstrate that the proposed method can generate better samples than SingSong, and accelerate the generation by at least 30 times. Audio samples and code are available at https://fastsag.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Age-Dependent Analysis and Stochastic Generation of Child-Directed Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Child-directed speech (CDS) is a particular type of speech that adults use when addressing young children. Its properties also change as a function of extralinguistic factors, such as age of the child being addressed. Access to large amounts of representative and varied CDS would be useful for child language research, as this would enable controlled computational modeling experiments of infant language acquisition with realistic input in terms of quality and quantity. In this study, we describe an approach to model age-dependent linguistic properties of CDS using a language model (LM) trained on CDS transcripts and ages of the recipient children, as obtained from North American English corpora of the CHILDES database. The created LM can then be used to stochastically generate synthetic CDS transcripts in an age-appropriate manner, thereby scaling beyond the original datasets in size. We compare characteristics of the generated CDS against the real speech addressed at children of different ages, showing that the LM manages to capture age-dependent changes in CDS, except for a slight difference in the effective vocabulary size. As a side product, we also provide a systematic characterization of age-dependent linguistic properties of CDS in CHILDES, illustrating how all measured aspects of the CDS change with children's age.</description>

      <title>Improving Multimodal Learning with Multi-Loss Gradient Modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning from multiple modalities, such as audio and video, offers opportunities for leveraging complementary information, enhancing robustness, and improving contextual understanding and performance. However, combining such modalities presents challenges, especially when modalities differ in data structure, predictive contribution, and the complexity of their learning processes. It has been observed that one modality can potentially dominate the learning process, hindering the effective utilization of information from other modalities and leading to sub-optimal model performance. To address this issue the vast majority of previous works suggest to assess the unimodal contributions and dynamically adjust the training to equalize them. We improve upon previous work by introducing a multi-loss objective and further refining the balancing process, allowing it to dynamically adjust the learning pace of each modality in both directions, acceleration and deceleration, with the ability to phase out balancing effects upon convergence. We achieve superior results across three audio-video datasets: on CREMA-D, models with ResNet backbone encoders surpass the previous best by 1.9% to 12.4%, and Conformer backbone models deliver improvements ranging from 2.8% to 14.1% across different fusion methods. On AVE, improvements range from 2.7% to 7.7%, while on UCF101, gains reach up to 6.1%.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Heart Sound Analysis in the Deep Learning Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heart sound auscultation has been applied in clinical usage for early screening of cardiovascular diseases. Due to the high demand for auscultation expertise, automatic auscultation can help with auxiliary diagnosis and reduce the burden of training professional clinicians. Nevertheless, there is a limit to classic machine learning's performance improvement in the era of big data. Deep learning has outperformed classic machine learning in many research fields, as it employs more complex model architectures with a stronger capability of extracting effective representations. Moreover, it has been successfully applied to heart sound analysis in the past years. As most review works about heart sound analysis were carried out before 2017, the present survey is the first to work on a comprehensive overview to summarise papers on heart sound analysis with deep learning published in 2017--2022. This work introduces both classic machine learning and deep learning for comparison, and further offer insights about the advances and future research directions in deep learning for heart sound analysis.

Abstract: Although audio generation shares commonalities across different types of audio, such as speech, music, and sound effects, designing models for each type requires careful consideration of specific objectives and biases that can significantly differ from those of other types. To bring us closer to a unified perspective of audio generation, this paper proposes a framework that utilizes the same learning method for speech, music, and sound effect generation. Our framework introduces a general representation of audio, called "language of audio" (LOA). Any audio can be translated into LOA based on AudioMAE, a self-supervised pre-trained representation learning model. In the generation process, we translate any modalities into LOA by using a GPT-2 model, and we perform self-supervised audio generation learning with a latent diffusion model conditioned on LOA. The proposed framework naturally brings advantages such as in-context learning abilities and reusable self-supervised pretrained AudioMAE and latent diffusion models. Experiments on the major benchmarks of text-to-audio, text-to-music, and text-to-speech demonstrate state-of-the-art or competitive performance against previous approaches. Our code, pretrained model, and demo are available at https://audioldm.github.io/audioldm2.</description>

      <title>Are Sounds Sound for Phylogenetic Reconstruction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02807</link>

Abstract: In traditional studies on language evolution, scholars often emphasize the importance of sound laws and sound correspondences for phylogenetic inference of language family trees. However, to date, computational approaches have typically not taken this potential into account. Most computational studies still rely on lexical cognates as major data source for phylogenetic reconstruction in linguistics, although there do exist a few studies in which authors praise the benefits of comparing words at the level of sound sequences. Building on (a) ten diverse datasets from different language families, and (b) state-of-the-art methods for automated cognate and sound correspondence detection, we test, for the first time, the performance of sound-based versus cognate-based approaches to phylogenetic reconstruction. Our results show that phylogenies reconstructed from lexical cognates are topologically closer, by approximately one third with respect to the generalized quartet distance on average, to the gold standard phylogenies than phylogenies reconstructed from sound correspondences.</description>

      <title>Fast Timing-Conditioned Latent Audio Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating long-form 44.1kHz stereo audio from text prompts can be computationally demanding. Further, most previous works do not tackle that music and sound effects naturally vary in their duration. Our research focuses on the efficient generation of long-form, variable-length stereo music and sounds at 44.1kHz using text prompts with a generative model. Stable Audio is based on latent diffusion, with its latent defined by a fully-convolutional variational autoencoder. It is conditioned on text prompts as well as timing embeddings, allowing for fine control over both the content and length of the generated music and sounds. Stable Audio is capable of rendering stereo signals of up to 95 sec at 44.1kHz in 8 sec on an A100 GPU. Despite its compute efficiency and fast inference, it is one of the best in two public text-to-music and -audio benchmarks and, differently from state-of-the-art models, can generate music with structure and stereo sounds.</description>

      <title>Look Once to Hear: Target Speech Hearing with Noisy Examples</title>

Abstract: In crowded settings, the human brain can focus on speech from a target speaker, given prior knowledge of how they sound. We introduce a novel intelligent hearable system that achieves this capability, enabling target speech hearing to ignore all interfering speech and noise, but the target speaker. A naive approach is to require a clean speech example to enroll the target speaker. This is however not well aligned with the hearable application domain since obtaining a clean example is challenging in real world scenarios, creating a unique user interface problem. We present the first enrollment interface where the wearer looks at the target speaker for a few seconds to capture a single, short, highly noisy, binaural example of the target speaker. This noisy example is used for enrollment and subsequent speech extraction in the presence of interfering speakers and noise. Our system achieves a signal quality improvement of 7.01 dB using less than 5 seconds of noisy enrollment audio and can process 8 ms of audio chunks in 6.24 ms on an embedded CPU. Our user studies demonstrate generalization to real-world static and mobile speakers in previously unseen indoor and outdoor multipath environments. Finally, our enrollment interface for noisy examples does not cause performance degradation compared to clean examples, while being convenient and user-friendly. Taking a step back, this paper takes an important step towards enhancing the human auditory perception with artificial intelligence.
