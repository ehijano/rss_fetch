      <title>Tsallis Entropy derived from the Chaitin-Kolmogorov Informational Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous first-principle derivation of the non-additive Tsallis' entropy by employing the Chaitin-Kolmogorov algorithmic information theory. By applying non-local restrictive rules on the string formation (grammar), we show that the algorithmic cost follows a power-law of the string length, instead of the linear behaviour obtained in the classical theory. As a result, the Tsallis entropy governs the increase of information. We explore the result showing, through Landauer's limit, that the heat dissipation in systems with long-range correlations is diminished. The $\Omega_q$ number, which remains incompressible, now offers the possibility of a continuous increase of complexity, measured by the parameter $q$. We show the consistency of the results by a numerical simulation, and discuss Zipf's law in light of the new findings.</description>

      <title>Restoring Sparsity in Potts Machines via Mean-Field Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines and related probabilistic hardware have emerged as promising platforms for NP-hard optimization and sampling. However, many practical problems involve constraints that induce dense or all-to-all couplings, undermining scalability and hardware efficiency. We address this constraint-induced density through two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a hardware-aware native formulation for multi-state probabilistic digits (p-dits) that avoids the locally dense intra-variable couplings required by binary Ising encodings. We validate p-dit dynamics by reproducing known critical behavior of the 2D Potts model. Second, we propose mean-field constraints (MFC), a hybrid scheme that replaces dense pairwise constraint couplings with dynamically updated single-node biases. Applied to balanced graph partitioning, MFC achieves solution quality comparable to exact all-to-all constraint formulations while dramatically reducing graph density. Finally, we demonstrate the practical impact of restored sparsity by an FPGA implementation, enabling orders-of-magnitude acceleration over CPU-based solvers. Together, these results outline a pathway for scaling constrained optimization on probabilistic hardware.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of the Sub-Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics is a powerful framework for analyzing optimization yielding analytical results for matching, optimal transport, and other combinatorial problems. However, these methods typically target the zero-temperature limit, where systems collapse onto optimal configurations, a.k.a. the ground states. Real-world systems often occupy intermediate regimes where entropy and cost minimization genuinely compete, producing configurations that are structured yet sub-optimal. The Sub-Optimal Transport (SOT) model captures this competition through an ensemble of weighted bipartite graphs: a coupling parameter interpolates between entropy-dominated dense configurations and cost-dominated sparse structures. This crossover has been observed numerically but lacked analytical understanding. Here we develop a mean-field theory that characterizes this transition. We show that local fluctuations in Lagrange multipliers become sub-extensive in the thermodynamic limit, reducing the full model with strength constraints to an effective single-constraint problem admitting an exact solution in some intermediate regime. The resulting free energy is analytic in the coupling parameter, confirming a smooth crossover rather than a phase transition. We derive closed-form expressions for thermodynamic observables and weight distributions, validated against numerical simulations. These results establish the first analytical description of the SOT model, extending statistical mechanics methods beyond the zero-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of isotropic systems with strong dipole-dipole interaction from the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the critical exponents of three-dimensional magnets with strong dipole-dipole interactions using the functional renormalization group (FRG) within the local potential approximation including the wave function renormalization (LPA$^\prime$). The system is governed by the Aharony fixed point, which is scale-invariant but lacks conformal invariance. Our nonperturbative FRG analysis identifies this fixed point and determines its scaling behavior. The resulting critical exponents are found to be close to those of the Heisenberg $O(3)$ universality class, as computed within the same FRG/LPA$^\prime$ framework. This proximity confirms the distinct yet numerically similar nature of the two universality classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of the area and the absolute area under the trajectories of subdiffusive random walks. Using different frameworks to describe subdiffusion (as the scaled Brownian motion, fractional Brownian motion, the continuous-time random walk or the Brownian motion in heterogeneous media), we compute the first two moments, the ergodicity breaking parameter for the absolute area and infer a general scaling for the probability density functions of these functionals. We discuss the differences between the statistical properties of the area and the absolute area for the different subdiffusion models and illustrate the experimental interest of our results. Our theoretical findings are supported by Monte Carlo simulations showing an excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics simulations of large deviations for three subclasses of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies have gradually deepened our understanding of the one-dimensional (1D) Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class even in the large deviation regime, but numerical methods for studying KPZ large deviations remain limited. Here we implement a method based on the population dynamics algorithm for studying large deviations of time-integrated local currents in the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP), which is a pragmatic model in the 1D KPZ class. Carrying out simulations for the three representative initial conditions, namely step, flat, and stationary ones, we not only confirm theoretical predictions available for the step case, but also characterize large deviations for the flat and stationary cases which have not been investigated before. We reveal in particular an unexpected robustness of the deeply negative large deviation regime with respect to different initial conditions. We attribute this robustness to the spontaneous formation of a wedge shape in interface profile. Our population dynamics approach may serve as a versatile method for studying large deviations in the KPZ class numerically and, potentially, even experimentally.</description>

      <title>Probabilities of rare events in product kernel aggregation: An exact formula and phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact method for calculating the large deviation function describing rare fluctuations in the number of particles for product-kernel aggregation. Starting from the master equation, we derive an exact integral representation for the probability $P(M,N,t)$ of observing $N$ particles at time $t$ starting from $M$ monomers for any finite $M, N, t$. From this, we obtain an exact expression for the exponential moment $\langle p^N\rangle$ for integer $p$. Employing a replica conjecture -- numerically validated by finite-$M$ scaling -- we extend this result to real $p \geq 0$. The convex envelope of the large deviation function, obtained via a Legendre-Fenchel transform of the exponential moment, shows singular behavior. The singular structure allows us to construct the full phase diagram of product-kernel aggregation, which contains a tricritical point, separating continuous and discontinuous transitions. We also compute the asymptotic form of the LDF for small $N/M$.</description>

      <title>Control protocols for harmonically confined run-and-tumble particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble particles constitute one of the simplest models of self-propelled active matter, and provide an ideal playground to the understanding of out-of-equilibrium systems. We consider an idealized setup where one such particle is subject to a harmonic confining potential, and an external agent can vary in time the tumbling rate and the strength of the trap. We search for time-dependent control protocols steering the system between assigned end states, in a prescribed time interval. To this aim, we propose a description of the dynamics, alternative to the usual ones, in the form of an infinite set of ordinary differential equations. Solutions based on a suitable closure of such hierarchy, which we expect to hold true in the limit of long protocol duration, are discussed and compared with numerical simulations. We also look for the protocol completing the task with the minimal work, on average: the problem can be tackled analytically, again in the regime of slow (but not quasi-static) transformations. The solution provides insightful intuition on the optimal strategies for the control of active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent Hawking Radiation and Quantum Sensing in a Quenched Chiral Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence and detection of Hawking radiation (HR) in a 1D chiral spin chain model, where the gravitational collapse is simulated by a sudden quantum quench that triggers a horizon-inducing phase transition. While our previous work Jaiswal [2025] established that this model mimics BH formation conditions even when the Hoop conjecture is seemingly violated, we here focus on the resulting stationary radiation spectrum and its detectability. By mapping the spin chain dynamics to a Dirac fermion in a curved (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime, we analyze the radiation using two complementary approaches: field-theoretic modes and operational quantum sensors. First, using localized Gaussian wave packets to model realistic detectors, we find that the radiation spectrum exhibits deviations from the ideal Planckian form, analogous to frequency-dependent greybody factors, while retaining robust Poissonian statistics that signal the loss of formation-scale information. Second, we introduce a qubit coupled to the chain as a stationary Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the qubit functions as a faithful quantum sensor of the Hawking temperature only in the weak-coupling regime, where its population dynamics are governed solely by the bath spectral density. In the strong-coupling limit, the probe thermalizes with the global environment, obscuring the horizon-induced thermal signature. These results provide a clear operational protocol for distinguishing genuine analog HR from environmental noise in quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>The Most Dispersed Subset of Random Points in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a population of $N$ individuals, each having $d\geq 1$ different traits, and an additive measure, called dispersion, which rewards large pairwise separations between traits. The goal is to select $M\leq N$ individuals such that their traits are as dispersed as possible. We compute analytically the full statistics (including large deviation tails) of the maximally achievable dispersion among sub-populations of size $M$ when the traits are independent and identically distributed. Two complementary approaches are developed, one based on a mean-field theory for order statistics, and the other on the replica method from the field of disordered systems. In all dimensions $d$, and for rotationally symmetric distributions, the optimal subset for large populations consists of all points lying outside a $d$-dimensional ball whose radius is determined self-consistently. For a single trait ($d=1$), the statistics of the maximal dispersion can be tackled for finite $N,M$ as well. The formulae we obtained are corroborated by numerical simulations on small instances and by heuristic algorithms that find near-optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Site and bond percolation in linearly distorted triangular and square lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate site and bond percolation in triangular and square lattices subjected to linear distortion. In contrast to previously studied distortion schemes that preserve lattice geometry, linear distortion dislocates regular lattice sites along a fixed direction. Nearest-neighbors of a regular lattice need to satisfy a distance-based connection criterion to remain neighbors in the linearly distorted lattice. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analyses, we examine how site and bond percolation thresholds vary with the distortion parameter and the connection threshold. For triangular lattices, we observe pronounced directional dependence of both site and bond percolation thresholds, as well as of the critical connection threshold. This arises from the distortion-induced anisotropic modification of nearest-neighbor separations. In particular, bond percolation exhibits nontrivial behavior that cannot be explained solely in terms of changes in the average coordination number. In contrast, square lattices remain effectively isotropic under linear distortion, resulting in identical percolation thresholds for distortions applied along different directions. Percolation thresholds in the thermodynamic limit, evaluated for a selected set of values of distortion parameter and connection threshold, confirm that the results for large finite lattices provide reliable estimates of the infinite-system behavior.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dynamical Friction from the Doppler-Shifted Equilibrium Memory Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a statistical mechanics framework for modeling non-equilibrium transport coefficients using the Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE). We show that the kernel, obtained via the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) from the stochastic force autocorrelation measured in a thermal equilibrium state, is sufficient to model the dynamics of the system in a Non-Equilibrium Steady State (NESS). This approach provides a computationally efficient path to modeling complex transport problems. We apply this framework to the canonical problem of test particle drag in a uniform plasma. The GLE formalism is shown to naturally capture non-Markovian phenomena through the moments of the kernel, including an effective mass renormalization and oscillatory relaxation. We demonstrate that the standard Chandrasekhar stopping power formula arises naturally as the Markovian limit of this equilibrium memory kernel. These theoretical predictions are quantitatively validated by direct Particle-in-Cell simulations, which confirm the predicted oscillatory structure of the memory kernel. This work thus establishes a practical method for predicting non-equilibrium transport properties from first-principles equilibrium simulations.</description>

      <title>Transport Properties of Active Particles Moving on Adjustable Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active adaptive matter has attracted considerable interest due to its rich, largely unexplained dynamics and its relevance to a wide range of synthetic and biological materials. An important subclass of such systems consists of active particles that can remodel the network in which they move. Here, we introduce a minimal yet versatile model of active particles moving on an adjustable network. In this model, particles undergo discrete run-and-tumble motion along the links of a triangular lattice and leave behind a trail of temporarily blocked links. These closed links cannot be traversed by other particles and reopen only after a characteristic healing time. The resulting trail-mediated blocking mechanism is fundamentally distinct from more familiar interactions such as excluded-volume effects. In the high-persistence limit, we find a qualitative contrast between the two mechanisms: while steric blocking leads to reduced diffusivity with increasing persistence, trail-induced blocking causes diffusivity to increase monotonically. We characterize this fundamental difference and the associated, unexpected transport properties, and discuss potential applications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions in Boundary Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) in a dissipative collective-spin model that exhibits the boundary time crystal (BTC) phase. We initialize the system in the ground state of the Hamiltonian in either the BTC or the non-BTC phase, and drive it across the BTC transition. The driving is done by an abrupt quench or by a finite-time linear ramp of a Hamiltonian control parameter under Markovian Lindblad dynamics. We diagnose DQPTs through zeros of the fidelity-based Loschmidt echo between the initial state and the evolving mixed state, which induce nonanalytic cusp-like features in the associated rate function. For quenches into the BTC phase, the Loschmidt echo exhibits repeated zeros due to the emergent time-periodic steady state, whereas for quenches into the non-BTC phase, the overlap vanishes and remains zero once the dynamics relaxes to a stationary state. We further show that the DQPT persists under the ramp protocol followed by unitary evolution with the final Hamiltonian. Finally, we analyze the finite-size scaling of the first critical time and find convergence to a constant in the thermodynamic limit, with distinct power-law approaches for the quench and the ramp protocols.</description>

      <title>Deterministic scale-invariant dynamics in a logistic Game-of-Life model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scale invariance is a hallmark of criticality in complex dynamical systems. While random external inputs or tunable stochastic interactions are typically required to produce critical behavior, it remains unclear whether scale-invariant dynamics can emerge from purely deterministic interactions. Here, we address this question by studying the asymptotic dynamics of the logistic Game of Life (GOL), a deterministic-parameter extension of Conway's GOL. In this system, we identify three distinct asymptotic phases separated by two fundamentally different critical points. The first critical point, associated with an unusual form of self-organized criticality, separates a sparse-static phase from a sparse-dynamic phase. The second critical point corresponds to a deterministic percolation transition between the sparse-dynamic phase and a third, dense-dynamic phase. In addition, we observe power-law cluster size distributions with unconventional critical exponents not found in standard equilibrium systems. Overall, our work paves the way for studying emergent scale invariance in purely deterministic systems.</description>

      <title>General Theory for Group Resetting with Application to Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general theoretical framework for group resetting dynamics in a potential landscape. While traditional resetting models typically focus on a single particle, we consider a group of particles whose collective dynamics govern the resetting. We extend existing resetting theories to cover extreme-value group resetting. This has applications from bacterial evolution under antibiotic pressure to swarm-search optimization. Using renewal theory, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation for the spatial distribution of the group's center of mass, treated as an effective particle. This formalism yields analytical expressions for key observables such as the stationary mean position and variance. We also study a group avoidance problem, where the particles must avoid an undesirable region. Such problems have recently been studied in contexts such as preventing critically high water levels in dams and controlling excessive financial leverage. Our framework offers new insight into how resetting can optimize group-level search and avoidance strategies.</description>

      <title>Higher-order contagion processes in 3.99 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions have recently emerged as a promising framework for describing new dynamical phenomena in heterogeneous contagion processes. However, a fundamental open question is how to understand their contribution from the perspective of the physics of critical phenomena. Based on a mesoscopic field-theoretic Langevin description, we show that: (i) pairwise mechanisms such as facilitation or thresholding are formally equivalent to higher-order ones, (ii) pairwise interactions at coarse-grained scales govern the higher-order contact process and, (iii) the interplay between noise and topology is determined by the network spectral dimension. In short, we demonstrate that classical field theories, rooted on model symmetries and/or network dimensionality, still capture the nature of the phase transition, also predicting finite-size effects in real and synthetic networks.</description>

      <title>Geometric Criticality in Scale-Invariant Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dimension in physical systems determines universal properties at criticality. Yet, the impact of structural perturbations on dimensionality remains largely unexplored. Here, we characterize the attraction basins of structural fixed points in scale-invariant networks from a renormalization group perspective, demonstrating that basin stability connects to a structural phase transition. This topology-dependent effect, which we term geometric criticality, triggers a geometric breakdown hitherto unknown, which induces non-trivial fractal dimensions and unveils hidden LRG flows toward unstable structural fixed points. Our systematic study of how networks and lattices respond to disorder paves the way for future analysis of non-ergodic behavior induced by quenched disorder.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of the DNLS equation at positive and negative absolute temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Discrete Non Linear Schr\"odinger (DNLS) model, due to the existence of two conserved quantities, displays an equilibrium transition between a homogeneous phase at positive absolute temperature and a localized phase at negative absolute temperature. Here, we provide a mean-field theory of DNLS through a suitable approximation of the grandcanonical partition function which makes it factorizable. By comparing our mean-field results with numerically exact ones, we show that this approximation is semi-quantitatively correct in the whole grandcanonical phase diagram, becoming increasingly accurate in proximity of the transition line and exact along the line itself. Our mean-field theory suggests that the passage from stable positive-temperature to metastable negative-temperature states is smooth and allows for a more accurate description of the metastable region.</description>

      <title>LDPC stabilizer codes as gapped quantum phases: stability under graph-local perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the proof of stability of topological order, due to Bravyi, Hastings and Michalakis, to stabilizer Hamiltonians corresponding to low-density parity check (LDPC) codes without the restriction of geometric locality in Euclidean space. We consider Hamiltonians $H_0$ defined by $[[N,K,d]]$ LDPC codes which obey certain topological quantum order conditions: (i) code distance $d \geq c \log(N)$, implying local indistinguishability of ground states, and (ii) a mild condition on local and global compatibility of ground states; these include good quantum LDPC codes, and the toric code on a hyperbolic lattice, among others. We consider stability under weak perturbations that are quasi-local on the interaction graph defined by $H_0$, and which can be represented as sums of bounded-norm terms. As long as the local perturbation strength is smaller than a finite constant, we show that the perturbed Hamiltonian has well-defined spectral bands originating from the $O(1)$ smallest eigenvalues of $H_0$. The band originating from the smallest eigenvalue has $2^K$ states, is separated from the rest of the spectrum by a finite energy gap, and has exponentially narrow bandwidth $\delta = C N e^{-\Theta(d)}$, which is tighter than the best known bounds even in the Euclidean case. We also obtain that the new ground state subspace is related to the initial code subspace by a quasi-local unitary, allowing one to relate their physical properties. Our proof uses an iterative procedure that performs successive rotations to eliminate non-frustration-free terms in the Hamiltonian. Our results extend to quantum Hamiltonians built from classical LDPC codes, which give rise to stable symmetry-breaking phases. These results show that LDPC codes very generally define stable gapped quantum phases, even in the non-Euclidean setting, initiating a systematic study of such phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Temperature overshooting in the Mpemba effect of frictional active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The traditional Mpemba effect refers to an anomalous cooling phenomenon when an initial hotter system cools down faster than an initial warm system. Such counterintuitive behavior has been confirmed and explored across phase transitions in condensed matter systems and also for colloidal particles exposed to a double-well potential. Here we predict a frictional Mpemba effect for a macroscopic body moving actively on a surface governed by Coulomb (dry) friction. For an initial high temperature, relaxation towards a cold state occurs much faster than that for an intermediate initial temperature, due to a large temperature overshooting in the latter case. This frictional Mpemba effect can be exploited to steer the motion of robots and granules.</description>

      <title>Advection selects pattern in multistable emulsions of active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the size of droplets, for example in biological cells, is challenging because large droplets typically outcompete smaller droplets due to surface tension. This coarsening is generally accelerated by hydrodynamic effects, but active chemical reactions can suppress it. We show that the interplay of these processes leads to three different dynamical regimes: (1) Advection dominates the coalescence of small droplets, (2) diffusion leads to Ostwald ripening for intermediate sizes, and (3) reactions finally suppress coarsening. Interestingly, a range of final droplet sizes is stable, of which one is selected depending on initial conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that hydrodynamic effects control initial droplet sizes, but they do not affect the later dynamics, in contrast to passive emulsions.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.93546$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical</description>
