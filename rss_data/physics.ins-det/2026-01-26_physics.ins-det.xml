      <title>Probing dark matter interactions with a RES-NOVA prototype cryogenic detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the operation of a 13 g PbWO$_4$ crystal, grown from archaeological Pb and operated as a cryogenic calorimeter in an underground environment. Read out with a Ge thermistor, the detector achieves a low energy threshold and, for the first time, enables the derivation of a dark matter exclusion limit using PbWO$_4$ as target material, for both spin-dependent interactions on neutrons and spin-independent interactions. Although limited in mass and not representative of the final RES-NOVA detector design, this prototype demonstrates effective control of mechanical vibrations and low-energy noise in a cryogenic system, which is a key requirement for rare-event searches. The experiment therefore provides a proof of principle for the RES-NOVA detection concept, validating the use of archaeological Pb-based PbWO$_4$ crystals, low-background operation, and robust data-analysis procedures. These results establish a solid technological and methodological foundation for future RES-NOVA detectors employing larger target masses and advanced thermal readout technologies.</description>

      <title>A First Demonstration of the SQUAT Detector Architecture: Direct Measurement of Resonator-Free Charge-Sensitive Transmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Superconducting Quasiparticle-Amplifying Transmon (SQUAT) is a new sensor architecture for THz (meV) detection based on a weakly charge-sensitive transmon directly coupled to a transmission line. In such devices, energy depositions break Cooper pairs in the qubit capacitor islands, generating quasiparticles. Quasiparticles that tunnel across the Josephson junction change the transmon qubit parity, generating a measurable signal. In this paper, we present the design of first-generation SQUATs and demonstrate an architecture validation. We summarize initial characterization measurements made with prototype devices, comment on background sources that influence the observed parity-switching rate, and present experimental results showing simultaneous detection of charge and quasiparticle signals using aluminum-based SQUATs.</description>

      <title>VUV Reflectance Measurements for Materials Relevant to Argon and Xenon Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of material reflectance in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) range is crucial for optimizing photon detection in noble gas detectors such as DUNE. Despite its importance, reflectance values for detector materials in the VUV region remain poorly characterized, with literature values showing significant variation depending on surface termination and finish. We present an angular-resolved reflectance measurement system developed at IFIC that operates in a gaseous argon atmosphere, enabling realistic measurements of detector materials under controlled conditions. The setup couples a deuterium lamp to a monochromator and employs a motorized PMT rotating around the sample to measure reflected light distributions across a wide angular range. We have characterized two key DUNE materials -- aluminum field cage profiles and stainless steel cryostat membranes -- in both the UV-VIS (300-500 nm) and VUV (128-200 nm) ranges. In the UV-VIS region, we confirm literature values of approximately 60% reflectance for aluminum and 40% for stainless steel. Preliminary VUV measurements at 45{\deg} angle of incidence yield reflectance values of 10-15% for both materials, significantly lower than their UV-VIS counterparts. The reflected light distributions exhibit a mixed character between specular and diffuse reflection. These results have direct implications for detector simulations and light yield predictions in next-generation experiments.</description>

      <title>Performance of a SuperCDMS HVeV Detector with Sub-eV Energy Resolution and Single Charge-sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed characterization of a new generation of athermal-phonon single-charge sensitive Si HVeV detectors, the best of which achieved 612 meV $\pm$ 4 meV baseline resolution. Our sub-eV energy resolution enables precise measurements of single-photon events and reveal consistent energy losses of 0.81 eV $\pm$ 0.03 eV per charge excitation across two facilities. We demonstrate that the noise for these detectors is well described using a standard Transition Edge Sensor noise model. We also place upper bounds on the nominal phonon collection efficiency of 45\%, establishing these detectors as the most efficient athermal phonon detectors to date, limited only by intrinsic limitations of quasiparticle generation.</description>

      <title>Design and characterization of the POKERINO prototype for the POKER/NA64 experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NA64 experiment at CERN H4 beamline recently started a high-energy positron-beam program to search for light dark matter particles through a thick-target, missing-energy measurement. To fulfil the energy resolution requirement of the physics measurement $\sigma_E/E\simeq2.5\%/\sqrt{E\mathrm{[GeV}]} \oplus 0.5\%$ and cope with the constraints and performance requests of the NA64 setup, a new high-resolution homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeter PKR-CAL has been designed. The detector is based on PbWO$_4$ crystals, each read by multiple SiPM sensors to maximize the light collection. The PKR-CAL design has been optimized to mitigate and control unavoidable SiPM saturation effects at high light levels, as well as to minimize the gain fluctuations induced by instantaneous variations of the H4 beam intensity. The $R\&amp;D$ program culminated in the construction of a small-scale prototype, POKERINO. In this work, we present the results from the experimental characterization campaign of the POKERINO aiming at demonstrating that the obtained performances are compatible with the application requirements.</description>

      <title>Investigating ultra-thin 4H-SiC AC-LGADs for superior radiation-hard timing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Low Gain Avalanche Diodes (LGADs) are promising particle detectors for timing resolution better than $50$ ps under a high radiation environment. This study investigates n-in-p LGAD architecture, focusing on ultra-thin sensors of thickness less than $50\ \mu$m using the WeightField2 program. The capabilities of WeightField2 are demonstrated by comparing its results with irradiation measurements from an FBK LGAD wafer, showing good agreement across unirradiated and neutron-irradiated conditions. This paper presents device simulations in High Luminosity LHC conditions (lifetime integrated fluence $ \mathcal{O} (10^{14})\ \mathrm{n_{eq}~cm^{-2}}$, temperature $ \approx 243\ \mathrm{K} $), and taking into account radiation damage, gain reduction due to fluence, and lattice defects. It is shown that a 20 $\mu$m thick sensor achieves the best timing performance. Among Silicon (Si), Diamond (C), and 4H-Silicon Carbide (4H-SiC), we found 4H-SiC to be the most promising: it provides the highest gain value for a fixed thickness and gain implant layer configuration, and best retains high charge collection value and timing capability under increasing fluence up to $50\times10^{14}\ \mathrm{n_{eq}~cm^{-2}}$. A time resolution less than 25 ps is reported with different gain implant concentrations for a $20 \mu$m 4H-SiC sensor. This work presents the potential of SiC-based LGADs in high-radiation collider environments.</description>

      <title>Neutron spectrum measurement in the Yemi underground laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the measurement of neutron energy spectra at the newly established Yemi Underground Laboratory (Yemilab) in the Republic of Korea, designed to host dark matter and rare-event search experiments. A high-sensitivity neutron spectrometer was employed, consisting of ten cylindrical {}^{3}He proportional counters, eight of which were embedded in cylindrical high-density polyethylene moderators of various sizes. To quantify and mitigate contributions from internal \alpha-backgrounds, each detector underwent a dedicated background measurement using a cadmium-shielded box. These backgrounds, primarily originating from trace amounts of U and Th in the stainless-steel housings, were characterized and subtracted during data analysis. Neutron measurements were carried out at three locations within the Yemilab between March to October 2023. After waveform-based event selection and correction for \alphasym-backgrounds, neutron count rates were estimated and corresponding energy spectra were reconstructed using the unfolding method. The total neutron fluence rates were measured ranged from (3.24 $\pm$ 0.11) to (4.01 $\pm$ 0.10) $\times~10^{-5}~ {cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$, with thermal and fast neutron components (1 - 10 MeV) ranging from (1.32 $\pm$ 0.05) to (1.51 $\pm$ 0.05) $\times 10^{-5}~{cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$ and (0.27 $\pm$ 0.03) to (0.34 $\pm$ 0.10) $\times~10^{-5}~{cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive semi-automated fabrication system for quartz tuning fork AFM probe with real-time resonance frequency monitoring and Q-factor control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quartz tuning fork-based atomic force microscopy (QTF-AFM) has become a powerful tool for high-resolution imaging of both conductive and insulating samples, including semiconductor structures and metal-coated surfaces as well as soft matter under ambient conditions, while also enabling measurements in more demanding environments including ultrahigh vacuum and cryogenic conditions where conventional cantilever-based AFM often encounters limitations. However, the broader adoption of QTF-AFM has been constrained by the difficulty of attaching a cantilever tip to a quartz tuning fork (QTF) with the positional and angular precision required for repeatable and reproducible probe fabrication. For stable operation, the tip must be placed precisely at the midline of a single tine, aligned parallel to the prong axis, and rigidly secured. Even slight lateral offsets or angular deviations disrupt the intrinsic antisymmetric flexural mode, induce torsional coupling, and ultimately lead to systematic image distortions and reduced measurement integrity. In this work, we present a comprehensive, semi-automated QTF-tip fabrication system that integrates precision alignment, real-time frequency-sweep monitoring, and controlled Q-factor tuning within a single workflow. Experimental characterization demonstrates consistent probe preparation across multiple trials, preservation of sharp and well-defined resonance responses with deliberately adjustable damping, and high-fidelity, high-resolution imaging in practical scanning tests. This integrated approach provides a reproducible framework to QTF-based probe fabrication, lowering the technical barrier to QTF-AFM implementation and broadening its applicability across diverse sample types and operating environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03476v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) will replace the current CMS Endcap Calorimeter during Long-Shutdown 3. The Endcap Concentrator (ECON) ASICs represent key elements in the readout chain, processing trigger (ECON-T) and data (ECON-D) streams from the HGCROC to the lpGBT. The ECONs will operate in a radiation environment with a High-Energy Hadron (${E\geq20MeV}$) flux up to $2\cdot10^{7} cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. This contribution describes the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)-based functional verification of the ECON ASICs focusing on the re-use of existing components to manage the complexity of the verification environment.</description>

      <title>Challenges and strategies in verification of FastRICH ASIC for the LHCb RICH detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The FastRICH ASIC provides high-precision, triggerless readout for the LS3 Enhancements and Upgrades II of the LHCb RICH detector. The demands of continuous data acquisition and varying hit rates across the detector impose unique challenges on the ASIC's design and verification. This work presents the verification strategy for FastRICH, focusing on functional correctness, timing performance, and operational robustness. The methodology includes simulations across occupancy scenarios, validation of timing precision, and stress testing under pile-up and high-rate conditions. Results demonstrate that FastRICH meets its performance requirements over the full range of expected occupancies. Key design and verification challenges specific to triggerless, fast-timing ASICs are discussed, along with lessons learned for future developments.</description>

      <title>Reusable Verification Components for High-Energy Physics readout ASICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03478v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verification is a critical aspect of designing front-end (FE) readout ASICs for High-Energy Physics (HEP) experiments. These ASICs share several similar functional features, resulting in similar verification objectives, which can be addressed using comparable verification strategies. This contribution presents a set of re-usable verification components for addressing common verification tasks, such as clock generation, reset handling, configuration, as well as hit and fault injections. The components were developed as part of the CHIPS initiative and they have been successfully used in the verification of multiple HEP ASICs.</description>
