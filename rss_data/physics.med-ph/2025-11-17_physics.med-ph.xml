      <title>Effects of diode laser photobiomodulation on peri-implant inflammation and stability in orthodontic mini-implants: A randomized controlled trial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peri-implant inflammation in orthodontic mini-implant may lead to patient discomfort and treatment failure. This study aims to evaluate the effects of diode laser application on the health of mini-implant, preventing peri-implantitis and promoting healing. A randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 30 orthodontic patients (12 males and 18 females, aged 18-32) who had mini-implants implanted on both sides of the maxilla for anterior teeth retraction. One side of each patient was assigned to either an experimental group receiving diode laser irradiation (650 nm, 25 mW) at specific postoperative intervals or a control group receiving simulated radiation. Clinical assessments included plaque index, modified sulcus bleeding index, probing depth, and incidence of peri-implant mucositis and implant mobility, measured at 1, 4, and 12 weeks post-implantation. Additionally, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\b{eta}) levels in peri-implant fluid were analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results indicated that the experimental group exhibited significantly lower plaque indices, sulcus bleeding indices, and probing depths (p &lt; 0.05) compared to the control group. Moreover, the experimental group had fewer cases of peri-implant mucositis (p &lt; 0.05), while differences in implant stability were not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). IL-1\b{eta} levels were consistently lower in the experimental group throughout the study duration (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, adjunctive diode laser therapy appears to enhance peri-implant health and reduce complications associated with orthodontic mini-implants, suggesting a promising direction for improving patient outcomes in orthodontics. Future research should explore long-term effects and the mechanisms underlying these benefits.</description>

      <title>Impact of Brain Anisotropy on Transcranial Temporal Interference Stimulation: Numerical Analysis Toward Reliable Montage Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background &amp; Aim: Transcranial temporal interference stimulation (TIS) is a novel transcranial electrical stimulation modality that enables focused targeting of deep brain structures. When targeting deep regions, current pathways traverse the highly anisotropic white matter, making anisotropy a potentially critical factor. This study aimed to clarify how anisotropy influences interferential currents in deep brain regions and to assess its impact on TIS montage optimization for the first time. Methods: Anatomical head conductor models with anisotropic and isotropic conductivities were compared to evaluate the role of anisotropy in the intracranial interferential currents distributions and montage optimization. For the anisotropic conductivity, conductivity tensors were derived from diffusion-weighted imaging data for gray matter, white matter, and deep brain structures. Montage optimization was conducted based on Pareto front optimization. Results: In literature-reported TIS montages, anisotropic conductivity significantly altered the interferential electric field intensity, with differences of up to 18% in the white matter, whereas discrepancies in deep brain structures remained below 12%. For TIS-optimized montages, these variations across conductivity models yielded only 50% montage disagreement. However, when constraining differences in focality and target field strength to within 10%, the agreement improved to nearly 90%. Conclusions: Incorporating anisotropic conductivities is important to determine individualized focality and target-field characteristics. Moreover, anisotropy can substantially affect the selection of the optimal montage, but under practical focality and target-field tolerances, montage choices largely converge.</description>

      <title>Mathematical and numerical methods for accurate aorta segmentation from non-enhanced CT Data yielding reliable identification and evaluation of large vessel vasculitis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation of the aorta is crucial for various medical analyses, such as the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This work presents mathematical models and methods yielding a semi-automatic segmentation of the aorta from non-enhanced CT data. Our framework consists of three steps. First, using the minimal path approach, we extract a path within the aorta from two user-supplied points. Then, using 3D Lagrangian curve evolution, we move the initial path to the approximate centerline of the aorta. The centered path is used in the last step to construct the initial condition for the generalized subjective surface method (GSUBSURF). Applying the GSUBSURF method with this initial condition yields an accurate segmentation of the aorta. The segmentation results and the manual segmentations overlap, with a worst-case mean Hausdorff distance of $2.175 \pm 0.605$ mm for a voxel spacing of $0.977$ mm. Using the aorta centerline and segmentation, we define precise regions of interest along the aorta to assess large-vessel vasculitis from patient FDG-PET/CT image data. The application shows promising results, as we demonstrated widespread inflammation throughout the aorta in a patient before treatment. After treatment, we observed a significant reduction in inflammation while accurately identifying the aorta regions where inflammation persisted. These findings also align with those of experienced medical doctors who have worked on the same cases.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Sensitive Module for Optical Coherence Tomography Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) extends OCT by analyzing the polarization states of backscattered light to quantify tissue birefringence. However, conventional implementations require polarization-diverse detection and are therefore incompatible with most commercial OCT systems. As a result, PS-OCT has largely remained restricted to specialized research groups, limiting its broader scientific and clinical use. Here, we present a modular PS-OCT framework that integrates with a standard spectral-domain OCT platform through a detachable rotating achromatic half-wave plate in the sample arm. This waveplate modulates both incident and reflected polarization states. Three or more repeated measurements at distinct waveplate orientations enable reconstruction of the sample's round-trip Jones matrix and the corresponding polarization properties. To mitigate random phase variations between repeated measurements, we introduce a retarder-constrained phase optimization strategy. We validate the framework with imaging of birefringent phantoms and human retina in vivo, demonstrating reliable reconstruction of retardance and optic axis orientation. This approach requires only minimal hardware modification and is readily deployable on mainstream OCT systems. Lowering technical barriers paves the way for rapid and widespread deployment of PS-OCT across diverse biomedical applications in both research and clinical environments.</description>

      <title>Volumetric axial velocity estimation with XDoppler using row-column arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate volumetric velocity estimation in ultrasound imaging is crucial for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Traditional ultrasound systems, though effective for two-dimensional imaging, face major limitations in 3D imaging due to hardware and computational demands. Row-column addressed (RCA) ultrasound probes offer a promising alternative by reducing hardware complexity, thereby helping bridge the gap between research prototypes and clinical systems. However, this typically comes at the expense of stronger sidelobes compared with fully populated matrix arrays, leading to a decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this study, we present a method that exploits the phase information from RCA rows and columns signals to compute a novel velocity estimator based on cross-correlation of orthogonal apertures. This extends the XDoppler scheme, initially developed for power Doppler imaging, to velocity estimation. Our results show that the XDoppler estimator provides accurate measurements of axial velocities (RMSE=9.21%, R2=0.88) and outperforms the traditional phase-shift autocorrelator, while offering a theoretical Nyquist velocity twice as high. In vitro experiments further demonstrate enhanced sensitivity to slow flows (&lt;10mm/s) and reduced bias in flow rate estimation. In vivo data from a carotid artery confirm the reduced sensitivity to aliasing and reveal the ability to track dynamic blood flow velocity changes associated with arterial pulsatility. These findings suggest that the proposed XDoppler estimator could improve volumetric blood velocity imaging with RCA probes.</description>

      <title>Are Ultrathin Stents Optimal for Bifurcation Lesions? Insights from Computational Modelling of Provisional and DK-Crush Techniques</title>

Abstract: Complex coronary bifurcation lesions remain challenging in percutaneous coronary intervention, with stent design and deployment strategy influencing clinical outcomes. This study compares the mechanical and hemodynamic performance of the ultrathin-strut Orsiro and thin-strut Xience Sierra stent in Provisional Side Branch (PSB) and Double Kissing Crush (DKC) techniques. We used finite element analyses of bifurcation stent deployment to assess malapposition, ostium clearance, and arterial wall stress for both techniques. Computational fluid dynamics simulations quantified the luminal exposure to low Time-Averaged Endothelial Shear Stress (TAESS below 0.4 Pa) and high shear rates (above 1000 1/s). In PSB, Orsiro showed higher malapposition (13.0% vs 9.6%) but improved SB ostium clearance (77% vs 64%) and lower low-TAESS exposure (30.3% vs 33.6%) compared to Xience. Orsiro also produced higher arterial wall stresses, particularly during kissing balloon inflation. In DKC, differences in malapposition and ostium clearance diminished between stents, though Orsiro retained a hemodynamic advantage with lower low-TAESS (28.2% vs 36.3%).Stent design influenced outcomes more strongly in PSB, where anatomical interaction and platform-specific behavior impacted both structural and hemodynamic results. In DKC, procedural complexity minimized those differences, making the stenting technique the primary performance driver. Nonetheless, Orsiro consistently preserved more favorable flow conditions. These findings highlight the need to match device selection with lesion characteristics in PSB, while in DKC, optimizing procedural steps may have a greater impact than the choice of stent platform.</description>

      <title>Progress in SPECT and PET Reconstruction for Theranostics: From Diagnosis to Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theranostic paradigm enables personalization of treatment by selecting patients with a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical and monitoring therapy using a matched therapeutic isotope. This strategy relies on accurate image reconstruction of both pretherapy and post-therapy images for patient selection and monitoring treatment. However, traditional reconstruction methods are hindered by challenges such as crosstalk in multi-isotope imaging and extremely low-count measurements data when imaging of alpha-emitting isotopes. Additionally, to fully realize the benefits of new imaging systems being developed for theranostic applications, advanced reconstruction techniques are needed. This review highlights recent progress and discusses critical challenges and unmet needs in theranostic image reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Cyclic jetting enables microbubble-mediated drug delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of targeted therapies capable of overcoming biological barriers, including the tenacious blood-brain barrier, has spurred the investigation into stimuli-responsive microagents. This approach could improve therapeutic efficacy, reduce undesirable side effects, and open avenues for treating previously incurable diseases. Intravenously-administered ultrasound-responsive microbubbles are one of the most promising agents, having demonstrated potential in several clinical trials. However, the mechanism by which microbubbles enhance drug absorption remains unclear. Here, we reveal through unprecedented time-resolved side-view visualisations that single microbubbles, upon microsecond-long ultrasound driving, puncture the cell membrane and induce drug uptake via stable cyclic microjets. Our theoretical models successfully reproduce the observed bubble and cell dynamic responses. We find that cyclic jets arise from shape instabilities, warranting recognition as a novel class of jets in bubbles, distinct from classical inertial jets driven by pressure gradients. We also establish a threshold for bubble radial expansion beyond which microjets form and facilitate cellular permeation. Remarkably, these microjets occur at ultrasound pressures below 100kPa due to their unique formation mechanism. We show that the stress generated by microjetting surpasses all previously suggested mechanisms by at least an order of magnitude. In summary, this work elucidates the physics behind microbubble-mediated targeted drug delivery and provides criteria for its effective yet safe application.</description>
