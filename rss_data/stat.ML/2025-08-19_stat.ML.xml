      <title>BaMANI: Bayesian Multi-Algorithm causal Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improved computational power has enabled different disciplines to predict causal relationships among modeled variables using Bayesian network inference. While many alternative algorithms have been proposed to improve the efficiency and reliability of network prediction, the predicted causal networks reflect the generative process but also bear an opaque imprint of the specific computational algorithm used. Following a ``wisdom of the crowds" strategy, we developed an ensemble learning approach to marginalize the impact of a single algorithm on Bayesian causal network inference. To introduce the approach, we first present the theoretical foundation of this framework. Next, we present a comprehensive implementation of the framework in terms of a new software tool called BaMANI (Bayesian Multi-Algorithm causal Network Inference). Finally, we describe a BaMANI use-case from biology, particularly within human breast cancer studies.</description>

      <title>Dropping Just a Handful of Preferences Can Change Top Large Language Model Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for evaluating the robustness of a widely used LLM ranking system -- the Bradley--Terry ranking system -- to dropping a worst-case very small fraction of evaluation data. Our approach is computationally fast and easy to adopt. When we apply our method to matchups from two popular human-preference platforms, Chatbot Arena and MT-Bench, we find that the Bradley--Terry rankings of top-performing models are remarkably sensitive to the removal of a small fraction of evaluations. Our framework also identifies the specific evaluations most responsible for such ranking flips, allowing for inspections of these influential preferences. We observe that the rankings derived from MT-Bench preferences are notably more robust than those from Chatbot Arena, likely due to MT-bench's use of expert annotators and carefully constructed prompts. Finally, we find that rankings based on crowdsourced human-evaluated systems are just as sensitive as those based on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations, where in both, dropping as little as 0.02% of the total evaluations in the dataset can change the top-ranked model.</description>

      <title>Robust Data Fusion via Subsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data fusion and transfer learning are rapidly growing fields that enhance model performance for a target population by leveraging other related data sources or tasks. The challenges lie in the various potential heterogeneities between the target and external data, as well as various practical concerns that prevent a na\"ive data integration. We consider a realistic scenario where the target data is limited in size while the external data is large but contaminated with outliers; such data contamination, along with other computational and operational constraints, necessitates proper selection or subsampling of the external data for transfer learning. To our knowledge,transfer learning and subsampling under data contamination have not been thoroughly investigated. We address this gap by studying various transfer learning methods with subsamples of the external data, accounting for outliers deviating from the underlying true model due to arbitrary mean shifts. Two subsampling strategies are investigated: one aimed at reducing biases and the other at minimizing variances. Approaches to combine these strategies are also introduced to enhance the performance of the estimators. We provide non-asymptotic error bounds for the transfer learning estimators, clarifying the roles of sample sizes, signal strength, sampling rates, magnitude of outliers, and tail behaviors of model error distributions, among other factors. Extensive simulations show the superior performance of the proposed methods. Additionally, we apply our methods to analyze the risk of hard landings in A380 airplanes by utilizing data from other airplane types,demonstrating that robust transfer learning can improve estimation efficiency for relatively rare airplane types with the help of data from other types of airplanes.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Sliced Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sliced Optimal Transport (SOT) is a rapidly developing branch of optimal transport (OT) that exploits the tractability of one-dimensional OT problems. By combining tools from OT, integral geometry, and computational statistics, SOT enables fast and scalable computation of distances, barycenters, and kernels for probability measures, while retaining rich geometric structure. This paper provides a comprehensive review of SOT, covering its mathematical foundations, methodological advances, computational methods, and applications. We discuss key concepts of OT and one-dimensional OT, the role of tools from integral geometry such as Radon transform in projecting measures, and statistical techniques for estimating sliced distances. The paper further explores recent methodological advances, including non-linear projections, improved Monte Carlo approximations, statistical estimation techniques for one-dimensional optimal transport, weighted slicing techniques, and transportation plan estimation methods. Variational problems, such as minimum sliced Wasserstein estimation, barycenters, gradient flows, kernel constructions, and embeddings are examined alongside extensions to unbalanced, partial, multi-marginal, and Gromov-Wasserstein settings. Applications span machine learning, statistics, computer graphics and computer visions, highlighting SOT's versatility as a practical computational tool. This work will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in machine learning, data sciences, and computational disciplines seeking efficient alternatives to classical OT.</description>

      <title>On computing and the complexity of computing higher-order $U$-statistics, exactly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order $U$-statistics abound in fields such as statistics, machine learning, and computer science, but are known to be highly time-consuming to compute in practice. Despite their widespread appearance, a comprehensive study of their computational complexity is surprisingly lacking. This paper aims to fill that gap by presenting several results related to the computational aspect of $U$-statistics. First, we derive a useful decomposition from an $m$-th order $U$-statistic to a linear combination of $V$-statistics with orders not exceeding $m$, which are generally more feasible to compute. Second, we explore the connection between exactly computing $V$-statistics and Einstein summation, a tool often used in computational mathematics, quantum computing, and quantum information sciences for accelerating tensor computations. Third, we provide an optimistic estimate of the time complexity for exactly computing $U$-statistics, based on the treewidth of a particular graph associated with the $U$-statistic kernel. The above ingredients lead to a new, much more runtime-efficient algorithm of exactly computing general higher-order $U$-statistics. We also wrap our new algorithm into an open-source Python package called $\texttt{u-stats}$. We demonstrate via three statistical applications that $\texttt{u-stats}$ achieves impressive runtime performance compared to existing benchmarks. This paper aspires to achieve two goals: (1) to capture the interest of researchers in both statistics and other related areas further to advance the algorithmic development of $U$-statistics, and (2) to offer the package $\texttt{u-stats}$ as a valuable tool for practitioners, making the implementation of methods based on higher-order $U$-statistics a more delightful experience.</description>

      <title>Unfolded Laplacian Spectral Embedding: A Theoretically Grounded Approach to Dynamic Network Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic relational structures play a central role in many AI tasks, but their evolving nature presents challenges for consistent and interpretable representation. A common approach is to learn time-varying node embeddings, whose effectiveness depends on satisfying key stability properties. In this paper, we propose Unfolded Laplacian Spectral Embedding, a new method that extends the Unfolded Adjacency Spectral Embedding framework to normalized Laplacians while preserving both cross-sectional and longitudinal stability. We provide formal proof that our method satisfies these stability conditions. In addition, as a bonus of using the Laplacian matrix, we establish a new Cheeger-style inequality that connects the embeddings to the conductance of the underlying dynamic graphs. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the strong performance of our method. These results establish a principled and stable framework for dynamic network representation grounded in spectral graph theory.</description>

      <title>Optimal Condition for Initialization Variance in Deep Neural Networks: An SGD Dynamics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), one of the most fundamental optimization algorithms in machine learning (ML), can be recast through a continuous-time approximation as a Fokker-Planck equation for Langevin dynamics, a viewpoint that has motivated many theoretical studies. Within this framework, we study the relationship between the quasi-stationary distribution derived from this equation and the initial distribution through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. As the quasi-steady-state distribution depends on the expected cost function, the KL divergence eventually reveals the connection between the expected cost function and the initialization distribution. By applying this to deep neural network models (DNNs), we can express the bounds of the expected loss function explicitly in terms of the initialization parameters. Then, by minimizing this bound, we obtain an optimal condition of the initialization variance in the Gaussian case. This result provides a concrete mathematical criterion, rather than a heuristic approach, to select the scale of weight initialization in DNNs. In addition, we experimentally confirm our theoretical results by using the classical SGD to train fully connected neural networks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The result shows that if the variance of the initialization distribution satisfies our theoretical optimal condition, then the corresponding DNN model always achieves lower final training loss and higher test accuracy than the conventional He-normal initialization. Our work thus supplies a mathematically grounded indicator that guides the choice of initialization variance and clarifies its physical meaning of the dynamics of parameters in DNNs.</description>

      <title>The path to a goal: Understanding soccer possessions via path signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for predicting next actions in soccer possessions by leveraging path signatures to encode their complex spatio-temporal structure. Unlike existing approaches, we do not rely on fixed historical windows and handcrafted features, but rather encode the entire recent possession, thereby avoiding the inclusion of potentially irrelevant or misleading historical information. Path signatures naturally capture the order and interaction of events, providing a mathematically grounded feature encoding for variable-length time series of irregular sampling frequencies without the necessity for manual feature engineering. Our proposed approach outperforms a transformer-based benchmark across various loss metrics and considerably reduces computational cost. Building on these results, we introduce a new possession evaluation metric based on well-established frameworks in soccer analytics, incorporating both predicted action type probabilities and action location. Our metric shows greater reliability than existing metrics in domain-specific comparisons. Finally, we validate our approach through a detailed analysis of the 2017/18 Premier League season and discuss further applications and future extensions.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference: A Practical Guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in many areas of science and engineering is to identify model parameters that are consistent with prior knowledge and empirical data. Bayesian inference offers a principled framework for this task, but can be computationally prohibitive when models are defined by stochastic simulators. Simulation-based Inference (SBI) is a suite of methods developed to overcome this limitation, which has enabled scientific discoveries in fields such as particle physics, astrophysics, and neuroscience. The core idea of SBI is to train neural networks on data generated by a simulator, without requiring access to likelihood evaluations. Once trained, inference is amortized: The neural network can rapidly perform Bayesian inference on empirical observations without requiring additional training or simulations. In this tutorial, we provide a practical guide for practitioners aiming to apply SBI methods. We outline a structured SBI workflow and offer practical guidelines and diagnostic tools for every stage of the process -- from setting up the simulator and prior, choosing and training inference networks, to performing inference and validating the results. We illustrate these steps through examples from astrophysics, psychophysics, and neuroscience. This tutorial empowers researchers to apply state-of-the-art SBI methods, facilitating efficient parameter inference for scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Shapley Values: Paired-Sampling Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Originally introduced in cooperative game theory, Shapley values have become a very popular tool to explain machine learning predictions. Based on Shapley's fairness axioms, every input (feature component) gets a credit how it contributes to an output (prediction). These credits are then used to explain the prediction. The only limitation in computing the Shapley values (credits) for many different predictions is of computational nature. There are two popular sampling approximations, sampling KernelSHAP and sampling PermutationSHAP. Our first novel contributions are asymptotic normality results for these sampling approximations. Next, we show that the paired-sampling approaches provide exact results in case of interactions being of maximal order two. Furthermore, the paired-sampling PermutationSHAP possesses the additive recovery property, whereas its kernel counterpart does not.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Corrosion Resistance of Aluminum Alloys Through AI and ML Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Corrosion poses a significant challenge to the performance of aluminum alloys, particularly in marine environments. This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict and optimize corrosion resistance, utilizing a comprehensive open-source dataset compiled from various sources. The dataset encompasses corrosion rate data and environmental conditions, preprocessed to standardize units and formats. We explored two different approaches, a direct approach, where the material's composition and environmental conditions were used as inputs to predict corrosion rates; and an inverse approach, where corrosion rate served as the input to identify suitable material compositions as output. We employed and compared three distinct ML methodologies for forward predictions: Random Forest regression, optimized via grid search; a feed-forward neural network, utilizing ReLU activation and Adam optimization; and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), implemented with GPyTorch and employing various kernel functions. The Random Forest and neural network models provided predictive capabilities based on elemental compositions and environmental conditions. Notably, Gaussian Process Regression demonstrated superior performance, particularly with hybrid kernel functions. Log-transformed GPR further refined predictions. This study highlights the efficacy of ML, particularly GPR, in predicting corrosion rates and material properties.</description>

      <title>Causal Structure Learning in Hawkes Processes with Complex Latent Confounder Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate Hawkes process provides a powerful framework for modeling temporal dependencies and event-driven interactions in complex systems. While existing methods primarily focus on uncovering causal structures among observed subprocesses, real-world systems are often only partially observed, with latent subprocesses posing significant challenges. In this paper, we show that continuous-time event sequences can be represented by a discrete-time model as the time interval shrinks, and we leverage this insight to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying latent subprocesses and the causal influences. Accordingly, we propose a two-phase iterative algorithm that alternates between inferring causal relationships among discovered subprocesses and uncovering new latent subprocesses, guided by path-based conditions that guarantee identifiability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method effectively recovers causal structures despite the presence of latent subprocesses.</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis of multivariate planar curves and applications to X-ray classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in computer vision have enabled the availability of segmented images across various domains, such as medicine, where segmented radiography images play an important role in diagnosis-making. As prediction problems are common in medical image analysis, this work explores the use of segmented images (through the associated contours they highlight) as predictors in a supervised classification context. Consequently, we develop a new approach for image analysis that takes into account the shape of objects within images. For this aim, we introduce a new formalism that extends the study of single random planar curves to the joint analysis of multiple planar curves-referred to here as multivariate planar curves. In this framework, we propose a solution to the alignment issue in statistical shape analysis. The obtained multivariate shape variables are then used in functional classification methods through tangent projections. Detection of cardiomegaly in segmented X-rays and numerical experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the appeal and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A note on simulation methods for the Dirichlet-Laplace prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bhattacharya et al. (2015, Journal of the American Statistical Association 110(512): 1479-1490) introduce a novel prior, the Dirichlet-Laplace (DL) prior, and propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to simulate posterior draws under this prior in a conditionally Gaussian setting. The original algorithm samples from conditional distributions in the wrong order, i.e., it does not correctly sample from the joint posterior distribution of all latent variables. This note details the issue and provides two simple solutions: A correction to the original algorithm and a new algorithm based on an alternative, yet equivalent, formulation of the prior. This corrigendum does not affect the theoretical results in Bhattacharya et al. (2015).</description>

      <title>Universal Learning of Nonlinear Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of learning a marginally stable unknown nonlinear dynamical system. We describe an algorithm for this problem, based on the technique of spectral filtering, which learns a mapping from past observations to the next based on a spectral representation of the system. Using techniques from online convex optimization, we prove vanishing prediction error for any nonlinear dynamical system that has finitely many marginally stable modes, with rates governed by a novel quantitative control-theoretic notion of learnability. The main technical component of our method is a new spectral filtering algorithm for linear dynamical systems, which incorporates past observations and applies to general noisy and marginally stable systems. This significantly generalizes the original spectral filtering algorithm to both asymmetric dynamics as well as incorporating noise correction, and is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Unified Conformalized Multiple Testing with Full Data Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformalized multiple testing offers a model-free way to control predictive uncertainty in decision-making. Existing methods typically use only part of the available data to build score functions tailored to specific settings. We propose a unified framework that puts data utilization at the center: it uses all available data-null, alternative, and unlabeled-to construct scores and calibrate p-values through a full permutation strategy. This unified use of all available data significantly improves power by enhancing non-conformity score quality and maximizing calibration set size while rigorously controlling the false discovery rate. Crucially, our framework provides a systematic design principle for conformal testing and enables automatic selection of the best conformal procedure among candidates without extra data splitting. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our enhanced methods deliver superior efficiency and adaptability across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Does the Barron space really defy the curse of dimensionality?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Barron space has become famous in the theory of (shallow) neural networks because it seemingly defies the curse of dimensionality. And while the Barron space (and generalizations) indeed defies (defy) the curse of dimensionality from the POV of classical smoothness, we herein provide some evidence in favor of the idea that the Barron space (and generalizations) does (do) not defy the curse of dimensionality with a nonclassical notion of smoothness which relates naturally to "infinitely wide" shallow neural networks. Like how the Bessel potential spaces are defined via the Fourier transform, we define so-called ADZ spaces via the Mellin transform; these ADZ spaces encapsulate the nonclassical smoothness we alluded to earlier.

      <title>Asymptotic breakdown point analysis of the minimum density power divergence estimator under independent non-homogeneous setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimum density power divergence estimator (MDPDE) has gained significant attention in the literature of robust inference due to its strong robustness properties and high asymptotic efficiency; it is relatively easy to compute and can be interpreted as a generalization of the classical maximum likelihood estimator. It has been successfully applied in various setups, including the case of independent and non-homogeneous (INH) observations that cover both classification and regression-type problems with a fixed design. While the local robustness of this estimator has been theoretically validated through the bounded influence function, no general result is known about the global reliability or the breakdown behavior of this estimator under the INH setup, except for the specific case of location-type models. In this paper, we extend the notion of asymptotic breakdown point from the case of independent and identically distributed data to the INH setup and derive a theoretical lower bound for the asymptotic breakdown point of the MDPDE, under some easily verifiable assumptions. These results are further illustrated with applications to some fixed design regression models and corroborated through extensive simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous estimation of connectivity and dimensionality in samples of networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An overarching objective in contemporary statistical network analysis is extracting salient information from datasets consisting of multiple networks. To date, considerable attention has been devoted to node and network clustering, while comparatively less attention has been devoted to downstream connectivity estimation and parsimonious embedding dimension selection. Given a sample of potentially heterogeneous networks, this paper proposes a method to simultaneously estimate a latent matrix of connectivity probabilities and its embedding dimensionality or rank after first pre-estimating the number of communities and the node community memberships. The method is formulated as a convex optimization problem and solved using an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. We establish estimation error bounds under the Frobenius norm and nuclear norm for settings in which observable networks have blockmodel structure, even when node memberships are imperfectly recovered. When perfect membership recovery is possible and dimensionality is much smaller than the number of communities, the proposed method outperforms conventional averaging-based methods for estimating connectivity and dimensionality. Numerical studies empirically demonstrate the accuracy of our method across various scenarios. Additionally, analysis of a primate brain dataset demonstrates that posited connectivity is not necessarily full rank in practice, illustrating the need for flexible methodology.</description>

      <title>Toward Architecture-Agnostic Local Control of Posterior Collapse in VAEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs), one of the most widely used generative models, are known to suffer from posterior collapse, a phenomenon that reduces the diversity of generated samples. To avoid posterior collapse, many prior works have tried to control the influence of regularization loss. However, the trade-off between reconstruction and regularization is not satisfactory. For this reason, several methods have been proposed to guarantee latent identifiability, which is the key to avoiding posterior collapse. However, they require structural constraints on the network architecture. For further clarification, we define local posterior collapse to reflect the importance of individual sample points in the data space and to relax the network constraint. Then, we propose Latent Reconstruction(LR) loss, which is inspired by mathematical properties of injective and composite functions, to control posterior collapse without restriction to a specific architecture. We experimentally evaluate our approach, which controls posterior collapse on varied datasets such as MNIST, fashionMNIST, Omniglot, CelebA, and FFHQ.</description>

      <title>Data-driven particle dynamics: Structure-preserving coarse-graining for emergent behavior in non-equilibrium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiscale systems are ubiquitous in science and technology, but are notoriously challenging to simulate as short spatiotemporal scales must be appropriately linked to emergent bulk physics. When expensive high-dimensional dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative, history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1) coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.</description>

      <title>Constrained Centroid Clustering: A Novel Approach for Compact and Structured Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Constrained Centroid Clustering (CCC), a method that extends classical centroid-based clustering by enforcing a constraint on the maximum distance between the cluster center and the farthest point in the cluster. Using a Lagrangian formulation, we derive a closed-form solution that maintains interpretability while controlling cluster spread. To evaluate CCC, we conduct experiments on synthetic circular data with radial symmetry and uniform angular distribution. Using ring-wise, sector-wise, and joint entropy as evaluation metrics, we show that CCC achieves more compact clusters by reducing radial spread while preserving angular structure, outperforming standard methods such as K-means and GMM. The proposed approach is suitable for applications requiring structured clustering with spread control, including sensor networks, collaborative robotics, and interpretable pattern analysis.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel unsupervised outlier detection method based on Randomized Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Inspired by the performance of Randomized PCA (RPCA) Forest in approximate K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search, we develop a novel unsupervised outlier detection method that utilizes RPCA Forest for outlier detection. Experimental results showcase the superiority of the proposed approach compared to the classical and state-of-the-art methods in performing the outlier detection task on several datasets while performing competitively on the rest. The extensive analysis of the proposed method reflects it high generalization power and its computational efficiency, highlighting it as a good choice for unsupervised outlier detection.</description>

      <title>Bridging Human and LLM Judgments: Understanding and Narrowing the Gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used as judges (LLM-as-a-judge) to evaluate model outputs at scale, but their assessments often diverge systematically from human judgments. We present Bridge, a unified statistical framework that explicitly bridges human and LLM evaluations under both absolute scoring and pairwise comparison paradigms. Bridge posits a latent human preference score for each prompt-response pair and models LLM deviations as linear transformations of covariates that capture sources of discrepancies. This offers a simple and principled framework for refining LLM ratings and characterizing systematic discrepancies between humans and LLMs. We provide an efficient fitting algorithm with asymptotic guarantees for statistical inference. Using six LLM judges and two benchmarks (BigGen Bench and Chatbot Arena), Bridge achieves higher agreement with human ratings (accuracy, calibration, and KL divergence) and exposes systematic human-LLM gaps.</description>

      <title>A self-supervised learning approach for denoising autoregressive models with additive noise: finite and infinite variance cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The autoregressive time series model is a popular second-order stationary process, modeling a wide range of real phenomena. However, in applications, autoregressive signals are often corrupted by additive noise. Further, the autoregressive process and the corruptive noise may be highly impulsive, stemming from an infinite-variance distribution. The model estimation techniques that account for additional noise tend to show reduced efficacy when there is very strong noise present in the data, especially when the noise is heavy-tailed. Moreover, identification of a model corrupted with heavy-tailed, particularly infinite-variance noise, can be a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method to denoise the additive noise-corrupted autoregressive model. Our approach is motivated by recent work in computer vision and does not require full knowledge of the noise distribution. We use the proposed method to recover exemplary finite- and infinite-variance autoregressive signals, namely, Gaussian- and alpha-stable distributed signals, respectively, from their noise-corrupted versions. The simulation study conducted on both synthetic and semi-synthetic data demonstrates the efficiency of our method compared to several baseline methods, particularly when the corruption is significant and impulsive in nature. Finally, we apply the presented methodology to forecast the pure autoregressive signal from the noise-corrupted data.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Aware Multi-view Evidential Learning with Adaptive Prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-view evidential learning aims to integrate information from multiple views to improve prediction performance and provide trustworthy uncertainty esitimation. Most previous methods assume that view-specific evidence learning is naturally reliable. However, in practice, the evidence learning process tends to be biased. Through empirical analysis on real-world data, we reveal that samples tend to be assigned more evidence to support data-rich classes, thereby leading to unreliable uncertainty estimation in predictions. This motivates us to delve into a new Biased Evidential Multi-view Learning (BEML) problem. To this end, we propose Fairness-Aware Multi-view Evidential Learning (FAML). FAML first introduces an adaptive prior based on training trajectory, which acts as a regularization strategy to flexibly calibrate the biased evidence learning process. Furthermore, we explicitly incorporate a fairness constraint based on class-wise evidence variance to promote balanced evidence allocation. In the multi-view fusion stage, we propose an opinion alignment mechanism to mitigate view-specific bias across views, thereby encouraging the integration of consistent and mutually supportive evidence. Extensive experiments on five real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate that FAML achieves more balanced evidence allocation and improves both prediction performance and the reliability of uncertainty estimation compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Perfectly Truthful Calibration Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calibration requires that predictions are conditionally unbiased and, therefore, reliably interpretable as probabilities. Calibration measures quantify how far a predictor is from perfect calibration. As introduced by Haghtalab et al. (2024), a calibration measure is truthful if it is minimized in expectation when a predictor outputs the ground-truth probabilities. Although predicting the true probabilities guarantees perfect calibration, in reality, when calibration is evaluated on a finite sample, predicting the truth is not guaranteed to minimize any known calibration measure. All known calibration measures incentivize predictors to lie in order to appear more calibrated on a finite sample. Such lack of truthfulness motivated Haghtalab et al. (2024) and Qiao and Zhao (2025) to construct approximately truthful calibration measures in the sequential prediction setting, but no perfectly truthful calibration measure was known to exist even in the more basic batch setting.
  We design a perfectly truthful calibration measure in the batch setting: averaged two-bin calibration error (ATB). In addition to being truthful, ATB is sound, complete, continuous, and quadratically related to two existing calibration measures: the smooth calibration error (smCal) and the (lower) distance to calibration (distCal). The simplicity in our definition of ATB makes it efficient and straightforward to compute. ATB allows faster estimation algorithms with significantly easier implementations than smCal and distCal, achieving improved running time and simplicity for the calibration testing problem studied by Hu et al. (2024). We also introduce a general recipe for constructing truthful measures, which proves the truthfulness of ATB as a special case and allows us to construct other truthful calibration measures such as quantile-binned l_2-ECE.</description>

      <title>Improving Detection of Watermarked Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Watermarking has recently emerged as an effective strategy for detecting the generations of large language models (LLMs). The strength of a watermark typically depends strongly on the entropy afforded by the language model and the set of input prompts. However, entropy can be quite limited in practice, especially for models that are post-trained, for example via instruction tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which makes detection based on watermarking alone challenging. In this work, we investigate whether detection can be improved by combining watermark detectors with non-watermark ones. We explore a number of hybrid schemes that combine the two, observing performance gains over either class of detector under a wide range of experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>A Consistent and Scalable Algorithm for Best Subset Selection in Single Index Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysis of high-dimensional data has led to increased interest in both single index models (SIMs) and the best-subset selection. SIMs provide an interpretable and flexible modeling framework for high-dimensional data, while the best-subset selection aims to find a sparse model from a large set of predictors. However, the best-subset selection in high-dimensional models is known to be computationally intractable. Existing proxy algorithms are appealing but do not yield the bestsubset solution. In this paper, we directly tackle the intractability by proposing a provably scalable algorithm for the best-subset selection in high-dimensional SIMs. We directly proved the subset selection consistency and oracle property for our algorithmic solution, distinguishing it from other state-of-the-art support recovery methods in SIMs. The algorithm comprises a generalized information criterion to determine the support size of the regression coefficients, eliminating the model selection tuning. Moreover, our method does not assume an error distribution or a specific link function and hence is flexible to apply. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our method is not only computationally efficient but also able to exactly recover the best subset in various settings (e.g., linear regression, Poisson regression, heteroscedastic models).</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of online algorithms for vector-valued kernel regression</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating the regression function $f_\mu:\, \Omega \to Y$ from noisy $\mu$-distributed vector-valued data $(\omega_m,y_m)\in\Omega\times Y$ by an online learning algorithm using a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $H$ (RKHS) as prior. In an online algorithm, i.i.d. samples become available one by one via a random process and are successively processed to build approximations to the regression function. Assuming that the regression function essentially belongs to $H$ (soft learning scenario), we provide estimates for the expected squared error in the RKHS norm of the approximations $f^{(m)}\in H$ obtained by a standard regularized online approximation algorithm. In particular, we show an order-optimal estimate $$ \mathbb{E}(\|\epsilon^{(m)}\|_H^2)\le C (m+1)^{-s/(2+s)},\qquad m=1,2,\ldots, $$ where $\epsilon^{(m)}$ denotes the error term after $m$ processed data, the parameter $0&lt;s\leq 1$ expresses an additional smoothness assumption on the regression function, and the constant $C$ depends on the variance of the input noise, the smoothness of the regression function, and other parameters of the algorithm. The proof, which is inspired by results on Schwarz iterative methods in the noiseless case, uses only elementary Hilbert space techniques and minimal assumptions on the noise, the feature map that defines $H$ and the associated covariance operator.</description>

      <title>Optimal Projections for Classification with Naive Bayes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Naive Bayes classification model the class conditional densities are estimated as the products of their marginal densities along the cardinal basis directions. We study the problem of obtaining an alternative basis for this factorisation with the objective of enhancing the discriminatory power of the associated classification model. We formulate the problem as a projection pursuit to find the optimal linear projection on which to perform classification. Optimality is determined based on the multinomial likelihood within which probabilities are estimated using the Naive Bayes factorisation of the projected data. Projection pursuit offers the added benefits of dimension reduction and visualisation. We discuss an intuitive connection with class conditional independent components analysis, and show how this is realised visually in practical applications. The performance of the resulting classification models is investigated using a large collection of (162) publicly available benchmark data sets and in comparison with relevant alternatives. We find that the proposed approach substantially outperforms other popular probabilistic discriminant analysis models and is highly competitive with Support Vector Machines.
  Code to implement the proposed approach, in the form of an R package, is available from https://github.com/DavidHofmeyr/OPNB</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Filtering, Estimation and Classification using Neural Jump ODEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Jump ODEs model the conditional expectation between observations by neural ODEs and jump at arrival of new observations. They have demonstrated effectiveness for fully data-driven online forecasting in settings with irregular and partial observations, operating under weak regularity assumptions. This work extends the framework to input-output systems, enabling direct applications in online filtering and classification. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for this approach, providing a robust solution to $L^2$-optimal filtering. Empirical experiments highlight the model's superior performance over classical parametric methods, particularly in scenarios with complex underlying distributions. These results emphasise the approach's potential in time-sensitive domains such as finance and health monitoring, where real-time accuracy is crucial.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Chaos for Mean-Field Langevin Dynamics and its Application to Model Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD) is an optimization method derived by taking the mean-field limit of noisy gradient descent for two-layer neural networks in the mean-field regime. Recently, the propagation of chaos (PoC) for MFLD has gained attention as it provides a quantitative characterization of the optimization complexity in terms of the number of particles and iterations. A remarkable progress by Chen et al. (2022) showed that the approximation error due to finite particles remains uniform in time and diminishes as the number of particles increases. In this paper, by refining the defective log-Sobolev inequality -- a key result from that earlier work -- under the neural network training setting, we establish an improved PoC result for MFLD, which removes the exponential dependence on the regularization coefficient from the particle approximation term of the optimization complexity. As an application, we propose a PoC-based model ensemble strategy with theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Linear Bandits with Partially Observable Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the linear bandit problem that accounts for partially observable features. Without proper handling, unobserved features can lead to linear regret in the decision horizon $T$, as their influence on rewards is unknown. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel theoretical framework and an algorithm with sublinear regret guarantees. The core of our algorithm consists of (i) feature augmentation, by appending basis vectors that are orthogonal to the row space of the observed features; and (ii) the introduction of a doubly robust estimator. Our approach achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{(d + d_h)T})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the observed features and $d_h$ depends on the extent to which the unobserved feature space is contained in the observed one, thereby capturing the intrinsic difficulty of the problem. Notably, our algorithm requires no prior knowledge of the unobserved feature space, which may expand as more features become hidden. Numerical experiments confirm that our algorithm outperforms both non-contextual multi-armed bandits and linear bandit algorithms depending solely on observed features.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Optimism of Random-Design Linear and Kernel Regression Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derived the closed-form asymptotic optimism of linear regression models under random designs, and generalizes it to kernel ridge regression. Using scaled asymptotic optimism as a generic predictive model complexity measure, we studied the fundamental different behaviors of linear regression model, tangent kernel (NTK) regression model and three-layer fully connected neural networks (NN). Our contribution is two-fold: we provided theoretical ground for using scaled optimism as a model predictive complexity measure; and we show empirically that NN with ReLUs behaves differently from kernel models under this measure. With resampling techniques, we can also compute the optimism for regression models with real data.</description>

      <title>Balancing Interpretability and Flexibility in Modeling Diagnostic Trajectories with an Embedded Neural Hawkes Process Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hawkes process (HP) is commonly used to model event sequences with self-reinforcing dynamics, including electronic health records (EHRs). Traditional HPs capture self-reinforcement via parametric impact functions that can be inspected to understand how each event modulates the intensity of others. Neural network-based HPs offer greater flexibility, resulting in improved fit and prediction performance, but at the cost of interpretability, which is often critical in healthcare. In this work, we aim to understand and improve upon this tradeoff. We propose a novel HP formulation in which impact functions are modeled by defining a flexible impact kernel, instantiated as a neural network, in event embedding space, which allows us to model large-scale event sequences with many event types. This approach is more flexible than traditional HPs yet more interpretable than other neural network approaches, and allows us to explicitly trade flexibility for interpretability by adding transformer encoder layers to further contextualize the event embeddings. Results show that our method accurately recovers impact functions in simulations, achieves competitive performance on MIMIC-IV procedure dataset, and gains clinically meaningful interpretation on Duke-EHR with children diagnosis dataset even without transformer layers. This suggests that our flexible impact kernel is often sufficient to capture self-reinforcing dynamics in EHRs and other data effectively, implying that interpretability can be maintained without loss of performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) offer a powerful framework for sampling graphs in proportion to their rewards. However, existing approaches suffer from systematic biases due to inaccuracies in state transition probability computations. These biases, rooted in the inherent symmetries of graphs, impact both atom-based and fragment-based generation schemes. To address this challenge, we introduce Symmetry-Aware GFlowNets (SA-GFN), a method that incorporates symmetry corrections into the learning process through reward scaling. By integrating bias correction directly into the reward structure, SA-GFN eliminates the need for explicit state transition computations. Empirical results show that SA-GFN enables unbiased sampling while enhancing diversity and consistently generating high-reward graphs that closely match the target distribution.</description>

      <title>Information Must Flow: Recursive Bootstrapping for Information Bottleneck in Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), a unified framework that models cognition as the directed flow of information between high-entropy context and low-entropy content. Inference emerges as a cycle of bidirectional interactions, bottom-up contextual disambiguation paired with top-down content reconstruction, which resolves the Information Bottleneck in Optimal Transport (iBOT). Implemented via Rao-Blackwellized variational entropy minimization, CCUP steers representations toward minimal joint uncertainty while preserving inferential directionality. Local cycle completion underpins temporal bootstrapping, chaining simulations to refine memory, and spatial bootstrapping, enabling compositional hierarchical inference. We prove a Delta Convergence Theorem showing that recursive entropy minimization yields delta-like attractors in latent space, stabilizing perceptual schemas and motor plans. Temporal bootstrapping through perception-action loops and sleep-wake consolidation further transforms episodic traces into semantic knowledge. Extending CCUP, each hierarchical level performs delta-seeded inference: low-entropy content seeds diffuse outward along goal-constrained paths shaped by top-down priors and external context, confining inference to task-relevant manifolds and circumventing the curse of dimensionality. Building on this, we propose that language emerges as a symbolic transport system, externalizing latent content to synchronize inference cycles across individuals. Together, these results establish iBOT as a foundational principle of information flow in both individual cognition and collective intelligence, positioning recursive inference as the structured conduit through which minds adapt, align, and extend.</description>

      <title>ADMIRE-BayesOpt: Accelerated Data MIxture RE-weighting for Language Models with Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the optimal data mixture for large language model training remains a challenging problem with an outsized impact on performance. In practice, language model developers continue to rely on heuristic exploration since no learning-based approach has emerged as a reliable solution. In this work, we propose to view the selection of training data mixtures as a black-box hyperparameter optimization problem, for which Bayesian Optimization is a well-established class of appropriate algorithms. Firstly, we cast data mixture learning as a sequential decision-making problem, in which we aim to find a suitable trade-off between the computational cost of training exploratory (proxy-) models and final mixture performance. Secondly, we systematically explore the properties of transferring mixtures learned at a small scale to larger-scale experiments, providing insights and highlighting opportunities for research at a modest scale. By proposing Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization as a suitable method in this common scenario, we introduce a natural framework to balance experiment cost with model fit, avoiding the risks of overfitting to smaller scales while minimizing the number of experiments at high cost. We present results for pre-training and instruction finetuning across models ranging from 1 million to 7 billion parameters, varying from simple architectures to state-of-the-art models and benchmarks spanning dozens of datasets. We demonstrate consistently strong results relative to a wide range of baselines, resulting inspeed-ups of over 500% in determining the best data mixture on our largest experiments. In addition, we broaden access to research by sharing ADMIRE IFT Runs, a dataset of 460 full training &amp; evaluation runs worth over 13,000 GPU hours, greatly reducing the cost of conducting research in this area.</description>

Abstract: We provide uniform confidence bands for kernel ridge regression (KRR), a widely used nonparametric regression estimator for nonstandard data such as preferences, sequences, and graphs. Despite the prevalence of these data--e.g., student preferences in school matching mechanisms--the inferential theory of KRR is not fully known. We construct valid and sharp confidence sets that shrink at nearly the minimax rate, allowing nonstandard regressors. Our bootstrap procedure uses anti-symmetric multipliers for computational efficiency and for validity under mis-specification. We use the procedure to develop a test for match effects, i.e. whether students benefit more from the schools they rank highly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a formulation of flow matching as variational inference, which we refer to as variational flow matching (VFM). Based on this formulation we develop CatFlow, a flow matching method for categorical data. CatFlow is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and achieves strong results on graph generation tasks. In VFM, the objective is to approximate the posterior probability path, which is a distribution over possible end points of a trajectory. We show that VFM admits both the CatFlow objective and the original flow matching objective as special cases. We also relate VFM to score-based models, in which the dynamics are stochastic rather than deterministic, and derive a bound on the model likelihood based on a reweighted VFM objective. We evaluate CatFlow on one abstract graph generation task and two molecular generation tasks. In all cases, CatFlow exceeds or matches performance of the current state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Must Be Taught to Know What They Don't Know</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When using large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes applications, we need to know when we can trust their predictions. Some works argue that prompting high-performance LLMs is sufficient to produce calibrated uncertainties, while others introduce sampling methods that can be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we first argue that prompting on its own is insufficient to achieve good calibration and then show that fine-tuning on a small dataset of correct and incorrect answers can create an uncertainty estimate with good generalization and small computational overhead. We show that a thousand graded examples are sufficient to outperform baseline methods and that training through the features of a model is necessary for good performance and tractable for large open-source models when using LoRA. We also investigate the mechanisms that enable reliable LLM uncertainty estimation, finding that many models can be used as general-purpose uncertainty estimators, applicable not just to their own uncertainties but also the uncertainty of other models. Lastly, we show that uncertainty estimates inform human use of LLMs in human-AI collaborative settings through a user study.</description>

      <title>Prompt-to-Slate: Diffusion Models for Prompt-Conditioned Slate Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slate generation is a common task in streaming and e-commerce platforms, where multiple items are presented together as a list or ``slate''. Traditional systems focus mostly on item-level ranking and often fail to capture the coherence of the slate as a whole. A key challenge lies in the combinatorial nature of selecting multiple items jointly. To manage this, conventional approaches often assume users interact with only one item at a time, assumption that breaks down when items are meant to be consumed together.
  In this paper, we introduce DMSG, a generative framework based on diffusion models for prompt-conditioned slate generation. DMSG learns high-dimensional structural patterns and generates coherent, diverse slates directly from natural language prompts. Unlike retrieval-based or autoregressive models, DMSG models the joint distribution over slates, enabling greater flexibility and diversity.
  We evaluate DMSG in two key domains: music playlist generation and e-commerce bundle creation. In both cases, DMSG produces high-quality slates from textual prompts without explicit personalization signals. Offline and online results show that DMSG outperforms strong baselines in both relevance and diversity, offering a scalable, low-latency solution for prompt-driven recommendation. A live A/B test on a production playlist system further demonstrates increased user engagement and content diversity.</description>

      <title>A Law of Next-Token Prediction in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely employed across various application domains, yet their black-box nature poses significant challenges to understanding how these models process input data internally to make predictions. In this paper, we introduce a precise and quantitative law that governs the learning of contextualized token embeddings through intermediate layers in pre-trained LLMs for next-token prediction. Our findings reveal that each layer contributes equally to enhancing prediction accuracy, from the lowest to the highest layer -- a universal phenomenon observed across a diverse array of open-source LLMs, irrespective of their architectures or pre-training data. We demonstrate that this law offers new perspectives and actionable insights to inform and guide practices in LLM development and applications, including model scaling, pre-training tasks, and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Multilingual hierarchical classification of job advertisements for job vacancy statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop a multilingual classifier and conditional probability estimator of occupation codes for online job advertisements in accordance with the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) extended with the Polish Classification of Occupations and Specializations (KZiS), which is analogous to the European Classification of Occupations. In this paper, we utilise a range of data sources, including a novel one, namely the Central Job Offers Database, which is a register of all vacancies submitted to Public Employment Offices. Their staff members code the vacancies according to the ISCO and KZiS. A hierarchical multi-class classifier has been developed based on the transformer architecture. The classifier begins by encoding the jobs found in advertisements to the widest 1-digit occupational group, and then narrows the assignment to a 6-digit occupation code. We show that incorporation of the hierarchical structure of occupations improves prediction accuracy by 1-2 percentage points, particularly for the hand-coded online job advertisements. Finally, a bilingual (Polish and English) and multilingual (24 languages) model is developed based on data translated using closed and open-source software. The open-source software is provided for the benefit of the official statistics community, with a particular focus on international comparability.</description>

      <title>Constructive approximate transport maps with normalizing flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an approximate controllability problem for the continuity equation and its application to constructing transport maps with normalizing flows. Specifically, we construct time-dependent controls $\theta=(w, a, b)$ in the vector field $x\mapsto w(a^\top x + b)_+$ to approximately transport a known base density $\rho_{\mathrm{B}}$ to a target density $\rho_*$. The approximation error is measured in relative entropy, and $\theta$ are constructed piecewise constant, with bounds on the number of switches being provided. Our main result relies on an assumption on the relative tail decay of $\rho_*$ and $\rho_{\mathrm{B}}$, and provides hints on characterizing the reachable space of the continuity equation in relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ideas of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty are widely used to reason about the probabilistic predictions of machine-learning models. We identify incoherence in existing discussions of these ideas and suggest this stems from the aleatoric-epistemic view being insufficiently expressive to capture all the distinct quantities that researchers are interested in. To address this we present a decision-theoretic perspective that relates rigorous notions of uncertainty, predictive performance and statistical dispersion in data. This serves to support clearer thinking as the field moves forward. Additionally we provide insights into popular information-theoretic quantities, showing they can be poor estimators of what they are often purported to measure, while also explaining how they can still be useful in guiding data acquisition.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Exploration for Multi-Reward Multi-Policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the policy evaluation problem in an online multi-reward multi-policy discounted setting, where multiple reward functions must be evaluated simultaneously for different policies. We adopt an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC perspective to achieve $\epsilon$-accurate estimates with high confidence across finite or convex sets of rewards, a setting that has not been investigated in the literature. Building on prior work on Multi-Reward Best Policy Identification, we adapt the MR-NaS exploration scheme to jointly minimize sample complexity for evaluating different policies across different reward sets. Our approach leverages an instance-specific lower bound revealing how the sample complexity scales with a measure of value deviation, guiding the design of an efficient exploration policy. Although computing this bound entails a hard non-convex optimization, we propose an efficient convex approximation that holds for both finite and convex reward sets. Experiments in tabular domains demonstrate the effectiveness of this adaptive exploration scheme.</description>

      <title>Stability and performance guarantees for misspecified multivariate score-driven filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05021v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can stochastic gradient methods track a moving target? We address the problem of tracking multivariate time-varying parameters under noisy observations and potential model misspecification. Specifically, we examine implicit and explicit score-driven (ISD and ESD) filters, which update parameter predictions using the gradient of the logarithmic postulated observation density (commonly referred to as the score). For both filter types, we derive novel sufficient conditions that ensure the exponential stability of the filtered parameter path and the existence of a finite mean squared error (MSE) bound relative to the pseudo-true parameter path. Our (non-)asymptotic MSE bounds rely on mild moment conditions on the data-generating process, while our stability results are agnostic about the true process. For the ISD filter, concavity of the postulated log density combined with simple parameter restrictions is sufficient to guarantee stability. In contrast, the ESD filter additionally requires the score to be Lipschitz continuous and the learning rate to be sufficiently small. We validate our theoretical findings through simulation studies, showing that ISD filters outperform ESD filters in terms of accuracy and stability.</description>

      <title>Reverse Markov Learning: Multi-Step Generative Models for Complex Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning complex distributions is a fundamental challenge in contemporary applications. Shen and Meinshausen (2024) introduced engression, a generative approach based on scoring rules that maps noise (and covariates, if available) directly to data. While effective, engression can struggle with highly complex distributions, such as those encountered in image data. In this work, we propose reverse Markov learning (RML), a framework that defines a general forward process transitioning from the target distribution to a known distribution (e.g., Gaussian) and then learns a reverse Markov process using multiple engression models. This reverse process reconstructs the target distribution step by step. This framework accommodates general forward processes, allows for dimension reduction, and naturally discretizes the generative process. In the special case of diffusion-based forward processes, RML provides an efficient discretization strategy for both training and inference in diffusion models. We further introduce an alternating sampling scheme to enhance post-training performance. Our statistical analysis establishes error bounds for RML and elucidates its advantages in estimation efficiency and flexibility in forward process design. Empirical results on simulated and climate data corroborate the theoretical findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of RML in capturing complex distributions.</description>

      <title>NoProp: Training Neural Networks without Full Back-propagation or Full Forward-propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The canonical deep learning approach for learning requires computing a gradient term at each block by back-propagating the error signal from the output towards each learnable parameter. Given the stacked structure of neural networks, where each block builds on the representation of the block below, this approach leads to hierarchical representations. More abstract features live on the top blocks of the model, while features on lower blocks are expected to be less abstract. In contrast to this, we introduce a new learning method named NoProp, which does not rely on either forward or backwards propagation across the entire network. Instead, NoProp takes inspiration from diffusion and flow matching methods, where each block independently learns to denoise a noisy target using only local targets and back-propagation within the block. We believe this work takes a first step towards introducing a new family of learning methods that does not learn hierarchical representations -- at least not in the usual sense. NoProp needs to fix the representation at each block beforehand to a noised version of the target, learning a local denoising process that can then be exploited at inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 image classification benchmarks. Our results show that NoProp is a viable learning algorithm, is easy to use and computationally efficient. By departing from the traditional learning paradigm which requires back-propagating a global error signal, NoProp alters how credit assignment is done within the network, enabling more efficient distributed learning as well as potentially impacting other characteristics of the learning process.</description>

      <title>Learning from Samples: Inverse Problems over measures via Sharpened Fenchel-Young Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating parameters from samples of an optimal probability distribution is essential in applications ranging from socio-economic modeling to biological system analysis. In these settings, the probability distribution arises as the solution to an optimization problem that captures either static interactions among agents or the dynamic evolution of a system over time. We introduce a general methodology based on a new class of loss functions, called sharpened Fenchel-Young losses, which measure the sub-optimality gap of the optimization problem over the space of probability measures. We provide explicit stability guarantees for two relevant settings in the context of optimal transport: The first is inverse unbalanced optimal transport (iUOT) with entropic regularization, where the parameters to estimate are cost functions that govern transport computations; this method has applications such as link prediction in machine learning. The second is inverse gradient flow (iJKO), where the objective is to recover a potential function that drives the evolution of a probability distribution via the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) time-discretization scheme; this is particularly relevant for understanding cell population dynamics in single-cell genomics. We also establish source conditions to ensure stability of our method under mirror stratifiable regularizers (such as l1 or nuclear norm) that promote structure. Finally, we present optimization algorithms specifically tailored to efficiently solve iUOT and iJKO problems. We validate our approach through numerical experiments on Gaussian distributions, where closed-form solutions are available, to demonstrate the practical performance of our methods.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Experts Provably Detect and Learn the Latent Cluster Structure in Gradient-Based Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE), an ensemble of specialized models equipped with a router that dynamically distributes each input to appropriate experts, has achieved successful results in the field of machine learning. However, theoretical understanding of this architecture is falling behind due to its inherent complexity. In this paper, we theoretically study the sample and runtime complexity of MoE following the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) when learning a regression task with an underlying cluster structure of single index models. On the one hand, we prove that a vanilla neural network fails in detecting such a latent organization as it can only process the problem as a whole. This is intrinsically related to the concept of information exponent which is low for each cluster, but increases when we consider the entire task. On the other hand, we show that a MoE succeeds in dividing this problem into easier subproblems by leveraging the ability of each expert to weakly recover the simpler function corresponding to an individual cluster. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to explore the benefits of the MoE framework by examining its SGD dynamics in the context of nonlinear regression.</description>

      <title>When can in-context learning generalize out of task distribution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize \emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem influence the transition.</description>

      <title>Scalable Gaussian Processes with Latent Kronecker Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying Gaussian processes (GPs) to very large datasets remains a challenge due to limited computational scalability. Matrix structures, such as the Kronecker product, can accelerate operations significantly, but their application commonly entails approximations or unrealistic assumptions. In particular, the most common path to creating a Kronecker-structured kernel matrix is by evaluating a product kernel on gridded inputs that can be expressed as a Cartesian product. However, this structure is lost if any observation is missing, breaking the Cartesian product structure, which frequently occurs in real-world data such as time series. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging latent Kronecker structure, by expressing the kernel matrix of observed values as the projection of a latent Kronecker product. In combination with iterative linear system solvers and pathwise conditioning, our method facilitates inference of exact GPs while requiring substantially fewer computational resources than standard iterative methods. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art sparse and variational GPs on real-world datasets with up to five million examples, including robotics, automated machine learning, and climate applications.</description>

      <title>A Free Probabilistic Framework for Analyzing the Transformer-based Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a formal operator-theoretic framework for analyzing Transformer-based language models using free probability theory. By modeling token embeddings and attention mechanisms as self-adjoint operators in a tracial \( W^* \)-probability space, we reinterpret attention as non-commutative convolution and describe representation propagation via free additive convolution. This leads to a spectral dynamic system interpretation of deep Transformers. We derive entropy-based generalization bounds under freeness assumptions and provide insight into positional encoding, spectral evolution, and representational complexity. This work offers a principled, though theoretical, perspective on structural dynamics in large language models.</description>

      <title>Online Learning with Probing for Sequential User-Centric Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formalize sequential decision-making with information acquisition as the probing-augmented user-centric selection (PUCS) framework, where a learner first probes a subset of arms to obtain side information on resources and rewards, and then assigns $K$ plays to $M$ arms. PUCS covers applications such as ridesharing, wireless scheduling, and content recommendation, in which both resources and payoffs are initially unknown and probing is costly. For the offline setting with known distributions, we present a greedy probing algorithm with a constant-factor approximation guarantee $\zeta = (e-1)/(2e-1)$. For the online setting with unknown distributions, we introduce OLPA, a stochastic combinatorial bandit algorithm that achieves a regret bound $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} + \ln^{2} T)$. We also prove a lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, showing that the upper bound is tight up to logarithmic factors. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions.</description>

      <title>Two-sample comparison through additive tree models for density ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ratio of two densities characterizes their differences. We consider learning the density ratio given i.i.d. observations from each of the two distributions. We propose additive tree models for the density ratio along with efficient algorithms for training these models using a new loss function called the balancing loss. With this loss, additive tree models for the density ratio can be trained using algorithms original designed for supervised learning. Specifically, they can be trained from both an optimization perspective that parallels tree boosting and from a (generalized) Bayesian perspective that parallels Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). For the former, we present two boosting algorithms -- one based on forward-stagewise fitting and the other based on gradient boosting, both of which produce a point estimate for the density ratio function. For the latter, we show that due to the loss function's resemblance to an exponential family kernel, the new loss can serve as a pseudo-likelihood for which conjugate priors exist, thereby enabling effective generalized Bayesian inference on the density ratio using backfitting samplers designed for BART. The resulting uncertainty quantification on the inferred density ratio is critical for applications involving high-dimensional and complex distributions in which uncertainty given limited data can often be substantial. We provide insights on the balancing loss through its close connection to the exponential loss in binary classification and to the variational form of f-divergence, in particular that of the squared Hellinger distance. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach while providing unique capabilities in uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate the application of our method in a case study involving assessing the quality of generative models for microbiome compositional data.</description>
