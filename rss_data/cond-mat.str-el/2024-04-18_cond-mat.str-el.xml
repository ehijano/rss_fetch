      <title>Eight-color chiral spin liquid in the $S=1$ bilinear-biquadratic model with Kitaev interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipolar spin systems provide a rich ground for the emergence of unexpected states of matter due to their enlarged spin degree of freedom. In this study, with a specific emphasis on $S=1$ magnets, we explore the interplay between spin nematic states and spin liquids. Based on the foundations laid in the prior work [R. Pohle et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, L140403 (2023)], we investigate the $S=1$ Kitaev model with bilinear-biquadratic interactions, which stabilizes, next to Kitaev spin liquid, spin nematic and triple-$q$ phases, also an exotic chiral spin liquid. Through a systematic reduction of the spin degree of freedom -- from $\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ to $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ and ultimately to a discrete eight-color model -- we provide an intuitive understanding of the nature and origin of this chiral spin liquid. We find that the chiral spin liquid is characterized by an extensive ground-state degeneracy, bound by a residual entropy, extremely short-ranged correlations, a nonzero scalar spin chirality marked by $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux order, and a gapped continuum of excitations. Our work contributes not only to the specific exploration of $S=1$ Kitaev magnets but also to the broader understanding of the importance of multipolar spin degree of freedom on the ground state and excitation properties in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Interacting Crystalline Topological Insulators in 2D with Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology is routinely used to understand the physics of electronic insulators. However, for strongly interacting electronic matter, such as Mott insulators, a comprehensive topological characterization is still lacking. When their ground state only contains short range entanglement and does not break symmetries spontaneously, they generically realize crystalline symmetry protected topological phases (cFSPTs), supporting gapless modes at the boundaries or at the lattice defects. Here, we provide an exhaustive classification of cFSPTs in two-dimensions (2D) with $\mathrm{U}(1)$ charge-conservation and spinful time-reversal symmetries, namely those generically are present in spin-orbit coupled insulators, for any of the 17 wallpaper groups. It has been shown that the classification of cFSPTs can be understood from appropriate real-space decorations of lower-dimensional subspaces, and we expose how these relate to the Wyckoff positions of the lattice. We find that all nontrivial one-dimensional decorations require electronic interactions. Furthermore, we provide model Hamiltonians for various decorations, and discuss the signatures of cFSPTs. This classification paves the way to further explore topological interacting insulators, providing the backbone information in generic model systems and ultimately in experiments.</description>

      <title>Dirac spin liquid as an "unnecessary" quantum critical point on square lattice antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of quantum matter especially pertinent to many modern condensed matter systems. Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of gapless quantum spin liquids that do not have a quasi-particle description and are potentially realized in a wide variety of spin $1/2$ magnetic systems on $2d$ lattices. In particular, the DSL in square lattice spin-$1/2$ magnets is described at low energies by $(2+1)d$ quantum electrodynamics with $N_f=4$ flavors of massless Dirac fermions minimally coupled to an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. The existence of a relevant, symmetry-allowed monopole perturbation renders the DSL on the square lattice intrinsically unstable. We argue that the DSL describes a stable continuous phase transition within the familiar Neel phase (or within the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase). In other words, the DSL is an "unnecessary" quantum critical point within a single phase of matter. Our result offers a novel view of the square lattice DSL in that the critical spin liquid can exist within either the Neel or VBS state itself, and does not require leaving these conventional states.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure and component-separated transitions of HoNiSi$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HoNiSi$_{3}$ is an intermetallic compound characterized by two successive antiferromagnetic transitions at $T_{N1} = 6.3$ K and $T_{N2} = 10.4$ K. Here, its zero-field microscopic magnetic structure is inferred from resonant x-ray magnetic diffraction experiments on a single crystalline sample that complement previous bulk magnetic susceptibility data. For $T &lt; T_{N2}$, the primitive magnetic unit cell matches the chemical cell. The magnetic structure features ferromagnetic {\it ac} planes stacked in an antiferromagnetic $\uparrow \downarrow \uparrow \downarrow$ pattern. For $T_{N1} &lt; T &lt; T_{N2}$, the ordered magnetic moment points along $\vec{a}$, and for $T &lt; T_{N1}$ a component along $\vec{c}$ also orders. A symmetry analysis indicates that the magnetic structure for $T&lt;T_{N1}$ is not compatible with the presumed orthorhombic $Cmmm$ space group of the chemical structure, and therefore a slight lattice distortion is implied. Mean-field calculations using a simplified magnetic Hamiltonian, including a reduced set of three independent exchange coupling parameters determined by density functional theory calculations and two crystal electric field terms taken as free-fitting parameters, are able to reproduce the main experimental observations. An alternative approach using a more complete model including seven exchange coupling and nine crystal electric field terms is also explored, where the search of the ground state magnetic structure compatible with the available anisotropic magnetic susceptibility and magnetization data is carried out with the help of an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The possible magnetic configurations are grouped into five clusters, and the cluster that yields the best comparison with the experimental macroscopic data contains the parameters previously found with the simplified model and also predicts the correct ground-state magnetic structure.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Eliashberg theory for systems with electron-phonon and electron-electron interaction: a comparative analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of the validity of Eliashberg theory for the cases of fermions interacting with an Einstein phonon and with soft nematic fluctuations near an Ising-nematic/Ising-ferromagnetic quantum-critical point (QCP). In both cases, Eliashberg theory is obtained by neglecting vertex corrections. For the phonon case, the reasoning to neglect vertex corrections is the Migdal ``fast electron/slow boson'' argument because the phonon velocity is much smaller than the Fermi velocity, $v_F$. The same argument allows one to compute the fermionic self-energy within Eliashberg theory perturbatively rather than self-consistently. For the nematic case, the velocity of a collective boson is comparable to $v_F$ and this argument apparently does not work. Nonetheless, we argue that while two-loop vertex corrections near a nematic QCP are not small parametrically, they are small numerically. At the same time, perturbative calculation of the fermionic self-energy can be rigorously justified when the fermion-boson coupling is small compared to the Fermi energy. Furthermore, we argue that for the electron-phonon case Eliashberg theory breaks down at some distance from where the dressed Debye frequency would vanish, while for the nematic case it holds all the way to a QCP. From this perspective, Eliashberg theory for the nematic case actually works better than for the electron-phonon case.</description>

      <title>Pair density waves in the strong-coupling two-dimensional Holstein-Hubbard model: a variational Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A robust theory of the mechanism of pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity (i.e. where Cooper pairs have nonzero center of mass momentum) remains elusive. Here we explore the triangular lattice $t$-$J$-$V$ model, a low-energy effective theory derived from the strong-coupling limit of the Holstein-Hubbard model, by large-scale variational Monte Carlo simulations. When the electron density is sufficiently low, the favored ground state is an s-wave PDW, consistent with results obtained from previous studies in this limit. Additionally, a PDW ground state with nematic d-wave pairing emerges in intermediate range of electron densities and phonon frequencies. For these s-wave and d-wave PDWs arising in states with spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries, PDW formation derives from valley-polarization and intra-pocket pairing.</description>

      <title>Tunable Kondo physics in a van der Waals kagome antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kondo lattice physics, describing the hybridization of localized spin matrix with dispersive conduction electrons, breeds numerous discoveries in the realm of strongly correlated quantum matter. Generally observed in lanthanide and actinide compounds, increasing attention has been directed towards alternative pathways for achieving flat band structures, such as Morie superlattices and Kagome metals. However, fine control of Kondo interaction outside of heterostructures remains elusive. Here we report the discovery of a van der Waals (vdW) kagome antiferromagnet CsCr6Sb6. Angle-resolved photoemission spectra and theoretical analysis show clear flat bands, consisting of half-filled 3dxz and 3dyz orbitals of Cr, situated 50 meV below the Fermi level. Importantly, we observe the emergence of anomalous Hall effect with remarkable tunability by simple reduction the sample thickness. The effective control of kondo interaction in CsCr6Sb6 render it an ideal platform for exploring unpresented phenomena using the vast toolkit of vdW structures.</description>

      <title>Mass-Assisted Local Deconfinement in a Confined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement is a prominent phenomenon in condensed matter and high-energy physics that has recently become the focus of quantum-simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). As such, a theoretical understanding of the effect of confinement on LGT dynamics is not only of fundamental importance, but can lend itself to upcoming experiments. Here, we show how confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT can be \textit{locally} avoided by proximity to a resonance between the fermion mass and the electric field strength. Furthermore, we show that this local deconfinement can become global for certain initial conditions, where information transport occurs over the entire chain. In addition, we show how this can lead to strong quantum many-body scarring starting in different initial states. Our findings provide deeper insights into the nature of confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs and can be tested on current and near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Symmetry Preserving Gapped Phases from Coupling Constant Anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we will characterize constraints on the possible IR phases of a given QFT by anomalies in the space of coupling constants. We will give conditions under which a coupling constant anomaly cannot be matched by a continuous family of symmetry preserving gapped phases, in which case the theory is either gapless, or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking or a phase transition. We additionally demonstrate examples of theories with coupling constant anomalies which can be matched by a family of symmetry preserving gapped phases without a phase transition and comment on the interpretation of our results for the spontaneous breaking of "$(-1)$-form global symmetries."</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twist between neighboring layers and variation of interlayer distance are two extra ways to control the physical properties of stacked two-dimensional van der Waals materials without alteration of chemical compositions or application of external fields, compared to their monolayer counterparts. In this work, we explored the dependence of the magnetic states of the untwisted and twisted bilayer 1T-VX$_2$ (X = S, Se) on the interlayer distance by density functional theory calculations. We find that, while a magnetic phase transition occurs from interlayer ferromagnetism to interlayer antiferromagnetism either as a function of decreasing interlayer distance for the untwisted bilayer 1T-VX$_2$ or after twist, richer magnetic phase transitions consecutively take place for the twisted bilayer 1T-VX$_2$ as interlayer distance is gradually reduced. Besides, the critical pressures for the phase transition are greatly reduced in twisted bilayer 1T-VX$_2$ compared with the untwisted case. We derived the Heisenberg model with intralayer and interlayer exchange couplings to comprehend the emergence of various magnetic states. Our results point out an easy access towards tunable two-dimensional magnets.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of honeycomb lattice model by high-order moir\'e pattern</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices have become an emergent solid-state platform for simulating quantum lattice models. However, in single moir\'e device, Hamiltonians parameters like lattice constant, hopping and interaction terms can hardly be manipulated, limiting the controllability and accessibility of moire quantum simulator. Here, by combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that high-order moir\'e patterns in graphene-monolayered xenon/krypton heterostructures can simulate honeycomb model in mesoscale, with in-situ tunable Hamiltonians parameters. The length scale of simulated lattice constant can be tuned by annealing processes, which in-situ adjusts intervalley interaction and hopping parameters in the simulated honeycomb lattice. The sign of the lattice constant can be switched by choosing xenon or krypton monolayer deposited on graphene, which controls sublattice degree of freedom and valley arrangment of Dirac fermions. Our work establishes a novel path for experimentally simulating the honeycomb model with tunable parameters by high-order moir\'e patterns.</description>

Abstract: Optical manipulation of magnetism holds promise for future ultrafast spintronics, especially with lanthanides and their huge, localized 4f magnetic moments. These moments interact indirectly via the conduction electrons (RKKY exchange), influenced by interatomic orbital overlap, and the conduction electron susceptibility. Here, we study this influence in a series of 4f antiferromagnets, GdT2Si2 (T=Co, Rh, Ir), using ultrafast resonant X-ray diffraction. We observe a twofold increase in ultrafast angular momentum transfer between the materials, originating from modifications in the conduction electron susceptibility, as confirmed by first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle cooling algorithms for quantum many-body state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing correlated states of many-body systems is one of the central tasks for quantum simulators and processors. A promising approach to state preparation is to realize desired correlated states as steady states of engineered dissipative evolution. A recent experiment with a Google superconducting quantum processor [X. Mi et al., Science 383, 1332 (2024)] demonstrated a cooling algorithm utilizing auxiliary degrees of freedom that are periodically reset to remove quasiparticles from the system, thereby driving it towards the ground state. We develop a kinetic theory framework to describe quasiparticle cooling dynamics, and employ it to compare the efficiency of different cooling algorithms. In particular, we introduce a protocol where coupling to auxiliaries is modulated in time to minimize heating processes, and demonstrate that it allows a high-fidelity preparation of ground states in different quantum phases. We verify the validity of the kinetic theory description by an extensive comparison with numerical simulations of a 1d transverse-field Ising model using a solvable model and tensor-network techniques. Further, the effect of noise, which limits efficiency of variational quantum algorithms in near-term quantum processors, can be naturally described within the kinetic theory. We investigate the steady state quasiparticle population as a function of noise strength, and establish maximum noise values for achieving high-fidelity ground states. This work establishes quasiparticle cooling algorithms as a practical, robust method for many-body state preparation on near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Abnormal solutions of Bethe--Salpeter equation with massless and massive exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize the main properties of the so called ''abnormal solutions'' of the Wick--Cutkosky model, i.e. two massive scalar particles interacting via massless scalar exchange ("photons"), within the Bethe--Salpeter equation. These solutions do not exist in the non-relativistic limit, in spite of having very small binding energies. They present a genuine many-body character dominated by photons, with a norm of the valence constituent wave function (two-body norm) that vanishes in the limit of zero binding energy.
  We present new results concerning the massive-exchange case, in particular determine under which conditions is it possible to obtain such peculiar solutions without spoiling the model by tachyonic states ($M^2&lt;0$).</description>

Abstract: We theoretically explore the possibility of realizing the symmetry-protected topological Haldane phase of spin-1 chains in a tunable hybrid platform of superconducting islands (SIs) and quantum dots (QDs). Inspired by recent findings suggesting that an appropriately tuned QD-SI-QD block may behave as a robust spin-1 unit, we study the behavior of many such units tunnel-coupled into linear chains. Our efficient and fully microscopic modeling of long chains with several tens of units is enabled by the use of the surrogate model solver [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023); arXiv:2402.18357]. Our numerical findings indicate that the QD-SI-QD chains exhibit emblematic features of the Haldane phase, such as fractional spin-1/2 edge states and non-vanishing string order parameters, and that these persist over a sizeable region of parameter space. Increasing the coupling between neighboring units gradually degrades their individual spin-1 character and leads to a trivial dimerized phase.</description>

      <title>Stoner ferromagnetism in a momentum-confined interacting 2D electron gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the ground state of a momentum-confined interacting 2D electron gas, a momentum-space analog of an infinite quantum well. The study is performed by combining analytical results with a numerical exact diagonalization procedure. We find a ferromagnetic ground state near a particular electron density and for a range of effective electron (or hole) masses. We argue that this observation may be relevant to the generalized Stoner ferromagnetism recently observed in multilayer graphene systems. The collective magnon excitations exhibit a linear dispersion, which originates from a diverging spin stiffness.</description>

      <title>An introduction to infinite projected entangled-pair state methods for variational ground state simulations using automatic differentiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor networks capture large classes of ground states of phases of quantum matter faithfully and efficiently. Their manipulation and contraction has remained a challenge over the years, however. For most of the history, ground state simulations of two-dimensional quantum lattice systems using (infinite) projected entangled pair states have relied on what is called a time-evolving block decimation. In recent years, multiple proposals for the variational optimization of the quantum state have been put forward, overcoming accuracy and convergence problems of previously known methods. The incorporation of automatic differentiation in tensor networks algorithms has ultimately enabled a new, flexible way for variational simulation of ground states and excited states. In this work we review the state-of-the-art of the variational iPEPS framework, providing a detailed introduction to automatic differentiation, a description of a general foundation into which various two-dimensional lattices can be conveniently incorporated, and demonstrative benchmarking results.</description>

      <title>Thermally induced localization of dopants in a magnetic spin ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I unveil a novel variant of Anderson localization. This emergent phenomenon pertains to the motion of a dopant in a thermal spin lattice, rendered localized by thermal fluctuations. This is in stark contrast to the intrinsic origin of localization for quenched disorder. The system of interest consists of spin-$1/2$ particles organized in a two-leg ladder with nearest neighbor Ising interactions $J$. The motion of a hole -- the dopant -- is initialized by suddenly removing a spin from the thermal spin ensemble, which then moves along the ladder via nearest neighbor hopping $t$. I find that the hole remains \emph{localized} for all values of $J/t$ and for \emph{all} nonzero temperatures. The origin is an effective disorder potential seen by the hole and induced by thermal spin fluctuations. Its length scale is found to match with the underlying spin-spin correlation length at low temperatures. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J&lt;0$), the associated localization length of the hole increases with decreasing temperature and becomes proportional to the correlation length at low temperatures, asymptotically delocalizing at low temperatures. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J&gt;0$), there is a smooth crossover between thermal localization at high temperatures to localization driven by the antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures. At infinite temperatures, the dynamics becomes independent of the sign of the spin coupling, whereby the localization length is a universal function of $|J|/t$, diverging as $(t/J)^{2}$ for $|J| \ll t$. Finally, I analyze a setup with Rydberg-dressed atoms, which naturally realizes finite range Ising interactions, accessible in current experimental setups. I show that the discovered localization phenomenon can be probed on experimentally accessible length- and timescales, providing a strong testing ground for my predictions.</description>

      <title>Spin-phonon interactions on the kagome lattice: Dirac spin liquid versus valence-bond solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the spin-phonon coupling on the S=1/2 Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice. For the pure spin model, there is increasing evidence that the low-energy properties can be correctly described by a Dirac spin liquid, in which spinons with a conical dispersion are coupled to emergent gauge fields. Within this scenario, the ground-state wave function is well approximated by a Gutzwiller-projected fermionic state [Y. Ran, M. Hermele, P.A. Lee, and X.-G. Wen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 117205 (2007)]. However, the existence of U(1) gauge fields may naturally lead to instabilities when small perturbations are included. Since phonons are ubiquitous in real materials, they may play a relevant role in the determination of the actual physical properties of the kagome antiferromagnet. We perform a step forward in this direction, including phonon degrees of freedom (at the quantum level) and applying a variational approach based upon Gutzwiller-projected fermionic Ans\"atze. Our results suggest that the Dirac spin liquid is stable for small spin-phonon couplings, while valence-bond solids are obtained at large couplings. Even though different distortions can be induced by the spin-phonon interaction, the general aspect is that the energy is lowered by maximizing the density of perfect hexagons in the dimerization pattern.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid fixed point of the dissipative Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a functional renormalization group approach we derive the renormalization group (RG) flow of a dissipative variant of the Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model describing $N$ fermions on a quantum dot which interact via a disorder-induced Yukawa coupling with $M$ bosons. The inverse Euclidean propagator of the bosons is assumed to exhibit a non-analytic term proportional to the modulus of the Matsubara frequency. We show that, to leading order in $1/N$ and $1/M$, the hierarchy of formally exact flow equations for the irreducible vertices of the disorder-averaged model can be closed at the level of the two-point vertices. We find that the RG flow exhibits a non-Fermi liquid fixed point characterized by a finite fermionic anomalous dimension $\eta$ which is related to the bosonic anomalous dimension $\gamma$ via the scaling law $2 = 2 \eta + \gamma$ with $ 0 &lt; \eta &lt; 1/2$. We explicitly calculate $\eta$ and the critical exponents characterizing the linearized RG flow in the vicinity of the fixed point as functions of $N/M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of adsorption of a single He-4 layer on graphene, focusing on the commensurate C1/3 crystalline phase, specifically on whether it may possess a nonzero superfluid response, and on the existence of superfluid phases, either (metastable) liquid or vacancy-doped crystalline. We make use of canonical Quantum Monte Carlo simulations at zero and finite temperature, based on a realistic microscopic model of the system. Our results confirm the absence of any superfluid response in the commensurate crystal, and that no thermodynamically stable uniform phase exists at lower coverage. No evidence of a possibly long-lived, metastable superfluid phase at C1/3 coverage is found. Altogether, the results of ground-state projection methods and finite-temperature simulations are entirely consistent.</description>

Abstract: We report structural and electronic properties of Na$_2$Ni$_3$S$_4$, a quasi-two-dimensional compound composed of alternating layers of [Ni$_3$S$_4$]$^{2-}$ and Na$^{+}$. The compound features a remarkable Ni-based kagome lattice with a square planar configuration of four surrounding S atoms for each Ni atom. Magnetization and electrical measurements reveal a weak paramagnetic insulator with a gap of about 0.5 eV. Our band structure calculation highlights a set of topological flat bands of the kagome lattice derived from the rotated d$_{xz}$-orbital with $C_\mathrm{3}$ + $T$ symmetry in the presence of crystal-field splitting.</description>

      <title>Remote detectability from entanglement bootstrap I: Kirby's torus trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote detectability is often taken as a physical assumption in the study of topologically ordered systems, and it is a central axiom of mathematical frameworks of topological quantum field theories. We show under the entanglement bootstrap approach that remote detectability is a necessary property; that is, we derive it as a theorem. Starting from a single wave function on a topologically-trivial region satisfying the entanglement bootstrap axioms, we can construct states on closed manifolds. The crucial technique is to immerse the punctured manifold into the topologically trivial region and then heal the puncture. This is analogous to Kirby's torus trick. We then analyze a special class of such manifolds, which we call pairing manifolds. For each pairing manifold, which pairs two classes of excitations, we identify an analog of the topological $S$-matrix. This pairing matrix is unitary, which implies remote detectability between two classes of excitations. These matrices are in general not associated with the mapping class group of the manifold. As a by-product, we can count excitation types (e.g., graph excitations in 3+1d). The pairing phenomenon occurs in many physical contexts, including systems in different dimensions, with or without gapped boundaries. We provide a variety of examples to illustrate its scope.</description>

      <title>Theory of superconductivity in thin films under an external electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The supercurrent field effect is experimentally realized in various nano-scale devices, based on the superconductivity suppression by external electric fields being effective for confined systems. In spite of intense research, a microscopic theory and explanation of this effect is missing. Here, a microscopic theory of phonon-mediated superconductivity in thin films is presented, which accounts for the effect of quantum confinement on the electronic density of states, on the Fermi energy, and on the topology of allowed states in momentum space. By further accounting for the interplay between quantum confinement, the external static electric field, the Thomas-Fermi screening in the electron-phonon matrix element, and the effect of confinement on the Coulomb repulsion parameter, the theory predicts the critical value of the external electric field as a function of the film thickness, above which superconductivity is suppressed. In particular, this critical value of the electric field is the lower the thinner the film, in agreement with recent experimental observations. Crucially, this effect is predicted by the theory when both Thomas-Fermi screening and the Coulomb pseudopotential are taken into account, along with the respective dependence on thin film thickness. This microscopic theory of the supercurrent field-effect opens up new possibilities for electric-field gated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK models with dynamical bosons and fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of SYK models with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry, described by $N$ fermions in chiral Fermi multiplets, as well as $\alpha N$ first-order bosons in chiral multiplets. The interactions are characterised by two integers $(p,q)$. We focus on the large $N$ and low energy limit of these models. Despite the presence of dynamical bosons, we find conformal behaviour akin to the standard SYK model. We use $\mathcal{I}$-extremization of a Witten index to study the supersymmetric solutions. In particular, we find an exact expression for the entropy, which matches the numerical solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations. We further solve the model both in the large $p$ and large $p,q$ limits. Numerically, we verify our analytical results and obtain estimates for the Schwarzian coupling in the near zero-temperature limit. We also study the low-lying spectrum of operators to determine the parameter ranges where the Schwarzian mode dominates the IR dynamics. Lastly, we study out-of-time-ordered correlators to show that the model is maximally chaotic.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Global Natural Orbital Functional Approximation on Model Systems with Strong Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, natural orbital functional (NOF) approximations have emerged as prominent tools for characterizing electron correlation. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches, which rely on natural orbitals and their associated occupation numbers, often require hybridization with other methods to fully account for all correlation effects. Recently, a global NOF (GNOF) has been proposed [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 233001 (2021)] to comprehensively address both dynamic and static correlations. This study evaluates the performance of GNOF on strongly correlated model systems, including comparisons with highly accurate Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) calculations for hydrogen atom clusters in one, two, and three dimensions. Additionally, the investigation extends to a BeH2 reaction, involving the insertion of a beryllium atom into a hydrogen molecule along a C2v pathway. According to the results obtained using GNOF, consistent behavior is observed across various correlation regions, encompassing a range of occupation and orbital schemes. Furthermore, distinctive features are identified when varying the dimensionality of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we give a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving electronic structure problems of molecules using only linear quantum optical systems. The variational ansatz we proposed is a hybrid of non-interacting Boson dynamics and classical computational chemistry methods, specifically, the Hartree-Fock method and the Configuration Interaction method. The Boson part is built by a linear optical interferometer which is easier to realize compared with the well-known Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatz composed of quantum gates in conventional VQE and the classical part is merely classical processing acting on the Hamiltonian. We called such ansatzes Boson Sampling-Classic (BS-C). The appearance of permanents in the Boson part has its physical intuition to provide different kinds of resources from commonly used single-, double-, and higher-excitations in classical methods and the UCC ansatz to exploring chemical quantum states. Such resources can help enhance the accuracy of methods used in the classical parts. We give a scalable hybrid homodyne and photon number measurement procedure for evaluating the energy value which has intrinsic abilities to mitigate photon loss errors and discuss the extra measurement cost induced by the no Pauli exclusion principle for Bosons with its solutions. To demonstrate our proposal, we run numerical experiments on several molecules and obtain their potential energy curves reaching chemical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Revealing the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sublattice symmetry on a bipartite lattice is commonly regarded as the chiral symmetry in the AIII class of the tenfold Altland-Zirnbauer classification. Here, we reveal the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry, and show that this assertion holds only if the periodicity of primitive unit cells agrees with that of the sublattice labeling. In cases where the periodicity does not agree, sublattice symmetry is represented as a glide reflection in energy-momentum space, which inverts energy and simultaneously translates some $k$ by $\pi$, leading to substantially different physics. Particularly, it introduces novel constraints on zero modes in semimetals and completely alters the classification table of topological insulators compared to class AIII. Notably, the dimensions corresponding to trivial and nontrivial classifications are switched, and the nontrivial classification becomes $\mathbb{Z}_2$ instead of $\mathbb{Z}$. We have applied these results to several models, including the Hofstadter model both with and without dimerization.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Nonsaturating Magnetoresistance Observed in HoMn$_6$Ge$_6$: A Kagome Dirac Semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the magnetic and magnetotransport properties and electronic band structure of the kagome Dirac semimetal HoMn$_6$Ge$_6$. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity demonstrates various magnetic-transition-driven anomalies. Notably, a crossover from negative to positive magnetoresistance (MR) is observed at around 150 K. While the linear nonsaturating positive MR in the low-temperature region is mainly driven by the linear Dirac-like band dispersions as predicted by the first-principles calculations, the negative MR observed in the high-temperature region is due to the spin-flop type magnetic transition. Consistent with anisotropic Fermi surface topology, we observe anisotropic magnetoresistance at low temperatures. A significant anomalous Hall effect has been noticed at high temperatures in addition to a switching of the dominant charge carrier from electron to hole at around 215 K.</description>
