      <title>Reimagining Peer Review Process Through Multi-Agent Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The software engineering research community faces a systemic crisis: peer review is failing under growing submissions, misaligned incentives, and reviewer fatigue. Community surveys reveal that researchers perceive the process as "broken." This position paper argues that these dysfunctions are mechanism design failures amenable to computational solutions. We propose modeling the research community as a stochastic multi-agent system and applying multi-agent reinforcement learning to design incentive-compatible protocols. We outline three interventions: a credit-based submission economy, MARL-optimized reviewer assignment, and hybrid verification of review consistency. We present threat models, equity considerations, and phased pilot metrics. This vision charts a research agenda toward sustainable peer review.</description>

      <title>Learning the Pareto Space of Multi-Objective Autonomous Driving: A Modular, Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Balancing safety, efficiency, and interaction is fundamental to designing autonomous driving agents and to understanding autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior in real-world operation. This study introduces an empirical learning framework that derives these trade-offs directly from naturalistic trajectory data. A unified objective space represents each AV timestep through composite scores of safety, efficiency, and interaction. Pareto dominance is applied to identify non-dominated states, forming an empirical frontier that defines the attainable region of balanced performance.
  The proposed framework was demonstrated using the Third Generation Simulation (TGSIM) datasets from Foggy Bottom and I-395. Results showed that only 0.23\% of AV driving instances were Pareto-optimal, underscoring the rarity of simultaneous optimization across objectives. Pareto-optimal states showed notably higher mean scores for safety, efficiency, and interaction compared to non-optimal cases, with interaction showing the greatest potential for improvement.
  This minimally invasive and modular framework, which requires only kinematic and positional data, can be directly applied beyond the scope of this study to derive and visualize multi-objective learning surfaces</description>

      <title>More at Stake: How Payoff and Language Shape LLM Agent Strategies in Cooperation Dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As LLMs increasingly act as autonomous agents in interactive and multi-agent settings, understanding their strategic behavior is critical for safety, coordination, and AI-driven social and economic systems. We investigate how payoff magnitude and linguistic context shape LLM strategies in repeated social dilemmas, using a payoff-scaled Prisoner's Dilemma to isolate sensitivity to incentive strength. Across models and languages, we observe consistent behavioral patterns, including incentive-sensitive conditional strategies and cross-linguistic divergence. To interpret these dynamics, we train supervised classifiers on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to LLM decisions, revealing systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioral intentions, with linguistic framing sometimes matching or exceeding architectural effects. Our results provide a unified framework for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and highlight cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance and multi-agent system design.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Orchestrators: Constraint-Compliant Multi-Agent Optimization for Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems must optimize multiple objectives while satisfying hard business constraints such as fairness and coverage. For example, an e-commerce platform may require every recommendation list to include items from multiple sellers and at least one newly listed product; violating such constraints--even once--is unacceptable in production. Prior work on multi-objective recommendation and recent LLM-based recommender agents largely treat constraints as soft penalties or focus on item scoring and interaction, leading to frequent violations in real-world deployments. How to leverage LLMs for coordinating constrained optimization in recommendation systems remains underexplored. We propose DualAgent-Rec, an LLM-coordinated dual-agent framework for constrained multi-objective e-commerce recommendation. The framework separates optimization into an Exploitation Agent that prioritizes accuracy under hard constraints and an Exploration Agent that promotes diversity through unconstrained Pareto search. An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs. These results indicate that LLMs can act as effective orchestration agents for deployable and constraint-compliant recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>TS-Debate: Multimodal Collaborative Debate for Zero-Shot Time Series Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and time series (TS) analysis has revealed both promise and fragility. While LLMs can reason over temporal structure given carefully engineered context, they often struggle with numeric fidelity, modality interference, and principled cross-modal integration. We present TS-Debate, a modality-specialized, collaborative multi-agent debate framework for zero-shot time series reasoning. TS-Debate assigns dedicated expert agents to textual context, visual patterns, and numerical signals, preceded by explicit domain knowledge elicitation, and coordinates their interaction via a structured debate protocol. Reviewer agents evaluate agent claims using a verification-conflict-calibration mechanism, supported by lightweight code execution and numerical lookup for programmatic verification. This architecture preserves modality fidelity, exposes conflicting evidence, and mitigates numeric hallucinations without task-specific fine-tuning. Across 20 tasks spanning three public benchmarks, TS-Debate achieves consistent and significant performance improvements over strong baselines, including standard multimodal debate in which all agents observe all inputs.</description>

      <title>The Role of Social Learning and Collective Norm Formation in Fostering Cooperation in LLM Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing body of multi-agent studies with LLMs explores how norms and cooperation emerge in mixed-motive scenarios, where pursuing individual gain can undermine the collective good. While prior work has explored these dynamics in both richly contextualized simulations and simplified game-theoretic environments, most LLM systems featuring common-pool resource (CPR) games provide agents with explicit reward functions directly tied to their actions. In contrast, human cooperation often emerges without explicit knowledge of the payoff structure or how individual actions translate into long-run outcomes, relying instead on heuristics, communication, and enforcement. We introduce a CPR simulation framework that removes explicit reward signals and embeds cultural-evolutionary mechanisms: social learning (adopting strategies and beliefs from successful peers) and norm-based punishment, grounded in Ostrom's principles of resource governance. Agents also individually learn from the consequences of harvesting, monitoring, and punishing via environmental feedback, enabling norms to emerge endogenously. We establish the validity of our simulation by reproducing key findings from existing studies on human behavior. Building on this, we examine norm evolution across a $2\times2$ grid of environmental and social initialisations (resource-rich vs. resource-scarce; altruistic vs. selfish) and benchmark how agentic societies comprised of different LLMs perform under these conditions. Our results reveal systematic model differences in sustaining cooperation and norm formation, positioning the framework as a rigorous testbed for studying emergent norms in mixed-motive LLM societies. Such analysis can inform the design of AI systems deployed in social and organizational contexts, where alignment with cooperative norms is critical for stability, fairness, and effective governance of AI-mediated environments.</description>
