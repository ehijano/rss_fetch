      <title>A model of thermophoresis of colloidal proteins in water using non-Fickian diffusion currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1928, Chapman generalised Einstein's theory of diffusion for non-uniform fluids to show the presence of a non-Fickian diffusion current, which he considered important in thermodiffusion (Ludwig-Soret effect). In 1941, Kiyosi It\^o proposed the formal methods of stochastic calculus in the presence of spatially dependent diffusion, yielding the same non-Fickian diffusion current as shown by Chapman. The phenomenon of thermodiffusion and thermophoresis happens in the presence of a temperature gradient, which makes diffusion space-dependent. The role of solvation forces in thermophoresis will only be clearer once that of diffusion is understood properly. In this paper, we investigate the importance of Chapman's non-Fickian diffusion current on the thermophoretic motion of colloidal particles in water (with weak salt concentration). We show that all the general features of variations of the Soret coefficient $S_T$ with temperature can be captured using Chapman's non-Fickian diffusion current. We compare our theoretical results with experimental plots of the Soret coefficients for three polypeptides in aqueous solution: Lysozyme, BLGA, and Poly-L-Lysine, and find a strong match. We emphasise that, in addition to the yet-to-be-understood details of solvation forces, Chapman's non-Fickian diffusion current is an indispensable element that needs to be taken into account for a complete understanding of thermophoresis and thermodiffusion.</description>

      <title>Instability of microbial droplets growing on viscous substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a model for a flat microbial droplet growing on the surface of a three-dimensional viscous fluid. The model describes growth-induced stresses at the fluid surface, density variations in the bulk due to nutrient consumption, and the resulting fluid flows that arise. We reformulate this free-boundary problem as a system of integro-differential equations defined solely on the microbial domain. From this formulation, we identify an axisymmetric solution corresponding to a radially expanding disk and analyze its morphological stability. We find that growth forces stabilize the axisymmetric solution while buoyancy forces destabilize it. We connect these findings to experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Mediated Contagion: A Quantum Electrodynamics-Inspired Framework for Non-Local Epidemic Dynamics and Superdiffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a gauge-mediated Epidemiological Model inspired by Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). In this model, the ``direct contact'' paradigm of classical SIR models is replaced by a gauge-mediated interaction where the environment, represented by a pathogen field $\varphi$, plays a fundamental role in the epidemic dynamics. In this model, the non-local characteristics of epidemics appear naturally by integrating out the pathogen field. Utilizing the Doi-Peliti formalism, we derive the effective action of the system and the standard Feynman rules that can be used to compute perturbatively any observables. Using standard QED techniques, we show how to relate renormalized pathogen mass, Debye screening, to epidemiological concepts and we compute at first order the effective reproductive number,$R_{eff}$, and how the condition to have an epidemic is related to a phase transition in the pathogen mass. We show that the superspreading hosts can be included easily in this formalism.</description>

      <title>Convergent-Beam X-ray Crystallography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular and polymeric crystals show a wide range of functional properties that arise from the interplay between the atomic-scale structure of their constituent molecules and the organization of these molecules within the crystal lattice at macroscopic length scales. X-ray diffraction can provide structural information at these disparate length scales, but usually only through experiments that address one or the other of molecular (or unit-cell) structure versus crystal structure. Consequently, the accuracy of determined molecular or polymer structures may be limited by unaccounted crystal inhomogeneities of the crystal lattice and the characterization of crystalline materials might not reveal the underlying causes of crystal morphology. Here we introduce X-ray convergent-beam diffraction to obtain spatially-resolved structural information from crystals by projection topographic imaging. Using highly focusing X-ray multilayer Laue lenses, we show that Bragg reflections can be mapped into tomographic images of the crystal, for the characterization of strain and defects at high resolution. We demonstrate how the crystal morphology obtained this way can be accounted for when determining structure factors as a function of position in the crystal. The approach may assist in studies such as diffusion and binding in MOFS, protein-drug binding, crystal growth, and the mechanical responses of photo-reactive or thermally driven dynamic crystals.</description>

      <title>Non-normal Dynamics on Non-reciprocal Networks: Reactivity and Effective Dimensionality in Neural Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are a defining feature of many complex systems, biological, ecological, and technological, often pushing them far from equilibrium and enabling rich dynamical responses. These asymmetries can arise at multiple levels: locally, in the dynamics of individual units, and globally, in the topology of their interactions. In this work, we investigate how these two forms of non-reciprocity interact in networks of neuronal populations. At the local level, each population is modeled by a non-reciprocally coupled set of excitatory and inhibitory neural populations exhibiting transient amplification and reactivity. At the network level, these populations are coupled via directed, asymmetric connections that introduce structural non-normality. Since non-reciprocal interactions generically lead to non-normal linear operators, we frame both local and global asymmetries in terms of non-normal dynamics. Using a modified Wilson-Cowan framework, we analyze how the interplay between these two types of non-normality shapes the system's behavior. We show that their combination leads to emergent collective dynamics, including fluctuation-driven transitions, dimensionality reduction, and novel nonequilibrium steady states. Our results provide a minimal yet flexible framework to understand how multi-scale non-reciprocities govern complex dynamics in neural and other interconnected systems.</description>

      <title>Delay-facilitated self-assembly in compartmentalized systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-assembly processes in biological and synthetic biomolecular systems are often governed by the spatial separation of biochemical processes. While previous work has focused on optimizing self-assembly through fine-tuned reaction parameters or using phase-separated liquid compartments with fast particle exchange, the role of slow inter-compartmental exchange remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that slow particle exchange between reaction domains can enhance self-assembly efficiency through a cooperative mechanism: delay-facilitated assembly. Using a minimal model of irreversible self-assembly in two compartments with distinct reaction and exchange dynamics, we identify scenarios that maximize yield and minimize assembly time, even under conditions where isolated compartments would fail to facilitate any self-assembly. The mechanism relies on a separation of timescales between intra-compartmental reactions and inter-compartmental exchange and is robust across a wide range of geometries, including spatially extended domains with diffusive transport. We demonstrate that this effect enables geometric control of self-assembly processes through compartment volumes and exchange rates, eliminating the need for fine-tuning local reaction rates. These results offer a conceptual framework for leveraging spatial separation in synthetic self-assembly design and suggest that biological systems may use slow particle exchange to improve assembly efficiency.

      <title>Dynamical Boundary Following and Corner Trapping of Undulating Worms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of {\it Lumbriculus variegatus} in circular and polygonal chambers and show that the worms align with the boundaries as they move forward and then become dynamically trapped at the concave corners over prolonged periods. We model the worm as a self-propelled rod and derive analytical expressions for the evolution of its orientation when it encounters the flat and the circular boundaries of the chamber. By further incorporating translational and rotational diffusion, arising due to the undulatory and peristaltic body strokes, we demonstrate through numerical simulations that the self-propelled rod model can capture both the boundary aligning and the corner trapping behavior of the worm. The P\'eclet number $Pe$, representing the ratio of forward propulsion to rotational diffusion, is found to characterize the boundary alignment dynamics and trapping time distribution of the worm. Simulations show that the angle of the worm's body with the boundary while entering a concave corner plays a key role in determining the trapping time, with shallow angles leading to faster escapes. Our study demonstrates that directed motion combined with limited angular diffusion can lead to spatial localization that mimics shelter seeking behavior in slender undulating limbless worms, even in the absence of thigmotaxis or contact seeking behavior.</description>

      <title>Activated solids: Spontaneous deformations, non-affine fluctuations, softening, and failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internal activity can fundamentally reshape the mechanical behavior of solids, yet its role in softening and failure remains incompletely understood. In this study, we investigate spontaneous deformations in activated solids via non-affine fluctuations that quantify local rearrangements relative to global strain. Using scaling analysis and numerical simulations, we show that non-affinity in crystalline solids grows quadratically with active speed, increases linearly with persistence time before saturating, and scales inversely with the distance to the melting density. Spatial correlations reveal an activity-dependent growing correlation length, while relaxation dynamics are governed by the active persistence time. With increasing activity, the distributions of local non-affinity broaden, become more skewed, and develop heavy tails, eventually forming a secondary maximum that signals coexisting small and large non-affinities; this heterogeneity precedes defect formation and two-step melting from solid to hexatic and ultimately to fluid. Finally, we demonstrate that spatially patterned activation provides a simple route to locally induce non-affinity and mechanical softening. Our predictions are experimentally testable and suggest a pathway to tunable mechanics in adaptive metamaterials, with implications for mechanical regulation in biological systems.</description>

Abstract: The framework of bipartite stochastic thermodynamics is a powerful tool to analyze a composite system's internal thermodynamics. It has been used to study the components of different molecular machines such as ATP synthase. However, this approach has not yet been used to describe ion-transporting proteins despite their high-level functional similarity. Here we study the bipartite thermodynamics of the sodium-potassium pump in the nonequilibrium steady state. Using a physically intuitive partition between the ATP-consuming subsystem and the ion-transporting subsystem, we find considerable information flow comparable to other molecular machines, and Maxwell-demon behavior in the ATP-consuming subsystem. We vary ion concentrations and transmembrane voltage in a range including the neuronal action potential, and find that the information flow inverts during depolarization.</description>

      <title>Coevolutionary balance of resting-state brain networks in autism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with atypical large-scale brain organization, yet the functional principles underlying these alterations remain incompletely understood. We examined whether coevolutionary balance, a network-level energy measure derived from signed interactions and nodal activity states, captures disruptions in resting-state functional connectivity in autistic adults. Using resting-state fMRI data from ABIDE I with ComBat harmonization to mitigate multi-site batch effects, we constructed whole-brain networks by combining binarized fALFF activity with signed functional correlations and quantified their coevolutionary energy. In the primary analysis with global signal regression (GSR), the ASD group showed significantly more negative global coevolutionary energy (pFDR &lt; 0.002), higher proportions of agreement links, and lower proportions of imbalanced-same links, indicating a systematic redistribution of local motifs rather than a uniform increase in balance. Because GSR can introduce artifactual negative correlations, we repeated all analyses without GSR. In this sensitivity analysis, whole-brain energy and motif differences were attenuated, but bipolarity, a measure of global two-block signed network organization, became the only FDR-significant metric (pFDR = 0.047), with ASD showing higher bipolarity. Intra-network energy differences did not survive FDR correction under either pipeline. Coevolutionary energy showed modest associations with ADI-R and ADOS scores, none of which survived correction across 720 tests. Machine learning classification achieved 77.8% test accuracy (AUC = 0.79) with GSR and 64.7% (AUC = 0.65) without GSR. These findings suggest that coevolutionary balance captures altered signed network organization in ASD, though the specific metric driving group differences depends on preprocessing choices regarding global signal regression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a quantitative model of ionization processes in biological tissues under Ultra High Dose Rate (UHDR) radiation. The underlying conjecture is that of electron-hole liquid (EHL) forming in water based substances of biological tissues. Unlike the earlier known EHL in semiconductor crystals, the charge carriers here are low mobile due to strong interactions with the background (solvated electrons, etc.); hence, EHL resembling ionic melts. Similar to all ionic systems, the Coulomb coupling makes that EHL energetically favorable that leads to recombination barriers suppressing subsequent structural transformations. In particular, generation of secondary reactive species in such EHL becomes limited translating into reduction of biological damages and tissue sparing effect. We show how these processes are sensitive to the tissue quality and frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity. Equations for dose and dose rate defining the sparing thresholds are derived.</description>

      <title>ECMSim: A high-performance interactive web application for real-time spatiotemporal simulation of cardiac ECM signaling and diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is central to a wide variety of healthy and diseased tissue processes. Unfortunately, predicting ECM remodeling under various chemical and mechanical conditions has proven to be excessively challenging, due in part to its complex regulation by intracellular and extracellular molecular reaction networks that are spatially and temporally dynamic. We introduce ECMSim, which is a highly interactive, real-time, and web application designed to simulate heterogeneous matrix remodeling. The current model simulates cardiac scar tissue with configurable input conditions using a large-scale model of the cardiac fibroblast signaling network. Cardiac fibrosis is a major component of many forms of heart failure. ECMSim solves 1.37 million coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and executes approximately 4.84 million operations per time step in real time, encompassing 137 molecular species and 259 regulatory interactions per cell across a 100x100 spatial array (10,000 cells), which accounts for inputs, receptors, intracellular signaling cascades, ECM production, feedback loops, and molecular diffusion. The algorithm is represented by a set of ODEs that are coupled with ECM molecular diffusion. The equations are solved on demand using compiled C++ and the WebAssembly standard. The software enables the investigation of pathological or experimental conditions, hypothetical scenarios, matrix remodeling, or the testing of the effects of an experimental drug(s) with a target receptor.</description>
