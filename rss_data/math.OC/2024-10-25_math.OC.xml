      <title>Real-Time Integrated Learning and Decision-Making for Asset Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Problem definition: Unexpected component failures in industrial assets can lead to significant financial losses and operational disruptions, making preventive maintenance crucial for reducing unplanned downtime. This study focuses on optimizing maintenance for economically coupled assets that degrade according to a compound Poisson process, failing when degradation exceeds a specified threshold. Degradation parameters vary across components and cannot be directly observed, necessitating inference from real-time sensor data, with maintenance limited to scheduled interventions. Academic/practical relevance: We characterize optimal replacement policies that have access to the degradation process parameters, which inform suitable initial policies for our deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. The effectiveness of the trained policies is demonstrated through a case study on interventional X-ray systems. Methodology: The maintenance optimization problem is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). To manage the inherent computational complexity, we reformulate it as a Bayesian Markov decision process (BMDP) using conjugate pairs. This allows us to extend the DRL algorithm to BMDPs. Additionally, we propose an open-loop feedback approach to adapt the DRL algorithm to the POMDP setting when a BMDP reformulation is infeasible. Results: Numerical results indicate that our DRL algorithm effectively reduces maintenance costs and unplanned downtime by leveraging real-time data and shared setup costs to learn state-of-the-art complex opportunistic maintenance policies. Managerial implications: Our approach demonstrates how integrating real-time learning and decision-making can significantly lower costs in industrial asset networks, providing a practical solution for improving operational efficiency amidst asset heterogeneity and economic dependence.</description>

      <title>AC-Network-Informed DC Optimal Power Flow for Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a parametric quadratic approximation of the AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem for time-sensitive and market-based applications. The parametric approximation preserves the physics-based but simple representation provided by the DC-OPF model and leverages market and physics information encoded in the data-driven demand-dependent parameters. To enable the deployment of the proposed model for real-time applications, we propose a supervised learning approach to predict near-optimal parameters, given a certain metric concerning the dispatch quantities and locational marginal prices (LMPs). The training dataset is generated based on the solution of the accurate AC-OPF problem and a bilevel optimization problem, which calibrates parameters satisfying two market properties: cost recovery and revenue adequacy. We show the proposed approach's performance in various test systems in terms of cost and dispatch approximation errors, LMPs, market properties satisfaction, dispatch feasibility, and generalizability with respect to N-1 network topologies.</description>

      <title>Observer-Based Event-Triggered Secure Consensus Control for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the intricate challenges encountered by multi-agent systems (MASs) operating within environments that are subject to deception attacks and Markovian randomly switching topologies, particularly in the context of event-triggered secure consensus control. To address these complexities, a novel observer-based distributed event-triggered control scheme is introduced. This approach uses local information to dynamically adjust its triggered conditions, thereby enhancing the utilization of network resources. Additionally, the design of the observer based secure consensus controller is distributed, leveraging the local information of each individual agent. Furthermore, our event-triggered mechanism theoretically precludes the occurrence of Zeno behavior in the triggering time series. Finally, simulation results underscore the superiority of our proposed method when compared to existing techniques, thereby validating its effectiveness and applicability in the event-triggered secure consensus control of MASs.</description>

      <title>Data-driven topology design for conductor layout problem of electromagnetic interference filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic interference (EMI) filters are used to reduce electromagnetic noise. It is well known that the performance of an EMI filter in reducing electromagnetic noise largely depends on its conductor layout. Therefore, if a conductor layout optimization method with a high degree of freedom is realized, a drastic performance improvement is expected. Although there are a few design methods based on topology optimization for this purpose, these methods have some difficulties originating from topology optimization. In this paper, we therefore propose a conductor layout design method for EMI filters on the basis of data-driven topology design (DDTD), which is a high degree of freedom structural design methodology incorporating a deep generative model and data-driven approach. DDTD was proposed to overcome the intrinsic difficulties of topology optimization, and we consider it suitable for the conductor layout design problem of EMI filters. One significant challenge in applying DDTD to the conductor layout design problem is maintaining the topology of the circuit diagram during the solution search. For this purpose, we propose a simple yet efficient constraint. We further provide numerical examples to confirm the usefulness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Generalized conditional gradient methods for multiobjective composite optimization problems with H{\"o}lder condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with multiobjective composite optimization problems, where each objective function is a combination of smooth and possibly non-smooth functions. We first propose a parameter-dependent conditional gradient method to solve this problem. The step size in this method requires prior knowledge of the parameters related to the H{\"o}lder continuity of the gradient of the smooth function. The convergence properties of this method are then established. Given that these parameters may be unknown or, if known, may not be unique, the first method may encounter implementation challenges or slow convergence. To address this, we further propose a parameter-free conditional gradient method that determines the step size using a local quadratic upper approximation and an adaptive line search strategy, eliminating the need for any problem-specific parameters. The performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated on several test problems involving the indicator function and an uncertainty function.</description>

      <title>Optimal Primal-Dual Algorithm with Last iterate Convergence Guarantees for Stochastic Convex Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel first-order algorithm that solves composite nonsmooth and stochastic convex optimization problem with function constraints. Most of the works in the literature provide convergence rate guarantees on the average-iterate solution. There is growing interest in the convergence guarantees of the last iterate solution due to its favorable structural properties, such as sparsity or privacy guarantees and good performance in practice. We provide the first method that obtains the best-known convergence rate guarantees on the last iterate for stochastic composite nonsmooth convex function-constrained optimization problems. Our novel and easy-to-implement algorithm is based on the augmented Lagrangian technique and uses a new linearized approximation of constraint functions, leading to its name, the Augmented Constraint Extrapolation (Aug-ConEx) method. We show that Aug-ConEx achieves $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ convergence rate in the nonsmooth stochastic setting without any strong convexity assumption and $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ for the same problem with strongly convex objective function. While optimal for nonsmooth and stochastic problems, the Aug-ConEx method also accelerates convergence in terms of Lipschitz smoothness constants to $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/K^2)$ in the aforementioned cases, respectively. To our best knowledge, this is the first method to obtain such differentiated convergence rate guarantees on the last iterate for a composite nonsmooth stochastic setting without additional $\log{K}$ factors. We validate the efficiency of our algorithm by comparing it with a state-of-the-art algorithm through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimal policies for stock redistribution in a retail network: Mathematical modeling and algorithmic solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of stock replenishment and transshipment in the retail industry. We develop a model that can accommodate different policies, including centralized redistribution (replenishment) and decentralized redistribution (lateral transshipments), allowing for direct comparisons between them. We present a numeric analysis in which the benchmark instances stem from the collaboration with a high-end clothing retail company. The underlying model, as usually in the field, is a large-scale mixed-integer linear programming problem. We develop a specific algorithmic procedure to solve this MILP problem and compare its performance with the direct solution via state-of-the-art solvers.</description>

      <title>Fully Stochastic Primal-dual Gradient Algorithm for Non-convex Optimization on Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic decentralized optimization algorithms often suffer from issues such as synchronization overhead and intermittent communication. This paper proposes a $\underline{\rm F}$ully $\underline{\rm S}$tochastic $\underline{\rm P}$rimal $\underline{\rm D}$ual gradient $\underline{\rm A}$lgorithm (FSPDA) that suggests an asynchronous decentralized procedure with (i) sparsified non-blocking communication on random undirected graphs and (ii) local stochastic gradient updates. FSPDA allows multiple local gradient steps to accelerate convergence to stationarity while finding a consensual solution with stochastic primal-dual updates. For problems with smooth (possibly non-convex) objective function, we show that FSPDA converges to an $\mathrm{\mathcal{O}( {\it \sigma /\sqrt{nT}} )}$-stationary solution after $\mathrm{\it T}$ iterations without assuming data heterogeneity. The performance of FSPDA is on par with state-of-the-art algorithms whose convergence depend on static graph and synchronous updates. To our best knowledge, FSPDA is the first asynchronous algorithm that converges exactly under the non-convex setting. Numerical experiments are presented to show the benefits of FSPDA.</description>

      <title>No-gap second-order optimality conditions for additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing by laser fusion on a metal oxides powder bed has developed considerably in the last few years and allows to produce a wide range of complex parts. The mathematical models correspond to initial boundary value problems for the heat equation with moving heat sources according to the laser trajectories. The main questions concern the optimization of the trajectories scanned by the laser and of the thermal treatment time in order to melt the powder where it is desired to make the part and to minimize the thermal gradients. Our purpose in this current paper is to pursue the study of the optimization model that we have introduced in a previous paper. Here, we consider second-order optimality conditions for non-necessarily convex constraints on the laser paths. In particular, we obtain no gap between the second-order sufficient optimality condition and the necessary second-order optimality condition. To achieve this goal, we reformulate our optimal control problem in order to fit it in the framework of the abstract theory of optimization under constraints in Banach spaces. Higher regularity of the trajectories for local minimizers is also proved implying higher regularity of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers. The case of the regularity of the trajectories for stationary points is left open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of solutions of reversible and irreversible port-Hamiltonian systems. To this end, we utilize the associated exergy, a function that is composed of the system's Hamiltonian and entropy, to prove global existence in time for bounded control functions. The results are then leveraged to prove existence of solutions of energy- and entropy-optimal control problems. Last, we explore model predictive control tailored to irreversible port-Hamiltonian systems by means of a numerical case study with a heat exchanger network.</description>

      <title>Detection of Undeclared EV Charging Events in a Green Energy Certification Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The green potential of electric vehicles (EVs) can be fully realized only if their batteries are charged using energy generated from renewable (i.e. green) sources. For logistic or economic reasons, however, EV drivers may be tempted to avoid charging stations certified as providing green energy, instead opting for conventional ones, where only a fraction of the available energy is green. This behaviour may slow down the achievement of decarbonisation targets of the road transport sector. In this paper, we use GPS data to infer whether an undeclared charging event has occurred. Specifically, we construct a Bayesian hypothesis test for the charging behaviour of the EV. Extensive simulations are carried out for an area of London, using the mobility simulator, SUMO, and exploring various operating conditions. Excellent detection rates for undeclared charging events are reported. We explain how the algorithm can serve as the basis for an incentivization scheme, encouraging compliance by drivers with green charging policies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo: A Hybrid Approach to Data Assimilation in 4DVAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (QMCMC) with variational particle filters to tackle the computational challenges in Four-Dimensional Variational Data Assimilation (4DVAR). 4DVAR, widely used in numerical weather prediction, suffers from inefficiencies in high-dimensional, non-linear systems. Our approach, the Quantum Variational Particle Filter (QVPF), uses QAOA to optimize particle proposals and QMCMC to efficiently compute particle weights and resample, accelerating convergence while reducing the computational load.
  The QVPF framework addresses the curse of dimensionality by minimizing the number of particles required for accurate state estimation, thus improving efficiency in systems with complex dynamics. The hybrid model offers enhanced accuracy by integrating quantum algorithms into the variational particle filter, making it particularly suited for applications in climate modeling, space weather prediction, and defense. The potential for achieving unprecedented resolution in predictive models could transform sectors that rely on high-resolution forecasting.
  We present the mathematical foundations of the approach, along with discussions on algorithmic implementation and hardware requirements. Early results suggest that this hybrid framework could significantly improve data assimilation, with future implementations on near-term quantum devices offering a practical pathway for scaling up. This work demonstrates how quantum computing can address the growing need for more accurate and computationally feasible methods in large-scale data assimilation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Adaptive Federated Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive optimization plays a pivotal role in federated learning, where simultaneous server and client-side adaptivity have been shown to be essential for maximizing its performance. However, the scalability of jointly adaptive systems is often constrained by limited resources in communication and memory. In this paper, we introduce a class of efficient adaptive algorithms, named $FedAda^2$, designed specifically for large-scale, cross-device federated environments. $FedAda^2$ optimizes communication efficiency by avoiding the transfer of preconditioners between the server and clients. At the same time, it leverages memory-efficient adaptive optimizers on the client-side to reduce on-device memory consumption. Theoretically, we demonstrate that $FedAda^2$ achieves the same convergence rates for general, non-convex objectives as its more resource-intensive counterparts that directly integrate joint adaptivity. Empirically, we showcase the benefits of joint adaptivity and the effectiveness of $FedAda^2$ on both image and text datasets.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</description>

      <title>Sub-twistor metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a natural distance function on the period space of a hyperk\"ahler manifold associated to non-holonomic constraints imposed by twistor lines. These metrics were introduced by Verbitsky in the context of the global Torelli theorem for hyperk\"aler manifolds. We show that they are Finsler and explicitly describe their Finsler norms. To achieve this goal we consider a class of distance functions (called here sub-conic metrics) that slightly generalize sub-Riemann metrics. The main technical result is the statement that every sub-conic metric is sub-Finsler. The content and methods of the paper lie within basic metric geometry. The complex geometrical background and motivation are isolated in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Faster Algorithms for User-Level Private Stochastic Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study private stochastic convex optimization (SCO) under user-level differential privacy (DP) constraints. In this setting, there are $n$ users (e.g., cell phones), each possessing $m$ data items (e.g., text messages), and we need to protect the privacy of each user's entire collection of data items. Existing algorithms for user-level DP SCO are impractical in many large-scale machine learning scenarios because: (i) they make restrictive assumptions on the smoothness parameter of the loss function and require the number of users to grow polynomially with the dimension of the parameter space; or (ii) they are prohibitively slow, requiring at least $(mn)^{3/2}$ gradient computations for smooth losses and $(mn)^3$ computations for non-smooth losses. To address these limitations, we provide novel user-level DP algorithms with state-of-the-art excess risk and runtime guarantees, without stringent assumptions. First, we develop a linear-time algorithm with state-of-the-art excess risk (for a non-trivial linear-time algorithm) under a mild smoothness assumption. Our second algorithm applies to arbitrary smooth losses and achieves optimal excess risk in $\approx (mn)^{9/8}$ gradient computations. Third, for non-smooth loss functions, we obtain optimal excess risk in $n^{11/8} m^{5/4}$ gradient computations. Moreover, our algorithms do not require the number of users to grow polynomially with the dimension.</description>

      <title>GPU Accelerated 3D P-wave Source Free Adaptive Wavefield Reconstruction Inversion with an application to experimental VSP physical modeling data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wavefield reconstruction inversion (WRI) has been considered a potential solution to the issue of local minima inherent in conventional full waveform inversion (FWI) methods. However, most current WRI research has been confined to 2D problems due to the computational challenges posed by solving augmented systems for optimal data-fitting wavefields. This constraint limits WRI applicability to realistic 3D scenarios. This study introduces a GPU-accelerated 3D source-free adaptive WRI (GPU-SF-AWRI) method that overcomes these computational barriers by adaptively controlling the computational accuracy of wavefield simulation and optimizing GPU utilization, thus enhancing its suitability for 3D applications. The inclusion of an on-the-fly source estimation technique further boosts its performance on realistic problems. Numerical experiments reveal that the proposed GPU-accelerated method achieves a 195-fold speedup compared to CPU-based approaches. By incorporating adaptive accuracy and total variation regularization, we attain a 2-fold speedup while maintaining inversion accuracy. We applied the GPU-SF-AWRI method to numerical and actual Vertical Seismic Profiling (VSP) physical modeling P-wave data, confirming its efficacy in addressing real data challenges and mitigating local minima associated with conventional FWI.</description>

      <title>Bearing-Only Solution for Fermat-Weber Location Problem: Generalized Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents novel algorithms for the Fermat-Weber Location Problem, guiding an autonomous agent to the point that minimizes the weighted sum of Euclidean distances to some beacons using only bearing measurements. The existing results address only the simple scenario where the beacons are stationary and the agent is modeled by a single integrator. In this paper, we propose a number of bearing-only algorithms that let the agent, which can be modeled as either a single-integrator or a double-integrator, follow the Fermat-Weber point of a group of stationary or moving beacons. The theoretical results are rigorously proven using Lyapunov theory and supported with simulation examples.</description>

      <title>Constraint-adaptive MPC for large-scale systems: Satisfying state constraints without imposing them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a successful control methodology, which is applied to increasingly complex systems. However, real-time feasibility of MPC can be challenging for complex systems, certainly when an (extremely) large number of constraints have to be adhered to. For such scenarios with a large number of state constraints, this paper proposes two novel MPC schemes for general nonlinear systems, which we call constraint-adaptive MPC. These novel schemes dynamically select at each time step a (varying) set of constraints that are included in the on-line optimization problem. Carefully selecting the included constraints can significantly reduce, as we will demonstrate, the computational complexity with often only a slight impact on the closed-loop performance. Although not all (state) constraints are imposed in the on-line optimization, the schemes still guarantee recursive feasibility and constraint satisfaction. A numerical case study illustrates the proposed MPC schemes and demonstrates the achieved computation time improvements exceeding two orders of magnitude without loss of performance.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit of diffusive games through the master equation: extreme value analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an $N$-player game where the players control the drifts of their diffusive states which have no interaction in the noise terms. The aim of each player is to minimize the expected value of her cost, which is a function of the player's state and the empirical measure of the states of all the players. Our aim is to determine the $N \to \infty$ asymptotic behavior of the upper order statistics of the player's states under Nash equilibrium (the Nash states). For this purpose, we consider also a system of interacting diffusions which is constructed by using the Master PDE of the game and approximates the system of the Nash states, and we improve an $L^2$ estimate for the distance between the drifts of the two systems which has been used for establishing Central Limit Theorems and Large Deviations Principles for the Nash states in the past. By differentiating the Master PDE, we obtain that estimate also in $L^{\infty}$, which allows us to control the Radon-Nikodym derivative of a Girsanov transformation that connects the two systems. The latter allows us to reduce the problem to the case of $N$ uncontrolled diffusions with standard mean-field interaction in the drifts, which has been treated in a previous work.</description>

Abstract: We characterize when a size-2 positive semidefinite (psd) factorization of a positive matrix of rank 3 and psd rank 2 is unique. The characterization is obtained using tools from rigidity theory. In the first step, we define s-infinitesimally rigid psd factorizations and characterize 1- and 2-infinitesimally rigid size-2 psd factorizations. In the second step, we connect 1- and 2-infinitesimal rigidity of size-2 psd factorizations to uniqueness via global rigidity. We also prove necessary conditions on a positive matrix of rank 3 and psd rank 2 to be on the topological boundary of all nonnegative matrices with the same rank conditions.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Indicators for Multiobjective Diversity Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indicator-based (multiobjective) diversity optimization aims at finding a set of near (Pareto-)optimal solutions that maximizes a diversity indicator, where diversity is typically interpreted as the number of essentially different solutions. Whereas, in the first diversity-oriented evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm, the NOAH algorithm by Ulrich and Thiele, the Solow Polasky Diversity (also related to Magnitude) served as a metric, other diversity indicators might be considered, such as the parameter-free Max-Min Diversity, and the Riesz s-Energy, which features uniformly distributed solution sets. In this paper, focusing on multiobjective diversity optimization, we discuss different diversity indicators from the perspective of indicator-based evolutionary algorithms (IBEA) with multiple objectives. We examine theoretical, computational, and practical properties of these indicators, such as monotonicity in species, twinning, monotonicity in distance, strict monotonicity in distance, uniformity of maximizing point sets, computational effort for a set of size~n, single-point contributions, subset selection, and submodularity. We present new theorems -- including a proof of the NP-hardness of the Riesz s-Energy Subset Selection Problem -- and consolidate existing results from the literature. In the second part, we apply these indicators in the NOAH algorithm and analyze search dynamics through an example. We examine how optimizing with one indicator affects the performance of others and propose NOAH adaptations specific to the Max-Min indicator.</description>

      <title>On the Crucial Role of Initialization for Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work revisits the classical low-rank matrix factorization problem and unveils the critical role of initialization in shaping convergence rates for such nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization. We introduce Nystrom initialization, which significantly improves the global convergence of Scaled Gradient Descent (ScaledGD) in both symmetric and asymmetric matrix factorization tasks. Specifically, we prove that ScaledGD with Nystrom initialization achieves quadratic convergence in cases where only linear rates were previously known. Furthermore, we extend this initialization to low-rank adapters (LoRA) commonly used for finetuning foundation models. Our approach, NoRA, i.e., LoRA with Nystrom initialization, demonstrates superior performance across various downstream tasks and model scales, from 1B to 7B parameters, in large language and diffusion models.</description>

Abstract: We adapt the problem of continuous congested optimal transport to the Heisenberg group, equipped with a sub-Riemannian metric. Originally introduced in the Euclidean setting by Carlier, Jimenez, and Santambrogio as a path-dependent variant of the Monge-Kantorovich problem, we significantly restrict the set of admissible curves to horizontal ones. We establish the existence of equilibrium configurations as solutions to a convex minimization problem over a suitable set of measures on horizontal curves. This result is achieved through the notions of horizontal transport density and horizontal traffic intensity.</description>

      <title>Semiconcavity for the minimum time problem in presence of time delay effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with a minimum time problem in presence of a time delay $\tau.$ The value function of the considered optimal control problem is no longer defined in a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, as it happens in the undelayed case, but its domain is a subset of the Banach space $C([-\tau,0];\mathbb{R}^{n})$. For the undelayed minimum time problem, it is known that the value function associated with it is semiconcave in a subset of the reachable set and is a viscosity solution of a suitable Hamilton-Jacobi-Belmann equation. The Hamilton-Jacobi theory for optimal control problems involving time delays has been developed by several authors. Here, we are rather interested in investigating the regularity properties of the minimum time functional. Extending classical arguments, we are able to prove that the minimum time functional is semiconcave in a suitable subset of the reachable set.</description>

      <title>Neural incomplete factorization: learning preconditioners for the conjugate gradient method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The convergence of the conjugate gradient method for solving large-scale and sparse linear equation systems depends on the spectral properties of the system matrix, which can be improved by preconditioning. In this paper, we develop a computationally efficient data-driven approach to accelerate the generation of effective preconditioners. We, therefore, replace the typically hand-engineered preconditioners by the output of graph neural networks. Our method generates an incomplete factorization of the matrix and is, therefore, referred to as neural incomplete factorization (NeuralIF). Optimizing the condition number of the linear system directly is computationally infeasible. Instead, we utilize a stochastic approximation of the Frobenius loss which only requires matrix-vector multiplications for efficient training. At the core of our method is a novel message-passing block, inspired by sparse matrix theory, that aligns with the objective of finding a sparse factorization of the matrix. We evaluate our proposed method on both synthetic problem instances and on problems arising from the discretization of the Poisson equation on varying domains. Our experiments show that by using data-driven preconditioners within the conjugate gradient method we are able to speed up the convergence of the iterative procedure. The code is available at https://github.com/paulhausner/neural-incomplete-factorization.</description>

      <title>Computing Wasserstein Barycenter via operator splitting: the method of averaged marginals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter (WB) is an important tool for summarizing sets of probability measures. It finds applications in applied probability, clustering, image processing, etc. When the measures' supports are finite, computing a (balanced) WB can be done by solving a linear optimization problem whose dimensions generally exceed standard solvers' capabilities. In the more general setting where measures have different total masses, we propose a convex nonsmooth optimization formulation for the so-called unbalanced WB problem. Due to their colossal dimensions, we introduce a decomposition scheme based on the Douglas-Rachford splitting method that can be applied to both balanced and unbalanced WB problem variants.Our algorithm, which has the interesting interpretation of being built upon averaging marginals, operates a series of simple (and exact) projections that can be parallelized and even randomized, making it suitable for large-scale datasets. Numerical comparisons against state-of-the-art methods on several data sets from the literature illustrate the method's performance.</description>

      <title>A Novel Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Formulation for Continuous-Time Inventory Routing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inventory management, vehicle routing, and delivery scheduling decisions are simultaneously considered in the context of the inventory routing problem. This paper focuses on the continuous-time version of this problem where, unlike its more traditional discrete-time counterpart, the distributor is required to guarantee that inventory levels are maintained within the desired intervals at any moment of the planning horizon. In this work, we develop a compact mixed-integer linear programming formulation to model the continuous-time inventory routing problem. We further discuss means to expedite its solution process, including the adaptation of well-known rounded capacity inequalities to tighten the formulation in the context of a branch-and-cut algorithm. Through extensive computational studies on a suite of 90 benchmark instances from the literature, we show that our branch-and-cut algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approach. We also consider a new set of 63 instances adapted from a real-life dataset and show our algorithm's practical value in solving instances with up to 20 customers to guaranteed optimality.</description>

      <title>Computation of Generalized Derivatives for Abs-Smooth Functions by Backward Mode Algorithmic Differentiation and Implications to Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithmic differentiation (AD) tools allow to obtain gradient information of a continuously differentiable objective function in a computationally cheap way using the so-called backward mode. It is common practice to use the same tools even in the absence of differentiability, although the resulting vectors may not be generalized gradients in the sense of Clarke. The paper at hand focuses on objectives in which the non-differentiability arises solely from the evaluation of the absolute value function. In that case, an algebraic condition based on the evaluation procedure of the objective is identified, that guarantees that Clarke gradients are correctly computed without requiring any modifications of the AD tool in question. The analysis allows to prove that any standard AD tool is adequate to drive a stochastic generalized gradient descent method for training a dense neural network with ReLU activations. The same is true for generalized batch gradients or the full generalized gradient, provided that the AD tool makes a deterministic and agnostic choice for the derivative information of the absolute value at 0.</description>

      <title>Optimizing over Multiple Distributions under Generalized Quasar-Convexity Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a typical optimization model where the optimization variable is composed of multiple probability distributions. Though the model appears frequently in practice, such as for policy problems, it lacks specific analysis in the general setting. For this optimization problem, we propose a new structural condition/landscape description named generalized quasar-convexity (GQC) beyond the realms of convexity. In contrast to original quasar-convexity \citep{hinder2020near}, GQC allows an individual quasar-convex parameter $\gamma_i$ for each variable block $i$ and the smaller of $\gamma_i$ implies less block-convexity. To minimize the objective function, we consider a generalized oracle termed as the internal function that includes the standard gradient oracle as a special case. We provide optimistic mirror descent (OMD) for multiple distributions and prove that the algorithm can achieve an adaptive $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((\sum_{i=1}^d1/\gamma_i)\epsilon^{-1})$ iteration complexity to find an $epsilon$-suboptimal global solution without pre-known the exact values of $\gamma_i$ when the objective admits "polynomial-like" structural. Notably, it achieves iteration complexity that does not explicitly depend on the number of distributions and strictly faster $(\sum_{i=1}^d 1/\gamma_i \text{ v.s. } d\max_{i\in[1:d]} 1/\gamma_i)$ than mirror decent methods. We also extend GQC to the minimax optimization problem proposing the generalized quasar-convexity-concavity (GQCC) condition and a decentralized variant of OMD with regularization. Finally, we show the applications of our algorithmic framework on discounted Markov Decision Processes problem and Markov games, which bring new insights on the landscape analysis of reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Neural-Rendezvous: Provably Robust Guidance and Control to Encounter Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) are likely representatives of primitive materials invaluable in understanding exoplanetary star systems. Due to their poorly constrained orbits with generally high inclinations and relative velocities, however, exploring ISOs with conventional human-in-the-loop approaches is significantly challenging. This paper presents Neural-Rendezvous -- a deep learning-based guidance and control framework for encountering fast-moving objects, including ISOs, robustly, accurately, and autonomously in real time. It uses pointwise minimum norm tracking control on top of a guidance policy modeled by a spectrally-normalized deep neural network, where its hyperparameters are tuned with a loss function directly penalizing the MPC state trajectory tracking error. We show that Neural-Rendezvous provides a high probability exponential bound on the expected spacecraft delivery error, the proof of which leverages stochastic incremental stability analysis. In particular, it is used to construct a non-negative function with a supermartingale property, explicitly accounting for the ISO state uncertainty and the local nature of nonlinear state estimation guarantees. In numerical simulations, Neural-Rendezvous is demonstrated to satisfy the expected error bound for 100 ISO candidates. This performance is also empirically validated using our spacecraft simulator and in high-conflict and distributed UAV swarm reconfiguration with up to 20 UAVs.</description>

      <title>A genetic algorithm to search the space of Ehrhart $h^*$-vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a genetic algorithm to find candidates for $h^*$-vectors satisfying given properties in the space of integers vectors of finite length. We use an implementation of such algorithm to find a 52-dimensional lattice polytope having a non-unimodal $h^*$-vector which is the Cartesian product of two lattice polytopes having unimodal $h^*$-vectors. This counterexample answers negatively to a question by Ferroni and Higashitani.</description>

      <title>Pointer Networks with Q-Learning for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02629v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Pointer Q-Network (PQN), a hybrid neural architecture that integrates model-free Q-value policy approximation with Pointer Networks (Ptr-Nets) to enhance the optimality of attention-based sequence generation, focusing on long-term outcomes. This integration proves particularly effective in solving combinatorial optimization (CO) tasks, especially the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is the focus of our study. We address this challenge by defining a Markov Decision Process (MDP) compatible with PQN, which involves iterative graph embedding, encoding and decoding by an LSTM-based recurrent neural network. This process generates a context vector and computes raw attention scores, which are dynamically adjusted by Q-values calculated for all available state-action pairs before applying softmax. The resulting attention vector is utilized as an action distribution, with actions selected hinged to exploration-exploitation dynamic adaptibility of PQN. Our empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, also testing the model in unstable environments.</description>

      <title>A Mean-Field Analysis of Neural Stochastic Gradient Descent-Ascent for Functional Minimax Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies minimax optimization problems defined over infinite-dimensional function classes of overparameterized two-layer neural networks. In particular, we consider the minimax optimization problem stemming from estimating linear functional equations defined by conditional expectations, where the objective functions are quadratic in the functional spaces. We address (i) the convergence of the stochastic gradient descent-ascent algorithm and (ii) the representation learning of the neural networks. We establish convergence under the mean-field regime by considering the continuous-time and infinite-width limit of the optimization dynamics. Under this regime, the stochastic gradient descent-ascent corresponds to a Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of probability measures defined over the space of neural network parameters. We prove that the Wasserstein gradient flow converges globally to a stationary point of the minimax objective at a $O(T^{-1} + \alpha^{-1})$ sublinear rate, and additionally finds the solution to the functional equation when the regularizer of the minimax objective is strongly convex. Here $T$ denotes the time and $\alpha$ is a scaling parameter of the neural networks. In terms of representation learning, our results show that the feature representation induced by the neural networks is allowed to deviate from the initial one by the magnitude of $O(\alpha^{-1})$, measured in terms of the Wasserstein distance. Finally, we apply our general results to concrete examples including policy evaluation, nonparametric instrumental variable regression, asset pricing, and adversarial Riesz representer estimation.</description>

      <title>Strongly-polynomial time and validation analysis of policy gradient methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel termination criterion, termed the advantage gap function, for finite state and action Markov decision processes (MDP) and reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating this advantage gap function into the design of step size rules and deriving a new linear rate of convergence that is independent of the stationary state distribution of the optimal policy, we demonstrate that policy gradient methods can solve MDPs in strongly-polynomial time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such strong convergence properties have been established for policy gradient methods. Moreover, in the stochastic setting, where only stochastic estimates of policy gradients are available, we show that the advantage gap function provides close approximations of the optimality gap for each individual state and exhibits a sublinear rate of convergence at every state. The advantage gap function can be easily estimated in the stochastic case, and when coupled with easily computable upper bounds on policy values, they provide a convenient way to validate the solutions generated by policy gradient methods. Therefore, our developments offer a principled and computable measure of optimality for RL, whereas current practice tends to rely on algorithm-to-algorithm or baselines comparisons with no certificate of optimality.</description>
