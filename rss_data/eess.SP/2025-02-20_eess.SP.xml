      <title>Deep-Unfolded Massive Grant-Free Transmission in Cell-Free Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grant-free transmission and cell-free communication are vital in improving coverage and quality-of-service for massive machine-type communication. This paper proposes a novel framework of joint active user detection, channel estimation, and data detection (JACD) for massive grant-free transmission in cell-free wireless communication systems. We formulate JACD as an optimization problem and solve it approximately using forward-backward splitting. To deal with the discrete symbol constraint, we relax the discrete constellation to its convex hull and propose two approaches that promote solutions from the constellation set. To reduce complexity, we replace costly computations with approximate shrinkage operations and approximate posterior mean estimator computations. To improve active user detection (AUD) performance, we introduce a soft-output AUD module that considers both the data estimates and channel conditions. To jointly optimize all algorithm hyper-parameters and to improve JACD performance, we further deploy deep unfolding together with a momentum strategy, resulting in two algorithms called DU-ABC and DU-POEM. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed JACD algorithms via extensive system simulations.</description>

      <title>Uplink Coordinated Pilot Design for 1-bit Massive MIMO in Correlated Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a coordinated pilot design method to minimize the channel estimation mean squared error (MSE) in 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Under the assumption that the well-known Bussgang linear minimum mean square error (BLMMSE) estimator is used for channel estimation, we first observe that the resulting MSE leads to an intractable optimization problem, as it involves the arcsin function and a complex multiple matrix ratio form. To resolve this, we derive the approximate MSE by assuming the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, by which we develop an efficient coordinated pilot design based on a fractional programming technique. The proposed pilot design is distinguishable from the existing work in that it is applicable in general system environments, including correlated channel and multi-cell environments. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the channel estimation accuracy performance compared to the conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Research on the Offshore Marine Communication Environment Based on Satellite Remote Sensing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air-sea interface fluxes significantly impact the reliability and efficiency of maritime communication. Compared to sparse in-situ ocean observations, satellite remote sensing data offers broader coverage and extended temporal span. This study utilizes COARE V3.5 algorithm to calculate momentum flux, sensible heat flux, and latent heat flux at the air-sea interface, based on satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wind speed data, reanalysis data, and buoy measurements, combined with neural network methods. Findings indicate that SAR wind speed data corrected via neural networks show improved consistency with buoy-measured wind speeds in flux calculations. Specifically, the bias in friction velocity decreased from -0.03 m/s to 0.01 m/s, wind stress bias from -0.03 N/m^2 to 0.00 N/m^2, drag coefficient bias from -0.29 to -0.21, latent heat flux bias from -8.32 W/m^2 to 5.41 W/m^2, and sensible heat flux bias from 0.67 W/m^2 to 0.06 W/m^2. Results suggest that the neural network-corrected SAR wind speed data can provide more reliable environmental data for maritime communication.</description>

      <title>Binary Deterministic Sensing Matrix Construction Using Manifold Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary deterministic sensing matrices are highly desirable for sampling sparse signals, as they require only a small number of sum-operations to generate the measurement vector. Furthermore, sparse sensing matrices enable the use of lowcomplexity algorithms for signal reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a method to construct low-density binary deterministic sensing matrices by formulating a manifold-based optimization problem on the statistical manifold. The proposed matrices can be of arbitrary sizes, providing a significant advantage over existing constructions. We also prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm. The proposed binary sensing matrices feature low coherence and constant column weight. Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing binary sensing matrices in terms of reconstruction percentage and signal to noise ratio (SNR).</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wave ISAC Testbed Using Programmable Digital Coding Dynamic Metasurface Antenna: Practical Design and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMAs) are transforming reconfigurable antenna technology by enabling energy-efficient, cost-effective beamforming through programmable meta-elements, eliminating the need for traditional phase shifters and delay lines. This breakthrough technology is emerging to revolutionize beamforming for next-generation wireless communication and sensing networks. In this paper, we present the design and real-world implementation of a DMA-assisted wireless communication platform operating in the license-free 60 GHz millimeter-wave (mmWave) band. Our system employs high-speed binary-coded sequences generated via a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), enabling real-time beam steering for spatial multiplexing and independent data transmission. A proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates high-definition quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulated video transmission at 62 GHz. Furthermore, leveraging the DMA's multi-beam capability, we simultaneously transmit video to two spatially separated receivers, achieving accurate demodulation. We envision the proposed mmWave testbed as a platform for enabling the seamless integration of sensing and communication by allowing video transmission to be replaced with sensing data or utilizing an auxiliary wireless channel to transmit sensing information to multiple receivers. This synergy paves the way for advancing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in beyond-5G and 6G networks. Additionally, our testbed demonstrates potential for real-world use cases, including mmWave backhaul links and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) mmWave base stations.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Cram\'er-Rao Bound based 6D Localization and Tracking for 5G/6G Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization and tracking are critical components of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, enhancing resource management, beamforming accuracy, and overall system reliability through precise sensing. Due to the high path loss of the high-frequency systems, antenna arrays are required at the transmitter and receiver sides for beamforming gain. However, beam misalignment may occur, which requires accurate tracking of the six-dimensional (6D) state, namely, 3D position and 3D orientation. In this work, we first address the challenge that the rotation matrix, being part of the Lie group rather than Euclidean space, necessitates the derivation of the ICRB for an intrinsic performance benchmark. Then, leveraging the derived ICRB, we develop two filters-one utilizing pose fusion and the other employing error-state Kalman filter to estimate the UE's 6D state for different computational resource consumption and accuracy requirements. Simulation results validate the ICRB and assess the performance of the proposed filters, demonstrating their effectiveness and improved accuracy in 6D state tracking.</description>

      <title>Generative Video Semantic Communication via Multimodal Semantic Fusion with Large Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in traditional syntactic communications based on Shannon's theory, these methods struggle to meet the requirements of 6G immersive communications, especially under challenging transmission conditions. With the development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), progress has been made in reconstructing videos using high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose a scalable generative video semantic communication framework that extracts and transmits semantic information to achieve high-quality video reconstruction. Specifically, at the transmitter, description and other condition signals (e.g., first frame, sketches, etc.) are extracted from the source video, functioning as text and structural semantics, respectively. At the receiver, the diffusion-based GenAI large models are utilized to fuse the semantics of the multiple modalities for reconstructing the video. Simulation results demonstrate that, at an ultra-low channel bandwidth ratio (CBR), our scheme effectively captures semantic information to reconstruct videos aligned with human perception under different signal-to-noise ratios. Notably, the proposed ``First Frame+Desc." scheme consistently achieves CLIP score exceeding 0.92 at CBR = 0.0057 for SNR &gt; 0 dB. This demonstrates its robust performance even under low SNR conditions.</description>

      <title>Toeplitz-Hermitian ADMM-Net for DoA Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Toeplitz-Hermitian ADMM-Net (THADMM-Net), a deep neural network obtained by deep unfolding the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for solving the least absolute shrinkage thresholding operator problem in the context of direction of arrival estimation. By imposing both a Toeplitz-Hermitian as well as positve semi-definite constraint on the learnable matrices, the total parameter count required per layer is reduced from $N^2$ to approximately $N$ where $N$ is the length of the dictionary used in the sparse recovery problem. Numerical simulations show that with a lower parameter count and depth, THADMM-Net outperforms Toeplitz-Lista with respect to the normalized mean-squared error, the detection rate, as well as the root mean-squared error over a signal-to-noise ratio between 0 dB and 35 dB.</description>

      <title>Fundus2Globe: Generative AI-Driven 3D Digital Twins for Personalized Myopia Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Myopia, projected to affect 50% population globally by 2050, is a leading cause of vision loss. Eyes with pathological myopia exhibit distinctive shape distributions, which are closely linked to the progression of vision-threatening complications. Recent understanding of eye-shape-based biomarkers requires magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), however, it is costly and unrealistic in routine ophthalmology clinics. We present Fundus2Globe, the first AI framework that synthesizes patient-specific 3D eye globes from ubiquitous 2D color fundus photographs (CFPs) and routine metadata (axial length, spherical equivalent), bypassing MRI dependency. By integrating a 3D morphable eye model (encoding biomechanical shape priors) with a latent diffusion model, our approach achieves submillimeter accuracy in reconstructing posterior ocular anatomy efficiently. Fundus2Globe uniquely quantifies how vision-threatening lesions (e.g., staphylomas) in CFPs correlate with MRI-validated 3D shape abnormalities, enabling clinicians to simulate posterior segment changes in response to refractive shifts. External validation demonstrates its robust generation performance, ensuring fairness across underrepresented groups. By transforming 2D fundus imaging into 3D digital replicas of ocular structures, Fundus2Globe is a gateway for precision ophthalmology, laying the foundation for AI-driven, personalized myopia management.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised CP-UNet Framework for Denoising DAS Data with Decay Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed acoustic sensor (DAS) technology leverages optical fiber cables to detect acoustic signals, providing cost-effective and dense monitoring capabilities. It offers several advantages including resistance to extreme conditions, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and accurate detection. However, DAS typically exhibits a lower signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) compared to geophones and is susceptible to various noise types, such as random noise, erratic noise, level noise, and long-period noise. This reduced S/N can negatively impact data analyses containing inversion and interpretation. While artificial intelligence has demonstrated excellent denoising capabilities, most existing methods rely on supervised learning with labeled data, which imposes stringent requirements on the quality of the labels. To address this issue, we develop a label-free unsupervised learning (UL) network model based on Context-Pyramid-UNet (CP-UNet) to suppress erratic and random noises in DAS data. The CP-UNet utilizes the Context Pyramid Module in the encoding and decoding process to extract features and reconstruct the DAS data. To enhance the connectivity between shallow and deep features, we add a Connected Module (CM) to both encoding and decoding section. Layer Normalization (LN) is utilized to replace the commonly employed Batch Normalization (BN), accelerating the convergence of the model and preventing gradient explosion during training. Huber-loss is adopted as our loss function whose parameters are experimentally determined. We apply the network to both the 2-D synthetic and filed data. Comparing to traditional denoising methods and the latest UL framework, our proposed method demonstrates superior noise reduction performance.</description>

      <title>Multi-channel Replay Speech Detection using an Adaptive Learnable Beamformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Replay attacks belong to the class of severe threats against voice-controlled systems, exploiting the easy accessibility of speech signals by recorded and replayed speech to grant unauthorized access to sensitive data. In this work, we propose a multi-channel neural network architecture called M-ALRAD for the detection of replay attacks based on spatial audio features. This approach integrates a learnable adaptive beamformer with a convolutional recurrent neural network, allowing for joint optimization of spatial filtering and classification. Experiments have been carried out on the ReMASC dataset, which is a state-of-the-art multi-channel replay speech detection dataset encompassing four microphones with diverse array configurations and four environments. Results on the ReMASC dataset show the superiority of the approach compared to the state-of-the-art and yield substantial improvements for challenging acoustic environments. In addition, we demonstrate that our approach is able to better generalize to unseen environments with respect to prior studies.</description>

      <title>User Association and Coordinated Beamforming in Cognitive Aerial-Terrestrial Networks: A Safe Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive aerial-terrestrial networks (CATNs) offer a solution to spectrum scarcity by sharing spectrum between aerial and terrestrial networks. However, aerial users (AUs) experience significant interference from numerous terrestrial base stations (BSs). To alleviate such interference, we investigate a user association and coordinated beamforming (CBF) problem in CATN, where the aerial network serves as the primary network sharing its spectrum with the terrestrial network. Specifically, we maximize the sum rate of the secondary terrestrial users (TUs) under the interference temperature constraints of the AUs. Traditional iterative optimization schemes are impractical due to their high computational complexity and information exchange overhead. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based schemes can address these challenges, their performance is sensitive to the weights of the weighted penalty terms for violating constraints in the reward function. Motivated by these issues, we propose a safe DRL-based user association and CBF scheme for CATN, eliminating the need for training multiple times to find the optimal penalty weight before actual deployment. Specifically, the CATN is modeled as a networked constrained partially observable Markov game. Each TU acts as an agent to choose its associated BS, and each BS acts as an agent to decide its beamforming vectors, aiming to maximize the reward while satisfying the safety constraints introduced by the interference constraints of the AUs. By exploiting a safe DRL algorithm, the proposed scheme incurs lower deployment expenses than the penalty-based DRL schemes since only one training is required before actual deployment. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a higher sum rate of TUs than a two-stage optimization scheme while the average received interference power of the AUs is generally below the threshold.</description>

      <title>Herglotz-NET: Implicit Neural Representation of Spherical~Data with Harmonic Positional Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representing and processing data in spherical domains presents unique challenges, primarily due to the curvature of the domain, which complicates the application of classical Euclidean techniques. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising alternative for high-fidelity data representation; however, to effectively handle spherical domains, these methods must be adapted to the inherent geometry of the sphere to maintain both accuracy and stability. In this context, we propose Herglotz-NET (HNET), a novel INR architecture that employs a harmonic positional encoding based on complex Herglotz mappings. This encoding yields a well-posed representation on the sphere with interpretable and robust spectral properties. Moreover, we present a unified expressivity analysis showing that any spherical-based INR satisfying a mild condition exhibits a predictable spectral expansion that scales with network depth. Our results establish HNET as a scalable and flexible framework for accurate modeling of spherical data.</description>

      <title>Beam Pattern Modulation Embedded Hybrid Transceiver Optimization for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as a promising technology for B5G/6G, particularly in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band. However, the widely utilized hybrid architecture in mmWave systems compromises multiplexing gain due to the constraints of limited radio frequency chains. Moreover, additional sensing functionalities exacerbate the impairment of spectrum efficiency (SE). In this paper, we present an optimized beam pattern modulation-embedded ISAC (BPM-ISAC) transceiver design, which spares one RF chain for sensing and the others for communication. To compensate for the reduced SE, index modulation across communication beams is applied. We formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the sensing beampattern, subject to a symbol MSE constraint. This problem is then solved by sequentially optimizing the analog and digital parts. Both the multi-aperture structure (MAS) and the multi-beam structure (MBS) are considered for the design of the analog part. We conduct theoretical analysis on the asymptotic pairwise error probability (APEP) and the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) of direction of arrival (DoA) estimation. Numerical simulations validate the overall enhanced ISAC performance over existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Variation Bayesian Interference for Multiple Extended Targets or Unresolved Group Targets Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a tracking method for multiple extended targets or unresolvable group targets based on the Variational Bayesian Inference (VBI). Firstly, based on the most commonly used Random Matrix Model (RMM), the joint states of a single target are modeled as a Gamma Gaussian Inverse Wishart (GGIW) distribution, and the multi-target joint association variables are involved in the estimation together as unknown information with a prior distribution. A shape evolution model and VBI are employed to address the shortcomings of the RMM. Through the VBI, we can derive the approximate variational posterior for the exact multi-target posterior. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of the method in real-world tracking scenarios, we present two potential lightweight schemes. The first is based on clustering, which effectively prunes the joint association events. The second is a simplification of the variational posterior through marginal association probabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using simulation experiments, and the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and adaptability. This manuscript is only a preprint version, a completer and more official version will be uploaded as soon as possible</description>

      <title>Chirped DFT-s-OFDM: A new single-carrier waveform with enhanced LMMSE noise suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a new single-carrier waveform, called chirped discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM), is proposed for the sixth generation of communications. As the initial study on this waveform, its performance is analyzed and evaluated in single-user uplink multiple access communications, using a delay-Doppler channel model with independent and identically distributed path amplitudes and different integer delays. By chirping DFT-s-OFDM in the time domain, it maintains the low peak-to-average-power ratio of DFT-s-OFDM. Thanks to full-band transmission and symbols retransmission enabled by chirping and discrete Fourier transform precoding, it enhances noise suppression of linear minimum mean square error equalization. By using pairwise error probability analysis, the derived bit error rate upper bound is close to the simulated ones and the diversity order analysis confirms that it achieves full frequency diversity.</description>

      <title>Covert Communications Without Pre-Sharing of Side Information and Channel Estimation Over Quasi-Static Fading Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new covert communication scheme that operates without pre-sharing side information and channel estimation, utilizing a Gaussian-distributed Grassmann constellation for noncoherent detection. By designing constant-amplitude symbols on the Grassmann manifold and multiplying them by random variables, we generate signals that follow an arbitrary probability distribution, such as Gaussian or skew-normal distributions. The mathematical property of the manifold enables the transmitter's random variables to remain unshared with the receiver, and the elimination of pilot symbols that could compromise covertness. The proposed scheme achieved higher covertness and achievable rates compared to conventional coherent Gaussian signaling schemes, without any penalty in terms of complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14441v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as the key technology in the vision of the sixth generation (6G) era. With the emergence of new concepts in mobile communications, the channel model is the prerequisite for system design and performance evaluation. Currently, 3GPP Release 19 is advancing the standardization of ISAC channel models. Nevertheless, a unified modeling framework has yet to be established. This paper provides a simulation diagram of ISAC channel modeling extended based on the Geometry-Based Stochastic Model (GBSM), compatible with existing 5G channel models and the latest progress in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standardization. We first introduce the progress of the ISAC channel model standardization in general. Then, a concatenated channel modeling approach is presented considering the team's standardization proposals, which is implemented on the BUPTCMCC-6G-CMG+ channel model generator. We validated the model in cumulative probability density function (CDF) in statistical extension of angle and delay, and radar cross section (RCS). Simulation results show that the proposed model can realistically characterize the feature of channel concatenation and RCS within the ISAC channel.</description>

Abstract: Multi-connectivity (MC) in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), included in the Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, is regarded as a promising technology for future networks, especially the non-terrestrial network (NTN). The significant advantages of MC in improving coverage, communication, and sensing through satellite-terrestrial collaboration have sparked widespread interest. This article introduces three fundamental deployment architectures of MC systems in STINs, including multi-satellite, single-satellite single-base-station, and multi-satellite multi-base-station configurations. Considering the emerging but still evolving satellite networking, we explore system design challenges such as satellite networking schemes, such as cell-free and multi-tier satellite networks. Subsequently, key technical challenges severely influencing the quality of mutual communications, including beamforming, channel estimation, and synchronization, are discussed. Furthermore, typical applications such as coverage enhancement, traffic offloading, collaborative sensing, and low-altitude communication are demonstrated, followed by a case study comparing coverage performance in MC and single-connectivity (SC) configurations. Several essential future research directions for MC in STINs are presented to facilitate further exploration.</description>

      <title>MSEMG: Surface Electromyography Denoising with a Mamba-based Efficient Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) recordings can be contaminated by electrocardiogram (ECG) signals when the monitored muscle is closed to the heart. Traditional signal processing-based approaches, such as high-pass filtering and template subtraction, have been used to remove ECG interference but are often limited in their effectiveness. Recently, neural network-based methods have shown greater promise for sEMG denoising, but they still struggle to balance both efficiency and effectiveness. In this study, we introduce MSEMG, a novel system that integrates the Mamba state space model with a convolutional neural network to serve as a lightweight sEMG denoising model. We evaluated MSEMG using sEMG data from the Non-Invasive Adaptive Prosthetics database and ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database. The results show that MSEMG outperforms existing methods, generating higher-quality sEMG signals using fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>Computation-and-Communication Efficient Coordinated Multicast Beamforming in Massive MIMO Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main challenges in designing downlink coordinated multicast beamforming in massive multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) cellular networks are the complex computational solutions and significant fronthaul overhead for centralized coordination. This paper proposes a coordinated multicast beamforming solution that is both computation and communication efficient. For joint BS coordination with individual base station transmit power budgets, we first obtain the optimal structure of coordinated multicast beamforming. It reveals that the beamformer at each BS is naturally distributed and only depends on the local channel state information (CSI) at its serving BS. Moreover, the optimal beamformer is a weighted minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamformer with a low-dimensional structure of unknown weights to be optimized, independent of the number of BS antennas. Utilizing the optimal structural properties, we propose fast algorithms to determine the unknown parameters for the optimal beamformer. The main iterative algorithm decomposes the problem into small subproblems, yielding only closed/semi-closed form updates. Furthermore, we propose a semi-distributed computing approach for the proposed algorithm that allows each BS to compute its beamformer based on the local CSI without the need for global CSI sharing, resulting in the fronthaul overhead independent of the number of BS antennas. We further extend our results to the design under the imperfect CSI and other coordination scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed methods can achieve near-optimal performance with significantly lower computational time for massive MIMO systems than the conventional approaches.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink delay Doppler channels (also called doubly selective channels). We prove that no modulation schemes (including the current active VOFDM/OTFS) can compensate a non-trivial Doppler spread well. We then discuss some of the existing methods to deal with time-varying channels, in particular time-frequency (TF) coding in an OFDM system. TF coding is equivalent to space-time coding in the math part. We also summarize state of the art on space-time coding that was an active research topic over a decade ago.</description>

      <title>An Attention-Assisted AI Model for Real-Time Underwater Sound Speed Estimation Leveraging Remote Sensing Sea Surface Temperature Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The estimation of underwater sound velocity distribution serves as a critical basis for facilitating effective underwater communication and precise positioning, given that variations in sound velocity influence the path of signal transmission. Conventional techniques for the direct measurement of sound velocity, as well as methods that involve the inversion of sound velocity utilizing acoustic field data, necessitate on--site data collection. This requirement not only places high demands on device deployment, but also presents challenges in achieving real-time estimation of sound velocity distribution. In order to construct a real-time sound velocity field and eliminate the need for underwater onsite data measurement operations, we propose a self-attention embedded multimodal data fusion convolutional neural network (SA-MDF-CNN) for real-time underwater sound speed profile (SSP) estimation. The proposed model seeks to elucidate the inherent relationship between remote sensing sea surface temperature (SST) data, the primary component characteristics of historical SSPs, and their spatial coordinates. This is achieved by employing CNNs and attention mechanisms to extract local and global correlations from the input data, respectively. The ultimate objective is to facilitate a rapid and precise estimation of sound velocity distribution within a specified task area. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has lower root mean square error (RMSE) and stronger robustness than other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence-derived Vascular Age from Photoplethysmography: A Novel Digital Biomarker for Cardiovascular Health</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing availability of wearable devices, photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive tool for monitoring human hemodynamics. We propose a deep learning framework to estimate vascular age (AI-vascular age) from PPG signals, incorporating a distribution-aware loss to address biases caused by imbalanced data. The model was developed using data from the UK Biobank (UKB), with 98,672 participants in the development cohort and 113,559 participants (144,683 data pairs) for clinical evaluation. After adjusting for key confounders, individuals with a vascular age gap (AI-vascular age minus calendar age) exceeding 9 years had a significantly higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) (HR = 2.37, p &lt; 0.005) and secondary outcomes, including diabetes (HR = 2.69, p &lt; 0.005), hypertension (HR = 2.88, p &lt; 0.005), coronary heart disease (HR = 2.20, p &lt; 0.005), heart failure (HR = 2.15, p &lt; 0.005), myocardial infarction (HR = 2.51, p &lt; 0.005), stroke (HR = 2.55, p &lt; 0.005), and all-cause mortality (HR = 2.51, p &lt; 0.005). Conversely, participants with a vascular age gap below -9 years exhibited a significantly lower incidence of these outcomes. We further evaluated the longitudinal applicability of AI-vascular age using serial PPG data from the UKB, demonstrating its value in risk stratification by leveraging AI-vascular age at two distinct time points to predict future MACCE incidence. External validation was performed on a MIMIC-III-derived cohort (n = 2,343), where each one-year increase in vascular age gap was significantly associated with elevated in-hospital mortality risk (OR = 1.02, p &lt; 0.005). In conclusion, our study establishes AI-vascular age as a novel, non-invasive digital biomarker for cardiovascular health assessment.</description>

      <title>Iterative Inversion of Ill-Conditioned MIMO Channels Using Symmetric Rank-$1$ Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While iterative matrix inversion methods excel in computational efficiency, memory optimization, and support for parallel and distributed computing when managing large matrices, their limitations are also evident in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels. These methods encounter challenges related to slow convergence and diminished accuracy, especially in ill-conditioned scenarios, hindering their application in future MIMO networks such as extra-large aperture array. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel matrix regularization method termed symmetric rank-$1$ regularization (SR-$1$R). The proposed method functions by augmenting the channel matrix with a symmetric rank-$1$ matrix, with the primary goal of minimizing the condition number of the resultant regularized matrix. This significantly improves the matrix condition, enabling fast and accurate iterative inversion of the regularized matrix. Then, the inverse of the original channel matrix is obtained by applying the Sherman-Morrison transform on the outcome of iterative inversions. Our eigenvalue analysis unveils the best channel condition that can be achieved by an optimized SR-$1$R matrix. Moreover, a power iteration-assisted (PIA) approach is proposed to find the optimum SR-$1$R matrix without need of eigenvalue decomposition. The proposed approach exhibits logarithmic algorithm-depth in parallel computing for MIMO precoding. Finally, computer simulations demonstrate that SR-$1$R has the potential to reduce the required iteration by up to $35\%$ while achieving the performance of regularized zero-forcing.</description>

      <title>Regression coefficient estimation from remote sensing maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13659v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing map products are used to estimate regression coefficients relating environmental variables, such as the effect of conservation zones on deforestation. However, the quality of map products varies, and -- because maps are outputs of complex machine learning algorithms that take in a variety of remotely sensed variables as inputs -- errors are difficult to characterize. Thus, population-level estimates from such maps may be biased. In this paper, we apply prediction-powered inference (PPI) to regression coefficient estimation. PPI generates unbiased estimates by using a small amount of randomly sampled ground truth data to correct for bias in large-scale remote sensing map products. Applying PPI across multiple remote sensing use cases in regression coefficient estimation, we find that it results in estimates that are (1) more reliable than using the map product as if it were 100% accurate and (2) have lower uncertainty than using only the ground truth and ignoring the map product. Empirically, we observe effective sample size increases of up to 17-fold using PPI compared to only using ground truth data. This is the first work to estimate remote sensing regression coefficients without assumptions on the structure of map product errors. Data and code are available at https://github.com/Earth-Intelligence-Lab/uncertainty-quantification.</description>
