      <title>The type IIA Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude in AdS$_4$ $\times$ CP$^3$ from ABJM theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider tree level scattering of gravitons in type IIA string theory on $AdS_4\times \mathbb{CP}^3$ to all orders in $\alpha'$, which is dual to the stress tensor correlator in $U(N)_k\times U(N)_{-k}$ ABJM theory in the planar large $N$ limit and to all orders in large $\lambda\sim N/k$. The small curvature expansion of this correlator, defined via a Borel transform, is given by the flat space Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude plus AdS curvature corrections. We fix curvature corrections by demanding that their resonances are consistent with the superconformal block expansion of the correlator and with a worldsheet ansatz in terms of single-valued multiple polylogarithms. The first correction is fully fixed in this way, and matches independent results from integrability, as well as the $R^4$ correction at finite AdS curvature that was previously fixed using supersymmetric localization. We are also able to fix the second curvature correction by using a few additional assumptions, and find that it also satisfies various non-trivial consistency checks. We use our results to fix the tree level $D^4R^4$ correction at finite AdS curvature, and to give many predictions for future integrability studies.</description>

      <title>Lectures in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formulating a quantum theory of gravity lies at the heart of fundamental theoretical physics. This collection of lecture notes encompasses a selection of topics that were covered in six mini-courses at the Nordita PhD school "Towards Quantum Gravity". The scope was to provide a coherent picture, from its foundation to forefront research, emphasizing connections between different areas. The lectures begin with perturbative quantum gravity and effective field theory. Subsequently, two ultraviolet-complete approaches are presented: asymptotically safe gravity and string theory. Finally, elements of quantum effects in black hole spacetimes are discussed.</description>

      <title>The EFT of Large Spin Mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use effective string theory to study mesons with large spin $J$ in large $N_c$ QCD as rotating open strings. In the first part of this work, we formulate a consistent effective field theory (EFT) for open spinning strings with light quarks. Our EFT provides a consistent treatment of the endpoints' singularities that arise in the massless limit. We obtain results, in a systematic $1/J$ expansion, for the spectrum of the leading and daughter Regge trajectories. Interestingly, we find that the redshift factor associated with the quarks' acceleration implies that the applicability regime of the EFT is narrower compared to that of static flux tubes. In the second part of this work, we discuss several extensions of phenomenological interests, including mesons with heavy quarks, the quarks' spin and the daughter Regge trajectories associated with the worldsheet axion, a massive string mode identified in lattice simulations of $4d$ flux tubes. We compare our predictions with $4d$ QCD spectroscopy data, and suggest potential $stringy$ interpretations of the observed mesons. We finally comment on the relation between the EFT spectrum and the Axionic String Ansatz, a recently proposed characterization of the spectrum of Yang-Mills glueballs.</description>

      <title>Random Circuits in the Black Hole Interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a quantitative holographic relation between a microscopic measure of randomness and the geometric length of the wormhole in the black hole interior. To this end, we perturb an AdS black hole with Brownian semiclassical sources, implementing the continuous version of a random quantum circuit for the black hole. We use the random circuit to prepare ensembles of states of the black hole whose semiclassical duals contain Einstein-Rosen (ER) caterpillars: long cylindrical wormholes with large numbers of matter inhomogeneities, of linearly growing length with the circuit time. In this setup, we show semiclassically that the ensemble of ER caterpillars of average length $k\ell_{\Delta}$ and matter correlation scale $\ell_{\Delta}$ forms an approximate quantum state $k$-design of the black hole. At exponentially long circuit times, the ensemble of ER caterpillars becomes polynomial-copy indistinguishable from a collection of random states of the black hole. We comment on the implications of these results for holographic circuit complexity and for the holographic description of the black hole interior.</description>

      <title>Brane-fused black hole operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct infinitely many new $\frac{1}{16}$-BPS cohomologies of the 4d maximal super-Yang-Mills theory and interpret them as a black hole wrapped by dual giant graviton hairs. Since the black hole inside a dual giant feels the RR 5-form flux reduced by one unit, its microstate should essentially be an $SU(N-1)$ cohomology. However, due to the fortuitous nature of the black hole microstates, promoting an $SU(N-1)$ black hole state to $SU(N)$ generally fails to yield a cohomology. We show at $N=3$ that suitable fusion products with the dual giants yield cohomologies. The core black hole size is probed by the minimal size of the dual giant which can wrap it. We also discuss two types of large black hole hairs: large conformal descendants of gravitons and large dual giants. We prove that any $SU(N)$ black hole cohomology admits infinitely many hairs of the first type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To deepen our understanding of Quantum Gravity and its connections with black holes and cosmology, building a common language and exchanging ideas across different approaches is crucial. The Nordita Program "Quantum Gravity: from gravitational effective field theories to ultraviolet complete approaches" created a platform for extensive discussions, aimed at pinpointing both common grounds and sources of disagreements, with the hope of generating ideas and driving progress in the field. This contribution summarizes the twelve topical discussions held during the program and collects individual thoughts of speakers and panelists on the future of the field in light of these discussions.</description>

      <title>Defects in the long-range O(N) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of extended excitations in the long-range O(N) model. We focus on line and surface defects and we discuss the challenges of a naive generalization of the simplest defects in the short-range model. To face these challenges we propose three alternative realizations of defects in the long-range model. The first consists in introducing an additional parameter in the perturbative RG flow or, equivalently, treating the non-locality of the model as a perturbation of the local four-dimensional theory. The second is based on the introduction of non-local defect degrees of freedom coupled to the bulk and it provides some non-trivial defect CFTs also in the case of a free bulk, i.e. for generalized free field theory. The third approach is based on a semiclassical construction of line defects. After finding a non-trivial classical field configuration we consider the fluctuation Lagrangian to obtain quantum corrections for the defect theory.</description>

      <title>The complete non-perturbative partition function of minimal superstring theory and JT supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an exact convergent expression for the partition function of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ $(2,4k)$ minimal superstring theory with type 0B GSO projection in the ungapped phase by leveraging the duality between this theory and a double-scaled unitary matrix integral. Taking the $k\rightarrow\infty$ limit, we also obtain the complete partition function of $\mathcal{N}=1$ JT supergravity, including all contributions associated with ``doubly non-perturbative'' effects. We discover that the fundamental objects of the string theory are a linear combination of the standard FZZT branes which we call F-branes, along with their charge-conjugate partners which we call anti-F-branes. Summing over the disk and cylinder diagram contributions of the F-branes and anti-F-branes and integrating over their moduli space completely reproduces our expression for the partition function from the matrix integral side of the duality. We show that the string theory can be expressed precisely in the formalism of dressed free fermions and we propose a Hilbert space interpretation of our results. We present exact expressions for the matrix integral correlators of the double-scaled eigenvalue density $\widetilde{\rho}(x)$.</description>

      <title>Holographic dual of Bures metric and subregion complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the AdS/CFT correspondence, computational complexity for reduced density matrices of holographic conformal field theories has been conjectured to be related to certain geometric observables in the dual gravity theory. We study this conjecture from both the gravity and field theory point of view. Specifically, we consider a measure of complexity associated to the Bures metric on the space of density matrices. We compute this complexity measure for mixed states associated to single intervals in descendant states of the vacuum in 2d CFTs. Moreover, we derive from first principles a geometric observable dual to the Bures metric which is localized in the entanglement wedge of the AdS spacetime associated to the quantum circuit on the boundary. Finally, we compare the Bures metric complexity measure with holographic subregion complexity within the ``complexity=volume'' paradigm for perturbatively small transformations of the vacuum. While there is no exact agreement between these two quantities, we find striking similarities as we vary the target state and interval size, suggesting that these quantities are closely related.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of MHV Gravity Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate MHV tree-level gravity amplitudes as defined on the spinor-helicity variety. Unlike their gluon counterparts, the gravity amplitudes do not have logarithmic singularities and do not admit Amplituhedron-like construction. Importantly, they are not determined just by their singularities, but rather their numerators have interesting zeroes. We make a conjecture about the uniqueness of the numerator and explore this feature from a more mathematical perspective. This leads us to a new approach for examining adjoints. We outline steps of our proposed proof and provide computational evidence for its validity in specific cases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for obtaining a hierarchy of rigorous bounds on the time-evolution of a quantum mechanical system from an arbitrary initial state, systematically generalizing Mandelstam-Tamm-like relations. For any fixed level in the hierarchy, the bounds are tightest after short time-evolution and gradually loosen over time; we present evidence that for any fixed amount of time-evolution, the bounds can be made arbitrarily tight by moving up in the hierarchy. The computational effort to obtain the bounds scales polynomially with the number of degrees of freedom in the system being simulated. We demonstrate the method on both a single anharmonic oscillator and a system of two coupled anharmonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Chiral global embedding of Fibre Inflation with $\overline{\rm D3}$ uplift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carefully analyse the challenges posed by the construction of type IIB chiral global embeddings of Fibre Inflation with $\overline{ \rm D3}$ uplift to a de Sitter vacuum. We present an explicit example involving an $h^{1,1}=4$ Calabi-Yau manifold with a K3 fibration and a del Pezzo divisor supporting non-perturbative effects. The chosen orientifold involution induces O3-planes that can be placed on top of each other at the tip of the throat of a deformed conifold singularity. The D7-brane sector contains standard magnetised branes and a Whitney brane. The former induce chiral matter and generate quantum effects that stabilise the K\"ahler moduli, while the latter helps increasing the total D3-charge. We study in detail the constraints on the parameter space leading to an observationally viable inflationary dynamics, finding several regions where the effective field theory is under control.</description>

      <title>Exploring superconformal Yang-Mills theories through matrix Bessel kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A broad class of observables in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal Yang-Mills theories can be exactly computed for arbitrary 't Hooft coupling as Fredholm determinants of integrable Bessel operators. These observables admit a unifying description through a one-parameter generating function, which possesses a determinant representation involving a matrix generalization of the Bessel operator. We analyze this generating function over a wide range of parameter values and finite 't Hooft coupling. We demonstrate that it has a well-behaved weak-coupling expansion with a finite radius of convergence. In contrast, the strong-coupling expansion exhibits factorially growing coefficients, necessitating the inclusion of non-perturbative corrections that are exponentially suppressed at strong coupling. We compute these non-perturbative corrections and observe a striking resemblance between the resulting trans-series expansion of the generating function and the partition function of a strongly coupled theory expanded in powers of a mass gap.</description>

      <title>A single geometry from an all-genus expansion in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an instance in quantum gravity where a topological expansion resums into an effective description on a single geometry. The original theory whose gravitational path integral we study is JT quantum gravity with one asymptotic boundary at nonperturbatively low temperatures. The effective theory we derive is a deformation of JT gravity by a highly quantum and nonlocal interaction for the dilaton, evaluated only on a disk topology. This emergent description addresses a strongly quantum gravitational regime where all genera contribute at the same order, successfully capturing the doubly nonperturbative physics of the original theory.</description>

      <title>Wave Function Renormalization in Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of wave function renormalization (WFR) in asymptotically safe gravity. We show that there are two WFR-invariant quantities, and the renormalization (RG) equations may be written entirely in terms of these quantities. The same set of RG equations can be obtained whether we fix the vacuum energy or Newton coupling along the RG trajectory. The flow of the Newton constant and the vacuum energy is also discussed in detail. In particular we discuss how the vacuum energy behaves near the singular barrier in the low energy.</description>

      <title>Chiral phase transition: effective field theory and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider chiral phase transition relevant for QCD matter at finite temperature but vanishing baryon density. Presumably, the chiral phase transition is of second order for two-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. Near the transition temperature, we apply the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and construct a low energy effective field theory (EFT) for the system, in which fluctuations and dissipations are systematically captured. Dynamical variables involve chiral charge densities and order parameter. The EFT action is further confirmed within a modified AdS/QCD model using the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh technique. With suitable higher terms neglected, the stochastic equations derived from the EFT resemble those of model F in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification. Within the EFT, we briefly discuss spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry and the Goldstone modes.</description>

      <title>The generalized CV conjecture of Krylov complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the ``complexity=volume" (CV) conjecture in the wormhole to the quantum states in the framework of information geometry. In particular, we conjecture that Krylov complexity equals the volume of the Fubini-Study metric in the information geometry. In order to test our conjecture, we study the general Hermitian two-mode Hamiltonian according to the Weyl algebra both in the closed and open systems. By employing the displacement operator, we find that the wave function for a closed system corresponds to the well-known two-mode squeezed state. For an open system, we can create a wave function known as the open two-mode squeezed state by using the second kind of Meixner polynomials. Remarkably, in both cases, the resulting volume of the corresponding Fubini-Study metric provides strong evidence for the validity of the generalized CV conjecture.</description>

      <title>Rational RG flow, extension, and Witt class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a renormalization group flow preserving a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_1$. If it flows to a rational conformal field theory, the surviving symmetry $\mathcal S_1$ flows to a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_2$ with monoidal functor $F:\mathcal S_1\to\mathcal S_2$. By clarifying mathematical (especially category theoretical) meaning of renormalization group domain wall/interface or boundary condition, we find the hidden extended vertex operator (super)algebra gives a unique (up to braided equivalence) completely $(\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2)'$-anisotropic representative of the Witt equivalence class $[\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2]$. The mathematical conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets.
  The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $(A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.</description>

      <title>DeWitt wave functions for de Sitter JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity in two-dimensional de Sitter space is an intriguing model for cosmological ``wave functions of the universe". Its minisuperspace version already contains all physical information. The size of compact slices is parametrized by a scale factor $h &gt; 0$. The dilaton $\phi$ is chosen to have positive values, $\phi &gt; 0$, and interpreted as size of an additional compact slice in a higher-dimensional theory. At the boundaries $h=0$, $\phi=0$, where the volume of the universe vanishes, the curvature is generically singular. According to a conjecture by DeWitt, solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation should vanish at singular loci. Recently, the behaviour of JT wave functions at large field values $h$, $\phi$ has been obtained by means of a path integral over Schwarzian degrees of freedom of a boundary curve. We systematically analyze solutions of the WDW equation with Schwarzian asymptotic behaviour. We find real analytic solutions that vanish on the entire boundary, in agreement with DeWitt's conjecture. Projection to expanding and contracting branches may lead to singularities, which can however be avoided by an appropriate superposition of solutions. Our analysis also illustrates the limitations of semiclassical wave functions.</description>

      <title>Testing the RG-flow $M(3,10)+\phi_{1,7}\to M(3,8)$ with Hamiltonian Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) methods provide a powerful numerical approach for investigating strongly coupled QFTs. In this work, we develop HT techniques to analyse a specific Renormalization Group (RG) flow recently proposed in Refs. [1, 3]. These studies put forward Ginzburg-Landau descriptions for the conformal minimal models $M(3,10)$ and $M(3,8)$, as well as the RG flow connecting them. Specifically, the RG-flow is defined by deforming the $M(3,10)$ with the relevant primary operator $\phi_{1,7}$ (whose indices denote its position in the Kac table), yielding $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$. From the perspective of HT, realising such an RG-flow presents significant challenges, as the $\phi_{1,7}$ deformation requires renormalizing the UV theory up to third order in the coupling constant of the deformation. In this study, we carry out the necessary calculations to formulate HT for this theory and numerically investigate the spectrum of $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$ in the large coupling regime, finding strong evidence in favour of the proposed flow.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the renormalization of the gauge-invariant composite operators proposed in \cite{Dudal:2023jsu} to describe the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ Higgs model from a gauge-invariant perspective. To establish the relationship between the counterterms, we use the Algebraic Renormalization approach \cite{Piguet:1995er}. Therefore, we also derive the set of Ward identities of the model after introducing these composite operators. Using these Ward identities, we demonstrate important exact relations between the correlation functions of elementary fields and composite fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a self-consistent framework to study the backreaction effects of particle creation in coupled semiclassical dynamics of a quantum complex scalar field and a classical electric field in both Minkowski and de Sitter spacetimes. This approach utilizes a general formalism to analyze the evolution of Gaussian states of a quantized field, in the Schrodinger picture in the presence of a background electric field. We numerically solve the resulting nonlinear equations using initial data that consists of a Gaussian scalar field state. This provides a self-consistent semiclassical evolution incorporating the non-perturbative backreaction from particle production. We study the time-dependent particle content, current density, and electric field, which are defined in terms of the concept of instantaneous eigenstates, and describe how they capture the time evolution of the quantized field modes. We then compare the results with and without backreaction in flat and cosmological de Sitter spacetime, finding that the backreaction significantly alters particle production in both cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise a novel duality sequence to study late-time cosmology in the heterotic E_8 x E_8 setup of Horava and Witten with dynamical walls that are moving towards each other. Surprisingly, we find that the dimensionally reduced four-dimensional theory does not violate NEC and therefore we do not see either a bouncing or an ekpyrotic phase. Instead, our four-dimensional setup shows a transient de Sitter phase that lies well within the trans-Planckian bound. This opens up a myriad of possibilities of addressing both phenomenological and cosmological issues, and here we concentrate on one such interesting model, an axionic cosmology with temporally varying axionic coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High temperatures are typically thought to increase disorder. Here we examine this idea in Quantum Field Theory in 2+1 dimensions. For this sake we explore a novel class of tractable models, consisting of nearly-mean-field scalars interacting with critical scalars. We identify UV-complete, local, unitary models in this class and show that symmetry breaking $\mathbb{Z}_2 \to \emptyset$ occurs at any temperature in some regions of the phase diagram. This phenomenon, previously observed in models with fractional dimensions, or in the strict planar limits, or with non-local interactions, is now exhibited in a local, unitary 2+1 dimensional model with a finite number of fields.</description>

      <title>Entanglement R\'{e}nyi entropies in celestial holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Celestial holography is the conjecture that scattering amplitudes in $(d+2)$-dimensional asymptotically Minkowski spacetimes are dual to correlators of a $d$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) on the celestial sphere, called the celestial CFT (CCFT). In a CFT, we can calculate sub-region entanglement R\'{e}nyi entropies (EREs), including entanglement entropy (EE), from correlators of twist operators, via the replica trick. We argue that CCFT twist operators are holographically dual to cosmic branes in the $(d+2)$-dimensional spacetime, and that their correlators are holographically dual to the $(d+2)$-dimensional partition function (the vacuum-to-vacuum scattering amplitude) in the presence of these cosmic branes. We hence compute the EREs of a spherical sub-region of the CCFT's conformal vacuum, finding the form dictated by conformal symmetry, including a universal contribution determined by the CCFT's sphere partition function (odd $d$) or Weyl anomaly (even $d$). We find that this universal contribution vanishes when $d=4$ mod $4$, and otherwise is proportional to $i$ times the $d^{\textrm{th}}$ power of the $(d+2)$-dimensional long-distance cutoff in Planck units.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forced soliton equation is the starting point for semiclassical computations with solitons away from the small momentum transfer regime. This paper develops necessary analytical and numerical tools for analyzing solutions to the forced soliton equation in the context of two-dimensional models with kinks. Results include a finite degree of freedom regularization of soliton sector physics based on periodic and anti-periodic lattice models, a detailed analysis of numerical solutions, and the development of perturbation theory in the soliton momentum transfer to mass ratio Delta P/M. Numerical solutions at large transfer, greater or similar to the soliton mass, are capable of exhibiting, in a smooth and controlled fashion, extreme phenomena such as soliton-antisoliton pair creation and superluminal collective coordinate velocities, which we investigate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the vacuum wave function of a free scalar field theory in space partitioned into two regions, with the field obeying Robin conditions (of parameter $\kappa$) on the interface. A direct integration over fields in a subregion is carried out to obtain the reduced density matrix. This leads to a constructive proof of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem. We analyze the entanglement entropy as a function of the Robin parameter $\kappa$. We also consider a specific conditional probability as another measure of entanglement which is more amenable to analysis of the dependence on interface conditions. Finally, we discuss a direct calculation of correlation functions and how it gives an alternate route to the reduced density matrix.</description>

      <title>The Fuzzball Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the puzzles that arise in the quantum theory of black holes, and explain how they are resolved in string theory. We review how the Bekenstein entropy is obtained through the count of brane bound states. We describe the fuzzball construction of black hole microstates. These states have no horizon and radiate from their surface like a normal body, so there is no information puzzle. We explain how the semiclassical approximation is violated in gravitational collapse even though curvatures are low at the horizon. This violation happens because the collapse leads to a stretching of space that is {\it fast}: light does not have time to travel across the collapsing region to establish the `vecro' correlations needed in the quantum gravitational vacuum. These vecro correlations arise from the existence of virtual fuzzball fluctuations in the gravitational vacuum, and are significant because of the large degeneracy of fuzzball states implied by the Bekenstein entropy. It is plausible that similar effects of fast expansion may be responsible for effects like dark energy and the Early Dark Energy postulated to explain the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that AdS amplitudes are CFT correlators to all orders in the loop expansion by showing that they obey the conformal Ward identities. In particular, we provide explicit formulas for the constants and functions of cross-ratios that determine the CFT correlators in terms of bulk data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lecture notes prepared for the Les Houches school "Quantum Geometry: Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics" that took place during the summer 2024. We cover the techniques to perform the exact gravitational path integral of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity, and supergravity, over spacetimes with arbitrary topology, with an application to black holes. We discuss the connection with random matrix models and moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces briefly, since those concepts were covered in other lectures of the school.</description>

      <title>Black Mirrors: CPT-Symmetric Alternatives to Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein's equations imply that a gravitationally collapsed object forms an event horizon. But what lies on the other side of this horizon? In this paper, we question the reality of the conventional solution (the black hole), and point out another, topologically distinct solution: the \textit{black mirror}. In the black hole solution, the horizon connects the exterior metric to an interior metric which contains a curvature singularity. In the black mirror, the horizon instead connects the exterior metric to its own CPT mirror image, yielding a solution with no curvature singularities. We give the general stationary (charged, rotating) black mirror solution explicitly, and also describe the general black mirror formed by gravitational collapse. The black mirror is the relevant stationary point when the quantum path integral is equipped with suitably CPT-symmetric boundary conditions, that we propose. It appears to avoid many vexing puzzles which plague the conventional black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A line of first-order phase transitions is conjectured in the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics at non-zero baryon density. If this is the case, numerical simulations of neutron star mergers suggest that various regions of the stars may cross this line multiple times. This results in the nucleation of bubbles of the preferred phase, which subsequently expand and collide. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum is highly sensitively to the velocity of the bubble walls. We use holography to perform the first microscopic simulation of bubble dynamics in a theory that qualitatively mirrors the expected phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics. We determine the wall velocity in the metastable regions and we compare it to theoretical estimates. We discuss implications for gravitational wave production.</description>

      <title>The S-matrix bootstrap with neural optimizers I: zero double discontinuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning techniques to study nonperturbative scattering amplitudes. We focus on the two-to-two scattering amplitude of identical scalar particles, setting the double discontinuity to zero as a simplifying assumption. Neural networks provide an efficient parameterization for scattering amplitudes, offering a flexible toolkit to describe their fine nonperturbative structure. Combined with the bootstrap approach based on the dispersive representation of the amplitude and machine learning's gradient descent algorithms, they offer a new method to explore the space of consistent S-matrices. We derive bounds on the values of the first two low-energy Taylor coefficients of the amplitude and characterize the resulting amplitudes that populate the allowed region. Crucially, we parallel our neural network analysis with the standard S-matrix bootstrap, both primal and dual, and observe perfect agreement across all approaches.</description>

      <title>Influence of gravity on the quantum speed limit in neutrino oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum speed limits (QSLs) determine the minimal amount of time required for a quantum system to evolve from an initial to a final state. We investigate QSLs for the unitary evolution of the neutrino-antineutrino system in the presence of a gravitational field. It is known that the transition probabilities between neutrino and antineutrino in the framework of one and two flavors depend on the strength of the gravitational field. The behavior of the QSL time in the two-flavor system indicates fast flavor transitions as the gravitational field strength increases. Subsequently, we observe quick suppression of entanglement by exploring the speed limit for entanglement entropy of two-flavor oscillations in the neutrino-antineutrino system in the proximity of a spinning primordial black hole.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Influence on the Quantum Speed Limit in Flavor Oscillations of Neutrino-Antineutrino System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum speed limit (QSL) during the time evolution of neutrino-antineutrino system under the influence of the gravitational field of a spinning primordial black hole (PBH). We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using the Boyer-Lindquist (BL) coordinates. This gravitational potential leads to an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, contributing to the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino systems. Our findings indicate that the gravitational field, expressed in BL coordinates, significantly influences the transition probabilities in two-flavor oscillations of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then apply the expression for transition probabilities between states to analyze the Bures angle, which quantifies the closeness between the initial and final states of the time-evolved flavor state. We use this concept to probe the QSL for the time evolution of the initial flavor neutrino state.</description>

      <title>Metric as Emergence of Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First, we explain some ambiguities of spacetime and metric field as fundamental concepts. Then, from the Unruh effect point of view and using the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, we construct an operator as a quanta of acceleration that we call quantum acceleration operator (QAO). Thereupon, we investigate the relation between the vacuum of two different frames in the Minkowski space. Also, we show that the vacuum of each accelerated frame in the Minkowski space can be obtained by applying such a QAO to the Minkowski vacuum. Furthermore, utilizing these QAOs, we augment the Hilbert space and then extract the metric field of a general frame of the Minkowski spacetime. In this approach, these concepts emerge from the Hilbert space through the constructed QAOs. Accordingly, such an augmented Hilbert space includes quantum field theory in a general frame and can be considered as a fundamental concept instead of the classical metric field and the standard Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Axion mass prediction from adaptive mesh refinement cosmological lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) axion arises as the pseudo-Goldstone mode of a spontaneously broken abelian Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry. If the scale of PQ symmetry breaking occurs below the inflationary reheat temperature and the domain wall number is unity, then there is a unique axion mass that gives the observed dark matter (DM) abundance. Computing this mass has been the subject of intensive numerical simulations for decades since the mass prediction informs laboratory experiments. Axion strings develop below the PQ symmetry-breaking temperature, and as the string network evolves it emits axions that go on to become the DM. A key ingredient in the axion mass prediction is the spectral index of axion radiation emitted by the axion strings. We compute this index in this work using the most precise and accurate large-scale simulations to date of the axion-string network leveraging adaptive mesh refinement to achieve the precision that would otherwise require a static lattice with 262,144$^3$ lattice sites. We find a scale-invariant axion radiation spectrum to within 1% precision. Accounting for axion production from strings prior to the QCD phase transition leads us to predict that the axion mass should be approximately $m_a\in(45,65)$ $\mu \mathrm{eV}$. However, we provide preliminary evidence that axions are produced in greater quantities from the string-domain-wall network collapse during the QCD phase transition, potentially increasing the mass prediction to as much as 300 $\mu$eV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal Love numbers quantify the conservative static response of compact objects to external tidal fields, and are found to vanish exactly for asymptotically flat black holes in four-dimensional general relativity. Many aspects of the physics of black holes have an analogue in the theory of supersonic acoustic flows, including the existence of an event horizon and associated phenomena, such as quasinormal modes and superradiance. In this paper, we investigate the tidal Love numbers of acoustic black holes in different number of dimensions. We find that they exhibit a number of similar properties as higher-dimensional general relativistic black holes, such as logarithmic running with radial distance, and vanishing tidal response for special multipole moments. We show that the latter is a consequence of ladder symmetries, analogous to those identified for black holes.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for two peaks in the sound speed in cold dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I show that in addition to the well-known peak inside massive neutron stars, the sound speed in cold dense QCD matter likely exhibits another peak above neutron star densities before it asymptotes to $c_s=\sqrt{C_s}=\sqrt{1/3}$. Based on the framework reported in arxiv:2408.16738, this approach does not rely on any assumption about the ultra-dense matter not realized in nature. Current multimessenger observation of neutron stars favors the two-peak scenario with a Bayes factor $5.1_{-0.7}^{+0.9}$, where the uncertainties are systematics due to models of neutron star inner cores. This evidence grows to $27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star. The trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below $0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\%$ level) if $2.6M_\odot$ neutron stars exist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark matter, for instance color superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified framework that simultaneously addresses the dynamics of early-time cosmic inflation and late-time cosmic acceleration within the context of a single scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity. By employing an exponential coupling function and a scalar potential with dual asymptotic plateaus, our model naturally transitions from inflationary dynamics at small field values to a quintessence-like behavior at large field values. We derive the inflationary predictions for the spectral index ($n_s$) and tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) in agreement with current observational constraints. For late-time acceleration, the model produces a viable dark energy component with an equation of state $w_\phi$ approaching $-1$ but retaining a measurable deviation that could serve as an observational signature. This work demonstrates that a single theoretical framework can reconcile both early inflation and the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Zero Mass limit of Kerr-MOG Black Hole Equals Wormhole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been argued in existing literature that the zero mass limit of Kerr spacetime corresponds to either flat Minkowski spacetime or a wormhole exhibiting a locally flat geometry. In this study, we examine that the zero mass limit of the Kerr-MOG black hole is equivalent to a wormhole. Moreover, we derive the Kerr-Schild form of the Kerr-MOG black hole through specific coordinate transformations. We further investigate the physical and topological characteristics of the Kerr-MOG black hole within the framework of modified gravity. Our analysis also includes a discussion of the wormhole using cylindrical coordinates, which comprises two distinct coordinate patches. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the Kerr-Newman black hole and show that the \emph{zero mass limit of the Kerr-Newman black hole does not yield a wormhole}. However, if we impose an additional criterion such that \emph{both the mass parameter and the charge parameters are equal to zero}, then the Kerr-Newman black hole will be a wormhole.</description>

      <title>High Quality QCD Axion via Electric-Magnetic Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel paradigm for the QCD axion with high-quality Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry on the basis of electric-magnetic duality in the conformal window of a supersymmetric gauge theory. PQ breaking fields, that contain the QCD axion, emerge in the magnetic theory and possess a large anomalous dimension, which leads to not only generation of an intermediate scale of spontaneous PQ breaking but also significant suppression of explicit PQ symmetry breaking operators. The high PQ quality and the absence of a Landau pole in the color gauge coupling are achieved. The parameter space to realize the correct abundance of the axion dark matter (DM) predicts explicit PQ violation which may be probed by future measurements of the neutron electric dipole moment. In the other viable parameter space, the lightest supersymmetric particle can become a DM candidate. Since the model naturally accommodates a mechanism to suppress the axion isocurvature fluctuation, it provides a complete solution to the strong CP problem as well as the identity of DM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uniqueness and rigidity theorems assert that the asymptotically flat, vacuum, stationary rotating black hole solution in general relativity must be the Kerr solution, exhibiting novel symmetries such as axisymmetry and circularity. In our analysis of post-merger ringdown signal from coalescing black hole binary systems, we identify potential observational signatures for deviations from these Kerr symmetries. Utilizing ringdown data from the gravitational wave event GW150914, we place significant constraints on such deviations. Our analysis introduces a new and novel approach for testing spacetime symmetries through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Grassmann tensor renormalization group method to investigate the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model with the staggered fermions in the presence of a $2\pi$ periodic $\theta$ term in a broad range of mass. The method allows us to deal with the massive staggered fermions straightforwardly and to study the $\theta$ dependence of the free energy and topological charge in the thermodynamic limit. Our calculation provides consistent results with not only the analytical solution in the large mass limit but also the previous Monte Carlo studies in the small mass regime. Our numerical results also suggest that the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model on a lattice has a different phase structure, than the model in the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>NNLL Transverse Momentum Dependent evolution in the Parton Branching method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the preparation period for precision measurements in the newly planned collider experiments, the understanding of the 3D structure of hadron is becoming increasingly urgent. This triggers the activities to include elements of Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) factorization physics in Monte Carlo (MC) event generators. The method designed especially to address this need is the TMD Parton Branching (PB) method. The equivalence of the PB Sudakov form factor, both perturbative and non-perturbative, to the one of Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) is demonstrated and the recent development to increase the low-qt resummation precision of the PB Sudakov up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order by using effective soft-gluon coupling is discussed. The Collins-Soper (CS) kernel is extracted from PB Drell-Yan (DY) predictions obtained with different modelling of radiation.</description>

      <title>Topological data analysis of the deconfinement transition in SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the confining and deconfining phases of pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory with topological data analysis. This provides unique insights into long range correlations of field configurations across the confinement-deconfinement transition. Specifically, we analyze non-trivial structures in electric and magnetic field energy densities as well as Polyakov loop traces and a Polyakov loop-based variant of the topological density. The Betti curves for filtrations based on the electric and magnetic field energy densities reveal signals of electromagnetic dualities. These dualities can be associated with an interchange in the roles of local lumps of electric and magnetic energy densities around the phase transition. Moreover, we show that plaquette susceptibilities can manifest in the geometric features captured by the Betti curves. We also confront the results obtained for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ with that for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and elaborate on the significant differences. Our results demonstrate that topological data analysis can discriminate phase transitions of different order for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. Moreover, it provides unprecedented insights into the relevant structures in their vicinity.</description>

      <title>Highest weight vectors, shifted topological recursion and quantum curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of topological recursion by considering Airy structures whose partition functions are highest weight vectors of particular $\mathcal{W}$-algebra representations. Such highest weight vectors arise as partition functions of Airy structures only under certain conditions on the representations. In the spectral curve formulation of topological recursion, we show that this generalization amounts to adding specific terms to the correlators $ \omega_{g,1}$, which leads to a ``shifted topological recursion'' formula. We then prove that the wave-functions constructed from this shifted version of topological recursion are WKB solutions of families of quantizations of the spectral curve with $ \hbar$-dependent terms. In the reverse direction, starting from an $\hbar$-connection, we find that it is of topological type if the exact same conditions that we found for the Airy structures are satisfied. When this happens, the resulting shifted loop equations can be solved by the shifted topological recursion obtained earlier.</description>

      <title>Betwixt Annihilation and Decay: The Hidden Structure of Cosmological Stasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stasis is a unique cosmological phenomenon in which the abundances of different energy components in the universe (such as matter, radiation, and vacuum energy) each remain fixed even though they scale differently under cosmological expansion. Moreover, extended epochs exhibiting stasis are generally cosmological attractors in many BSM settings and thus arise naturally and without fine-tuning. To date, stasis has been found within a number of very different BSM cosmologies. In some cases, stasis emerges from theories that contain large towers of decaying states (such as theories in extra dimensions or string theory). By contrast, in other cases, no towers of states are needed, and stasis instead emerges due to thermal effects involving particle annihilation rather than decay. In this paper, we study the dynamics of the energy flows in all of these theories during stasis, and find that these theories all share a common energy-flow structure which in some sense lies between particle decay and particle annihilation. This structure has been hidden until now but ultimately lies at the root of the stasis phenomenon, with all of the previous stases appearing as different manifestations of this common underlying structure. This insight not only allows us to understand the emergence of stasis in each of these different scenarios, but also provides an important guide for the potential future discovery of stasis in additional cosmological systems.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Quantization and Minkowskian Statistical Mechanics: simulations on a 1+1 lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce symplectic quantization, a novel functional approach to quantum field theory which allows to sample quantum fields fluctuations directly in Minkowski space-time, at variance with the traditional importance sampling protocols, well defined only for Euclidean Field Theory. This importance sampling procedure is realized by means of a deterministic dynamics generated by Hamilton-like equations evolving with respect to an auxiliary time parameter $\tau$. In this framework, expectation values over quantum fluctuations are computed as dynamical averages along the trajectories parameterized by $\tau$. Assuming ergodicity, this is equivalent to sample a microcanonical partition function. Then, by means of a large-M calculation, where M is the number of degrees of freedom on the lattice, we show that the microcanonical correlation functions are equivalent to those generated by a Minkowskian canonical theory where quantum fields fluctuations are weighted by the factor $\exp(S/\hbar )$, with $S$ being the original relativistic action of the system.</description>

      <title>Propagating degrees of freedom on maximally-symmetric backgrounds in $f(R)$ theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of $f(R)$ gravity, as well as other extended theories of gravity, the correct counting of globally well-defined dynamical modes has recently drawn a vivid interest. In this communication we present a consistent approach shedding light on such issues for both so-called degenerate and non-degenerate $f(R)$ models embedded in maximally-symmetric backgrounds. We find that the linearised spectrum of degenerate models on these backgrounds is empty, lacking both the graviton and scalaron modes which appear in generic non-degenerate models. Our work generalises previous results in the literature applicable only to the specific (degenerate) model $f(R)=\alpha R^2$; in fact, we find that the same pathologies discovered therein emerge for all choices of $f(R)$ belonging to the wide class of degenerate models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a recently developed spectral method to obtain the spectrum of quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes in alternative theories of gravity and apply it to the black holes of shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory. In this theory the quasinormal modes were recently obtained by employing perturbation theory in quadratic order in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. Here we present the full non-perturbative results for the spectrum within the domain of existence of rotating black holes and compare with the perturbative results. We also compare with the quasinormal mode spectrum of rapidly rotating Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet black holes.</description>

Abstract: Identifying a full basis of operators to a given order is key to the generality of Effective Field Theory (EFT) and is by now a problem of known solution in terms of the Hilbert series. The present work is concerned with hidden symmetry in general and Higgs EFT in particular and {\it(i)} connects the counting formula presented in [1] in the CCWZ formulation with the linear frame and makes this connection explicit in HEFT {\it (ii)} outlines the differences in perturbation theory in each frame {\it (iii)} presents a new counting formula with measure in the full $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$ group for HEFT and {\it (iv)} provides a Mathematica code that produces the number of operators at the user-specified order in HEFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially chiral stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds can arise from various processes in the early Universe. The gravitational ABJ anomaly links the chirality of the gravitational field to the chiral fermions, resulting in the stochastic generation of fermionic matter in the radiation era. We show that this mechanism can account for the entire dark matter relic density and discuss its potential as a leptogenesis scenario to explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Remarkably, this letter reveals that even if gravitational waves become unpolarized later, their temporary chirality during their generation process leaves a lasting imprint on the fermionic matter, preserved as a quantum remnant.</description>

      <title>A glitch in gravity: cosmic Lorentz-violation from fiery Big Bang to glacial heat death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One regime where we might see departures from general relativity is at the largest accessible scales, with a natural choice in cosmology being the cosmological horizon (or Hubble) scale. We investigate a single-parameter extension to the standard cosmological model with a different strength of gravity above and below this scale -- a "cosmic glitch" in gravity. Cosmic microwave background observations, and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (including the recent DESI Y1) favour weaker superhorizon gravity, at nearly a percent (or 2$\sigma$ level), easing both the Hubble and clustering tensions with other cosmological data. This compounds evidence for an even stronger glitch during Big Bang nucleosynthesis (from helium abundance observations), suggesting that symmetries of general relativity are maximally violated at the Big Bang, but gradually recovered as we approach the present-day cosmological de Sitter scale, associated with the observed dark energy.</description>

      <title>Axionic quantum criticality of generalized Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a field theoretic description for $d$-dimensional interacting nodal semimetals, featuring dispersion that scales with the linear ($n$th) power of momentum along $d_L$ ($d_M$) mutually orthogonal directions around a few isolated points in the reciprocal space with $d_L+d_M=d$, and residing at the brink of isotropic insulation, described by $N_b$-component bosonic order parameter fields. The resulting renormalization group (RG) procedure, tailored to capture the associated quantum critical phenomena, is controlled by a `small' parameter $\epsilon=2-d_M$ and $1/N_f$, where $N_f$ is the number of identical fermion copies (flavor number). When applied to three-dimensional interacting general Weyl semimetals ($d_L=1$ and $d_M=2$), characterized by the Abelian monopole charge $n&gt;1$, living at the shore of the axionic insulation ($N_b=2$), a leading order RG analysis suggests Gaussian nature of the underlying quantum phase transition, around which the critical exponents assume mean-field values. A traditional field theoretic RG analysis yields same outcomes for simple Weyl semimetals ($n=1$, $d_L=3$, and $d_M=0$). Consequently, emergent marginal Fermi liquids showcase only logarithmic corrections to physical observables at intermediate scales of measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defining gravitational subsystems has long been challenging due to the lack of the conventional notion of locality in gravity. In this work, we define gravitational subsystems from the observable spacetime subregions of a set of well-defined accelerating observers. We study the most general horizons of accelerating observers and find that in a general spacetime, only spacelike surfaces satisfying a global condition could become horizons of well-defined accelerating observers, which we name the Rindler-convexity condition. The entanglement entropy associated with a Rindler-convex region is proportional to the area of the enclosing surface. The subregions defined from this observer perspective is named the generalized Rindler wedge. This provides a physical origin for defining gravitational subsystems associated with one type of Type III von Neumann subalgebra. We propose the holographic interpretation of generalized Rindler wedges and provide evidence from the observer correspondence, the subregion subalgebra duality, and the equality of the entanglement entropy, respectively. We introduce time/space cutoffs in the bulk to substantiate this proposition, generalize it, and establish a holographic observer concordance framework, which asserts that the partitioning of degrees of freedom through observation is holographically concordant.</description>

      <title>Towards a unitary formulation of quantum field theory in curved space-time: the case of Schwarzschild black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10345v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the origin of unitarity violation and information loss paradox in our understanding of black holes (BH) lies in the standard way of doing quantum field theory in curved space-time (QFTCS), which is heavily biased on intuition borrowed from classical General Relativity. In this paper, with the quantum first approach, we formulate a so-called direct-sum QFT (DQFT) in BH space-time based on a novel formulation of discrete space-time transformations in gravity that potentially restores unitarity. By invoking the quantum effects associated with the gravitational backreaction, we show that the Hawking quanta emerging outside of the Schwarzschild radius ($r_S=2GM$) cannot be independent of the quanta that continue to be inside $r_S$. This enables the information to be carried by Hawking quanta, but in the BH DQFT formalism, we do not get any firewalls. Furthermore, DQFT leads to the BH evaporation involving only pure states. This means the quantum mechanical effects at the BH horizon produce two components of a maximally entangled pure state in geometric superselection sector Hilbert spaces. This construction enables pure states to evolve into pure states, restoring unitarity and observer complementarity. Finally, we discuss how our framework leaves important clues for formulating a scattering matrix and probing the nature of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>C-R-T Fractionalization, Fermions, and Mod 8 Periodicity</title>

Abstract: Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), time reversal (T), and fermion parity $(-1)^{\rm F}$ are basic discrete spacetime and internal symmetries of the Dirac fermions. In this article, we determine the group, called the C-R-T fractionalization, which is a group extension of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm C}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm R}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm T}$ by the fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$, and its extension class in all spacetime dimensions $d$, for a single-particle fermion theory. For Dirac fermions, with the canonical CRT symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm CRT}$, the C-R-T fractionalization has two possibilities that only depend on spacetime dimensions $d$ modulo 8, which are order-16 nonabelian groups, including the famous Pauli group. For Majorana fermions, we determine the R-T fractionalization in all spacetime dimensions $d=0,1,2,3,4\mod8$, an order-8 abelian or nonabelian group. For Weyl fermions, we determine the C or T fractionalization in all even spacetime dimensions $d$, which is an order-4 abelian group. We only have an order-2 $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$ group for Majorana-Weyl fermions. We determine the maximal number of linearly independent Dirac and Majorana mass terms and construct them explicitly. We also discuss how the conventional Dirac and Majorana mass terms break the symmetries C, R, or T. We study the domain wall dimensional reduction of the fermions and their C-R-T fractionalization: from $d$-dim Dirac to $(d-1)$-dim Dirac or Weyl and from $d$-dim Majorana to $(d-1)$-dim Majorana or Majorana-Weyl.</description>

      <title>Weyl cohomology and the conformal anomaly in the presence of torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using cohomological methods, we identify both trivial and nontrivial contributions to the conformal anomaly in the presence of vectorial torsion in $d=2,4$ dimensions. In both cases, our analysis considers two scenarios: one in which the torsion vector transforms in an affine way, i.e., it is a gauge potential for Weyl transformations, and the other in which it is invariant under the Weyl group. An important outcome for the former case in both $d=2,4$ is the presence of anomalies of a "mixed" nature in relation to the classification of Deser and Schwimmer. For invariant torsion in $d=4$, we also find a new type of anomaly which we dub $\Psi$-anomaly. Taking these results into account, we integrate the different anomalies to obtain renormalized anomalous effective actions. Thereafter, we recast such actions in the covariant nonlocal and local forms, the latter being easier to work with. Along the way, we pause to comment on the physical usefulness of these effective actions, in particular to obtain renormalized energy-momentum tensors and thermodynamics of $2d$ black holes.</description>

      <title>Local Description of Decoherence of Quantum Superpositions by Black Holes and Other Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was previously shown that if an experimenter, Alice, puts a massive or charged body in a quantum spatial superposition, then the presence of a black hole (or more generally any Killing horizon) will eventually decohere the superposition [arXiv:2205.06279, arXiv:2301.00026, arXiv:2311.11461]. This decoherence was identified as resulting from the radiation of soft photons/gravitons through the horizon, thus suggesting that the global structure of the spacetime is essential for describing the decoherence. In this paper, we show that the decoherence can alternatively be described in terms of the local two-point function of the quantum field within Alice's lab, without any direct reference to the horizon. From this point of view, the decoherence of Alice's superposition in the presence of a black hole arises from the extremely low frequency Hawking quanta present in Alice's lab. We explicitly calculate the decoherence occurring in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Unruh vacuum from the local viewpoint. We then use this viewpoint to elucidate (i) the differences in decoherence effects that would occur in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Boulware and Hartle-Hawking vacua; (ii) the difference in decoherence effects that would occur in Minkowski spacetime filled with a thermal bath as compared with Schwarzschild spacetime; (iii) the lack of decoherence in the spacetime of a static star even though the vacuum state outside the star is similar in many respects to the Boulware vacuum around a black hole; and (iv) the requirements on the degrees of freedom of a material body needed to produce a decoherence effect that mimics that of a black hole.</description>

      <title>On the localized and delocalized modes in kink-antikink interactions: a toy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study deals with a piecewise $\phi^2$ scalar field theory in $(1+1)$ dimensions. The scalar field potential is designed with a triple-well shape, engendering kink solutions with asymmetric square-well linearized potentials. Thus, the localized and delocalized modes in this model can be obtained analytically in terms of transcendental equations. This allows us to explore kink-antikink and antikink-kink collisions with any desired number of localized and delocalized modes. We obtain new scenarios of resonance windows suppression, shedding light on the role of higher excited modes in kink scattering.</description>

      <title>Type II orientifold flux vacua in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of type II orientifold flux vacua in three dimensions including gauge and metric fluxes, O-planes and D-branes. We derive simple flux models (we dub them RSTU-models) that admit a description in terms of gauged supergravities with half-maximal $\,\mathcal{N}=8\,$ supersymmetry in three dimensions. As a landscape appetizer, we present various multi-parametric families of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric AdS$_{3}$ and Mkw$_{3}$ vacua. Remarkably, negative masses turn out to be always absent in the spectrum of scalar fluctuations, thus making all the vacua perturbatively stable within half-maximal supergravity. We provide examples of non-supersymmetric type IIB AdS$_{3}$ flux vacua which feature parametrically-controlled scale separation and come along with integer-valued conformal dimensions of the would-be dual CFT$_{2}$ operators. We also comment on the implications of our results in light of the Swampland Program.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by gauged supergravities, we consider gravitational systems coupled to arbitrary numbers of fluxes and scalar fields. We show that simple ansatze for asymptotically AdS solutions in these systems fully determine the potential for the scalars, and we construct the black hole geometries which generalize the solutions known in gauged supergravities to an arbitrary number of dimensions. We also construct branes and brane intersections supported by an arbitrary number of higher-form fluxes and a correlated number of scalars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AdS/QCD models are being extensively studied because they seem to offer an entirely tractable and radically different approach to the phases of QCD whose region of validity is precisely the region of strong interactions. In this context, a missing ingredient has been the absence of a bulk description dual to a confined hadronic phase at finite baryon density. In this work, we discuss a class of backgrounds that fill this lacuna. Applying physically motivated boundary conditions, we obtain phase diagrams which compare reasonably with approaches based on the PNJL model. We also show that such backgrounds can play a similar role in geometries with a dilaton field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate $ \mathcal{O}\left( r^N \right) $ asymptotic symmetries for a two-form gauge field in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. By employing symplectic renormalization, we identify $ N $ independent asymptotic charges, with each charge being parametrised by an arbitrary function of the angular variables. Working in Lorenz gauge, the gauge parameters require a radial expansion involving logarithmic (subleading) terms to ensure nontrivial angular dependence at leading order. At the same time, we adopt a setup where the field strength admits a power expansion, allowing logarithms in the gauge field expansions within pure gauge sectors. The same setup is studied for electromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Holographic Renyi entropy of 2d CFT in KdV generalized ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19271v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in chaotic two dimensional CFTs is subtle due to infinitely many conserved KdV charges. Previous works have demonstrated that primary CFT eigenstates have flat entanglement spectrum, which is very different from the microcanonical ensemble. This result is an apparent contradiction to conventional ETH, which does not take KdV charges into account. In a companion paper \cite{KdVETHgeneral}, we resolve this discrepancy by studying the subsystem entropy of a chaotic CFT in KdV-generalized Gibbs and microcanonical ensembles. In this paper, we carry out parallel computations in the context of AdS/CFT. We focus on the high density limit, which is equivalent to thermodynamic limit in conformal theories. In this limit holographic Renyi entropy can be computed using the so-called gluing construction. We explicitly study the KdV-generalized microcanonical ensemble with the densities of the first two KdV charges $\langle \mathcal{Q}_1\rangle = q_1,\langle \mathcal{Q}_3\rangle = q_3$ fixed and obeying $q_3-q_1^2 \ll q_1^2$. In this regime we found that the refined Renyi entropy $\tilde{S}_n$ is $n$-independent for $n&gt;n_{cut}$, where $n_{cut}$ depends on $q_1,q_3$. By taking the primary state limit $q_3\to q_1^2$, we recover flat entanglement spectrum characteristic of fixed-area states, in agreement with the primary state behavior. This provides a consistency check of the KdV-generalized ETH in 2d CFTs.</description>

Abstract: The saddle point approximation to formal quantum gravitational partition functions has yielded plausible computations of horizon entropy in various settings, but it stands on shaky ground. In this paper we visit some of that shaky ground, address some foundational questions, and describe efforts toward a more solid footing. We focus on the case of de Sitter horizon entropy which, it has been argued, corresponds to the dimension of the Hilbert space of a ball of space surrounded by the cosmological horizon.</description>

Abstract: To construct higher-dimensional counterparts of the Kerr-Newman black holes, we consider Einstein's equations sourced by a vector field and a negative cosmological constant. In contrast to the four-dimensional case, the Maxwell's equations are modified by sources generated by topological Chern-Simons couplings, the situation already encountered in the minimal five dimensional supergravity. After constructing explicit geometries in all odd dimensions, we demonstrate that the Klein-Gordon equation on the new backgrounds is fully separable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17591v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive soft theorems for on-shell scattering amplitudes from non-linearly realised global space-time symmetries, arising from the flat space and decoupling limits of the effective field theories (EFTs) of inflation, while taking particular care of on-shell limits, soft limits, time-ordered correlations, momentum derivatives, energy-momentum conserving delta functions and $i\varepsilon$ prescriptions. Intriguingly, contrary to common belief, we find with a preferred soft hierarchy among the soft momentum $q$, on-shell residue $p_a^0 \pm E_a$, and $\varepsilon$, the soft theorems do not have dependence on off-shell interactions, even in the presence of cubic vertices. We also argue that the soft hierarchy is a natural choice, ensuring the soft limit and on-shell limit commute. Our soft theorems depend solely on on-shell data and hold to all orders in perturbation theory. We present various examples including polynomial shift symmetries, non-linear realisation of Lorentz boosts and dilatations on how the soft theorems work. We find that the collection of exchange diagrams, where the soft momentum is associated with a cubic vertex, exhibits an enhanced soft scaling. The enhanced soft scaling explains why the sum of such diagrams do not enter the soft theorems non-trivially. We further apply the soft theorems to bootstrap the scattering amplitudes of the superfluid and scaling superfluid EFTs, finding agreement with the Hamiltonian analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain exact expressions for correlation functions of charged scalar operators at finite density and low temperature in CFT$_4$ dual to the RN-AdS$_5$ black brane. We use recent developments in the Heun connection problem in black hole perturbation theory arising from Liouville CFT and the AGT correspondence. The connection problem is solved perturbatively in an instanton counting parameter, which is controlled in a double-scaling limit where $\omega, T \to 0$ holding $\omega/T$ fixed. This provides analytic control over the emergence of the zero temperature branch cut as a confluent limit of the Heun equation. From the Green's function we extract analytic results for the critical temperature of the holographic superconductor, as well as dispersion relations for both gapped and gapless low temperature quasinormal modes. We demonstrate precise agreement with numerics.</description>

Abstract: {In 1+1 dimensional conformal field theory with a boundary the boundary contribution to the entanglement entropy is determined by a single number $g$ effectively counting the boundary degrees of freedom. In contrast, in 1+1 dimensional interface CFTs the corresponding quantity is a non-trivial {\it function} depending on the position of the interval relative to the interface, giving access to much more detailed information about the defect. In this work we determined this $g$-function in several examples using holography and derive some of its basic properties from holography and strong subadditivity.</description>

Abstract: We present two explicit expressions for generic singular vectors of type $(r,s)$ of the Virasoro algebra. These results follow from the paper of Bauer et al which presented recursive methods to construct the vectors. The expressions presented here generalise the results of Benoit-Saint Aubin for the type $(1,s)$ singular vectors in two different ways: the first simply solves the recursion through the use of partitions; the second gives explicit formulae for the coefficients in a particular expansion. A Mathematica notebook is available which implements the formulae.</description>

Abstract: We consider a string on a Jordanian deformation of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ spacetime. This model belongs to the larger class of Homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformations, which preserve classical integrability in the sense that one can construct an explicit Lax connection. To study the scattering of bosonic worldsheet excitations, we fix light-cone gauge and expand around a pointlike classical solution that reduces to the BMN vacuum in the undeformed limit. Our analysis shows that the light-cone gauge-fixed Hamiltonian, under a perturbative field expansion, includes cubic terms that give rise to non-trivial cubic processes for physical particles. We discuss this unexpected result in relation to the property of Lax integrability of the sigma-model.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are those which may have formed in the early Universe and affected the subsequent evolution of the Universe through their Hawking radiation and gravitational field. To constrain the early Universe from the observational constraint on the abundance of PBHs, it is essential to determine the formation threshold for primordial cosmological fluctuations, which are naturally described by cosmological long-wavelength solutions. I will briefly review our recent analytical and numerical results on the PBH formation.</description>

Abstract: Recently, with the upgradation of LHC, it is realized that study of heavy-flavored hadrons, namely $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ and $\rm{D}^{0}$ in hadronic collisions, could reveal the possibility of thermalization of charm quarks. With this motivation, we study the production dynamics of these hadrons using a pQCD-inspired Monte Carlo event generator called PYTHIA8 in proton+proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The production dynamics of these hadrons are analyzed through charged-particle multiplicity, transverse momentum, and pseudorapidity. With the help of the established PYTHIA8 tunes to mimic the behavior of flow-like features, we investigated the variation of effective temperature and degree of non-extensivity using thermodynamically consistent non-extensive Tsallis statistics. We further attempted to establish a connection between the initial state and final state by estimating the correlation between the number of multi-partonic interactions ($\rm{n}_{MPI}$) with the Knudsen number.</description>

      <title>A healthier semi-classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the back-reaction of quantum systems onto classical ones. Taking the starting point that semi-classical physics should be described at all times by a point in classical phase space and a quantum state in Hilbert space, we consider an unravelling approach, describing the system in terms of a classical-quantum trajectory. We derive the general form of the dynamics under the assumptions that the classical trajectories are continuous and the evolution is autonomous, and the requirement that the dynamics is linear and completely positive in the combined classical-quantum state. This requirement is necessary in order to consistently describe probabilities, and forces the dynamics to be stochastic when the back-reaction is non-zero. The resulting equations of motion are natural generalisations of the standard semi-classical equations of motion, but since the resulting dynamics is linear in the combined classical-quantum state, it does not lead to the pathologies which usually follow from evolution laws based on expectation values. In particular, the evolution laws we present account for correlations between the classical and quantum system, which resolves issues associated with other semi-classical approaches. In addition, despite a breakdown of predictability in the classical degrees of freedom, the quantum state evolves deterministically conditioned on the classical trajectory, provided a trade-off between decoherence and diffusion is saturated. As a result, the quantum state remains pure when conditioned on the classical trajectory. To illustrate these points, we numerically simulate a number of semi-classical toy models, including one of vacuum fluctuations as a source driving the expansion of the universe. Finally, we discuss the application of these results to semi-classical gravity, and the black-hole information problem.</description>

      <title>Theory-independent randomness generation from spatial symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize how the response of physical systems to spatial rotations constrains the probabilities of events that may be observed. From a foundational point of view, we show that the set of quantum correlations in our scenarios can be derived from rotational symmetry alone, without assuming quantum physics. This shows that important predictions of quantum theory can be derived from the structure of space, demonstrating that semi-device-independent scenarios can be utilized to shed light on the foundations of physics. From a practical perspective, these results allow us to introduce semi-device-independent protocols for the generation of secure random numbers based on the breaking of spatial symmetries. While experimental implementations will rely on quantum physics, the security analysis and the amount of extracted randomness is theory-independent and certified by the observed correlations only. That is, our protocols rely on a physically meaningful assumption: a bound on a theory-independent notion of spin.</description>

      <title>On the structural stability of a simple cosmological model in $R+\alpha R^{2}$ theory of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of gravity with a quadratic contribution of scalar curvature is investigated using a dynamical systems approach. The simplest Friedmann--Robertson--Walker metric is employed to formulate the dynamics in both the Jordan frame and the conformally transformed Einstein frame. We show that, in both frames, there are stable de Sitter states where the expansion of the Hubble function naturally includes terms corresponding to an effective dark matter component. Using the invariant center manifold, we demonstrate that, in the Einstein frame, there exists a zero-measure set of initial conditions that lead from an unstable to a stable de Sitter state. Additionally, the initial de Sitter state is associated with a parallelly propagated singularity. We show that the formulations of the theory in the Jordan frame and the Einstein frame are physically nonequivalent.</description>

      <title>Tau functions from Joyce structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argued in the paper "Geometry from Donaldson-Thomas invariants" that, when a certain sub-exponential growth property holds, the Donaldson-Thomas invariants of a 3-Calabi-Yau triangulated category should define a geometric structure on its space of stability conditions. In this paper we show how to associate a generating function to these geometric structures which we call the tau function. In the case of the derived category of the resolved conifold, this function reproduces the non-perturbative topological string partition function introduced in the paper "Riemann-Hilbert problems for the resolved conifold". In the case of the derived category of the A2 quiver it is the Painleve I tau function. The definition of the tau-function depends on certain choices of additional data which we discuss in the paper. There is still much to understand!</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various monoidal categories, including suitable representation categories of vertex operator algebras, admit natural Grothendieck-Verdier duality structures. We recall that such a Grothendieck-Verdier category comes with two tensor products which should be related by distributors obeying pentagon identities. We discuss in which circumstances these distributors are isomorphisms. This is achieved by taking the perspective of module categories over monoidal categories, using in particular the natural weak module functor structure of internal Homs and internal coHoms. As an illustration, we exhibit these concepts concretely in the case of categories of bimodules over associative algebras.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of the gravitational scattering in the absence of peeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symmetries of the gravitational scattering are intimately tied to the symmetries which preserve asymptotic flatness at null infinity. In Penrose's definition of asymptotic flatness, a central role is played by the notion of asymptotic simplicity and the ensuing peeling behavior which dictates the decay rate of the Weyl tensor. However, there is now accumulating evidence that in a generic gravitational scattering the peeling property is broken, so that the spacetime is not asymptotically-flat in the usual sense. These obstructions to peeling can be traced back to the existence of universal radiative low frequency observables called "tails to the displacement memory". The universality of these tail modes is the statement of the classical logarithmic soft graviton theorem of Sahoo, Saha and Sen. Four-dimensional gravitation scattering therefore exhibits a rich infrared interplay between tail to the memory, loss of peeling, and universal logarithmic soft theorems. In this paper we study the solution space and the asymptotic symmetries for logarithmically-asymptotically-flat spacetimes. These are defined by a polyhomogeneous expansion of the Bondi metric which gives rise to a loss of peeling, and represent the classical arena which can accommodate a generic gravitational scattering containing tails to the memory. We show that while the codimension-two generalized BMS charges are sensitive to the loss of peeling at $\mathcal{I}^+$, the flux is insensitive to the fate of peeling. Due to the tail to the memory, the soft superrotation flux contains a logarithmic divergence whose coefficient is the quantity which is conserved in the scattering by virtue of the logarithmic soft theorem. In our analysis we also exhibit new logarithmic evolution equations and flux-balance laws, whose presence suggests the existence of an infinite tower of subleading logarithmic soft graviton theorems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and phase transition of Bardeen-AdS-class black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a generalized parameter space, regular black holes can be regarded as non-singular solutions under specific parameters in Einstein gravity theory coupled with non-linear electromagnetic fields. Following this concept, we investigate the thermodynamic states and phase transitions of Bardeen-AdS-class black holes, revealing that the system can be classified into two categories, Type I and Type II, based on whether it adopts a pure Bardeen-AdS spacetime without event horizons or a Bardeen-AdS black hole as its phase state, each exhibiting distinct thermodynamic properties. If one includes the Bardeen-AdS black holes in the system (Type I), there will be three distinct black hole states and the phase transitions between them are analogous to the Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black holes. On the other hand, if the pure Bardeen-AdS spacetime is included (Type II), an additional tiny black hole state emerges. A phase transition reminiscent of the Hawking-Page transition was found. Significantly, in this scenario, thermodynamical characteristic curves exhibit discontinuous behavior, which attributes to the multiple horizons. The presence of a Bardeen-AdS black hole within the phase structure of the Bardeen-AdS-class black hole profoundly modifies the thermodynamical properties of the system, highlighting the novel aspects of regular black holes.</description>

      <title>Delving into the Phenomenology of Very Special Relativity: From Subatomic Particles to Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we investigate the implications of Lorentz-violating (LV) theories, focusing on Very Special Relativity (VSR) and its phenomenological consequences. Initially presented as an alternative mechanism for neutrino masses, VSR has since become a significant part of the general LV framework, distinguished by its unique group structure and non-local operators. After a comprehensive introduction to the principles of LV and VSR, we present the corresponding modifications to the Dirac equation. A significant part of the thesis is dedicated to the development of a Hamiltonian formalism within the VSR context, addressing its inherent non-localities. This approach is further extended to the non-relativistic limit, connecting it to the conventional Schr\"odinger picture. We then set upper bounds on the VSR parameters by examining its corrections to a wide range of physical systems and scenarios, such as Landau levels of charged particles, the $\mathsf g-$factor of electrons, the energy spectrum of ultracold neutrons in Earth's gravitational field, and the gravitational emission from binary stars. The latter analysis led us to the construction of a VSR field theory for spin-2 fields in flat space, which was surprisingly found to accommodate a gauge-invariant graviton mass. Through this comprehensive study, we bridged theoretical predictions with experimental data, paving the way for future explorations in Lorentz-violating theories and highlighting their potential to address unresolved questions in modern physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the functional renormalization group (FRG) under the local potential approximation, we analyze the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in the relativistic complex scalar theory. This framework leads to a complex flow equation of the effective potential, even with the well-known Litim regulator. In order to evaluate the condensate from such a complex effective potential, we impose a condition between chemical potential and mass, analogously to those in the free theory or the mean field theory. We elucidate that for the strongly (weakly) coupled theory, the phase diagrams computed from the FRG are more (less) deviated from that under the mean field approximation. This result implies that quantum fluctuations strongly affect the nonperturbative formation of the BEC.</description>

      <title>Newman-Penrose formalism and exact vacuum solutions to conformal Weyl gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the exterior solution for a static, spherically symmetric source in Weyl conformal gravity in terms of the Newman--Penrose formalism. We first show that both the static, uncharged black hole solution of Mannheim and Kazanas and the static, charged Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m-like solution can be found more easily in this formalism than in the traditional coordinate-basis approach, where the metric tensor components are taken as the basic variables. Second, we show that the Newman-Penrose formalism offers a particularly convenient framework that is well suited for the discussion of conformal gravity solutions corresponding to Petrov "type-D" spacetimes. This is illustrated with a two-parameter class of wormhole solutions that includes the Ellis--Bronnikov wormhole solution of Einstein's gravity as a limiting case. Other salient issues, such as the gauge equivalence of solutions and the inclusion of the electromagnetic field are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We consider an extension of the Standard Model with one or more scalar multiplets beyond the Higgs doublet $\Phi$. The additional scalar multiplets are supposed to carry arbitrary hypercharges. We prove that, in such a model, if the field configuration where only $\Phi$ has a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) is a local minimum of the potential, then it has a lower value of the potential than any field configuration where both $\Phi$ and other scalar multiplets have nonzero VEVs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a diffeomorphism-invariant formulation of differential entropy in Riemannian spaces, addressing the lack of an observer-independent notion of information for continuous variables in physical space. We extend this formulation to the quantum level by generalizing Wigner's quasiprobability density function to arbitrary Riemannian spaces and analytically continuing Shannon's differential entropy formula to incorporate contributions from intermediate virtual quantum states. We demonstrate this framework by computing the quantum phase space entropy of the harmonic oscillator in Minkowski and anti-de Sitter geometries. Additionally, we derive a generalized quantum entropic uncertainty relation, extending the Bialynicki-Birula and Mycielski inequality to curved spaces. Our work bridges concepts from information theory, geometry, and quantum physics to study quantum information in continuous and curved sample spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and analyse wormhole solutions in quantised space-time. The field equations are constructed from the deformed wormhole metric in the proper reference frame using tetrads. The spatial geometry of the wormhole is analysed in the kappa space-time. Further, the modifications to the conditions that ensure traversibility of the wormhole are studied and it is found that the necessity of the exotic matter persists in the non-commuative case as in the commutative space-time. Casimir energy is considered a possible source for exotic matter and it is shown that the time to pass through the wormhole as well as the amount of exotic matter required to create the wormhole reduce due to non-commutativity of space-time.</description>
