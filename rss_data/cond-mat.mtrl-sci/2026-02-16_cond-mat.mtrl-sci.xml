      <title>Investigating the Electronic and Magnetic Properties of Na$_x$Fe$_{1/2}$Mn$_{1/2}$O$_2$ Cathode Materials with X-ray Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss electronic and magnetic properties of Na$_x$Fe$_{1/2}$Mn$_{1/2}$O$_2$, a promising Na-ion battery cathode material. Using x-ray Compton scattering, SQUID magnetometry, and density-functional-theory based modeling, we probe how electrons and spins evolve during sodiation. By comparing Compton profiles of sodiated and desodiated samples, we show that oxygen 2$p$ orbitals drive the redox process, while transition-metal 3$d$ electrons become more delocalized, explaining the metallic phase at $x=2/3$. These profile differences define a quantitative descriptor for the sodiation range associated with improved conductivity. Electron holes on oxygen, reflected in oxygen magnetization, confirm the important role of oxygen in the electrochemical activity of the cathode.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Spin-Splitting Induced by Spin-Orbit Coupling in Non-magnetic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) leads to splitting of otherwise spin-degenerate bands in noncentrosymmetric materials, even if time-reversal symmetry is present. While this gives rise to well-known phenomena such as the Rashba and Dresselhaus effects, various other terms are allowed based on the point group of the crystal and the electronic Hamiltonian. In this study, we utilize point group representations to illustrate that four different types of SOC terms (Rashba, Dresselhaus, Weyl, and Ising) can emerge in periodic solids. We construct reciprocal space energy expressions for each type of SOC-induced splitting of opposite spin bands, and follow a similar procedure to also obtain minimal tight-binding models that capture all types of spin-splittings for subgroups of the cubic parent group $m\bar{3}m$. Furthermore, we also obtain a complete list of nodal features in the electronic band structure in these systems, distinguishing between crystallographic-symmetry-imposed nodal lines and those imposed by time-reversal-symmetry only. Finally, we conclude by presenting a list of materials that host each type of inversion-breaking SOC effects. Our classification of the spin-splitting symmetries in non-magnetic systems with SOC is the counterpart of the recent classification of spin-splitting symmetries in unconventional magnetic systems without SOC, such as altermagnets and odd-parity magnets. More broadly, our work provides a basis for studying superconductivity and other collective electronic phenomena that are impacted by SOC-induced band splittings in noncentrosymmetric materials.</description>

      <title>A Transformer-based Model for Rapid Microstructure Inference from Four-Dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties of crystalline materials are closely linked to microstructure arising from the spatial arrangement, orientation, and phase of nanocrystals. Rapid characterization of crystalline microstructure can accelerate the identification of these links and the development of materials with desired properties. Here, we combine a machine learning framework with four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to enable fast inference of crystalline microstructure over large fields of view. The framework employs a transformer-based architecture to predict crystallographic orientations and phases from 4D-STEM diffraction patterns, yielding spatially resolved maps of microstructural features at the nanoscale. With this framework, crystallographic orientations are inferred up to two orders of magnitude faster than widely used correlative template-matching approaches. This capability enables high-throughput characterization of complex crystalline materials and facilitates the establishment of structure-property relationships central to materials design and optimization.</description>

      <title>A variational critical-state theory of friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friction plays a fundamental role in many natural processes, including earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic eruptions. Earthquakes occur when highly compressed fault surfaces accumulate large enough shear stresses, causing the faults to move relative to one another, or slip. The slip is accommodated within a thin layer of comminuted granular material -- called fault gouge -- between the fault surfaces. As a result, characterizing the mechanical behavior of fault gouge in response to shear is a major open problem in earthquake source physics. Modeling gouge is complicated by large deformations, inelasticity, rate dependence, and volumetric changes. As such, researchers typically rely on empirical formulations to capture the effective response. Here, we systematically develop a variational, finite-kinematics framework for fault gouge. We first describe a general theory for a rigid-viscoplastic, pressure-sensitive material, where the plasticity evolution follows from the principle of maximum dissipation. Then, we specialize the governing equations for a Cam-Clay material within a shearing and dilating layer. We rely on convexity considerations and experimental observations from consolidation tests of granular layers to calibrate the model and develop explicit solutions for the rate- and state- dependent response of the model to shear tests under constant compressive normal stress and prescribed shearing rate. To validate the model, we select common rate functions and compare numerical material point tests and theoretical solutions to standard laboratory experiments of shearing granular layers. Lastly, we discuss connections of the model to empirical rate-and-state friction laws.</description>

      <title>Re-evaluating photoluminescent defects in Cu$_2$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cuprous oxide (Cu$_2$O) is of interest for several technologies, including solar cells, and more recently, quantum devices via Rydberg excitons. It's performance in these capacities is strongly affected by defects in the crystal. The current best diagnostic for the presence of defects in a sample is the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum, which shows a number of strong lines at energies below the band gap, with brightnesses dependent on the sample. However, the assignment of PL lines to particular defects has not been substantiated by modern theory. Using density functional theory (DFT), we investigate from first principles which native defects introduce electronic states within the Cu$_2$O band gap, and therefore would produce lines in the PL spectrum. We find that the accepted assignments of lines to simple oxygen and copper vacancies are unsupported, and propose a new assignment based on oxygen and copper interstitials, and (one of the possible) split copper vacancies, a significant step towards the use of PL as a diagnostic tool for Cu$_2$O crystal growth.</description>

      <title>Mechanism-driven CO2 Capture and Activation on Two-dimensional Transition-metal Diborides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The urgent need to mitigate rising atmospheric CO2 levels motivates the search for stable, efficient, and tunable adsorbent materials. In this study, we employ first-principles density functional theory to investigate the adsorption of CO2 molecules on two-dimensional hexagonal transition-metal diboride monolayers, M2B2 (M = Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Nb). The adsorption energies, structural distortions, and bonding characteristics are systematically analyzed to understand how the metal center governs CO2 activation. The calculated adsorption energies range from -1.84 to -2.16 eV (or -1.98 to -4.42 eV), with Ti2B2 and Sc2B2 exhibiting the strongest CO2 binding, while Y2B2, Zr2B2, and Nb2B2 show moderately strong chemisorption. Adsorption induces significant molecular activation, evidenced by elongated C-O bonds (1.27-1.29 Angstrom) and bent O-C-O angles (129-132 degrees), compared to the linear gas-phase configuration (1.17 Angstrom, 180 degrees). Charge analysis further reveals substantial electron transfer from the monolayer to CO2, consistent with strong chemisorption and structural deformation. Correspondingly, the shift toward less negative IpCOHP(Ef) values indicates a pronounced weakening of the internal C-O bonds, reflecting increased population of antibonding pi* orbitals. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that the activated CO2 species is thermally sensitive: while most M2B2 surfaces retain stable adsorption at 300 K, Ti2B2 drives spontaneous CO2 dissociation into CO and O, revealing a temperature-assisted activation pathway. These findings highlight how the choice of transition metal tunes electronic interactions, adsorption energetics, and activation pathways on M2B2 surfaces. Overall, this work identifies two-dimensional transition-metal diborides as promising candidates for next-generation CO2 capture and activation technologies.</description>

      <title>Strain-enhanced edge ferromagnetism and bipolar magnetic semiconducting behavior in Janus graphene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first-principles density functional theory and determinant quantum Monte Carlo methods, we show that Janus graphene nanoribbons with topological defect arrays ($m=2$) exhibit robust intrinsic ferromagnetism across widths $W=2-6$, with bandgaps exceeding 200 $meV$ and stable ferromagnetic ground states. Notably, uniaxial tensile strain significantly enhances their ferromagnetic properties: at 25\% strain, the Curie temperature increases to $222K$, a fivefold improvement over unstrained systems and the highest reported for graphene-based nanoribbons. Strain also induces a reversible transition to a bipolar magnetic semiconductor, with spin-flipped valence and conduction band edges beyond 10\% strain. This dual functionality, strain-enhanced ferromagnetism and strain-induced spin flip, stems from strain-modulated $p_{z}$ orbital hybridization and strong direct exchange interaction. Among these, $W=5$ Janus graphene nanoribbons emerge as potential candidates for room-temperature spintronic devices and strain-programmable quantum transport systems.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Terahertz Photoconductivity Polarity Switching in High Entropy Nickelates with Implications for Photonic Synapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High entropy oxides (HEO) hold the potential to revolutionize the conventional material paradigms by leveraging high order of chemical disorder that induces highly desirable exotic phases for advanced applications. Here, we devise a methodology to enhance the efficiency of an artificial photonic synapse using a high entropy rare earth nickelate. Combined with epitaxial strain, we show that high entropy can further manipulate the phase of these locally disordered materials. Using time-averaged and time resolved Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy as dynamic probe, for the first time we show a rare combination of i) crystal axis dependent insulator to metal THz electronic phase transition and ii) coexistence of negative and positive THz photoconductivity at room temperature. Detailed analysis within theoretical models, including density functional theory (DFT)-based band structure calculations, suggest origin of these properties as disproportionate ordering of oxygen vacancies. Based on these findings, a conceptual THz-based artificial photonic synapse is proposed. This work underlines the pivotal role of HEO in advancing diverse THz functionalities, representing a critical step toward futuristic applications like THz-based high-speed computing and communication with an emphasis in THz frequency domain.</description>

      <title>Exploring Wetting and Optical Properties of CuAg Alloys via Surface Texture Morphology Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copper-silver (CuAg) alloys are increasingly explored for applications in high-performance electrical and electronic systems, owing to their unique combination of high electrical and thermal conductivity and enhanced mechanical strength. Nevertheless, a thorough understanding of how these alloys surface characteristics fundamentally influence properties remains largely underdeveloped. Here, we explored the complex interplay between surface texture morphology, layer composition, wetting, and optical properties of Cu, Ag, and CuAg thin films deposited on textured silicon substrates via magnetron sputtering. Employing data mining and machine learning techniques, we identified robust correlations between contact angle and surface fractal dimension across all layer types promoting Cassie-Baxter surface state formation. Our analysis revealed a significant connection between layer thickness and surface topography entropy deficit, suggesting a dynamic evolution of surface order/disorder during metal film growth. Furthermore, we observed that contact angle sensitivity to layer thickness implied a correlation with microstructure evolution. Through K-Means clustering, we successfully categorized the formed surface textures morphology. Finally, a Random Forest regression model was developed to accurately predict water contact angles (Mean Absolute Error around 5 deg) using only texture and optical parameters. The model, along with accompanying Python code, is publicly available. Our findings establish a pathway towards targeted surface texture morphology engineering for tailored material performance.</description>

      <title>The role of radiation-induced segregation in defect-phase formation in Ni-Ge and Ni-Si alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions between chemical phase fields and structural defects play a key role in the properties of alloys. We illustrate the importance of these interactions in driven alloys, where defects are continuously being created, with particular focus on systems where radiation-induced segregation occurs. Specifically, we compare the microstructural evolution in undersaturated Ni-Si and Ni-Ge alloys during both 100 keV He and 2 MeV Ti irradiations. While the equilibrium phase diagrams of these systems are similar, and both systems show strong radiation-induced segregation, the evolving defect structures are remarkably different. Ni-Si reveals a high density of Frank loops, while Ni-Ge shows a complex array of dislocations. Moreover, a Ni3Ge precipitate shell is observed to coat He bubbles, while no segregation of Si is observed at such bubbles. We explain these differences in behaviors to solute drag by interstitial fluxes in Ni-Si vs solute drag by vacancy fluxes in Ni-Ge.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Mn sticking coefficient on Ga-rich, N-rich, and Ga/N-flux-free conditions in GaN grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This brief report examines the influence of Ga/N flux conditions on Mn incorporation in GaN. Mn-doped GaN layers were grown at 680$^{\circ}$C by molecular beam epitaxy on a Ga-polar GaN(0001) template substrate under Ga-rich, N-rich, and no-flux conditions (i.e., Mn $\delta$ doping). Mn incorporation was highest under N-rich condition, lowest under Ga-rich condition, and intermediate in the absence of Ga and N fluxes. For the growth conditions examined in this study, the corresponding Mn sticking coefficients, relative to that of the N-rich condition, were determined to be 0.31 for no-flux growth and 0.01 for the Ga-rich growth.</description>

      <title>Interface-Driven Growth Mode Control of 2D GaSe on 3D GaAs Substrates with Distinct Crystallographic Orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies of the growth of two-dimensional (2D) gallium selenide (GaSe) by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on a gallium arsenide (GaAs) three-dimensional (3D) substrate have reported significant differences in growth morphology, polytype, and the nature of the interface. The results differ, ranging from GaSe 2D film growth at tilted 2D planes to observed spiral structures, thereby calling for a deeper understanding of the impact of the substrate interface on the growth of GaSe films. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive reexamination of the growth mechanism of GaSe on GaAs substrates with (211)B and (001)B orientations, investigating the nature of the 2D/3D interface and the resulting morphology of the 2D GaSe films. We do this by investigating different methods of preparation of the GaAs substrate surface before the growth of GaSe by MBE, the importance of which has not been considered before. Our results resolve the mechanistic origin of tilted versus non-tilted 2D growth and establish a general interface-driven orientation selection rule linking substrate symmetry and dangling-bond coordination to layered heteroepitaxy. This framework provides a scalable interface-engineering pathway for deterministic control of layered chalcogenide heterostructures and enables wafer-scale integration with established semiconductor device platforms.</description>

      <title>Molecular Beam Epitaxy of Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N Nanowires: Towards Group-III Nitride Piezoelectric Nanogenerators with Enhanced Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the molecular beam epitaxy of self-assembled Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N nanowires on conductive TiN layers and demonstrate their application in piezoelectric nanogenerators. Wurtzite Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N nanowires with uniform Sc incorporation are grown across a wide composition range (0&lt;x&lt;0.35). At substrate temperatures below 700 $^\circ{}$C, these nanowires exhibit an inversely tapered morphology, whereas higher temperatures favor the nucleation of additional branches due to a phase separation of Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N into wurtzite AlN and rock-salt ScN. Phase-pure Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N nanowires are integrated into vertical nanogenerators, where the metallic TiN substrate serves as bottom electrode. The fabricated polymer-nanowire composite devices achieve effective piezoelectric charge coefficients of up to 8.5 pC N$^{-1}$ at x=0.32, thus exceeding the piezoelectric response of bulk AlN by nearly a factor of two. Although the charge response remains lower compared to Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N thin films, the reduced effective dielectric permittivity of the nanowire-polymer composites compensates the reduction in piezoelectric charge coefficient, eventually yielding a higher voltage response and comparable energy harvesting efficiency. Finally, effective medium modeling reveals that the device architecture is the primary factor limiting performance, providing general design principles for highly efficient nanowire-based piezoelectric energy harvesters.</description>

      <title>High-Tc Superconductivity in Functionalized Out-of-Plane Ordered Double Transition Metal MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) superconductors attracted growing interest in condensed-matter physics research. In this work, we explore the superconducting properties of surface-functionalized, out-of-plane ordered double transition-metal MXenes (o-MXenes), which exhibit distinctive structural and electronic characteristics. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the effects of electronic structure, electron-phonon coupling (EPC), anharmonicity, and anisotropy effect in superconductivity properties of o-MXenes. We examine a wide range of o-MXene systems, M$_{2}$M$^\prime$X$_{2}$T$_{2}$ (M = Mo, W; M$^\prime$ = Sc, Ti, V, Mo, Zr, Nb, Ta; X = C, N), functionalized with F, O, Cl, and H groups. Out of 128 candidates, 32 compounds are found to be mechanically, dynamically, and thermodynamically stable, exhibiting superconducting transition temperatures (T$_{c}$) from 0.1 K to 52 K. Notably, the Mo$_{2}$ScN$_{2}$O$_{2}$ compound achieves the highest T$_{c}$ of 52 K, with a superconducting gap of $\sim$10 meV. Solving the anisotropic Eliashberg equation reveals that Mo$_{2}$ScN$_{2}$O$_{2}$ is an anisotropic two-gap superconductor, and incorporating anharmonic effects decreases its T$_{c}$ slightly. We further analyze flat-band-induced EPC enhancement and present EPC matrix elements as functions of phonon wavevector q for distinct vibrational modes that show anharmonic behavior of these materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fabricated a C60-based molecular spin photovoltaic device that integrated a photovoltaic response with the spin transport across the molecular layer. The photovoltaic response can be modified under the application of a small magnetic field, with a magnetophotovoltage of up to 5% at room temperature. Device functionalities include a magnetic current inverter and the presence of diverging magnetocurrent at certain illumination levels that could be useful for sensing. Completely spin-polarized currents could be created by balancing the external partially spin polarized injection with the photogenerated carriers.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Photoemission Predictions of Semiconducting Photocathodes from Many-Body Ab Initio Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of high-performance electron sources requires theoretical frameworks that accurately link the microscopic electronic properties of cathode materials to their macroscopic photoemission observables. Here, we present a many-body extension of the three-step photoemission model for semiconducting photocathodes, directly integrating the $GW$ approximation and the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation on top of density functional theory (DFT). This approach overcomes the intrinsic limitations of standard DFT by explicitly accounting for quasiparticle and excitonic effects in the photoexcitation process. The quantum efficiency (QE) is evaluated by combining the ab initio absorption with an emission probability derived as an exciton-weighted average. We validate this model on representative alkali antimonides and demonstrate that a qualitative many-body description successfully captures complex spectral features that empirical models fail to reproduce. Furthermore, by incorporating macroscopic optical effects such as thin-film interference and polarization via Fresnel post-processing, we achieve quantitative agreement with experimental QE values without any adjustment. Minor discrepancies near the photoemission threshold are attributed to the idealized surface barrier adopted in the model and impurity effects in the samples, highlighting specific directions for future refinements. This work establishes a robust, parameter-free ab initio tool that bridges microscopic electronic correlation with macroscopic observables, providing a critical pathway for the rational design of next-generation electron sources.</description>

      <title>Negative thermal expansion in ice I polytypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental properties of ice have always attracted a lot of interest due to omnipresence of ice in many different natural contexts. Since cubic ice recently become experimentally accessible from a low-density gas hydrate precursor [1, 2], it has been possible to measure its density as a function of temperature in the whole thermodynamic range of metastability. We found strong analogies with respect to the other ice I polytype, i.e., hexagonal ice Ih [3], including the presence of a negative thermal expansion behavior at low temperature. Based on these results, a new enthalpy calculation quantifies the metastable nature of the cubic form and, consequently its inaccessibility from a "normal" ice Ih precursor.</description>

      <title>Mystery of the 175 cm$^{-1}$ Raman Mode in MnTe Altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MnTe has recently attracted exceptional attention due to its well-established altermagnetism, prompting a thorough reexamination of its properties. In particular, it was found that a Raman-active excitation at ~175 cm$^{-1}$, routinely assigned to the E2g phonon, is incompatible with this interpretation. It was further hypothesized that this mode is a "leakage", due to symmetry lowering, of an otherwise forbidden phonon. Here, using first-principles calculations, we decisively rule out this hypothesis and propose an alternative interpretation that the "mystery mode" is an electronic excitation, i.e., a plasmon, enabled by hole self-doping. The resolution of this mystery will require additional experiments and shed new light on the nature of electronic transport in MnTe.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Glass-Structure Descriptors for Assessing the Intrinsic Reactivity of Mixed Amorphous-Crystalline Precursors in Alkali-Activated Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid and reliable assessment of the intrinsic reactivity of amorphous aluminosilicates is critical for their application in alkali-activated materials (AAMs) and blended cements. Although physics-informed glass-structure descriptors have demonstrated strong structure-reactivity relationships for predominantly amorphous systems, their extension to heterogeneous precursors with mixed crystalline-amorphous phases has been limited. Here, quantitative X-ray diffraction combined with bulk compositional analysis was used to reconstruct the effective amorphous compositions of five fly ashes (FAs) and three ground granulated blast-furnace slags (GGBSs). These compositions served as inputs for molecular dynamics simulations employing a melt-and-quench approach to generate atomic-scale structural models of the glassy phases. Based on these structures, the previously introduced descriptors, i.e., average metal oxygen dissociation energy and average metal oxygen bond strength, were refined to cover a broader compositional space spanning SiO2-Al2O3-TiO2-Fe2O3-CaO-MgO-MnO-Na2O-K2O. The refined descriptors exhibit strong inverse correlations with multiple independent reactivity indicators, including cumulative heat release from isothermal calorimetry, bound water content from thermogravimetric analysis, and compressive strength, for both single precursors and binary FA-GGBS blends activated with NaOH. These results demonstrate that physics-informed glass-structure descriptors can be extended from ideal amorphous systems to heterogeneous mixed-phase precursors and capture relative intrinsic reactivity trends in alkaline solutions. The proposed framework provides a transferable, structure-informed basis for comparative assessment of precursor reactivity that complements experimental testing and may inform precursor screening and mix designs for AAM and blended cement systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the origin of the capacity fade in MnO$_{2}$ zinc-ion battery cathodes through an analysis of the Mn vacancy formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently explored rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion battery (RAZIB) cathode materials, such as $\alpha$-MnO$_{2}$, suffer from severe capacity fade when cycling at rates appropriate for grid-scale operation. Mn dissolution has been previously identified as the cause of $\alpha$-MnO$_{2}$ cathode degradation during RAZIB cycling, with conflicting evidence being found in support of the proposed Jahn-Teller effect-assisted charge disproportionation reaction as the mechanism behind Mn dissolution. In order to unveil the Mn dissolution mechanism in MnO$_{2}$ cathode cells under RAZIB operation conditions, the energetic feasibility for Mn vacancy formation was probed in both charged (MnO$_{2}$) and discharged (ZnMn$_{2}$O$_{4}$) phases of $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ polymorphs of MnO$_{2}$ using density functional theory. The formation of a Mn vacancy, and consequently the dissolution of Mn as Mn$^{2+}_{(aq)}$, was found to be thermodynamically feasible for the $\alpha$-ZnMn$_{2}$O$_{4}$ phase due to the energetically unfavourable Zn bent coordination formed during the Zn$^{2+}$ intercalation process, indicating that Mn dissolution is promoted by an unstable Zn coordination environment. The theoretical calculations were then corroborated by operando $^{1}$H nuclear magnetic resonance experiments which captured the Mn dissolution occurring throughout the RAZIB discharge, with subsequent electrochemical deposition of the Mn atoms on the electrode during charge. The combined computational and experimental analysis reveals the critical role of defect energetics and coordination environment in driving active material dissolution, and consequently capacity fade, with the proposed mechanism also relevant for understanding cathode degradation in other intercalating ion battery chemistries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cornerstone of advanced materials design is establishing a framework for assembling nanoparticle superstructures with tailored symmetries. A longstanding challenge has been assembling diamond-like superstructures for photonic devices. Traditionally, such open superstructures require functionalized nanoparticles with directional or anisotropic interactions, reminiscent of valence bonding in a diamond. Here, we present a robust strategy for assembling valence-free nanoparticles into a broad array of cubic superstructures. By grafting nanoparticles with oppositely charged, end-functionalized water-soluble polymers of adjustable molecular weight, we gain control over electrostatic interactions and conformational constraints. This unified approach yields lattices analogous to rock salt, CsCl, zinc-blende, diamond, and the rare simple cubic phase, with tunable lattice constants. Theoretical models and simulations elucidate the underlying interactions, providing a framework for engineering valence-free nanoparticle superlattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond to graphite transformation is a complex kinetically driven process which has been studied under various conditions for its fundamental importance. We report the transformation of diamond embedded ceramic matrix composites during hypersonic impact. Diamond particles embedded in cubic boron nitride matrix provide a superhard composite that was subjected to high impact collisions of metal projectiles travelling at speeds reaching Mach 8.45. Our observations suggest that the energy absorption and fracture of the composite is primarily enabled via the phase change of diamond into graphite. Characterization of the impact-fractured composite shows transformed diamond particles and provides details of the shock-induced phase transformation and the nature of diamond-graphite interfaces formed during rapid phase change. The study provides new understanding of phase transformation of diamond under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Disorder viscosity correction approach to calculate spinodal temperature and wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinodal decomposition, a key mechanism to microstructure formation in materials, has long posed challenges for predictive modeling, due to the need for parameter-free approaches that accurately capture local energy landscapes. In this work, we propose an approach to predict spinodal behavior by introducing a disorder viscosity correction to bulk free energies computed from finite, small, representative cells. We approximate the energy penalty required to transition into a disordered state to enable the stabilization of locally concave bulk free energy regions - essential for interface formation - while suppressing long-range concentration fluctuations. This approximation circumvents the complexity of full ab initio parameterization of interfacial properties and is well-suited for high-throughput and machine-learning frameworks. Our approach captures the necessary physics underpinning spinodal kinetics, offering a scalable route to predict spinodal regions in compositionally complex and high-entropy materials.</description>

      <title>Fast Generation of Pipek-Mezey Wannier Functions via the Co-Iterative Augmented Hessian Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a $k$-point extension of the second-order co-iterative augmented Hessian (CIAH) algorithm, termed $k$-CIAH, for Pipek-Mezey (PM) localization of Wannier functions (WFs). By exploiting an efficient evaluation of the Hessian-vector product, $k$-CIAH achieves $O(N_k^2 n^3)$ scaling in both CPU time and memory, matching that of previously reported first-order $k$-space approaches while improving upon the $O(N_k^3 n^3)$ scaling of $\Gamma$-point CIAH, where $N_k$ denotes the number of $k$-points sampling the first Brillouin zone and $n$ characterizes the unit-cell size. Benchmark calculations on a diverse set of solids -- including insulators, semiconductors, metals, and surfaces -- demonstrate the fast and robust convergence of $k$-CIAH-based PMWF optimization, which yields an overall computational efficiency approximately 2-3 -fold higher than first-order $k$-space methods and orders of magnitude higher than $\Gamma$-point CIAH for localizing 1000-5000 orbitals. The quality of the resulting PMWFs is further validated by accurate electronic band structures obtained via PMWF-based Wannier interpolation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous electrowetting of physicochemically heterogeneous surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, a physiochemically heterogeneous surface has been fabricated to investigate the electrowetting behaviour of the surface. The polystyrene (PS) micro-humps with varied size are developed on the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface, which show an anomalous electrowetting behaviour. The surfaces are observed to be more electro-wettable than it is predicted by the classical Lippmann-Young equation. The observations are well understood considering the chemical heterogeneity of the surface, exhibiting a surface energy mismatch between the PS micro-humps and the PDMS layer. Further, the anomaly is comprehended by following the ridge formation around the triple-phase contact line and the varied surface roughness. A surface parameter is introduced in the Lippmann-Young equation that follows the experimental data with varied values of the parameter representing the physicochemically heterogeneous surfaces. A positive value of the surface parameter indicates strong pinning while a negative value represents depinning of the droplet. This parameter explains the faster electrowetting than predicted by the Lippmann-Young equation.</description>

      <title>Subcycle videography of lightwave-driven Landau-Zener-Majorana transitions in graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong light fields have unlocked previously unthinkable possibilities to tailor coherent electron trajectories, engineer band structures and shape emergent phases of matter all-optically. Unravelling the underlying quantum mechanisms requires a visualisation of the lightwave-driven electron motion directly in the band structure. While photoelectron momentum microscopy has imaged optically excited electrons averaged over many cycles of light, actual subcycle band-structure videography has been limited to small electron momenta. Yet lightwave-driven elementary processes in quantum materials often occur throughout momentum space. Here, we introduce attosecond-precision, subcycle band-structure videography covering the entire first Brillouin zone (BZ) and visualize one of the most fundamental but notoriously elusive strong-field processes: non-adiabatic Landau-Zener-Majorana (LZM) tunnelling. The interplay of field-driven acceleration within the Dirac-like band structure of graphene and periodic LZM interband tunnelling manifest in a coherent displacement and distortion of the momentum distribution at the BZ edge. The extremely non-thermal electron distributions also allow us to disentangle competing scattering processes and assess their impact on coherent electronic control through electron redistribution and thermalization. Our panoramic view of strong-field-driven electron motion in quantum materials lays the foundation for a microscopic understanding of some of the most discussed light-driven phenomena in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>On the effect of Edge vs bulk effects in Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have shown how the electrical properties of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) show a size-dependence in terms of resistivity, charge neutrality point (CNP) and band structure once their widths drop below approximately 50 nm. It has been observed that the CNP switches sign below a certain GNR width, and in this article, we explore this via computational modelling of the electric field and the conductance of GNRs in the presence of an AFM tip. We show that CNP is expected to shift towards lower values as GNR width reduces as a result of the significantly enhanced electric field around edges, but that a change in sign is not expected. We also show experimentally via high-resolution Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) that there does not appear to be any significant difference between the edges and the bulk of a GNR, indicating that the switch in CNP is not due to differential doping, and may instead be due to variations in the band structure as a function of size.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Femtosecond Laser and Ion-Implantation Processing for Controlled, Deep, High-Efficiency Ablation in Fused Silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser modification of fused silica enables precise surface tailoring for the fabrication of micro-optical components such as microlenses and diffractive elements. However, the process is governed by laser-matter interactions where the local fluence determines the processing depth, often limiting control over feature geometry and efficiency. Here, we present a hybrid approach combining localized Au implantation (1.8 MeV Au2+ ions) into SiO2 samples with femtosecond laser irradiation (250 fs), effectively tuning the laser-matter interaction and resulting morphology. At both 515 nm and 1030 nm irradiation wavelengths, single-shot femtosecond pulses produce cylindrical craters with sharp edges and flat-bottom profiles. Independently of the fluence, these craters exhibit a constant depth of 550 nm, corresponding to the region of maximum Au concentration. The effect manifests already at moderate fluence (app. 4 J/sq.cm) and yields high ablation efficiency, up to 15 cubic micrometers per microjoule. The hybrid method also works effectively at lower implantation doses that preserve the excellent transmission of fused silica, offering a promising pathway for the high-quality fabrication of flat optical components such as binary phase masks, phase lenses, or fused-silica micromolds.</description>

      <title>Phonon properties and unconventional heat transfer in quasi-2D $Bi_2O_2Se$ crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05155v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bi2O2Se belongs to a group of quasi-2D semiconductors that can replace silicon in future high-speed/low-power electronics. However, the correlation between crystal/band structure and other physical properties still eludes understanding: carrier mobility increases non-intuitively with carrier concentration; the observed $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity lacks explanation. Moreover, a very high relative out-of-plane permittivity of about 150 has been reported in the literature. A proper explanation for such a high permittivity is still lacking. We have performed infrared (IR) reflectivity and Raman scattering experiments on a large perfect single crystal with defined mosaicity, carrier concentration and mobility. Five of the eight phonons allowed by factor group theory have been observed and their symmetries determined. The IR spectra show that the permittivity measured in the tetragonal plane is as high as ${\epsilon}_r{\approx}500$, and this high value is due to a strong polar phonon with a low frequency of ~34 $cm^{-1}$ (~1 THz). Such an unusually high permittivity allows the screening of charge defects, leading to the observation of high electron mobility at low temperatures. It also allows effective modulation doping providing a platform for high performance 2D electronics. DFT calculations suggest the existence of a very low frequency acoustic phonon ~14 $cm^{-1}$ (~0.4 THz). Both the low frequency phonons cause anomalous phonon DOS, which is reflected in the unconventional temperature dependence of the heat capacity, $c_M{\approx}T^{3.5}$. The temperature-dependent, two-component group velocity is proposed to explains the unusual temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, ${\kappa}{\approx}T^{1.5}$</description>

      <title>Atomistic modeling of uranium monocarbide with a machine learning interatomic potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uranium monocarbide (UC) is an advanced ceramic fuel candidate due to its superior uranium density and thermal conductivity compared to traditional fuels. To accurately model UC at reactor operating conditions, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) using an active learning procedure to generate a comprehensive training dataset capturing diverse atomic configurations. The resulting MLIP predicts structural, elastic, thermophysical properties, defect formation energies, and diffusion behaviors, aligning well with experimental and theoretical benchmarks. This work significantly advances computational methods to explore UC, enabling efficient large-scale and long-time molecular dynamics simulations essential for reactor fuel qualification.</description>

      <title>Local expression of fractional corner charges in obstructed atomic insulators and relationship with the fractional disclination charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In obstructed atomic insulators, fractionally quantized charges appear at the corners of the crystals in the shapes of vertex-transitive polyhedra, and are given by the filling anomaly divided by the number of corners. Recent studies reveal that the filling anomaly for the cases with genus $0$ is universally given by the total charge at the Wyckoff position $1a$. In this study, we rewrite the formula in terms of the degree of sharpness of the corner, and show that the corner charge formula also holds for cases with arbitrary genus. We also extend our formula to vertex-transitive shell polyhedra, which are closed or open polyhedra without the bulk region, with all the vertices related by symmetry. Then, we show that the corner charges of such shell polyhedra are equal to the two-dimensional disclination charges of the corresponding disclinations. By identifying it with the disclination charge under the Wen-Zee action, we show that the coupling constant of the Wen-Zee action for a crystalline insulator is given by the total charge at the Wyckoff position at the disclination core.</description>

      <title>Parameter-free prediction of irradiation defect structures in tungsten at room temperature using stochastic cluster dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The foundations of irradiation damage theory were laid in the 1950s and 60s within the framework of chemical reaction kinetics. While helpful to analyze qualitative aspects of irradiation damage, the theory contained gaps that delayed its implementation and applicability as a predictive tool. The advent of computer simulations with atomistic resolution in the 80s and 90s revealed a series of mechanisms that have proved essential to understand key aspects of irradiation damage in crystalline solids. However, we still lack a comprehensive model that can connect atomic-level defect physics with experimental measurements of quantitative features of the irradiated microstructure. In this work, we present a mesoscale model that draws from our improved understanding of irradiation damage processes collected over the last few decades, bridging knowledge gained from our most sophisticated atomistic simulations with defect kinetics taking place over time scales many orders of magnitude larger than atomic interaction times. Importantly, the model contains no adjustable parameters and combines several essential pieces of irradiation damage physics: each playing an irreplaceable role in the context of the full model but of limited utility if considered in isolation. Crucially, we carry out a set of experiments carefully designed to isolate the key irradiation damage variables and facilitate validation. Using tungsten as a model material, we find exceptionally good agreement between our numerical predictions and experimental measurements of defect densities and defect cluster sizes.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Dichalcogenide MoS${}_2$: oxygen and fluorine functionalization for selective plasma processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-temperature plasma processing is a promising technique for tailoring transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). For chalcogen substitution processing, a key challenge is to identify the ion energy window that enables selective chalcogen removal while preserving the metal lattice. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), we demonstrate that oxygen and fluorine functionalization widen the processing window by significantly lowering the sulfur sputtering energy threshold ($E_{\text{sputt,S}}$) of MoS${}_2$ from $\sim 30$ eV to $\sim 10$ eV via formation of sputtering products such as SO${}_2$ and SF${}_n$. Additionally, we show that experimentally relevant cryogenic temperatures strongly affect $E_{\text{sputt,S}}$. The dependence is confirmed via AIMD and also predicted by a mechanistic parameter-free theory, suggesting that $E_{\text{sputt}}(T)$ generalizes to other TMDs, functionalization, and surface impacts in general. Our results highlight oxygen/fluorine functionalization, ionic impact angle, and material temperature to be key control parameters for selective, damage-controlled chalcogen removal in TMD processing.</description>

      <title>Ultracoherent self-assembled diamond nanomechanics reveals superfluid dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From gravitational-wave detection, protein force microscopy, to exploration of quantum-classical boundaries, many anticipated discoveries in fundamental science require improving measurement sensitivity limits. Through the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, mechanical dissipation sets the acoustic noise for this limit. Yet, even in high-purity crystals, the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the acoustic loss remain poorly understood. Tension-induced dissipation dilution offers a route to ultralow acoustic loss, but is challenging to implement in crystalline materials including single-crystal diamond. Here we realize a strain-engineered diamond nanomechanical platform using a liquid-assisted van der Waals self-assembly process that harnesses intrinsic surface forces to apply tensile stress exceeding 1 GPa. At cryogenic temperatures these resonators achieve quality factors beyond 10 billion (intrinsic material quality factors beyond 100 million). This exceptional coherence turns them into a sensitive probe for residual dissipation, elucidating three distinct two-level-system channels and one topological dissipation channel from a surface superfluid helium film. Our work shows how advancing mechanical coherence opens access to new regimes of physics in hybrid quantum systems, precision metrology, and condensed-matter physics.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction textures in twisted bilayer graphene from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments probing the wavefunctions of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we perform large-scale first-principles calculations of tBLG with full atomic relaxation across a wide range of twist angles down to $0.99^\circ$. Focusing on the magic angle, we compute wavefunctions of the low energy bands, resolving atomic-scale details and moir\'e-scale patterns that form triangular, honeycomb, and Kagome lattices. By tuning the interlayer interactions, we illustrate the formation of the flat bands from isolated monolayers and the emergence of the band inversion and fragile topology at a sufficiently large interaction strength. We identify strong indicators of a new phase transition with increasing interlayer interaction strength, achievable with external pressure or a decrease in the twist angle. When this transition occurs, the upper and lower flat bands exchange their wavefunction character and symmetry eigenvalues, which may be correlated with the appearance of superconductivity with electron doping below the magic angle. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using first-principles wavefunctions to help interpret experimental signatures of topological and correlated phases in tBLG.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Role of Higher-Lying Excited States in Organic Emitters via Multistate Ab Initio Kinetic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher lying excited states beyond S1 and T1 are widely recognized in many photophysical systems, including thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). However, their explicit and quantitative impact on photophysical observables such as photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and lifetimes is difficult to be attained experimentally and it has not been systematically assessed within a fully ab initio kinetic modeling framework. To address this gap, we developed KinLuv, a multistate excited state kinetic model that includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2) and all possible monomolecular interconversion processes between all the electronic states, whose rate constants were computed using Fermi golden rule explicitly including the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling effect. We applied KinLuv to prototypical multi resonance TADF (MRTADF) emitters and their derivatives, as well as other representative organic chromophores, demonstrating its broad applicability across diverse photophysical playgrounds beyond TADF. The resulting simulations quantitatively reproduce key experimental observables, including PLQY and prompt and delayed fluorescence lifetimes. Beyond its predictive power, the present results establish clear criteria for identifying when higher lying excited states influence the excited state decay and when simplified models remain adequate. This framework enables rational selection of minimal kinetic models that balance physical insight with numerical robustness, with direct implications for the in silico design of high performance organic emitters.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure of Epitaxial Films of the Bilayer Strontium Ruthenate: Sr$_{3}$Ru$_2$O$_{7}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first combined study of the low-energy electronic band structure of epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory. The complete Fermi-surface topography of the near-Fermi-level bands is determined from in-situ ARPES measurements. To investigate the effects of substrate-induced strain on the band structure, Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ thin films are epitaxially grown on SrTiO$_3$ and (LaAlO$_{3}$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_{2}$TaAlO$_{6}$)$_{0.7}$ substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. The combination of the measured Fermi-surfaces along with the theoretical interpretation, clearly show dramatic changes in the Fermi surface topologies that result from the underlying strain states of the films on the two substrates. We find that the Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films prepared on SrTiO$_3$ are tensile strained with tetragonal symmetry, whereas those grown on (LaAlO$_{3}$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_{2}$TaAlO$_{6}$)$_{0.7}$ are compressively strained with orthorhombic symmetry. Within $\sim15~\text{meV}$ below the Fermi level, we observe two flat bands along $\Gamma$-$X$ in the orthorhombic phase and around $\Gamma$ in the tetragonal phase. These features could be favorable for van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, and highlight the emergence of magnetic instabilities in epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films.</description>

      <title>Tuning Optical Properties of FTO via Carbonaceous Al2O3 Microdot Deposition by DC plasma sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is a key transparent conductive oxide for photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, yet its high reflectance limits light-trapping efficiency. This work demonstrates a simple DC plasma sputtering approach to deposit carbonaceous Al2O3 microdots on FTO under controlled Ar, O2, and Ar-O2 atmospheres. For plasma discharge in the normal mode, with plasma density 10^9 cm^-3 and temperature of 2 eV, Volmer-Weber growth produced discrete microdots whose size and distribution were tuned by gas composition: dense, uniform dots in Ar (approximately 0.89 um radius), agglomerated structures in O2, and intermediate morphologies in mixed atmospheres. Structural analysis confirmed Al2O3 formation with carbon incorporation, while SEM revealed morphology-driven optical behavior. UV-Vis measurements showed that Ar-O2 coatings achieved the lowest reflectance across the visible range, outperforming bare FTO and other conditions. These findings establish a clear link between sputtering parameters, surface morphology, and optical performance, offering a scalable route to anti-reflective, light-trapping coatings for next-generation solar cells and optoelectronic devices.</description>
