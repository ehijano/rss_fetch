      <title>Duality and Interpolation of Bergman Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the dual space corresponding to p-Bergman space and examines the essential condition for the dual space to be a q-Bergman space. The investigation involves a detailed examination of the interpolation space of a Banach couple. Additionally, we draw comparisons between the `duality', `integrability' and `regularity' properties of a domain.</description>

      <title>On the radius of concavity for certain classes of functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ denote the class of all analytic functions $f$ defined in the open unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ with the normalization $f(0)=0=f'(0)-1$ and let $P'$ be the class of functions $f\in\mathcal{A}$ such that ${\rm{Re}}\,f'(z)&gt;0$, $z\in\mathbb{D}$. In this article, we obtain radii of concavity of $P'$ and for the class $P'$ with the fixed second coefficient. After that, we consider linearly invariant family of functions, along with the class of starlike functions of order $1/2$ and investigate their radii of concavity. Next, we obtain a lower bound of radius of concavity for the class of functions $\mathcal{U}_0(\lambda)=~\{f\in\mathcal{U}(\lambda) : f''(0)=0\}$, where
  $$
  \mathcal{U}(\lambda)=\left\{f\in\mathcal{A} : \left|\left(\frac{z}{f(z)}\right)^2f'(z)-1\right|&lt;\lambda,~z\in \mathbb{D}\right\},\quad \lambda \in (0,1].
  $$
  We also investigate the meromorphic analogue of the class $\mathcal{U}(\lambda)$ and compute its radius of concavity.</description>

      <title>Regularly oscillating mappings between metric spaces and a theorem of Hardy and Littlewood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by the classical theorem due to Hardy and Littlewood which concerns analytic mappings on the unit disk and relates the growth of the derivative with the H\"{o}lder continuity. We obtain a version of this result in a very general setting -- for regularly oscillating mappings on a metric space equipped with a weight, which is a continuous and positive function, with values in another metric space. As a consequence, we derive the Hardy and Littlewood theorem for analytic mappings on the unit ball of a normed space.</description>

      <title>A new class of Carleson measures and integral operators on Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n$ be a positive integer and $\mathbf{g}=(g_0,g_1,\cdots,g_{n-1})$, with $g_k\in H(\mathbb{D})$ for $k=0,1,\cdots,n-1$. Let $I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}$ be the generalized Volterra-type operators on $H(\mathbb{C})$, which is represented as $$ I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}f=I^n\left(fg_0+f'g_1+\cdots+f^{(n-1)}g_{n-1}\right), $$ where $I$ denotes the integration operator $$(If)(z)=\int_0^zf(w)dw,$$ and $I^n$ is the $n$th iteration of $I$. This operator is a generalization of the operator that was introduced by Chalmoukis in \cite{Cn}. In this paper, we study the boundedness and compactness of the operator $I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}$ acting on Bergman spaces to another. As a consequence of these characterizations, we obtain conditions for certain linear differential equations to have solutions in Bergman spaces. Moreover, we study the boundedness, compactness and Hilbert-Schmidtness of the following sums of generalized weighted composition operators: Let $\mathbf{u}=(u_0,u_1,\cdots,u_n)$ with $u_k\in H(\mathbb{D})$ for $0\leq k\leq n$ and $\varphi$ be an analytic self-map of $\mathbb{D}.$ The sums of generalized weighted composition operators is defined by $$L_{\mathbf{u},\varphi}^{(n)}=\sum_{k=0}^nW_{u_k,\varphi}^{(k)},$$ where $$W_{u_k,\varphi}^{(k)}f=u_k\cdot f^{(k)}\circ\varphi.$$ Our approach involves the study of new class of Sobolev-Carleson measures for classical Bergman spaces on unit disk which appears in the first main Theorems \ref{Theorem1.1} and \ref{Theorem1.2}.</description>

      <title>Essential normality of quotient submodules over strongly pseudoconvex finite manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $p$-essential normality of Hilbert quotient submodules on a relatively compact smooth strongly pseudoconvex domain in a complex manifold satisfying Property (S). For analytic subvarieties that have compact singularities and transversely intersect the strongly pseudoconvex boundary, we prove that the corresponding Bergman-Sobolev quotient submodules are $p$-essentially normal whenever $p$ exceeds the dimension of the noncompact part of the analytic subvarieties. As a consequence, we partially confirm the geometric Arveson-Douglas Conjecture and resolve an open problem regarding the trace-class antisymmetric sum of truncated Toeplitz operators within a broader context. Moreover, we provide applications in $K$-homology and geometric invariant theory.</description>

      <title>Toeplitz algebra and Symbol map via Berezin transform on $H^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{T}(L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}))$ be the Toeplitz algebra, that is, the $C^*$-algebra generated by the set $\{T_{\phi} : \phi\in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T})\}$. Douglas's theorem on symbol map states that there exists a $C^*$-algebra homomorphism from $\mathscr{T}(L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}))$ onto $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T})$ such that $T_{\phi}\mapsto \phi$ and the kernel of the homomorphism coincides with commutator ideal in $\mathscr{T}(L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}))$. In this paper, we use the Berezin transform to study results akin to Douglas's theorem for operators on the Hardy space $H^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$ over the open unit polydisc $\mathbb{D}^n$ for $n\geq 1$. We further obtain a class of bigger $C^*$-algebras than the Toeplitz algebra $\mathscr{T}(L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}^n))$ for which the analog of symbol map still holds true.</description>

      <title>Ellipsoid Methods for Metric Entropy Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new methodology for the characterization of the metric entropy of infinite-dimensional ellipsoids with exponentially decaying semi-axes. This procedure does not rely on the explicit construction of coverings or packings and provides a unified framework for the derivation of the metric entropy of a wide variety of analytic function classes, such as periodic functions analytic on a strip, analytic functions bounded on a disk, and functions of exponential type. In each of these cases, our results improve upon the best known results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Classifying multiply connected wandering domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the internal dynamics of multiply connected wandering domains of meromorphic functions. We do so by considering the sequence of injectivity radii along the orbit of a base point, together with the hyperbolic distortions along the same orbit. The latter sequence had been previously used in this context; the former introduces geometric information about the shape of the wandering domains that interacts with the dynamic information given by the hyperbolic distortions. Using this idea, we complete the description of the internal dynamics of any wandering domain of a meromorphic function, and also unify previous approaches to the question. We conclude that the internal dynamics of a wandering domain, from the point of view of hyperbolic geometry, can be classified into six different types. Five of these types are realised by wandering domains of entire functions, while the sixth can only arise for meromorphic functions: a locally but not globally eventually isometric wandering domain. We construct a meromorphic function with such a domain, demonstrating that this new phenomenon does in fact occur. Our results show that, on a local level, the dynamics of multiply connected wandering domains of meromorphic functions is similar to those of entire functions, although new global phenomena can arise for non-entire functions.</description>

      <title>Errett Bishop theorems on Complex Analytic Sets: Chow's Theorem Revisited and Foliations with all leaves Compact on K\"ahler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.04846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a series of seemingly unrelated results of Complex Analysis which are in fact connected via a different approach to their proofs using the results of Errett Bishop of volumes and limits of analytic varieties. We start by proving Chow's theorem by a technique suggested long time ago in the beautiful book by Gabriel Stolzenberg. We think this approach is very attractive and easier for students and newcomers to understand; also the theory presented here is linked to areas of mathematics that are not usually associated with Chow's result. In addition, Bishop's results imply both Chow's and Remmert-Stein's theorems directly, meaning that this view is simpler and just as profound as Remmert-Stein's proof. After that, we give a comparison table that explains how Bishop's theorems generalize to several complex variables classical results of one complex variable and prove Montel's compactness theorem using the techniques presented here. Finally we give an alternative proof of a theorem of Edwards, Millet and Sullivan of foliations with compact leaves for the case of complex foliations in K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

      <title>Landen transformations applied to approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study computational methods for the approximation of special functions recurrent in geometric function theory and quasiconformal mapping theory. The functions studied can be expressed as quotients of complete elliptic integrals and as inverses of such quotients. In particular, we consider the distortion function $\varphi_K(r)$ which gives a majorant for $|f(x)|$ when $f: \mathbb{B}^2 \to \mathbb{B}^2, f(0)=0,$ is a quasiconformal mapping of the unit disk $\mathbb{B}^2.$ It turns out that the approximation method is very simple: five steps of Landen iteration is enough to achieve machine precision.</description>

      <title>Minimization of Dirichlet energy of $j-$degree mappings between annuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{B}$ be circular annuli in the complex plane and consider the Dirichlet energy integral of $j-$degree mappings between $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{B}$. Then we minimize this energy integral. The minimizer is a $j-$degree harmonic mapping between annuli $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{B}$ provided it exits. If such a harmonic mapping does not exist, then the minimizer is still a $j-$degree mapping which is harmonic in $\mathbb{A}'\subset \mathbb{A}$ and it is a squeezing mapping in its complementary annulus $\mathbb{A}''=\mathbb{A}\setminus \mathbb{A}$. Such a result is an extension of the certain result of Astala, Iwaniec and Martin \cite{astala2010}.</description>
