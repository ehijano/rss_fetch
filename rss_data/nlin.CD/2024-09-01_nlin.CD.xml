      <title>Semiclassical limit of resonance states in chaotic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonance states in quantum chaotic scattering systems have a multifractal structure that depends on their decay rate. We show how classical dynamics describes resonance states of all decay rates in the semiclassical limit. This result for chaotic scattering systems corresponds to the well-established quantum ergodicity for closed chaotic systems. Specifically, we generalize Ulam's matrix approximation of the Perron-Frobenius operator, giving rise to conditionally invariant measures of various decay rates. There are many matrix approximations leading to the same decay rate and we conjecture a criterion for selecting the one relevant for resonance states. Numerically, we demonstrate that resonance states in the semiclassical limit converge to the selected measure. Example systems are a dielectric cavity, the three-disk scattering system, and open quantum maps.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov spectra and fluctuation relations: Insights from the Galerkin-truncated Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imposition of a global constraint of the conservation of total kinetic energy on a forced-dissipative Burgers equation yields a governing equation that is invariant under the time-reversal symmetry operation, $\{\mathcal{T}: t \to -t; u \to -u \}$, where $u$ is the velocity field. Moreover, the dissipation term gets strongly modified, as the viscosity is no longer a constant, but a fluctuating, state dependent quantity, which can even become negative in certain dynamical regimes. Despite these differences, the statistical properties of different dynamical regimes of the time-reversible Burgers equation and the standard forced-dssipative Burgers equation are equivalent, \`a la Gallavotti's conjecture of \textit{equivalence of nonequilibrium ensembles}. We show that the negative viscosity events occur only in the thermalized regime described by the time-reversible equation. This quasi-equilibrium regime is examined by calculating the local Lyapunov spectra and fluctuation relations. A pairing symmetry among the spectra is observed, indicating that the dynamics is chaotic and has an attractor spanning the entire phase space of the system. The violations of the second law of thermodynamics are found to be in accordance with the fluctuation relations, namely the Gallavotti-Cohen relation based on the phase-space contraction rate and the Cohen-Searles fluctuation relation based on the energy production rate. It is also argued that these violations are associated with the effects of the Galerkin-truncation, the latter is responsible for the thermalization.</description>

      <title>A Markovian dynamics for C. elegans behavior across scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do we capture the breadth of behavior in animal movement, from rapid body twitches to aging? Using high-resolution videos of the nematode worm $C. elegans$, we show that a single dynamics connects posture-scale fluctuations with trajectory diffusion, and longer-lived behavioral states. We take short posture sequences as an instantaneous behavioral measure, fixing the sequence length for maximal prediction. Within the space of posture sequences we construct a fine-scale, maximum entropy partition so that transitions among microstates define a high-fidelity Markov model, which we also use as a means of principled coarse-graining. We translate these dynamics into movement using resistive force theory, capturing the statistical properties of foraging trajectories. Predictive across scales, we leverage the longest-lived eigenvectors of the inferred Markov chain to perform a top-down subdivision of the worm's foraging behavior, revealing both "runs-and-pirouettes" as well as previously uncharacterized finer-scale behaviors. We use our model to investigate the relevance of these fine-scale behaviors for foraging success, recovering a trade-off between local and global search strategies.</description>
