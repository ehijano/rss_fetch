      <title>Electronic State Population Dynamics upon Ultrafast Strong Field Ionization and Fragmentation of Molecular Nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air-lasing from single ionized N$_2^+$ molecules induced by laser filamentation in air has been intensively investigated and the mechanisms responsible for lasing are currently highly debated. We use ultrafast nitrogen K-edge spectroscopy to follow the strong field ionization and fragmentation dynamics of N$_2$ upon interaction with an ultrashort 800 nm laser pulse. Using probe pulses generated by extreme high-order harmonic generation, we observe transitions indicative of the formation of the electronic ground X$^2\Sigma_{g}^{+}$, first excited A$^2\Pi_u$ and second excited B$^2\Sigma^+_u$ states of N$_2^+$ on femtosecond time scales, from which we can quantitatively determine the time-dependent electronic state population distribution dynamics of N$_2^+$. Our results show a remarkably low population of the A$^2\Pi_u$ state, and nearly equal populations of the X$^2\Sigma_{g}^{+}$ and B$^2\Sigma^+_u$ states. In addition, we observe fragmentation of N$_2^+$ into N and N$^+$ on a time scale of several tens of picoseconds that we assign to significant collisional dynamics in the plasma, resulting in dissociative excitation of N$_2^+$.</description>

      <title>Theoretical development of a new spin filter generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the early days of quantum mechanics hydrogen, as the simplest of all atoms, has been studied or used to investigate new physics. In parallel, this knowledge leads to different applications, e.g. a spin filter to separate metastable hydrogen atoms in single hyperfine substates with electron spin m_s=1/2. Subsequently, this work provides the necessary theory as well as experimental conditions to build a new generation of spin filter which permits the separation of all four individual metastable hydrogen hyperfine states as well as for its isotopes in a corresponding beam.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Inner-Shell Lasing at Angstrom Wavelengths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the invention of the laser nonlinear effects such as filamentation, Rabi-cycling and collective emission have been explored in the optical regime leading to a wide range of scientific and industrial applications. X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) have led to the extension of many optical techniques to X-rays for their advantages of angstrom scale spatial resolution and elemental specificity. One such example is XFEL driven population inversion of 1s core hole states resulting in inner-shell K${\alpha}$ (2p to 1s) X-ray lasing in elements ranging from neon to copper, which has been utilized for nonlinear spectroscopy and development of next generation X-ray laser sources. Here we show that strong lasing effects, similar to those observed in the optical regime, can occur at 1.5 to 2.1 angstrom wavelengths during high intensity (&gt; ${10^{19}}$ W/cm${^{2}}$) XFEL driven inner-shell lasing and superfluorescence of copper and manganese. Depending on the temporal substructure of the XFEL pump pulses, the resulting inner-shell X-ray laser pulses can exhibit strong spatial inhomogeneities as well as spectral inhomogeneities and broadening. Through 3D Maxwell Bloch theory we show that the observed spatial inhomogeneities result from X-ray filamentation, and that the spectral broadening is driven by Rabi cycling with sub-femtosecond periods. These findings indicate that we have generated Angstrom-wavelength x-ray pulses (containing ${10^{6}}$ - ${10^{8}}$ photons) in the strong lasing regime, some of them with pulse lengths of less than 100 attoseconds.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Structure Factor from Weak Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of our knowledge of quantum systems is encapsulated in the expectation value of Hermitian operators, experimentally obtained by averaging projective measurements. However, dynamical properties are often described by products of operators evaluated at different times; such observables cannot be measured by individual projective measurements, which occur at a single time. For example, the dynamical structure factor describes the propagation of density excitations, such as phonons, and is derived from the spatial density operator evaluated at different times. Conventionally, this is measured by first exciting the system at a specific wavevector and frequency, then measuring the response. Here, we describe an alternative approach using a pair of time-separated weak measurements, and analytically show that their cross-correlation function directly recovers the dynamical structure factor. We provide numerical confirmation of this technique with a matrix product states simulation of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, weakly measured by phase contrast imaging. We explore the limits of the method and demonstrate its applicability to real experiments with limited imaging resolution.</description>

      <title>A non-relativistic Dirac equation: An application to photo ionization of highly charged hydrogen-like ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2001.00646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of relativity in photo ionization of hydrogen-like ions by a laser pulse. For hydrogen, the wavelengths of the laser resides in the weakly ultra violet region. For higher nuclear charges, the laser parameters are scaled in a manner which renders the time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation in the dipole approximation independent of nuclear charge. The ionization potentials of these highly charged ions are strongly modified by relativistic effects. In an earlier work, Ivanova et al., Phys. Rev. A {\bf 98}, 063402 (2018), it is demonstrated how this explains most of the relativistic correction to the ionization probability. Here we investigate to what extent remaining discrepancies can be attributed to relativistic effects stemming from the strong external field. To this end, we solve semi-relativistic formulations of both the Schr{\"o}dinger and the Dirac equations; the former accounts for increased inertia due to the external laser field, while the latter features a non-relativistic interaction term.</description>

      <title>Revising the Universality Hypothesis for Room-temperature Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atoms constitute promising quantum sensors for a variety of scenarios including vacuum metrology. Key to this application is knowledge of the collision rate coefficient of the sensor atom with the particles being detected. Prior work demonstrated that, for room-temperature collisions, the total collision rate coefficient and the trap depth dependence of the sensor atom loss rate from shallow traps are both universal, independent of the interaction potential at short range. It was also shown that measurements of the energy transferred to the sensor atom by the collision can be used to estimate the total collision rate coefficient. However, discrepancies found when comparing the results of this and other methods of deducing the rate coefficient call into question its accuracy. Here the universality hypothesis is re-examined and an important correction is presented. We find that measurements of the post-collision recoil energy of sensor atoms held in shallow magnetic traps only provide information about the interaction potential at the very largest inter-atomic distances (e.g.~the value of $C_6$ for a leading order term of $C_6/r^6$). As other non-negligible terms exist at medium and long ranges, the total collision rate coefficient, even if universal, can differ from that computed solely from the value of $C_6$. By incorporating these other long-range terms into a simple semi-classical (SC) calculation, we find the SC prediction matches that of full, multi-channel, quantum mechanical scattering calculations using the complete potential. This work resolves the discrepancies, demonstrates the simplicity of estimating the rate coefficients for universal collision partners, and provides guidance for using atoms as a self-calibrating primary quantum pressure standard.</description>

      <title>Energy Transport Among Highly-Polarized Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A static electric field of a few V/cm shifts the energy levels of ultracold Rydberg atoms in a magneto-optical trap. For a given principle quantum number, most of the energy levels are nearly degenerate at zero field and fan out with increasing field to form a manifold. We excite Rydberg atoms to energy levels near the center of the manifold, where the spacing is nearly harmonic, and allow them to exchange energy via resonant dipole-dipole interactions. We measure the time evolution as energy spreads away from the center of the manifold, which reveals that the system fails to thermalize for long interaction times. A computational model that includes only a few essential features of the system qualitatively agrees with this result.</description>

      <title>Modeling of a continuous superradiant laser on the sub-mHz $^1$S$_0\,\rightarrow\,^3$P$_0$ transition in neutral strontium-88</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous superradiance using a narrow optical transition has the potential to improve the short-term stability of state-of-the-art optical clocks. Even though pulsed superradiant emission on a mHz linewidth clock transition has been shown, true continuous operation, without Fourier limitation, has turned out to be extremely challenging. The trade-off between maintaining a high atomic flux while minimizing decoherence effects presents a significant obstacle. Here, we discuss the design of a machine that could overcome this problem by combining a high-flux continuous beam of ultra cold strontium atoms with a bowtie cavity for the generation of superradiant lasing. To evaluate the feasibility of our design, we present simulation results for continuous high-efficiency cooling, loading, and pumping to the upper lasing state inside the bowtie cavity. We then present two different models for stimulating the generated superradiant field by taking into account position-dependent shifts, collisional decoherence, light shifts, and atom loss. Finally, we estimate a laser linewidth of less than 100 mHz, limited by atom number fluctuations, and resulting in an output power of hundreds of fW.</description>

      <title>Dicke superradiance in ordered lattices: dimensionality matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.08380v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dicke superradiance in ordered atomic arrays is a phenomenon where atomic synchronization gives rise to a burst in photon emission. This superradiant burst only occurs if there is one -- or just a few -- dominant decay channels. For a fixed atom number, this happens only below a critical interatomic distance. Here we show that array dimensionality is the determinant factor that drives superradiance. In 2D and 3D arrays, superradiance occurs due to constructive interference, which grows stronger with atom number. This leads to a critical distance that scales sublogarithmically with atom number in 2D, and as a power law in 3D. In 1D arrays, superradiance occurs due to destructive interference that effectively switches off certain decay channels, yielding a critical distance that saturates with atom number. Our results provide a guide to explore many-body decay in state-of-the art experimental setups.</description>

      <title>A hybrid atom tweezer array of nuclear spin and optical clock qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While data qubits with a long coherence time are essential for the storage of quantum information, ancilla qubits are pivotal in quantum error correction (QEC) for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The recent development of optical tweezer arrays, such as the preparation of large-scale qubit arrays and high-fidelity gate operations, offers the potential for realizing QEC protocols, and one of the important next challenges is to control and detect ancilla qubits while minimizing atom loss and crosstalk. Here, we present the realization of a hybrid system consisting of a dual-isotope ytterbium (Yb) atom array, in which we can utilize a nuclear spin qubit of fermionic ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$ as a data qubit and an optical clock qubit of bosonic ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$ as an ancilla qubit with a capacity of non-destructive qubit readout. We evaluate the crosstalk between qubits regarding the impact on the coherence of the nuclear spin qubits from the imaging light for ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$. The Hahn-echo sequence with a 399 nm probe and 556 nm cooling beams for ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$, we observe 99.1(1.8) % coherence retained under 20 ms exposure, yielding an imaging fidelity of 0.9992 and a survival probability of 0.988. The Ramsey sequence with a 556 nm probe beam shows negligible influence on the coherence, suggesting the potential future improvement of low cross-talk measurements. This result highlights the potential of the hybrid-Yb atom array for ancilla-qubit-based QEC protocols.</description>
