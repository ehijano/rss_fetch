      <title>An Inverse Hyperbolic Problem with Application to Joint Photoacoustic Parameter Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an inverse problem of recovering a parameter appearing in all levels in a second-order hyperbolic equation from a single boundary measurement. The model is motivated from applications in photoacoustic tomography when one seeks to recover both the wave speed and the initial ultrasound pressure from a single ultrasound signal. In particular, our result shows that the ratio of the initial ultrasound pressure and the wave speed squared uniquely determines both of them respectively.</description>

      <title>Soliton resolution for Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider soliton resolution for the Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (CM-DNLS). A rigorous PDE analysis of (CM-DNLS) was recently initiated by G\'erard and Lenzmann, who demonstrated its Lax pair structure. Additionally, (CM-DNLS) exhibits several symmetries, such as mass-criticality with pseudo-conformal symmetry and a self-dual Hamiltonian. Despite its integrability, finite-time blow-up solutions have been constructed.
  The purpose of this paper is to establish soliton resolution for both finite-time blow-up solutions and global solutions in a fully general setting, \emph{without imposing radial symmetry or size constraints}. To our knowledge, this is the first non-integrable proof of full soliton resolution for Schr\"odinger-type equations. A key aspect of our proof is the control of the energy of the outer radiation after extracting a soliton, referred to as the \emph{energy bubbling} estimate. This benefits from two levels of convervation laws, mass and energy, and self-duality. This approach allows us to directly prove continuous-in-time soliton resolution, bypassing time-sequential soliton resolution. Importantly, our proof does not rely on the integrability of the equation, potentially offering insights applicable to other non-integrable models.</description>

      <title>A gradient system based on anisotropic monochrome image processing with orientation auto-adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the mathematical analysis of a system of pseudo-parabolic partial differential equations governed by an energy functional, associated with anisotropic monochrome image processing. The energy functional is based on the one proposed by [Berkels et al. Cartoon extraction based on anisotropic image classification, SFB 611, 2006], which incorporates an orientation auto-adjustment mechanism, and our energy is a simplified version which reduces the order of derivatives to improve computational efficiency. The aim of this paper is to establish a stable minimization process that addresses some instability of the algorithm caused by the reduction of derivative order. As a part of the study, we here prove Main Theorems concerned with the well-posedness of the pseudo-parabolic system, and provide a mathematically rigorous guarantee for the stability of the image denoising process derived from our system.</description>

      <title>Existence results for a borderline case of a class of p-Laplacian problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is investigating the existence of at least one nontrivial bounded solution of the new asymptotically ``linear'' problem \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} - {\rm div} \left[\left(A_0(x) + A(x) |u|^{ps}\right) |\nabla u|^{p-2} \nabla u\right] + s\ A(x) |u|^{ps-2} u\ |\nabla u|^p &amp;\\ \qquad\qquad\qquad =\ \mu |u|^{p (s + 1) -2} u + g(x,u) &amp; \hbox{in $\Omega$,}\\ u = 0 &amp; \hbox{on $\partial{\Omega}$,} \end{array}\right.\] where $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N \ge 2$, $1 &lt; p &lt; N$, $s &gt; 1/p$, both the coefficients $A_0(x)$ and $A(x)$ are in $L^\infty(\Omega)$ and far away from 0, $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$, and the ``perturbation'' term $g(x,t)$ is a Carath\'{e}odory function on $\Omega \times \mathbb{R}$ which grows as $|t|^{r-1}$ with $1\le r &lt; p (s + 1)$ and is such that $g(x,t) \approx \nu |t|^{p-2} t$ as $t \to 0$. By introducing suitable thresholds for the parameters $\nu$ and $\mu$, which are related to the coefficients $A_0(x)$, respectively $A(x)$, under suitable hypotheses on $g(x,t)$, the existence of a nontrivial weak solution is proved if either $\nu$ is large enough with $\mu$ small enough or $\nu$ is small enough with $\mu$ large enough. Variational methods are used and in the first case a minimization argument applies while in the second case a suitable Mountain Pass Theorem is used.</description>

      <title>Optimal boundary regularity and Green function estimates for nonlocal equations in divergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove for the first time the $C^s$ boundary regularity for solutions to nonlocal elliptic equations with H\"older continuous coefficients in divergence form in $C^{1,\alpha}$ domains. So far, it was only known that solutions are H\"older continuous up to the boundary, and establishing their optimal regularity has remained an open problem in the field. Our proof is based on a delicate higher order Campanato-type iteration at the boundary, which we develop in the context of nonlocal equations and which is quite different from the local theory.
  As an application of our results, we establish sharp two-sided Green functions estimates in $C^{1,\alpha}$ domains for the same class of operators. Previously, this was only known under additional structural assumptions on the coefficients and in more regular domains.</description>

      <title>CT scans without X-rays: parallel-beam imaging from nonlinear current flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel-beam X-ray computed tomography (CT) and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) are two imaging modalities which stem from completely different underlying physics, and for decades have been thought to have little in common either practically or mathematically. CT is only mildly ill-posed and uses straight X-rays as measurement energy, which admits simple linear mathematics. However, CT relies on exposing targets to ionizing radiation and requires cumbersome setups with expensive equipment. In contrast, EIT uses harmless electrical currents as measurement energy and can be implemented using simple low-cost portable setups. But EIT is burdened by nonlinearity stemming from the curved paths of electrical currents, as well as extreme ill-posedness which causes characteristic low spatial resolution. In practical EIT reconstruction methods, nonlinearity and ill-posedness have been considered intertwined in a complicated fashion. In this work we demonstrate a surprising connection between CT and EIT which partly unravels the main problems of EIT and leads directly to a proposed imaging modality which we call virtual hybrid parallel-beam tomography (VHPT). We show that hidden deep within EIT data is information which possesses the same linear geometry as parallel-beam CT data. This admits a fundamental restructuring of EIT, separating ill-posedness and nonlinearity into simple modular sub-problems, and yields ''virtual radiographs'' and CT-like images which reveal previously concealed information. Furthermore, as proof of concept we present VHPT images of real-world objects.</description>

      <title>The non-convex planar Least Gradient Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the least gradient problem in bounded regions with Lipschitz boundary in the plane. We provide a set of conditions for the existence of solutions in non-convex simply connected regions. We assume the boundary data is continuous and in the space of functions of bounded variation, and we are interested in solutions that satisfy the boundary conditions in the trace sense. Our method relies on the equivalence of the least gradient problem and the Beckman problem which allows us to use the tools of the optimal transportation theory.</description>

      <title>On a $T_3$-Structure in Geometrically Linearized Elasticity: Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis and Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rigidity properties of the $T_3$-structure for the symmetrized gradient from \cite{BFJK94} qualitatively, quantitatively and numerically. More precisely, we complement the flexibility result for approximate solutions of the associated differential inclusion which was deduced in \cite{BFJK94} by a rigidity result on the level of exact solutions and by a quantitative rigidity estimate and scaling result. The $T_3$-structure for the symmetrized gradient from \cite{BFJK94} can hence be regarded as a symmetrized gradient analogue of the Tartar square for the gradient. As such a structure cannot exist in $\mathbb{R}^{2\times 2}_{sym}$ the example from \cite{BFJK94} is in this sense minimal. We complement our theoretical findings with numerical simulations of the resulting microstructure.</description>

      <title>On the attractor for 2D Navier-Stokes-like system with the dynamic slip boundary condition in a channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a 2D infinite channel domain with an incompressible fluid satisfying the so-called dynamic slip boundary condition on the (part of the) boundary. Introducing an exhaustion by a sequence of bounded sub-domains of the whole channel we show that the unique weak solution is strong. We then construct the global attractor and find an explicit upper bound of its fractal dimension with regard to the physical parameters. This result is compatible with the analogous estimate in the case of the Dirichlet boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Radiall symmetry of minimizers to the weighted $p-$Dirichlet energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{A}=\{z: r&lt; |z|&lt;R\}$ and $\A^\ast=\{z: r^\ast&lt;|z|&lt;R^\ast\}$ be annuli in the complex plane. Let $p\in[1,2]$ and assume that $\mathcal{H}^{1,p}(\A,\A^*)$ is the class of Sobolev homeomorphisms between $\A$ and $\A^*$, $h:\A\onto \A^*$. Then we consider the following Dirichlet type energy of $h$: $$\mathcal{F}_p[h]=\int_{\A(1,r)}\frac{\|Dh\|^p}{|h|^p}, \ \ 1\le p\le 2.$$ We prove that this energy integral attains its minimum, and the minimum is a certain radial diffeomorphism $h:\A\onto \A^*$, provided a radial diffeomorphic minimizer exists. If $p&gt;1$ then such diffeomorphism exist always. If $p=1$, then the conformal modulus of $\A^\ast$ must not be greater or equal to $\pi/2$. This curious phenomenon is opposite to the Nitsche type phenomenon known for the standard Dirichlet energy.</description>

      <title>Existence of global weak solutions to quasilinear theory for electrostatic plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasilinear theory has been widely used to describe the resonant particle-wave interaction in plasmas. It is a reduced model which originated from the Vlasov-Poisson/Maxwell system in weak turbulence regime under random phase approximation and ergodicity assumptions. The system consists of particles and waves (plasmons) coupled with each other through a resonance condition relating the momentum space and the spectral space. The electrostatic case, i.e. the model originating from Vlasov-Poisson system, is the most fundamental and representative one. In this paper, we prove the existence of global weak solutions to this system modeling electrostatic plasmas in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Quantitative 2D propagation of smallness and control for 1D heat equations with power growth potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relation between propagation of smallness in the plane and control for heat equations. The former has been proved by Zhu who showed how the value of solutions in some small set propagates to a larger domain. By reviewing his proof, we establish a quantitative version with the explicit dependence of parameters. Using this explicit version, we establish new exact null-controllability results of 1D heat equations with any nonnegative power growth potentials $V\in\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R})$. As a key ingredient, new spectral inequalities are established. The control set $\Omega$ that we consider satisfy \begin{equation*}
  \left|\Omega\cap [x-L\langle x\rangle ^{-s},x+L\langle x\rangle ^{-s}]\right|\ge \gamma^{\langle x\rangle^\tau}2L\langle x\rangle^{-s} \end{equation*} for some $\gamma\in(0,1)$, $L&gt;0$, $\tau,s\ge 0$, and $\langle x\rangle:=(1+|x|^2)^{1 /2} $. In particular, the null-controllability result for the case of thick sets that allow the decay of the density (\textit{i.e.}, $s=0$ and $\tau\ge 0$) is included. These extend the Zhu-Zhuge's results from $\Omega$ being the union of equidistributive open sets to thick sets in the 1-dimensional case, and Su-Sun-Yuan's result from bounded potentials to certain unbounded ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singular fourth-order Abreu equations have been used to approximate minimizers of convex functionals subject to a convexity constraint in dimensions higher than or equal to two. For Abreu type equations, they often exhibit different solvability phenomena in dimension one and dimensions at least two. We prove the analogues of these results for the variational problem and singular Abreu equations in dimension one, and use the approximation scheme to obtain a characterization of limiting minimizers to the one-dimensional variational problem.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the Sobolev inequality on noncommutative Euclidean spaces. As a simple consequence, we obtain the Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequality and as its application we show global well-posedness of nonlinear PDEs in the noncommutative Euclidean space. Moreover, we show that the logarithmic Sobolev inequality is equivalent to the Nash inequality for possibly different constants in this noncommutative setting by completing the list in noncommutative Varopoulos's theorem in [37]. Finally, we present a direct application of the Nash inequality to compute the time decay for solutions of the heat equation in the noncommutative setting.</description>

      <title>The $\hbar\to 0$ limit of open quantum systems with general Lindbladians: vanishing noise ensures classicality beyond the Ehrenfest time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum and classical systems evolving under the same formal Hamiltonian $H$ may exhibit dramatically different behavior after the Ehrenfest timescale $t_E \sim \log(\hbar^{-1})$, even as $\hbar \to 0$. Coupling the system to a Markovian environment results in a Lindblad equation for the quantum evolution. Its classical counterpart is given by the Fokker-Planck equation on phase space, which describes Hamiltonian flow with friction and diffusive noise. The quantum and classical evolutions may be compared via the Wigner-Weyl representation. Due to decoherence, they are conjectured to match closely for times far beyond the Ehrenfest timescale as $\hbar \to 0$. We prove a version of this correspondence, bounding the error between the quantum and classical evolutions for any sufficiently regular Hamiltonian $H(x,p)$ and Lindblad functions $L_k(x,p)$. The error is small when the strength of the diffusion $D$ associated to the Lindblad functions satisfies $D \gg \hbar^{4/3}$, in particular allowing vanishing noise in the classical limit. We use a time-dependent semiclassical mixture of variably squeezed Gaussian states evolving by a local harmonic approximation to the Lindblad dynamics. Both the exact quantum trajectory and its classical counterpart can be expressed as perturbations of this semiclassical mixture, with the errors bounded using Duhamel's principle. We present heuristic arguments suggesting the $4/3$ exponent is optimal and defines a boundary in the sense that asymptotically weaker diffusion permits a breakdown of quantum-classical correspondence at the Ehrenfest timescale. Our presentation aims to be comprehensive and accessible to both mathematicians and physicists. In a shorter companion paper, we treat the special case of Hamiltonians of the form $H=p^2/(2m) + V(x)$ and linear Lindblad operators, with explicit bounds that can be applied directly to physical systems.</description>

Abstract: While it is known that Hamiltonian systems may undergo a phenomenon of condensation akin to Bose-Einstein condensation, not all the manifestations of this phenomenon have been uncovered yet. In this work we present a novel form of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems that stands out due to its evolution through highly coherent states. The result is based on a deterministic approach to obtain exact explicit solutions representing the dynamical formation of condensates in finite time. We reveal a dual-cascade behavior during the process, featuring inverse and direct transfer of conserved quantities across the spectrum. The direct cascade yields the excitation of arbitrarily high modes in finite time, being associated with the formation of a small-scale coherent structure. We provide a fully analytic description of the processes involved.</description>
