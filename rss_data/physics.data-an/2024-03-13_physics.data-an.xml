      <title>Killing versus branching: Unexplored facets of diffusive relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the relaxation dynamics of Feynman-Kac path integral kernel functions in terms of branching diffusion processes with killing. This sheds new light on the admissible path-wise description of the relaxation to equilibrium for conditioned Brownian motions, and diffusion processes with absorbing boundaries, where Feynman-Kac kernels appear as the building blocks of inferred transition probability density functions.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Variability of the Nocturnal Boundary Layer through Localized Perturbation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A single-column model is used to investigate regime transitions within the stable atmospheric boundary layer, focusing on the role of small-scale fluctuations in wind and temperature dynamics and of turbulence intermittency as triggers for these transitions. Previous studies revealed abrupt near-surface temperature inversion transitions within a limited wind speed range. However, representing these transitions in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models is a known difficulty. To shed light on boundary layer processes that explain these abrupt transitions, the Ekman layer height and its correlation with regime shifts are analyzed. A sensitivity study is performed with several types of perturbations of the wind and temperature tendencies, as well as with the inclusion of intermittent turbulent mixing through a stochastic stability function, to quantify the effect of small fluctuations of the dynamics on regime transitions. The combined results for all tested perturbation types indicate that small-scale phenomena can drive persistent regime transitions from very to weakly stable regimes, but for the opposite direction, no evidence of persistent regime transitions was found. The inclusion of intermittency prevents the model from getting trapped in the very stable regime, thus preventing the so-called "runaway cooling", an issue for commonly used short-tail stability functions. The findings suggest that using stochastic parameterizations of boundary layer processes, either through stochastically perturbed tendencies or parameters, is an effective approach to represent sharp transitions in the boundary layer regimes and is, therefore, a promising avenue to improve the representation of stable boundary layers in NWP and climate models.</description>

      <title>Minimal cellular automaton model with heterogeneous cell sizes predicts epithelial colony growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regulation of cell proliferation is a crucial aspect of tissue development and homeostasis and plays a major role in morphogenesis, wound healing, and tumor invasion. A phenomenon of such regulation is contact inhibition, which describes the dramatic slowing of proliferation, cell migration and individual cell growth when multiple cells are in contact with each other. While many physiological, molecular and genetic factors are known, the mechanism of contact inhibition is still not fully understood. In particular, the relevance of cellular signaling due to interfacial contact for contact inhibition is still debated. Cellular automata (CA) have been employed in the past as numerically efficient mathematical models to study the dynamics of cell ensembles, but they are not suitable to explore the origins of contact inhibition as such agent-based models assume fixed cell sizes. We develop a minimal, data-driven model to simulate the dynamics of planar cell cultures by extending a probabilistic CA to incorporate size changes of individual cells during growth and cell division. We successfully apply this model to previous in-vitro experiments on contact inhibition in epithelial tissue: After a systematic calibration of the model parameters to measurements of single-cell dynamics, our CA model quantitatively reproduces independent measurements of emergent, culture-wide features, like colony size, cell density and collective cell migration. In particular, the dynamics of the CA model also exhibit the transition from a low-density confluent regime to a stationary postconfluent regime with a rapid decrease in cell size and motion. This implies that the volume exclusion principle, a mechanical constraint which is the only inter-cellular interaction incorporated in the model, paired with a size-dependent proliferation rate is sufficient to generate the observed contact inhibition.</description>

      <title>Towards a Unified Formalism of Multivariate Coefficients of Variation -- Application to the Analysis of Polarimetric Speckle Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article primarily aims to unify the various formalisms of multivariate coefficients of variation, leveraging advanced concepts of generalized means, whether weighted or not, applied to the eigenvalues of covariance matrices. We highlight the existence of an infinite number of these coefficients and demonstrate that they are bounded. Moreover, we link the various coefficients of variation identified in the literature to specific instances within our unified formalism. We illustrate the utility of our method by applying it to a time series of polarimetric radar imagery. In this context, the coefficient of variation emerges as a key tool for detecting changes or identifying permanent scatterers, which are characterized by their remarkable temporal stability. The multidimensionality arises from the diversity of polarizations. The introduction of the various possible coefficients demonstrates how their selection impacts the detection of samples exhibiting specific temporal behaviors and underscores the contribution of polarimetry to dynamic speckle analysis.</description>

      <title>Innovation Processes for Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urn models for innovation have proven to capture fundamental empirical laws shared by several real-world processes. The so-called urn model with triggering includes, as particular cases, an urn representation of the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet process and the Dirichlet process, seminal in Bayesian non-parametric inference. In this work, we leverage this connection to introduce a novel approach for quantifying closeness between symbolic sequences and test it within the framework of the authorship attribution problem. The method demonstrates high accuracy when compared to other state-of-the-art methods in different scenarios, featuring a substantial gain in computational efficiency and theoretical transparency. Beyond the practical convenience, this work demonstrates how the recently established connection between urn models and non-parametric Bayesian inference can pave the way for designing more efficient inference methods. In particular, the hybrid approach that we propose allows us to relax the exchangeability hypothesis, which can be particularly relevant for systems exhibiting complex correlation patterns and non-stationary dynamics.</description>
