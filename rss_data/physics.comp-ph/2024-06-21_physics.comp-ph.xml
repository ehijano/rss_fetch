      <title>Double PN Benchmark Solution for the 1D Monoenergetic Neutron Transport Equation in Plane Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As more and more numerical and analytical solutions to the linear neutron transport equation become available, verification of numerical results is increasingly important. This presentation concerns the development of another benchmark for the linear neutron transport equation. There are numerous ways of solving the transport equation, such as the Wiener-Hopf method based on analyticity, method of singular eigenfunctions, Laplace and Fourier transforms and ana-lytical discrete ordinates, which is arguably one of the most straightforward, to name a few. Another potential method is the PN method, where the solution is expanded in terms of full range orthogonal Legendre polynomials and with orthogonality and truncation, the moments form a set of second order ODEs. Because of the half-range boundary conditions for incoming particles however, full range Legendre expansions are inaccurate near material discontinuities. For this reason, a double PN (DPN) expansion is more appropriate, where the incoming and exiting flux distributions are expanded separately to preserve the discontinuity at material interfaces. Here, a new method of solution for the DPN equations is proposed and demonstrated for an isotropically scattering medium.</description>

      <title>Point containment algorithms for constructive solid geometry with unbounded primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present several algorithms for evaluating point containment in constructive solid geometry (CSG) trees with unbounded primitives. Three algorithms are presented based on postfix, prefix, and infix notations of the CSG binary expression tree. We show that prefix and infix notations enable short-circuiting logic, which reduces the number of primitives that must be checked during point containment. To evaluate the performance of the algorithms, each algorithm was implemented in the OpenMC Monte Carlo particle transport code, which relies on CSG to represent solid bodies through which subatomic particles travel. Two sets of tests were carried out. First, the execution time to generate a high-resolution rasterized image of a 2D slice of a detailed CSG model of the ITER tokamak was measured. Use of both prefix and infix notations offered significant speedup over the postfix notation that has traditionally been used in particle transport codes, with infix resulting in a 6$\times$ reduction in execution time relative to postfix. We then measured the execution time of neutron transport simulations of the same ITER model using each of the algorithms. The results and performance improvements reveal the same trends as for the rasterization test, with a 4.59$\times$ overall speedup using the infix notation relative to the original postfix notation in OpenMC.</description>

      <title>Critical temperature of the classical XY model via autoencoder latent space sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical XY model has been consistently studied since it was introduced more than six decades ago. Of particular interest has been the two-dimensional spin model's exhibition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This topological phenomenon describes the transition from bound vortex-antivortex pairs at low temperatures to unpaired or isolated vortices and anti-vortices above some critical temperature. In this work we propose a novel machine learning based method to determine the emergence of this phase transition. An autoencoder was used to map states of the XY model into a lower dimensional latent space. Samples were taken from this latent space to determine the thermal average of the vortex density which was then used to determine the critical temperature of the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Flow and clogging of capillary droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capillary droplets form due to surface tension when two immiscible fluids are mixed. We describe the motion of gravity-driven capillary droplets flowing through narrow constrictions and obstacle arrays in both simulations and experiments. Our new capillary deformable particle model recapitulates the shape and velocity of single oil droplets in water as they pass through narrow constrictions in microfluidic chambers. Using this experimentally validated model, we simulate the flow and clogging of single capillary droplets in narrow channels and obstacle arrays and find several important results. First, the capillary droplet speed profile is nonmonotonic as the droplet exits the narrow orifice, and we can tune the droplet properties so that the speed overshoots the terminal speed far from the constriction. Second, in obstacle arrays, we find that extremely deformable droplets can wrap around obstacles, which leads to decreased average droplet speed in the continuous flow regime and increased probability for clogging in the regime where permanent clogs form. Third, the wrapping mechanism causes the clogging probability in obstacle arrays to become nonmonotonic with surface tension $\Gamma$. At large $\Gamma$, the droplets are nearly rigid and the clogging probability is large since the droplets can not squeeze through the gaps between obstacles. With decreasing $\Gamma$, the clogging probability decreases as the droplets become more deformable. However, in the small-$\Gamma$ limit the clogging probability increases, since the droplets are extremely deformable and cause clogs as they wrap around the obstacles. The results from these studies are important for developing a predictive understanding of capillary droplet flows through complex and confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Elasticity and acoustic velocities of $\delta$-AlOOH at extreme conditions: a methodology assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrous phases play a fundamental role in the deep-water cycle on Earth. Understanding their stability and thermoelastic properties is essential for constraining their abundance using seismic tomography. However, determining their elastic properties at extreme conditions is notoriously challenging. The challenges stem from the complex behavior of hydrogen bonds under high pressures and temperatures (P,Ts). In this study, we evaluate how advanced molecular dynamics simulation techniques can address these challenges by investigating the adiabatic elasticity and acoustic velocities of $\delta$-AlOOH, a critical and prototypical high-pressure hydrous phase. We compared the performances of three methods to assess their viability and accuracy. The thermoelastic tensor was computed up to 140 GPa and temperatures up to 2,700 K using molecular dynamics with a DeePMD machine-learning interatomic potential based on the SCAN meta-GGA functional. The excellent agreement with ambient condition single-crystal ultrasound measurements and the correct description of velocity changes induced by H-bond disorder-symmetrization transition observed at 10 GPa in Brillouin scattering measurements underscores the accuracy and efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>A variational method for the simulation of hydrogen diffusion in metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for the approximate solution of the strongly coupled, nonlinear stress-diffusion problem that appears when modeling hydrogen transport in metals. The most salient feature of the proposed approximation is that it is fully variational, meaning that all the discrete equations are obtained from the optimality conditions of an incremental potential, even for inelastic mechanical behavior. Like other variational methods, the proposed algorithm has remarkable properties, including the symmetry of the tangent operator, making its solution extremely efficient compared to other similar methods available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Meent: Differentiable Electromagnetic Simulator for Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) simulation plays a crucial role in analyzing and designing devices with sub-wavelength scale structures such as solar cells, semiconductor devices, image sensors, future displays and integrated photonic devices. Specifically, optics problems such as estimating semiconductor device structures and designing nanophotonic devices provide intriguing research topics with far-reaching real world impact. Traditional algorithms for such tasks require iteratively refining parameters through simulations, which often yield sub-optimal results due to the high computational cost of both the algorithms and EM simulations. Machine learning (ML) emerged as a promising candidate to mitigate these challenges, and optics research community has increasingly adopted ML algorithms to obtain results surpassing classical methods across various tasks. To foster a synergistic collaboration between the optics and ML communities, it is essential to have an EM simulation software that is user-friendly for both research communities. To this end, we present Meent, an EM simulation software that employs rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA). Developed in Python and equipped with automatic differentiation (AD) capabilities, Meent serves as a versatile platform for integrating ML into optics research and vice versa. To demonstrate its utility as a research platform, we present three applications of Meent: 1) generating a dataset for training neural operator, 2) serving as an environment for the reinforcement learning of nanophotonic device optimization, and 3) providing a solution for inverse problems with gradient-based optimizers. These applications highlight Meent's potential to advance both EM simulation and ML methodologies. The code is available at https://github.com/kc-ml2/meent with the MIT license to promote the cross-polinations of ideas among academic researchers and industry practitioners.</description>

      <title>Scalable Training of Graph Foundation Models for Atomistic Materials Modeling: A Case Study with HydraGNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our work on developing and training scalable graph foundation models (GFM) using HydraGNN, a multi-headed graph convolutional neural network architecture. HydraGNN expands the boundaries of graph neural network (GNN) in both training scale and data diversity. It abstracts over message passing algorithms, allowing both reproduction of and comparison across algorithmic innovations that define convolution in GNNs. This work discusses a series of optimizations that have allowed scaling up the GFM training to tens of thousands of GPUs on datasets that consist of hundreds of millions of graphs. Our GFMs use multi-task learning (MTL) to simultaneously learn graph-level and node-level properties of atomistic structures, such as the total energy and atomic forces. Using over 150 million atomistic structures for training, we illustrate the performance of our approach along with the lessons learned on two United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) supercomputers, namely the Perlmutter petascale system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Frontier exascale system at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The HydraGNN architecture enables the GFM to achieve near-linear strong scaling performance using more than 2,000 GPUs on Perlmutter and 16,000 GPUs on Frontier. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) was performed on over 64,000 GPUs on Frontier to select GFM architectures with high accuracy. Early stopping was applied on each GFM architecture for energy awareness in performing such an extreme-scale task. The training of an ensemble of highest-ranked GFM architectures continued until convergence to establish uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities with ensemble learning. Our contribution opens the door for rapidly developing, training, and deploying GFMs using large-scale computational resources to enable AI-accelerated materials discovery and design.</description>

      <title>Electric field enhances the electronic and diffusion properties of penta-graphene nanoribbons for application in lithium-ion batteries: a first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the electronic and diffusion properties of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for improving the performance of the fast-growing energy storage devices. Here we use first principles methods with density functional theory and the climbing image-nudged elastic band method to evaluate the impact of an external electric field on the stability, electronic and diffusion properties of penta-graphene nanoribbons upon lithium adsorption. We show that by adsorbing a lithium atom, these semiconductor nanoribbons become metal with a formation energy of -0.22 (eV). The diffusion coefficient of this material is five orders of magnitude higher than that of a common carbon graphite layer. Under a relatively small vertical electric field, these lithium-ion systems are even more stable, and their diffusion coefficient is enhanced significantly of 711 times higher than that of the material in the absence of an applied electric field and 520 times higher than in the case of commercial graphitic carbon layers. Our results highlight the role of an external electric field as a novel switch to improve the efficiency of lithium-ion batteries with penta-graphene nanoribbon electrodes and open a new horizon for the use of more environmentally friendly pentagonal materials as electrode materials in lithium-ion battery industry.</description>

      <title>Genetics-based deperturbation analysis for the spin-orbit coupled ${\rm A}^1\Sigma^+$ and ${\rm b}^3\Pi_{0^+}$ states of LiRb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a deperturbation analysis of the spin-orbit coupled $\rm A^1\Sigma^+$ and $\rm b^3\Pi_{0^+}$ states of LiRb based on the rovibrational energy levels observed previously by photoassociation spectroscopy in bosonic $^7$Li$^{85}$Rb molecule. Using the genetic algorithm, we fit the potential energy curves of the $\rm A^1\Sigma^+$ state and the $\rm b^3\Pi$ state into point-wise form. We then fit these point-wise potentials along with the spin-orbit coupling into expanded Morse oscillator functional form and optimise analytical parameters based on the experimental data. From the fitted results, we calculate the transition dipole moment matrix elements for transitions from the rovibrational levels of the coupled $\rm A^1\Sigma^+$-$\rm b^3\Pi_{0^+}$ state to the Feshbach state and the absolute rovibrational ground state for fermionic $^6$Li$^{87}$Rb molecule. Based on the calculated transition dipole moment matrix elements, several levels of the coupled $\rm A^1\Sigma^+$-$\rm b^3\Pi_{0^+}$ state are predicted to be suitable as the intermediate state for stimulated Raman adiabatic passage transfer from the Feshbach state to the absolute rovibrational ground state. In addition, we also provide a similar estimation for ${\rm B}^1\Pi$-${\rm c}^3\Sigma_1^+$-${\rm b}^3\Pi_1$ state based on available $ab\ initio$ interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>Unifying Mixed Gas Adsorption in Molecular Sieve Membranes and MOFs using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent machine learning models to accurately obtain gas adsorption isotherms focus on polymers or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) separately. The difficulty in creating a unified model that can predict the adsorption trends in both types of adsorbents is challenging, owing to the diversity in their chemical structures. Moreover, models trained only on single gas adsorption data are incapable of predicting adsorption isotherms for binary gas mixtures. In this work, we address these problems using feature vectors comprising only the physical properties of the gas mixtures and adsorbents. Our model is trained on adsorption isotherms of both single and binary mixed gases inside carbon molecular sieving membrane (CMSM), together with data available from CoRE MOF database. The trained models are capable of accurately predicting the adsorption trends in both classes of materials, for both pure and binary components. ML architecture designed for one class of material, is not suitable for predicting the other class, even after proper training, signifying that the model must be trained jointly for proper predictions and transferability. The model is used to predict with good accuracy the CO2 uptake inside CALF-20 framework. This work opens up a new avenue for predicting complex adsorption processes for gas mixtures in a wide range of materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Networks: from Multipartite Entanglement to Hypergraph Immersion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement, a higher-order interaction unique to quantum information, offers various advantages over bipartite entanglement in quantum network (QN) applications. Establishing multipartite entanglement across remote parties in QN requires entanglement routing, which irreversibly transforms the QN topology at the cost of existing entanglement links. Here, we address the question of whether a QN can be topologically transformed into another via entanglement routing. Our key result is an exact mapping from multipartite entanglement routing to Nash-Williams's graph immersion problem, extended to hypergraphs. This generalized hypergraph immersion problem introduces a partial order between QN topologies, permitting certain topological transformations while precluding others, offering discerning insights into the design and manipulation of higher-order network topologies in QNs.</description>

      <title>Simulation of sympathetic cooling efficiency in a linear Paul trap driven by alternative waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooling of ions or other charged particles in electromagnetic traps is an essential tool to achieve control over their degrees of freedom on the quantum level. For many objects, there is no viable route for direct cooling, such as an accessible laser cooling transition. In such a case, the sympathetic cooling can be used, where a particle with such a direct route is used to cool down the other particle via Coulomb interaction. On the downside, this cooling process often is inefficient. Here, we numerically evaluate the sympathetic cooling performance in a quadrupole ion trap for different driving waveforms. We find that using different driving waveforms and optimized trap parameters the sympathetic cooling performance can be enhanced. These results will open up the way to achieve larger sympathetic cooling rates from which many techniques, such as aluminum ion clocks, might profit.</description>

      <title>Topological Solitons in Square-root Graphene Nanoribbons Controlled by Electric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are unique quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials that have garnered a lot of research interest in the field of topological insulators. While the topological phases exhibited by GNRs are primarily governed by their chemical structures, the ability to externally control these phases is crucial for their potential utilization in quantum electronics and spintronics. Here we propose a class of GNRs featured by mirror symmetry and four zigzag segments in a unit cell that has unique topological properties induced and controlled by an externally applied electric field. Their band structures manifest two finite gaps which support topological solitons, as described by an effective square-root model. To demonstrate the experimental feasibility, we design and synthesize a representative partially zigzag chevron-type GNR (pzc-GNR) with the desired zigzag segments using a bottom-up approach. First-principles calculations on pzc-GNR reveal band inversions at the two finite gaps by switching the direction of the electric field, which is in accordance with predictions from the square-root Hamiltonian. We show different topological phases can be achieved by controlling the direction of the field and the chemical potential of the system in square-root GNRs. Consequently, upon adding a step-function electric field, solitons states can be generated at the domain wall. We discuss the properties of two types of soliton states, depending on whether the terminating commensurate unit cell is mirror symmetric.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional, One-Phase and Two-Phase Eulerian Explicit Shock Tube Simulation Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a one-dimensional simulation code was developed for both single-phase and two-phase systems, focusing on time-dependent Euler equations for gas and particles. These equations, non-linear hyperbolic conservation laws, describe the dynamics of compressible materials, where body forces, viscous stresses, and heat flux are neglected. The Euler equations were discretized using the finite volume method, and the code was written in MATLAB. To test the accuracy of the computational fluid code, the Sod shock tube problem, a physical analogue of the Riemann problem, was employed. This problem models a pressure discontinuity where high and low-pressure regions are separated by a diaphragm, which breaks at t=0, creating a discontinuity in density as well. Exact solutions were used for code verification. A key focus was on modeling a curtain of particles impacted by a shock wave, relevant to multiphase heterogeneous cylindrical explosion studies by the PSAAP II project. This initiative, funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Office of Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC), involves Sandia National Laboratories and the Center for Compressible Multiphase Turbulence at the University of Florida. The propagation of uncertainties in the maximum density of the particle curtain was studied by varying initial curtain thickness and initial high density. Given the computational expense of multiple code evaluations for uncertainty propagation, a multi-fidelity surrogate model combining low and high-fidelity simulations was implemented. This model facilitated uncertainty propagation using DAKOTA, a flexible and extensible interface between analysis codes and iterative systems analysis methods.</description>

      <title>Delving into the Catalytic Mechanism of Molybdenum Cofactors: A Novel Coupled Cluster Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we use modern electronic structure methods to model the catalytic mechanism of different variants of the molybdenum cofactor (Moco). We investigate the dependence of various Moco model systems on structural relaxation and the importance of environmental effects for five critical points along the reaction coordinate with the DMSO and NO$_3^-$ substrates. Furthermore, we scrutinize the performance of various coupled-cluster approaches for modeling the relative energies along the investigated reaction paths, focusing on several pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) flavors and conventional coupled cluster approximations. Moreover, we elucidate the Mo--O bond formation using orbital-based quantum information measures, which highlight the flow of $\sigma_{\rm M-O}$ bond formation and $\sigma_{\rm N/S-O}$ bond breaking. Our study shows that pCCD-based models are a viable alternative to conventional methods and offer us unique insights into the bonding situation along a reaction coordinate. Finally, this work highlights the importance of environmental effects or changes in the core and, consequently, in the model itself to elucidate the change in activity of different Moco variants.</description>

      <title>A differentiable quantum phase estimation algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of electronic properties is a pivotal issue in modern electronic structure theory, driving significant efforts over the past decades to develop protocols for computing energy derivatives. In this work, we address this problem by developing a strategy to integrate the quantum phase estimation algorithm within a fully differentiable framework. This is accomplished by devising a smooth estimator able to tackle arbitrary initial states. We provide analytical expressions to characterize the statistics and algorithmic cost of this estimator. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence that the estimation accuracy is retained when an arbitrary state is considered and that it exceeds the one of standard majority rule. We explicitly use this procedure to estimate chemically relevant quantities, demonstrating our approach through ground-state and triplet excited state geometry optimization with simulations involving up to 19 qubits. This work paves the way for new quantum algorithms that combine interference methods and quantum differentiable programming.</description>

      <title>Transferable Boltzmann Generators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of equilibrium samples of molecular systems has been a long-standing problem in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators are a generative machine learning method that addresses this issue by learning a transformation via a normalizing flow from a simple prior distribution to the target Boltzmann distribution of interest. Recently, flow matching has been employed to train Boltzmann Generators for small molecular systems in Cartesian coordinates. We extend this work and propose a first framework for Boltzmann Generators that are transferable across chemical space, such that they predict zero-shot Boltzmann distributions for test molecules without being retrained for these systems. These transferable Boltzmann Generators allow approximate sampling from the target distribution of unseen systems, as well as efficient reweighting to the target Boltzmann distribution. The transferability of the proposed framework is evaluated on dipeptides, where we show that it generalizes efficiently to unseen systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed architecture enhances the efficiency of Boltzmann Generators trained on single molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling up global kinetic models of pulsar magnetospheres using a hybrid force-free-PIC numerical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle-in-cell approach has proven effective at modeling neutron star and black hole magnetospheres from first principles, but global simulations are plagued with an unrealistically small separation between the scales where microphysics operates and the system-size scales due to limited numerical resources. A legitimate concern is whether the scale separation currently achieved is large enough, such that results can be safely extrapolated to realistic scales. In this work, our aim is to explore the effect of scaling physical parameters up, and to check whether salient features uncovered by pure kinetic models at smaller scales are still valid, with a special emphasis on particle acceleration and high-energy radiation emitted beyond the light cylinder. To reach this objective, we develop a new hybrid numerical scheme coupling the ideal force-free and the particle-in-cell methods, to optimize the numerical cost of global models. We propose a domain decomposition of the magnetosphere based on the magnetic field topology using the flux function. The force-free model is enforced along open field lines while the particle-in-cell model is restricted to the reconnecting field line region. As a proof of concept, this new hybrid model is applied to simulate a weak millisecond pulsar magnetosphere with realistic scales using high-resolution axisymmetric simulations. Magnetospheric features reported by previous kinetic models are recovered, and strong synchrotron radiation above 100MeV consistent with the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray pulsar population is successfully reproduced. This work further consolidates the shining reconnecting current sheet scenario as the origin of the gamma-ray emission in pulsars, as well as firmly establishes pulsar magnetospheres as at least TeV particle accelerators.</description>

Abstract: Version 13 of XtalOpt, an evolutionary algorithm for crystal structure prediction, is now available for download from the CPC program library or the XtalOpt website, https://xtalopt.github.io. In the new version of the XtalOpt code, a general platform for multi-objective global optimization is implemented. This functionality is designed to facilitate the search for (meta)stable phases of functional materials through minimization of the enthalpy of a crystalline system coupled with the simultaneous optimization of any desired properties that are specified by the user. The code is also able to perform a constrained search by filtering the parent pool of structures based on a user-specified feature, while optimizing multiple objectives. Here, we present the implementation and various technical details, and we provide a brief overview of additional improvements that have been introduced in the new version of XtalOpt.</description>

      <title>Validating Automated Resonance Evaluation with Synthetic Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integrity and precision of nuclear data are crucial for a broad spectrum of applications, from national security and nuclear reactor design to medical diagnostics, where the associated uncertainties can significantly impact outcomes. A substantial portion of uncertainty in nuclear data originates from the subjective biases in the evaluation process, a crucial phase in the nuclear data production pipeline. Recent advancements indicate that automation of certain routines can mitigate these biases, thereby standardizing the evaluation process, reducing uncertainty and enhancing reproducibility. This article contributes to developing a framework for automated evaluation techniques testing, emphasizing automated fitting methods that do not require the user to provide any prior information. This approach simplifies the process and reduces the manual effort needed in the initial evaluation stage. It highlights the capability of the framework to validate and optimize subroutines, targeting the performance analysis and optimization of the fitting procedure using high-fidelity synthetic data (labeled experimental data) and the concept of a fully controlled computational experiment. An error metric is introduced to provide a clear and intuitive measure of the fitting quality by quantifying the accuracy and performance across the specified energy. This metric sets a scale for comparison and optimization of routines or hyperparameter selection, improving the entire evaluation process methodology and increasing reproducibility and objectivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computational fluid dynamics (QCFD) offers a promising alternative to classical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) by leveraging quantum algorithms for higher efficiency. This paper introduces a comprehensive QCFD method, including an iterative method "Iterative-QLS" that suppresses error in quantum linear solver, and a subspace method to scale the solution to a larger size. We implement our method on a superconducting quantum computer, demonstrating successful simulations of steady Poiseuille flow and unsteady acoustic wave propagation. The Poiseuille flow simulation achieved a relative error of less than $0.2\%$, and the unsteady acoustic wave simulation solved a 5043-dimensional matrix. We emphasize the utilization of the quantum-classical hybrid approach in applications of near-term quantum computers. By adapting to quantum hardware constraints and offering scalable solutions for large-scale CFD problems, our method paves the way for practical applications of near-term quantum computers in computational science.</description>

      <title>Right On Time: Ultrafast Charge Separation Before Hybrid Exciton Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organic/inorganic hybrid systems offer great potential for novel solar cell design combining the tunability of organic chromophore absorption properties with high charge carrier mobilities of inorganic semiconductors. However, often such material combinations do not show the expected performance: while ZnO, for example, basically exhibits all necessary properties for a successful application in light-harvesting, it was clearly outpaced by TiO$_2$ in terms of charge separation efficiency. The origin of this deficiency has long been debated. This study employs femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and many-body ab initio calculations to identify and quantify all elementary steps leading to the suppression of charge separation at an exemplary organic/ZnO interface. We demonstrate that charge separation indeed occurs efficiently on ultrafast (350 fs) timescales, but that electrons are recaptured at the interface on a 100 ps timescale and subsequently trapped in a strongly bound (0.7 eV) hybrid exciton state with a lifetime exceeding 5 $\mu$s. Thus, initially successful charge separation is followed by delayed electron capture at the interface, leading to apparently low charge separation efficiencies. This finding provides a sufficiently large timeframe for counter-measures in device design to successfully implement specifically ZnO and, moreover, invites material scientists to revisit charge separation in various kinds of previously discarded hybrid systems.</description>

Abstract: We propose a variational scheme to represent composite quantum systems using multiple parameterized functions of varying accuracies on both classical and quantum hardware. The approach follows the variational principle over the entire system, and is naturally suited for scenarios where an accurate description is only needed in a smaller subspace. We show how to include quantum devices as high-accuracy solvers on these correlated degrees of freedom, while handling the remaining contributions with a classical device. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the protocol on spin chains and small molecules and provide insights into its accuracy and computational cost.</description>

      <title>DynGMA: a robust approach for learning stochastic differential equations from data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning unknown stochastic differential equations (SDEs) from observed data is a significant and challenging task with applications in various fields. Current approaches often use neural networks to represent drift and diffusion functions, and construct likelihood-based loss by approximating the transition density to train these networks. However, these methods often rely on one-step stochastic numerical schemes, necessitating data with sufficiently high time resolution. In this paper, we introduce novel approximations to the transition density of the parameterized SDE: a Gaussian density approximation inspired by the random perturbation theory of dynamical systems, and its extension, the dynamical Gaussian mixture approximation (DynGMA). Benefiting from the robust density approximation, our method exhibits superior accuracy compared to baseline methods in learning the fully unknown drift and diffusion functions and computing the invariant distribution from trajectory data. And it is capable of handling trajectory data with low time resolution and variable, even uncontrollable, time step sizes, such as data generated from Gillespie's stochastic simulations. We then conduct several experiments across various scenarios to verify the advantages and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Cavity engineered phonon-mediated superconductivity in MgB$_2$ from first principles quantum electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong laser pulses can control superconductivity, inducing non-equilibrium transient pairing by leveraging strong-light matter interaction. Here we demonstrate theoretically that equilibrium ground-state phonon-mediated superconductive pairing can be affected through the vacuum fluctuating electromagnetic field in a cavity. Using the recently developed ab initio quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory approximation, we specifically investigate the phonon-mediated superconductive behavior of MgB$_2$ under different cavity setups and find that in the strong light-matter coupling regime its superconducting transition temperature can be, in principles, enhanced by $\approx 73\%$ ($\approx 40\%$) in an in-plane (out-of-plane) polarized cavity. However, in a realistic cavity, we expect the T$_{\rm{c}}$ of MgB$_2$ can increase, at most, by $5$ K via photon vacuum fluctuations. The results highlight that strong light-matter coupling in extended systems can profoundly alter material properties in a non-perturbative way by modifying their electronic structure and phononic dispersion at the same time. Our findings indicate a pathway to the experimental realization of light-controlled superconductivity in solid-state materials at equilibrium via cavity-material engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rabi oscillations have long been thought to be out of reach in simulations using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), a prominent symptom of the failure of the adiabatic approximation for non-perturbative dynamics. We present a reformulation of TDDFT which requires response quantities only, thus enabling an adiabatic approximation to predict such dynamics accurately because the functional is evaluated on a density close to the ground-state, instead of on the fully non-perturbative density. Our reformulation applies to it any real-time dynamics, redeeming TDDFT far from equilibrium. Examples of a resonantly-driven local excitation in a model He atom, and charge-transfer in the LiCN molecule are given.</description>

      <title>ICO learning as a measure of transient chaos in PT-symmetric Li\'enard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the implications of the unsupervised learning rule known as Input-Correlations (ICO) learning in the nonlinear dynamics of two linearly coupled PT-symmetric Li\'enard oscillators. The fixed points of the oscillator have been evaluated analytically and the Jacobian linearization is employed to study their stability. We find that on increasing the amplitude of the external periodic drive, the system exhibits period-doubling cascade to chaos within a specific parametric regime wherein we observe emergent chaotic dynamics. We further notice that the system indicates an intermittency route to chaos in the chaotic regime. Finally, in the period-4 regime of our bifurcation analysis, we predict the emergence of transient chaos which eventually settles down to a period-2 oscillator response which has been further validated by both the maximal Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) using the well-known Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization technique and the Hilbert Transform of the time-series. In the transiently chaotic regime, we deploy the ICO learning to analyze the time-series from which we identify that when the chaotic evolution transforms into periodic dynamics, the synaptic weight associated with the time-series of the loss oscillator exhibits stationary temporal evolution. This signifies that in the periodic regime, there is no overlap between the filtered signals obtained from the time-series of the coupled PT-symmetric oscillators. In addition, the temporal evolution of the weight associated with the stimulus mimics the behaviour of the Hilbert transform of the time-series.</description>
