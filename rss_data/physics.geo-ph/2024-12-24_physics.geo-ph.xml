      <title>Uncertainties of Satellite-based Essential Climate Variables from Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate uncertainty information associated with essential climate variables (ECVs) is crucial for reliable climate modeling and understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of the Earth system. In recent years, geoscience and climate scientists have benefited from rapid progress in deep learning to advance the estimation of ECV products with improved accuracy. However, the quantification of uncertainties associated with the output of such deep learning models has yet to be thoroughly adopted. This survey explores the types of uncertainties associated with ECVs estimated from deep learning and the techniques to quantify them. The focus is on highlighting the importance of quantifying uncertainties inherent in ECV estimates, considering the dynamic and multifaceted nature of climate data. The survey starts by clarifying the definition of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties and their roles in a typical satellite observation processing workflow, followed by bridging the gap between conventional statistical and deep learning views on uncertainties. Then, we comprehensively review the existing techniques for quantifying uncertainties associated with deep learning algorithms, focusing on their application in ECV studies. The specific need for modification to fit the requirements from both the Earth observation side and the deep learning side in such interdisciplinary tasks is discussed. Finally, we demonstrate our findings with two ECV examples, snow cover and terrestrial water storage, and provide our perspectives for future research.</description>

      <title>A Reproducible Method for Mapping Electricity Transmission Infrastructure for Space Weather Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space weather impact assessment is constrained by the lack of available asset information to undertake modeling of Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) in Extra High Voltage electricity infrastructure networks. The U.S. National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan identifies underutilized data as a central issue for improving risk assessment, motivating this research. Accurate GIC prediction is generally not possible without information on the electrical circuit, therefore we define a reproducible method based on open-source data, which enables risk analysts to collect their own substation component data. This process converts OpenStreetMap (OSM) substation locations to high-resolution, component-level mapping of electricity transmission assets by utilizing an innovative web-browser platform to facilitate component annotation. As a case study example, we convert an initial 1,313 high-voltage (&gt;115 kV) substations to 52,273 substation components via Google Earth APIs utilizing low-altitude, satellite, and Streetview imagery. We find that a total of 41,642 substation components (79.6%) connect to the highest substation voltage levels (&gt;345 kV) and are possibly susceptible to GIC, with a total of 7,949 transformers identified. Compared to the initial OSM baseline, we provide new detailed insights on voltage levels, line capacities, and substation configurations. Two validation workshops were undertaken to align the method and data with GIC assessment needs. The approach ensures consistency and rapid scalability, enabling users to quickly count components via a flexible web-browser application.</description>

      <title>On the Optimization of Singular Spectrum Analyses: A Pragmatic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) occupies a prominent place in the real signal analysis toolkit alongside Fourier and Wavelet analysis. In addition to the two aforementioned analyses, SSA allows the separation of patterns directly from the data space into the data space, with data that need not be strictly stationary, continuous, or even normally sampled. In most cases, SSA relies on a combination of Hankel or Toeplitz matrices and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Like Fourier and Wavelet analysis, SSA has its limitations. The main bottleneck of the method can be summarized in three points. The first is the diagonalization of the Hankel/Toeplitz matrix, which can become a major problem from a memory and/or computational point of view if the time series to be analyzed is very long or heavily sampled. The second point concerns the size of the analysis window, typically denoted as 'L', which will affect the detection of patterns in the time series as well as the dimensions of the Hankel/Toeplitz matrix. Finally, the third point concerns pattern reconstruction: how to easily identify in the eigenvector/eigenvalue space which patterns should be grouped. We propose to address each of these issues by describing a hopefully effective approach that we have been developing for over 10 years and that has yielded good results in our research work.</description>

      <title>Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs Anomaly Detection in NOAA's DART Time Series: A Machine Learning Approach for Enhancing Data Integrity for NASA's GRACE-FO Verification and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NOAA's Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) data are critical for NASA-JPL's tsunami detection, real-time operations, and oceanographic research. However, these time-series data often contain spikes, steps, and drifts that degrade data quality and obscure essential oceanographic features. To address these anomalies, the work introduces an Iterative Encoding-Decoding Variational Autoencoders (Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs) model to improve the quality of DART time series. Unlike traditional filtering and thresholding methods that risk distorting inherent signal characteristics, Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs progressively remove anomalies while preserving the data's latent structure. A hybrid thresholding approach further retains genuine oceanographic features near boundaries. Applied to complex DART datasets, this approach yields reconstructions that better maintain key oceanic properties compared to classical statistical techniques, offering improved robustness against spike removal and subtle step changes. The resulting high-quality data supports critical verification and validation efforts for the GRACE-FO mission at NASA-JPL, where accurate surface measurements are essential to modeling Earth's gravitational field and global water dynamics. Ultimately, this data processing method enhances tsunami detection and underpins future climate modeling with improved interpretability and reliability.</description>

      <title>Broadband Ground Motion Synthesis by Diffusion Model with Minimal Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earthquakes are rare. Hence there is a fundamental call for reliable methods to generate realistic ground motion data for data-driven approaches in seismology. Recent GAN-based methods fall short of the call, as the methods either require special information such as geological traits or generate subpar waveforms that fail to satisfy seismological constraints such as phase arrival times. We propose a specialized Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) that reliably generates realistic waveforms after learning from real earthquake data with minimal conditions: location and magnitude. We also design a domain-specific training method that exploits the traits of earthquake dataset: multiple observed waveforms time-aligned and paired to each earthquake source that are tagged with seismological metadata comprised of earthquake magnitude, depth of focus, and the locations of epicenter and seismometers. We construct the time-aligned earthquake dataset using Southern California Earthquake Data Center (SCEDC) API, and train our model with the dataset and our proposed training method for performance evaluation. Our model surpasses all comparable data-driven methods in various test criteria not only from waveform generation domain but also from seismology such as phase arrival time, GMPE analysis, and spectrum analysis. Our result opens new future research directions for deep learning applications in seismology.</description>

      <title>Turbulent spectrum of 2D internal gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the turbulent energy spectrum of weakly interacting 2D internal gravity waves using the full, non-hydrostatic dispersion relation. This spectrum is an exact solution of a regularized kinetic equation, from which the zero-frequency shear modes have been excised by a careful limiting process. This is a new method in wave kinetic theory. The turbulent spectrum agrees with the 2D oceanic Garrett--Munk spectrum for frequencies large compared to the Coriolis frequency and vertical scales small compared to the depth of the ocean. We show that this turbulent spectrum is the unique power law solution to the steady kinetic equation with a non-zero radial flux. Our solution provides an interesting insight into a turbulent energy cascade in an anisotropic system -- like isotropic turbulence it is self-similar in scale, but its angular part is peaked along the curve of vanishing frequency and is self-similar in frequency.</description>
