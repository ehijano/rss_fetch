      <title>Designing precise dynamical steady states in disordered networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elastic structures can be designed to exhibit precise, complex, and exotic functions. While recent work has focused on the quasistatic limit governed by force balance, the mechanics at a finite driving rate are governed by Newton's equations. The goal of this work is to study the feasibility, constraints, and implications of creating disordered structures with exotic properties in the dynamic regime. The dynamical regime offers responses that cannot be realized in quasistatics, such as responses at an arbitrary phase, frequency-selective responses, and history-dependent responses. We employ backpropagation through time and gradient descent to design spatially specific steady states in disordered spring networks. We find that a broad range of steady states can be achieved with small alterations to the structure, operating both at small and large amplitudes. We study the effect of varying the damping, which interpolates between the underdamped and the overdamped regime, as well as the amplitude, frequency, and phase. We show that convergence depends on several competing effects, including chaos, large relaxation times, a gradient bias due to finite time simulations, and strong attenuation. By studying the eigenmodes of the linearized system, we show that the systems adapt very specifically to the task they were trained to perform. Our work demonstrates that within physical bounds, a broad array of exotic behaviors in the dynamic regime can be obtained, allowing for a richer range of possible applications.</description>

      <title>Low-energy edge signatures of the Kitaev spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental work indicates that the Kitaev spin liquid may be realizable close to zero magnetic field in exfoliated $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ flakes, thus providing a more versatile setting for studying non-Abelian anyons. Here, we propose a robust nanoscale signature of the Kitaev spin liquid that results from its edge states and manifests in the low-energy spin dynamics. In particular, we highlight a singular peak in the dynamical spin structure factor of a zigzag edge whose energy scales linearly with only one component of the magnetic field. This sharp feature in the local spin dynamics directly reflects the bond-directional Kitaev spin interactions and, more generally, the projective symmetries of the Kitaev spin liquid. We demonstrate that our proposed signature survives in the presence of edge disorder as well as non-Kitaev interactions, and provide detailed guidelines for experimentally observing it using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy and color-center relaxometry.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone \&amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson \&amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>

      <title>Impact of synthesis method on the structure and function of high entropy oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The term sample dependence describes the troublesome tendency of nominally equivalent samples to exhibit different physical properties. High entropy oxides (HEOs) are a class of materials where sample dependence has the potential to be particularly profound due to their inherent chemical complexity. In this work, we prepare a spinel HEO of identical nominal composition by five distinct methods, spanning a range of thermodynamic and kinetic conditions: solid state, high pressure, hydrothermal, molten salt, and combustion syntheses. By structurally characterizing these five samples across all length scales with a variety of x-ray methods, we find that while the average structure is unaltered, the samples vary significantly in their local structures and their microstructures. The most profound differences are observed at intermediate length scales, both in terms of crystallite morphology and cation homogeneity. As revealed by x-ray fluorescence microscopy ideal cation homogeneity is achieved only in the case of combustion synthesis. These structural differences in turn significantly alter the observed functional properties, which we demonstrate via characterization of their magnetic response. While ferrimagnetic order is retained across all five samples, the sharpness of the transition, the size of the saturated moment, and the coercivity all show marked variations with synthesis method. We conclude that the chemical flexibility inherent to HEOs is complemented by strong synthesis method dependence, providing another axis along which to optimize these materials for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Gauge covariant neural network for quarks and gluons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.11965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose gauge-covariant neural networks along with a specialized training algorithm for lattice QCD, designed to handle realistic quarks and gluons in four-dimensional space-time. We show that the smearing procedure can be interpreted as an extended version of residual neural networks with fixed parameters. To demonstrate the applicability of our neural networks, we develop a self-learning hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm in the context of two-color QCD, yielding outcomes consistent with those from the conventional Hybrid Monte Carlo approach.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling Laws of Absorbing Phase Transitions in Artificial Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that conventional artificial deep neural networks operating near the phase boundary of the signal propagation dynamics, also known as the edge of chaos, exhibit universal scaling laws of absorbing phase transitions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Our numerical results indicate that the multilayer perceptrons and the convolutional neural networks belong to the mean-field and the directed percolation universality classes, respectively. Also, the finite-size scaling is successfully applied, suggesting a potential connection to the depth-width trade-off in deep learning. Furthermore, our analysis of the training dynamics under gradient descent reveals that hyperparameter tuning to the phase boundary is necessary but insufficient for achieving optimal generalization in deep networks. Remarkably, nonuniversal metric factors associated with the scaling laws are shown to play a significant role in concretizing the above observations. These findings highlight the usefulness of the notion of criticality for analyzing the behavior of artificial deep neural networks and offer new insights toward a unified understanding of an essential relationship between criticality and intelligence.</description>

      <title>Inverse renormalization group of spin glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose inverse renormalization group transformations to construct approximate configurations for lattice volumes that have not yet been accessed by supercomputers or large-scale simulations in the study of spin glasses. Specifically, starting from lattices of volume $V=8^{3}$ in the case of the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model we employ machine learning algorithms to construct rescaled lattices up to $V'=128^{3}$, which we utilize to extract two critical exponents. We conclude by discussing how to incorporate numerical exactness within inverse renormalization group methods of disordered systems, thus opening up the opportunity to explore a sustainable and energy-efficient generation of exact configurations for increasing lattice volumes without the use of dedicated supercomputers.</description>

      <title>SWAP algorithm for lattice spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapted the SWAP molecular dynamics algorithm for use in lattice Ising spin models. We dressed the spins with a randomly distributed length and we alternated long-range spin exchanges with conventional single spin flip Monte Carlo updates, both accepted with a stochastic rule which respects detailed balance. We show that this algorithm, when applied to the bidimensional Edwards-Anderson model, speeds up significantly the relaxation at low temperatures and manages to find ground states with high efficiency and little computational cost. The exploration of spin models should help in understanding why SWAP accelerates the evolution of particle systems and shed light on relations between dynamics and free-energy landscapes.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hall Responses in Disordered Topological Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an efficient numerical approach to compute the different components of the orbital Hall responses in disordered topological materials from the Berry phase theory of magnetization. The theoretical framework is based on the Chebyshev expansion of Green's functions and the off-diagonal elements of the position operator for systems under arbitrary boundary conditions. The capability of this scheme is shown by computing the orbital Hall conductivity for gapped graphene and the Haldane model in the presence of nonperturbative disorder effects. This methodology enables realistic simulations of orbital Hall responses in highly complex models of disordered materials.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks for $p$-spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network algorithm for the solution of $p$-spin models. We show that bond compression through rank-revealing decompositions performed during the tensor network contraction resolves logical redundancies in the system exactly and is thus lossless, yet leads to qualitative changes in runtime scaling in different regimes of the model. First, we find that bond compression emulates the so-called leaf-removal algorithm, solving the problem efficiently in the "easy" phase. Past a dynamical phase transition, we observe superpolynomial runtimes, reflecting the appearance of a core component. We then develop a graphical method to study the scaling of contraction for a minimal ensemble of core-only instances. We find subexponential scaling, improving on the exponential scaling that occurs without compression. Our results suggest that our tensor network algorithm subsumes the classical leaf removal algorithm and simplifies redundancies in the $p$-spin model through lossless compression, all without explicit knowledge of the problem's structure.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of how the structure of language is acquired by deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How much data is required to learn the structure of a language via next-token prediction? We study this question for synthetic datasets generated via a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) -- a tree-like generative model that captures many of the hierarchical structures found in natural languages. We determine token-token correlations analytically in our model and show that they can be used to build a representation of the grammar's hidden variables, the longer the range the deeper the variable. In addition, a finite training set limits the resolution of correlations to an effective range, whose size grows with that of the training set. As a result, a Language Model trained with increasingly many examples can build a deeper representation of the grammar's structure, thus reaching good performance despite the high dimensionality of the problem. We conjecture that the relationship between training set size and effective range of correlations holds beyond our synthetic datasets. In particular, our conjecture predicts how the scaling law for the test loss behaviour with training set size depends on the length of the context window, which we confirm empirically in Shakespeare's plays and Wikipedia articles.</description>
