      <title>Time-delayed feedback control for random dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Pyragas time-delayed feedback control (TDFC) to apply it to random dynamical systems and introduce an extended classification based on Lyapunov exponents and trajectory fluctuations. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework using the random logistic map and the stochastic R\"ossler system. Our results reveal that noise-induced chaos triggers a transition from stable to unstable regimes based on a phenomenon inherent to random dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>From two-dimensional continuous maps to one-dimensional discontinuous maps: a novel reduction explaining complex bifurcation structures in piecewise-linear families of maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piecewise-linear maps describe dynamical phenomena that switch between distinct states and readily generate complex bifurcation structures due to their strong nonlinearity. We show that two-dimensional continuous piecewise-linear maps near certain codimension-two homoclinic bifurcations are well approximated by a three-parameter family of one-dimensional maps. Each member of the one-dimensional family is discontinuous, because the family is constructed from the first return of iterates to a subset of phase space, and comprised of infinitely many linear pieces, where each piece corresponds to a fixed number of iterations near the saddle associated with the homoclinic bifurcation. The one-dimensional family exhibits period-incrementing, period-adding, bandcount-incrementing, and bandcount-adding structures (all typical for two-piece maps), as well as unique features caused by orbits repeatedly visiting more than two pieces of the map. These structures carry through to the two-dimensional maps with only minor differences in the arrangement of the bifurcations developing with the distance from the codimension-two bifurcations. This leads to a novel and vivid elucidation of the dynamics of the two-dimensional border-collision normal form.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of action potential generation using Markov models of voltage-gated sodium channel isoforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a conductance-based neuron model to explore how voltage-gated ion channel isoforms influence action-potential generation. The model combines a six-state Markov representation of NaV channels with a first-order KV3.1 model, allowing us to vary maximal sodium and potassium conductances and compare nine NaV isoforms. Using bifurcation theory and local stability analysis, we map regions of stable limit cycles and visualize excitability landscapes via heatmap-based diagrams. These analyses show that isoforms NaV1.3, NaV1.4 and NaV1.6 support broad excitable regimes, while isoforms NaV1.7 and NaV1.9 exhibit minimal oscillatory behavior. Our findings provide insights into the role of channel heterogeneity in neuronal dynamics and may help to guide the design of synthetic excitable systems by narrowing the parameter space needed for robust action-potential trains.</description>
