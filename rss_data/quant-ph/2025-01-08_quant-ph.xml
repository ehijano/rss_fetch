      <title>A no-go result for QBism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In QBism the wave function does not represent an element of physical reality external to the agent, but represent an agent's personal probability assignments, reflecting his subjective degrees of belief about the future content of his experience. In this paper, I argue that this view of the wave function is not consistent with protective measurements. The argument does not rely on the realist assumption of the psi-ontology theorems, namely the existence of the underlying ontic state of a quantum system.</description>

      <title>Can the ontology of Bohmian mechanics consists only in particles? The PBR theorem says no</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The meaning of the wave function is an important unresolved issue in Bohmian mechanics. On the one hand, according to the nomological view, the wave function of the universe or the universal wave function is nomological, like a law of nature. On the other hand, the PBR theorem proves that the wave function in quantum mechanics or the effective wave function in Bohmian mechanics is ontic, representing the ontic state of a physical system in the universe. It is usually thought that the nomological view of the universal wave function is compatible with the ontic view of the effective wave function, and thus the PBR theorem has no implications for the nomological view. In this paper, I argue that this is not the case, and these two views are in fact incompatible. This means that if the effective wave function is ontic as the PBR theorem proves, then the universal wave function cannot be nomological, and the ontology of Bohmian mechanics cannot consist only in particles. This incompatibility result holds true not only for Humeanism and dispositionalism but also for primitivism about laws of nature, which attributes a fundamental ontic role to the universal wave function. Moreover, I argue that although the nomological view can be held by rejecting one key assumption of the PBR theorem, the rejection will lead to serious problems, such as that the results of measurements and their probabilities cannot be explained in ontology in Bohmian mechanics. Finally, I briefly discuss three psi-ontologies, namely a physical field in a fundamental high-dimensional space, a multi-field in three-dimensional space, and RDMP (Random Discontinuous Motion of Particles) in three-dimensional space, and argue that the RDMP ontology can answer the objections to the psi-ontology raised by the proponents of the nomological view.</description>

      <title>Comment on "The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces" (arXiv:2308.06669v3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pivotal claim in "The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces" by Carcassi, Calder\'on and Aidala (arXiv:2308.06669v3) is that "unitary transformations in a Hilbert space can map states with finite expectation values to those with infinite ones". In the present comment it is shown that this statement is incorrect and the source of the mistake is pointed out. In consequence, the purported example of a time evolution that makes "the expectation value oscillate from finite to infinite in finite time" is also faulty, and the assertion that Hilbert spaces "turn a potential infinity into an actual infinity" is unsubstantiated.
  These errors weaken dramatically, if not invalidate, the authors' contention that Hilbert spaces are unphysical.</description>

      <title>MEMSDuino: An Arduino-Based MEMS Switch Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency cryogenic switches are a critical enabling technology for quantum information science for both calibration and high throughput testing of samples. Traditionally, solenoid-based switches have been used [1,2], but a transition is being made to MEMS-based (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) switches due to their lower power dissipation and smaller size, and to minimize the risk that solenoid switches tend to produce current pulses that destroy expensive cryogenic amplifiers and can cause electrostatic damage to devices. These MEMS switches require a 90-volt signal to be applied to the control lines to determine the state of the switches. Switches exist that have built-in CMOS-based (Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) control electronics to drive the 90 V, but these do not work at the cryogenic temperatures used in quantum information science.
  There is no currently available room temperature control system with direct control of the switches. The instrument presented here is a 19-inch rack-mount controller for a cryogenic MEMS switch network that allows a human operator to see the state of the switch via a row of clearly marked indicator lights and to change the state manually via buttons on an LED-based indicator board or automatically via Python-based serial port commands to the Arduino, an open source microcontroller platform available from multiple vendors. The design can also be modified to control other switches that require either a large voltage or current to switch.</description>

      <title>Quantum Feature-Empowered Deep Classification for Fast Mangrove Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mangrove mapping (MM) algorithm is an essential classification tool for environmental monitoring. The recent literature shows that compared with other index-based MM methods that treat pixels as spatially independent, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are crucial for leveraging spatial continuity information, leading to improved classification performance. In this work, we go a step further to show that quantum features provide radically new information for CNN to further upgrade the classification results. Simply speaking, CNN computes affine-mapping features, while quantum neural network (QNN) offers unitary-computing features, thereby offering a fresh perspective in the final decision-making (classification). To address the challenging MM problem, we design an entangled spatial-spectral quantum feature extraction module. Notably, to ensure that the quantum features contribute genuinely novel information (unaffected by traditional CNN features), we design a separate network track consisting solely of quantum neurons with built-in interpretability. The extracted pure quantum information is then fused with traditional feature information to jointly make the final decision. The proposed quantum-empowered deep network (QEDNet) is very lightweight, so the improvement does come from the cooperation between CNN and QNN (rather than parameter augmentation). Extensive experiments will be conducted to demonstrate the superiority of QEDNet.</description>

      <title>Lindblad estimation with fast and precise quantum control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing precision sensors for stochastic signals using quantum techniques is a promising emerging field of physics. Estimating a weak stochastic waveform is the core task of many fundamental physics experiments including searches for stochastic gravitational waves, quantum gravity, and axionic dark matter. Simultaneously, noise spectroscopy and characterisation, e.g. estimation of various decay mechanisms in quantum devices, is relevant to a broad range of fundamental and technological applications. We consider the ultimate limit on the sensitivity of these devices for Lindblad estimation given any quantum state, fast and precise control sequence, and measurement scheme. We show that it is optimal to rapidly projectively measure and re-initialise the quantum state. We develop optimal protocols for a wide range of applications including stochastic waveform estimation, spectroscopy with qubits, and Lindblad estimation.</description>

      <title>Evolved Quantum Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce evolved quantum Boltzmann machines as a variational ansatz for quantum optimization and learning tasks. Given two parameterized Hamiltonians $G(\theta)$ and $H(\phi)$, an evolved quantum Boltzmann machine consists of preparing a thermal state of the first Hamiltonian $G(\theta)$ followed by unitary evolution according to the second Hamiltonian $H(\phi)$. Alternatively, one can think of it as first realizing imaginary time evolution according to $G(\theta)$ followed by real time evolution according to $H(\phi)$. After defining this ansatz, we provide analytical expressions for the gradient vector and illustrate their application in ground-state energy estimation and generative modeling, showing how the gradient for these tasks can be estimated by means of quantum algorithms that involve classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. We also establish analytical expressions for the Fisher-Bures, Wigner-Yanase, and Kubo-Mori information matrix elements of evolved quantum Boltzmann machines, as well as quantum algorithms for estimating each of them, which leads to at least three different general natural gradient descent algorithms based on this ansatz. Along the way, we establish a broad generalization of the main result of [Luo, Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 132, 885 (2004)], proving that the Fisher-Bures and Wigner-Yanase information matrices of general parameterized families of states differ by no more than a factor of two in the matrix (Loewner) order, making them essentially interchangeable for training when using natural gradient descent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a family of W-class states describing three-qubit systems. For such systems, we analyze the relations between the entanglement measures and the nonlocality parameter for a two-mode mixed state related to the two-qubit subsystem. We find the conditions determining the boundary values of the negativity, parameterized by concurrence, for violating the Bell-CHSH inequality. Additionally, we derive the value ranges of the mixedness measure, parameterized by concurrence and negativity for the qubit--qubit mixed state, guaranteeing the violation and non-violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Quantum Polarization Microscopy using an Entangled-Photon Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of non-classical light sources such as single-photon and entangled-photon sources, innovative microscopy based on the quantum principles has been proposed over traditional microscopy. This paper introduces the experimental demonstration of a quantum polarization microscopic technique that incorporates a quantum-entangled photon source. Although the point that employs the variation of polarization angle due to reflection or transmission at the sample is similar to classical polarization microscopy, the method for constructing image contrast is significantly different. Image contrast is constructed by the coincidence count of signal and idler photons. In the case that coincidence count is recorded from both the signal and idler photons, the photon statistics resemble a thermal state, similar to the blackbody radiation, but with a significantly higher peak intensity in the second order autocorrelation function at zero delay that is derived from coincidence count. While, when the coincidence count is taken from either the signal or idler photon only, though the photon state exhibits a thermal state again, the photon statistics become more dispersive and result in a lower peak intensity of the autocorrelation function. These different thermal states can be switched by slightly changing the photon polarization, which is suddenly aroused within narrow range of analyzer angle. This polarization microscopic technique can provide a superior imaging technique compared to the classical method, opening a new frontier for research in material sciences, biology, and other fields requiring high-resolution imaging.</description>

      <title>Zeno Freezing and Anti-Zeno Acceleration of the Dynamic Evolution of Acoustic Topological Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum measurements severely disrupt the dynamic evolution of a quantum system by collapsing the probabilistic wavefunction. This principle can be leveraged to control quantum states by effectively freezing the system's dynamics or enhancing transitions between states. These are known as the quantum Zeno effect (ZE) and anti-Zeno effect (AZE), respectively. However, it remains elusive how quantum measurements affect topological states, which are famous for their robustness against disorder and perturbations. Here, we theoretically and experimentally show that the dynamic evolution of topological boundary states (TBSs) can be controlled by quantum-like measurement (QLM). Our work is based on spatially modulated topological acoustic waveguide systems with varying parameters that adiabatically pump the TBS across the bulk to the opposite boundary. Therein, the QLM is emulated using a perturbation to the Hamiltonian known as the Zeno subspace. With the help of quantum metrics, we identify the general conditions for ZE and AZE, and experimentally demonstrate their effects in freezing and accelerating the tunneling of the TBS. Furthermore, we discover a tunneling mechanism by varying the strength of the QLM. These results highlight QLM as a versatile tool for manipulating topological states and wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Interference of interference effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the interference of individual photons in a linear-optical setup comprised of two overlapping Mach$\unicode{x2013}$Zehnder interferometers joined via a common beam splitter. We show how, in this setup, two kinds of standard interference effects$\unicode{x2014}$namely, single-photon Mach$\unicode{x2013}$Zehnder interference and two-photon Hong$\unicode{x2013}$Ou$\unicode{x2013}$Mandel interference$\unicode{x2014}$interfere with one another, partially canceling each other out. This new perspective, along with the overall pedagogical exposition of this work, is intended as an intuitive illustration of why quantum effects can combine nontrivially and, moreover, of the fundamental notion that quantum interference happens at measurement. This work can serve as a bridge to more advanced quantum mechanical concepts. For instance, analyses of this setup in terms of entanglement have a rich history and can be used to test the predictions of quantum mechanics versus local realism (e.g., as in Hardy's Paradox).</description>

      <title>Efficient Sampling for Pauli Measurement-Based Shadow Tomography in Direct Fidelity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A constant number of random Clifford measurements allows the classical shadow protocol to perform Direct Fidelity Estimation (DFE) with high precision. However, estimating properties of an unknown quantum state is expected to be more feasible with random Pauli measurements than with random Clifford measurements in the near future. Inspired by the importance sampling technique applied to sampling Pauli measurements for DFE, we show that similar strategies can be derived from classical shadows. Specifically, we describe efficient methods using Pauli measurements to perform DFE with GHZ and W states, establishing tighter bounds ($\approx \times 14.22$ for GHZ, $\approx \times 16$ for W) on the number of measurements required for desired precision.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Deep-Unfolded Combinatorial Optimization Solver with Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing (QA) has attracted research interest as a sampler and combinatorial optimization problem (COP) solver. A recently proposed sampling-based solver for QA significantly reduces the required number of qubits, being capable of large COPs. In relation to this, a trainable sampling-based COP solver has been proposed that optimizes its internal parameters from a dataset by using a deep learning technique called deep unfolding. Although learning the internal parameters accelerates the convergence speed, the sampler in the trainable solver is restricted to using a classical sampler owing to the training cost. In this study, to utilize QA in the trainable solver, we propose classical-quantum transfer learning, where parameters are trained classically, and the trained parameters are used in the solver with QA. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate that the trainable quantum COP solver using classical-quantum transfer learning improves convergence speed and execution time over the original solver.</description>

      <title>Inductive Construction of Variational Quantum Circuit for Constrained Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new method for constrained combinatorial optimization using variational quantum circuits. Quantum computers are considered to have the potential to solve large combinatorial optimization problems faster than classical computers. Variational quantum algorithms, such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), have been studied extensively because they are expected to work on noisy intermediate scale devices. Unfortunately, many optimization problems have constraints, which induces infeasible solutions during VQE process. Recently, several methods for efficiently solving constrained combinatorial optimization problems have been proposed by designing a quantum circuit so as to output only the states that satisfy the constraints. However, the types of available constraints are still limited. Therefore, we have started to develop variational quantum circuits that can handle a wider range of constraints. The proposed method utilizes a forwarding operation that maps from feasible states for subproblems to those for larger subproblems. As long as appropriate forwarding operations can be defined, iteration of this process can inductively construct variational circuits outputting feasible states even in the case of multiple and complex constraints. In this paper, the proposed method was applied to facility location problem and was found to increase the probability for measuring feasible solutions or optimal solutions. In addition, the cost of the obtained circuit was comparable to that of conventional variational circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a circuit of the four-body coupler for superconducting qubits based on Josephson parametric oscillators (JPOs). Our coupler for the four-body interaction has a superconducting loop, similar to a capacitively shunted flux qubit, where an external magnetic flux set to half a flux quantum is threaded. This coupler circuit is a specific setup of the circuit called superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive elements (SNAIL) and also is a generalization of the previously proposed one for the four-body interaction of JPOs. We clarify roles of circuit parameters in the four-body interaction and, in particular, show that the four-body coupling constant in our circuit can be significantly increased by tuning capacitance of the coupler or the area ratio of the Josephson junctions of the coupler.</description>

      <title>Exact Decoding of Repetition Code under Circuit Level Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repetition code forms a fundamental basis for quantum error correction experiments. To date, it stands as the sole code that has achieved large distances and extremely low error rates. Its applications span the spectrum of evaluating hardware limitations, pinpointing hardware defects, and detecting rare events. However, current methods for decoding repetition codes under circuit level noise are suboptimal, leading to inaccurate error correction thresholds and introducing additional errors in event detection. In this work, we establish that repetition code under circuit level noise has an exact solution, and we propose an optimal maximum likelihood decoding algorithm called planar. The algorithm is based on the exact solution of the spin glass partition function on planar graphs and has polynomial computational complexity. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm uncovers the exact threshold for depolarizing noise and realistic superconductor SI1000 noise. Furthermore, we apply our method to analyze data from recent quantum memory experiments conducted by Google Quantum AI, revealing that part of the error floor was attributed to the decoding algorithm used by Google. Finally, we implemented the repetition code quantum memory on superconducting systems with a 72-qubit quantum chip lacking reset gates, demonstrating that even with an unknown error model, the proposed algorithm achieves a significantly lower logical error rate than the matching-based algorithm.</description>

      <title>Highly sensitive temperature sensing via quadratic optomechanical coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective frequency of a mechanical resonator can be tuned via the spring effect induced by quadratic optomechanical (QOM) coupling, and both spontaneous symmetry breaking and anti-parity-time phase transition were predicted in the QOM systems. Here, we show that the mechanical susceptibility can be enhanced significantly by driving the QOM system with a strong external optical field, and divergence will happen as the driving strength approaches the critical point (CP) for spontaneous symmetry breaking. Based on the CP, we propose a highly sensitive temperature sensor with a mechanical resonator quadratically coupled to an optical mode. We find that the sensitivity of the temperature sensor can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude as the driving strength approaches the CP, and the sensitivity of the temperature sensor remains high in the low-temperature limit. Our work provides an effective way to realize highly sensitive temperature sensing at ultra-low temperature in the QOM systems.</description>

      <title>Supercorrelated decay in a quasiperiodic nonlinear waveguide: From Markovian to non-Markovian transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobility edges (MEs) are critical boundaries in disordered quantum systems that separate localized from extended states, significantly affecting transport properties and phase transitions. Although MEs are well-understood in single-photon systems, their manifestation in many-body contexts remains an active area of research. In this work, we investigate a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard chain with a quasiperiodic potential modulating photon-photon interactions, effectively creating a mosaic lattice. We identify MEs for doublon states (i.e, bound photon pairs resulting from strong interactions) within the two-photon subspace. Our analytical solutions and numerical simulations confirm the existence of these MEs, extending single-photon MEs theories to the two-photon regime. Additionally, we analyze the dynamics of two emitters coupled to the waveguide, enabling the emission of supercorrelated photon pairs into the waveguide. Our findings reveal that coupling to extended states results in Markovian dynamics, characterized by exponentially supercorrelated decay, while coupling to localized states gives rise to non-Markovian dynamics, marked by suppressed decay and persistent oscillations. Here, a transition from Markovian to non-Markovian behavior occurs around the MEs of the doublons. Finally, we propose a feasible experimental implementation using superconducting circuits, providing a platform to observe the interplay between interactions and disorder in quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum imaging is an ever expanding research field, in which the aim is to exploit the quantum nature of light to enhance image reconstruction capabilities. Despite a number of successful demonstrations for quantum imaging, quantum microscopy still seems out of the range for practical applications, due to different physical and technical reasons. Here we propose an imaging method exploiting the quantum correlations of photon pairs and a scanning microscope to achieve fast, single mode quantum imaging. We first test our technique on a metal grating to estimate the resolution capabilities of our system. Moreover, we asses its potential in terms of the number of available independent pixels at full resolution compared to different quantum imaging approaches. Finally, we demonstrate scanning quantum microscopy of onion epithelial cells, paving the way towards scalable quantum microscopy for bio-physical applications. Our results, combined with the rapidly evolving photon-pair generation and detection technology towards the mid-infrared, could lead to an extension of quantum microscopy applications towards the mid-infrared, to access the molecular fingerprint region.</description>

      <title>Single-molecule Scale Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy using Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-molecule technology stands as a powerful tool, enabling the characterization of intricate structural and dynamic information that would otherwise remain concealed within the averaged behaviors of numerous molecules. This technology finds extensive application across diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. Quantum sensing, particularly leveraging nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers within diamond structures, presents a promising avenue for single-molecule magnetic resonance, offering prospects for sensing and imaging technology at the single-molecule level. Notably, while significant strides have been made in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance using NV centers over the past two decades, current approaches still exhibit limitations in magnetic sensitivity, spectral resolution, and spatial resolution. Particularly, the full reconstruction of three-dimensional positions of nuclear spins within single molecules remains an unattained goal. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance, encompassing an analysis of various relevant techniques involving NV centers. Additionally, it explores the optimization of technical parameters associated with these methods. This detailed analysis serves as a foundation for the development of new technologies and the exploration of potential applications.</description>

      <title>Spin Environment of a Superconducting Qubit in High Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits equipped with quantum non-demolishing readout and active feedback can be used as information engines to probe and manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom, whether intentionally designed or naturally occurring in their environment. In the case of spin systems, the required magnetic field bias presents a challenge for superconductors and Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate a granular aluminum nanojunction fluxonium qubit (gralmonium) with spectrum and coherence resilient to fields beyond one Tesla. Sweeping the field reveals a paramagnetic spin-1/2 ensemble, which is the dominant gralmonium loss mechanism when the electron spin resonance matches the qubit. We also observe a suppression of fast flux noise in magnetic field, suggesting the freezing of surface spins. Using an active state stabilization sequence, the qubit hyperpolarizes long-lived two-level systems (TLSs) in its environment, previously speculated to be spins. Surprisingly, the coupling to these TLSs is unaffected by magnetic fields, leaving the question of their origin open. The robust operation of gralmoniums in Tesla fields offers new opportunities to explore unresolved questions in spin environment dynamics and facilitates hybrid architectures linking superconducting qubits with spin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum random walks have been shown to be powerful quantum algorithms for certain tasks on graphs like database searching, quantum simulations etc. In this work we focus on its applications for the graph isomorphism problem. In particular we look at how we can compare multi-particle quantum walks and well known classical WL tests and how quantum walks can be used to distinguish hard graphs like CFI graphs which k-WL tests cannot distinguish. We provide theoretical proofs and empirical results to show that a k-QW with input superposition states distinguishes k-CFI graphs. In addition we also prove that a k-1 QW with localized input states distinguishes k-CFI graphs. We also prove some additional results about strongly regular graphs (SRGs).</description>

      <title>Dissipative evolution of a two-level system through a geometry-based classical mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce a geometry-based formalism to obtain a Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss mapping in order to study the dynamics of both isolated and interacting two-level systems. After showing the description of the isolated case using canonically conjugate variables, we implement an interaction model by bilinearly coupling the corresponding population differences {\it \`a la} Caldeira-Leggett, showing that the dynamics behave as a Gross-Pitaevskii-like one. We also find a transition between oscillatory and tunneling-suppressed dynamics that can be observed by varying the coupling constant. After extending our model to the {\it system plus environment} case, where the environment is considered as a collection of two-level systems, we show tunneling-suppressed dynamics in the strong coupling limit and the usual damping effect similar to that of a harmonic oscillator bath in the weak coupling one. Finally, we observe that our interacting model turns an isolated symmetric two-level system into an environment-assisted asymmetric one.</description>

      <title>Efficient Protein Ground State Energy Computation via Fragmentation and Reassembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein characterization is one of the key components for understanding the human body and advancing drug discovery processes. While the future of quantum hardware holds the potential to accurately characterize these molecules, current efforts focus on developing strategies to fragment large molecules into computationally manageable subsystems. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to enable quantum simulation using existing quantum algorithms. Our approach involves fragmenting proteins into their corresponding amino acids, simulating them independently, and then reassembling them post-simulation while applying chemical corrections. This methodology demonstrates its accuracy by calculating the ground state of relatively small peptides through reassembling, achieving a mean relative error of only $0.00263 \pm 0.01724\% $. Future directions include investigating, with larger quantum computers, whether this approach remains valid for larger proteins.</description>

      <title>Critical properties in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the critical properties of the localization transition in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark (AAS) model with quasiperiodic and Stark potentials, where the non-Hermiticity comes from the nonreciprocal hopping. The localization length, the inverse participation ratio and the energy gap are adopted as the characteristic quantities. We perform the scaling analysis to derive the scaling functions of the three quantities with critical exponents in several critical regions, with respect to the quasiperiodic and Stark potentials and the nonreciprocal strength. We numerically verify the finite-size scaling forms and extract the critical exponents in different situations. Two groups of new critical exponents for the non-Hermitian AAS model and its pure Stark limit are obtained, which are distinct to those for the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre model and their Hermitian counterparts. Our results indicate that the Hermitian and non-Hermitian AAS, Aubry-Andre, and Stark models belong to different universality classes. We demonstrate that these critical exponents are independent of the nonreciprocal strength, and remain the same in different critical regions and boundary conditions. Furthermore, we establish a hybrid scaling function with a hybrid exponent in the overlap region between the critical regions for the non-Hermitian AAS and Stark models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Linear Multistep Method for Using a Quantum Oracle with Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential equations are a crucial mathematical tool used in a wide range of applications. If the solution to an initial value problem (IVP) can be transformed into an oracle, it can be utilized in various fields such as search and optimization, achieving quadratic speedup with respect to the number of candidates compared to its classical counterpart. In the past, attempts have been made to implement such an oracle using the Euler method. In this study, we propose a quantum linear multistep method (QLMM) that applies the linear multistep method, commonly used to numerically solve IVPs on classical computers, to generate a numerical solution of the IVP for use in a quantum oracle. We also propose a method to find the optimal form of QLMM for a given IVP. Finally, through computer simulations, we derive the QLMM formulation for an example IVP and show that the solution from the optimized QLMM can be used in an optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Ultra-cold atoms as quantum simulators for relativistic phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to review developments regarding the use of ultra-cold atoms as quantum simulators. Special emphasis is placed on relativistic quantum phenomena, which are presumably most interesting for the audience of this journal. After a brief introduction into the main idea of quantum simulators and the basic physics of ultra-cold atoms, relativistic quantum phenomena of linear fields are discussed, including Hawking radiation, the Unruh effect, cosmological particle creation, the Gibbons-Hawking and Ginzburg effects, super-radiance, Sauter-Schwinger and Breit-Wheeler pair creation, as well as the dynamical Casimir effect. After that, the focus is shifted to phenomena of non-linear fields, such as the sine-Gordon model, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, false-vacuum decay, and quantum back-reaction. In order to place everything into proper context, the basic underlying mechanisms of these phenomena are briefly recapitulated before their simulators are discussed. Even though effort is made to provide a review as fair as possible, there can be co claim of completeness and the selection as well as the relative weights of the topics may well reflect some personal bias.</description>

      <title>Some properties and applications of the new quantum $f$-divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new definition for quantum $f$-divergences was introduced based on an integral representation. These divergences have shown remarkable properties, for example when investigating contraction coefficients under noisy channels. At the same time, many properties well known for other definitions have remained elusive for the new quantum $f$-divergence because of its unusual representation. In this work, we investigate alternative ways of expressing these quantum $f$-divergences. We leverage these expressions to prove new properties of these $f$-divergences and demonstrate some applications. In particular, we give a new proof of the achievability of the quantum Chernoff bound by establishing a strengthening of an inequality by Audenaert et al. We also establish inequalities between some previously known Renyi divergences and the new Renyi divergence. We further investigate some monotonicity and convexity properties of the new $f$-divergences, and prove inequalities between these divergences for various functions.</description>

      <title>Wigner Function of Observed Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wigner function was introduced as an attempt to describe quantum mechanical fields with the tools inherited from classical statistical mechanics. In particular, it is widely used to describe properties of radiation fields. In fact, a useful way to distinguish between classical and nonclassical states of light is to ask whether their Wigner function has a Gaussian profile or not, respectively. In this manuscript, I use the basis of Fock states to provide the closed-form expression for the Wigner function of an arbitrary quantum state. Further, to illustrate the power of my expression, I provide the Wigner function of the most fundamental quantum system: Resonance Fluorescence. Thus, I discuss the conditions to obtain negative-valued Wigner function and the relation that they have with population inversion. Finally, I tackle the problem of the observation of the radiation field, introducing physical detectors into the description of the emission. Notably, I show that the Wigner function can still expose the quantumness of the radiation field, even if the detection has finite spectral resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction of two massive particles with a quantised gravitational field in its vacuum state using two different position observables: (i) a frame-dependent coordinate separation and (ii) a frame-independent geodesic separation. For free particles, (i) leads to purely unitary dynamics but (ii) leads to dissipation. For two particles coupled through a linear spring, (i) and (ii) lead to different cut-off dependences in the frequency shift harmonic ladder of the differential motional mode. Our findings highlight the subtle consequences of different position observables at the interface of quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Modes, states and superselection rules in quantum optics and quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A convenient way to represent quantum optical states is through the quadrature basis of single-modes of the field. This framework provides intuitive definitions for quasi-classical states, their phase-space representations, and a robust toolbox for quantum state manipulation using universal gates. In this widely adopted representation of quantum optics, most pure states consist of coherent superpositions of photon-number states. However, this approach neglects the particle-number superselection rule - which prohibits coherence between states of differing photon numbers - and implicitly assumes a common phase reference - even though global phases are unmeasurable in quantum optics. We adopt a representation of quantum optical states that respects the superselection rule and revisit key tools and results in quantum optics and information encoding within quantum optics. In the introduced framework, general pure states are described using two orthogonal modes in the Fock basis. We show that this approach preserves the intuitive aspects of the traditional quadrature representation while unifying insights from quantum optics with those from symmetric spin-like and angular momentum systems. Moreover, the superselection rule-compliant representation provides a consistent definition of non-purity and coherence for optical modes and states. It offers a clearer and general perspective on quantum universality, non-classicality, and the (im)possibility of efficient classical simulation across various quantum information encoding schemes involving quantum optical modes and states.</description>

      <title>Cartan-covariant Quantum Channels and the PPT$^{2}$ conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-parameter generalizations of depolarizing channels are introduced and studied. These so-called Cartan-covariant channels have a covariance Lie group that forms a Cartan decomposition of SU$(D)$. The regions of completely positive and completely co-positive Cartan-covariant trace-preserving maps are found through a spectral analysis of the Choi state. Furthermore, we prove that the PPT$^{2}$ conjecture holds for these channels in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Performance of Practical Quantum Oblivious Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the applications of secure multiparty computation as a privacy-protecting data analysis tool, and identifying oblivious transfer as one of its main practical enablers, we propose a practical realization of randomized quantum oblivious transfer. By using only symmetric cryptography primitives to implement commitments, we construct computationally-secure randomized oblivious transfer without the need for public-key cryptography or assumptions imposing limitations on the adversarial devices. We show that the protocol is secure under an indistinguishability-based notion of security and demonstrate an experimental implementation to test its real-world performance. Its security and performance are then compared to both quantum and classical alternatives, showing potential advantages over existing solutions based on the noisy storage model and public-key cryptography.</description>

      <title>Quantum Models of Consciousness from a Quantum Information Science Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This perspective explores various quantum models of consciousness from the viewpoint of quantum information science, offering potential ideas and insights. The models under consideration can be categorized into three distinct groups based on the level at which quantum mechanics might operate within the brain: those suggesting that consciousness arises from electron delocalization within microtubules inside neurons, those proposing it emerges from the electromagnetic field surrounding the entire neural network, and those positing it originates from the interactions between individual neurons governed by neurotransmitter molecules. Our focus is particularly on the Posner model of cognition, for which we provide preliminary calculations on the preservation of entanglement of phosphate molecules within the geometric structure of Posner clusters. These findings provide valuable insights into how quantum information theory can enhance our understanding of brain functions.</description>

      <title>The trace distance between density matrices, a nifty tool in new-physics searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information methods have been brought to bear on high-energy physics, including the study of entanglement and Bell nonlocality in collider experiments. Quantum information observables have also been employed to constrain possible new physics effects. We improve on this point by introducing quantum information tools routinely used to compare quantum states: the trace distance and the fidelity. We find that the former outperforms other quantum information observables considered in the literature and, together with the cross section, yields the strongest bounds on possible departures from the Standard Model. The power of the proposed methodology is demonstrated with three examples of new physics searches. The first concerns the chromomagnetic dipole moment of the top quark and yields the first bound computed by means of quantum tomography and actual experimental data. The other two examples use Monte Carlo simulations and set the projected limits on the anomalous couplings of the $\tau$ leptons at Belle and at a future collider, which is taken to be LEP3. For these new physics searches we also compare the sensitivity of the trace distance to those of other quantum information quantities like concurrence, magic, and the fidelity distance. In passing, we provide the first determinations of magic in colliders data by analyzing the top-quark pair production at the LHC and the charmonium decays. The significance is well above the $5\sigma$ level in both the cases.</description>

      <title>Soft symmetries of topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</description>

      <title>Sub-micron Circuit Fabrication on Diamond Anvils for Mesoscopic High-Pressure Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel fabrication procedure to produce high-quality lift-off structures on diamond anvils extending from the culet down to the slanted facets. Feature sizes down to 500 nm are achieved through the use of a bi-layer resist stack and electron beam lithography. Device structures with strong adhesion to the diamond surface and high abrasion resistance are realized by optimizing the surface treatment. To benchmark our process, we fabricate a multi-lead tungsten circuit to measure changes of the superconducting transition temperature of zirconium across the structural phase transition at $\sim$30 GPa; showing a 4-fold jump of the critical temperature. Our process is easily reproducible in most traditional academic and industrial cleanroom facilities. This work paves the way for complex and high-precision fabrication and measurements inside diamond anvil cells and on other faceted crystalline samples.</description>

      <title>Probing Stress and Magnetism at High Pressures with Two-Dimensional Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pressure serves as a fundamental tuning parameter capable of drastically modifying all properties of matter. The advent of diamond anvil cells (DACs) has enabled a compact and tabletop platform for generating extreme pressure conditions in laboratory settings. However, the limited spatial dimensions and ultrahigh pressures within these environments present significant challenges for conventional spectroscopy techniques. In this work, we integrate optical spin defects within a thin layer of two-dimensional (2D) materials directly into the high-pressure chamber, enabling an in situ quantum sensing platform for mapping local stress and magnetic environments up to 4~GPa. Compared to nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers embedded in diamond anvils, our 2D sensors exhibit around three times stronger response to local stress and provide nanoscale proximity to the target sample in heterogeneous devices. We showcase the versatility of our approach by imaging both stress gradients within the high-pressure chamber and a pressure-driven magnetic phase transition in a room-temperature self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet, Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$. Our work demonstrates an integrated quantum sensing device for high-pressure experiments, offering potential applications in probing pressure-induced phenomena such as superconductivity, magnetism, and mechanical deformation.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculations of erbium crystal field splittings in oxide hosts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an effective ab initio method to calculate the crystal field coefficients of an erbium (Er3+) ion experiencing different local site symmetries in several wide-band-gap oxides, and then evaluate crystal field splittings of these Er3+ ions for their ground and excited states. The optical transitions between the ground state (Z) and excited state (Y) manifolds of the environmentally shielded 4f states of these Er3+ ions have wavelengths ~1.5 microns and thus have potential applications to quantum communications and quantum memories. These results are in excellent agreement with recent low-temperature measurements, provided the inadequate calculation of the 4f shell screening is adjusted by reducing the radial extent of the 4f wavefunctions by approximately a factor of 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expand here our description of a newly developed simple and effective ab initio method of calculating crystal field coefficients (CFCs) of rare-earth atoms in insulating hosts, focusing on Er in wide band gap oxide hosts MgO, ZnO, TiO$_2$, CaWO$_4$, and PbWO$_4$, which exemplify different local site symmetries. These hybrid functional calculations, which incorporate a portion of exact exchange from Hartree-Fock theory, reproduce the experimentally identified insulating band gaps of these oxides. The negative values of cohesive and formation energies confirm the structural and chemical stability of these oxides, whereas the defect formation energies indicate that Er doped ZnO, CaWO$_4$, and PbWO$_4$ are easier to form compared to Er doped MgO and TiO$_2$. Er doped in these oxide hosts exhibits a spin magnetic moment of $\sim$ 3 $\mu_B$ confirming the $3+$ valence state. The CFCs of these hosted Er are determined from charge densities and potentials obtained from non-spin-polarized calculations, involving a 4\textit{f} core approximation. These CFCs are subsequently used to solve an effective Hamiltonian and generate the crystal field splitting of Er 4f. These calculated Er 4f energy levels are in good agreement with available experiments.</description>

      <title>Flux pinning in superconducting multilayer 2H-NbSe$_2$ nano-step junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductors exhibit dissipationless supercurrents even under finite bias and magnetic field conditions, provided these remain below the critical values. However, type-II superconductors in the flux flow regime display Ohmic dissipation arising from vortex dynamics under finite magnetic fields. The interplay between supercurrent and Ohmic dissipation in a type-II superconductor is dictated by vortex motion and the robustness of vortex pinning forces. In this study, we present an experimental investigation of the superconducting phase transitions and vortex dynamics in the atomically thin type-II superconductor 2H-NbSe$_2$. We fabricated a high-quality multilayer 2H-NbSe$_2$ with a step junction, demonstrating supercurrent in clean limit below a critical temperature of 6.6 K and a high residual resistance ratio of 17. The upper critical field was estimated to be 4.5 T and the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length 8.6 nm. Additionally, we observed phase transitions induced by vortex viscous dynamics in the 2H-NbSe$_2$ step junction. Analysis of the pinning force density using the Dew-Hughes model indicates that the pinning force in the 2H-NbSe$_2$ device can be attributed to step junction, related to the surface-$\Delta\kappa$ type of pinning centers. Our findings pave the way for engineering pinning forces by introducing artificial pinning centers through partial atomic thickness variation in layered 2D superconductors while minimizing unwanted quality degradation in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the energy-entropy ratio inequality in quantum field theory (QFT) established by one of us from localized states to a larger class of states. The states considered in this paper can be in a charged (non-vacuum) representation of the QFT or may be only approximately localized in the region under consideration. Our inequality is $S(\Psi |\!| \Omega) \le 2\pi R \, ( \Psi, H_\rho \Psi ) + \log d(\rho) + \varepsilon$, where $S$ is the relative entropy, where $R$ is a "radius" (width) characterizing the size of the region, $d(\rho)$ is the statistical (quantum) dimension of the given charged sector $\rho$ hosting the quantum state $\Psi$, $\Omega$ is the vacuum state, $H_\rho$ is the Hamiltonian in the charged sector, and $\varepsilon$ is a tolerance measuring the deviation of $\Psi$ from the vacuum according to observers in the causal complement of the region.</description>

      <title>Gapless Symmetry-Protected Topological States in Measurement-Only Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-only quantum circuits offer a versatile platform for realizing intriguing quantum phases of matter. However, gapless symmetry-protected topological (gSPT) states remain insufficiently explored in these settings. In this Letter, we generalize the notion of gSPT to the critical steady state by investigating measurement-only circuits. Using large-scale Clifford circuit simulations, we investigate the steady-state phase diagram across several families of measurement-only circuits that exhibit topological nontrivial edge states at criticality. In the Ising cluster circuits, we uncover a symmetry-enriched non-unitary critical point, termed symmetry-enriched percolation, characterized by both topologically nontrivial edge states and string operator. Additionally, we demonstrate the realization of a steady-state gSPT phase in a $\mathbb Z_4$ circuit model. This phase features topological edge modes and persists within steady-state critical phases under symmetry-preserving perturbations. Furthermore, we provide a unified theoretical framework by mapping the system to the Majorana loop model, offering deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Approach to Zauner's Conjecture via the Stark Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a construction of $d^2$ complex equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$, also known as SICPOVMs, which were conjectured by Zauner to exist for all d. The construction gives a putatively complete list of SICs with Weyl-Heisenberg symmetry in all dimensions d &gt; 3. Specifically, we give an explicit expression for an object that we call a ghost SIC, which is constructed from the real multiplication values of a special function and which is Galois conjugate to a SIC. The special function, the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle, is a tuple of meromorphic functions indexed by a congruence subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We prove that our construction gives a valid SIC in every case assuming two conjectures: the order 1 abelian Stark conjecture for real quadratic fields and a special value identity for the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle. The former allows us to prove that the ghost and the SIC are Galois conjugate over an extension of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta})$ where $\Delta = (d+1)(d-3)$, while the latter allows us to prove idempotency of the presumptive fiducial projector. We provide computational tests of our SIC construction by cross-validating it with known exact solutions, with the numerical work of Scott and Grassl, and by constructing four numerical examples of inequivalent SICs in d=100, three of which are new. We further consider rank-r generalizations called r-SICs given by equichordal configurations of r-dimensional complex subspaces. We give similar conditional constructions for r-SICs for all r, d such that r(d-r) divides $(d^2-1)$. Finally, we study the structure of the field extensions conjecturally generated by the r-SICs. If $K$ is any real quadratic field, then either every abelian Galois extension of $K$, or else every abelian extension for which 2 is unramified, is generated by our construction; the former holds for a positive density of field discriminants.</description>

Abstract: Quantum k-SAT (the problem of determining whether a k-local Hamiltonian is frustration-free) is known to be QMA_1-complete for k &gt;= 3, and hence likely hard for quantum computers to solve. Building on a classical result of Alon and Shapira, we show that quantum k-SAT can be solved in randomised polynomial time given the `property testing' promise that the instance is either satisfiable (by any state) or far from satisfiable by a product state; by `far from satisfiable by a product state' we mean that \epsilon n^k constraints must be removed before a product state solution exists, for some fixed \epsilon &gt; 0. The proof has two steps: we first show that for a satisfiable instance of quantum k-SAT, most subproblems on a constant number of qubits are satisfiable by a product state. We then show that for an instance of quantum k-SAT which is far from satisfiable by a product state, most subproblems are unsatisfiable by a product state. Given the promise, quantum k-SAT may therefore be solved by checking satisfiability by a product state on randomly chosen subsystems of constant size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two main approaches to quantum computing are gate-based computation and analog computation, which are polynomially equivalent in terms of complexity, and they are often seen as alternatives to each other. In this work, we present a method for fitting one-dimensional probability distributions as a practical example of how analog and gate-based computation can be used together to perform different tasks within a single algorithm. In particular, we propose a strategy for encoding data within an adiabatic evolution model, which accomodates the fitting of strictly monotonic functions, as it is the cumulative distribution function of a dataset. Subsequently, we use a Trotter-bounded procedure to translate the adiabatic evolution into a quantum circuit in which the evolution time t is identified with the parameters of the circuit. This facilitates computing the probability density as derivative of the cumulative function using parameter shift rules.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Hamiltonian Simulation Techniques to Compile Operations on Bosonic Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circuit QED enables the combined use of qubits and oscillator modes. Despite a variety of available gate sets, many hybrid qubit-boson (i.e., oscillator) operations are realizable only through optimal control theory (OCT) which is oftentimes intractable and uninterpretable. We introduce an analytic approach with rigorously proven error bounds for realizing specific classes of operations via two matrix product formulas commonly used in Hamiltonian simulation, the Lie--Trotter and Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff product formulas. We show how this technique can be used to realize a number of operations of interest, including polynomials of annihilation and creation operators, i.e., $a^p {a^\dagger}^q$ for integer $p, q$. We show examples of this paradigm including: obtaining universal control within a subspace of the entire Fock space of an oscillator, state preparation of a fixed photon number in the cavity, simulation of the Jaynes--Cummings Hamiltonian, simulation of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and more. This work demonstrates how techniques from Hamiltonian simulation can be applied to better control hybrid boson-qubit devices.</description>

      <title>All-microwave Lamb shift engineering for a fixed frequency multi-level superconducting qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the electromagnetic vacuum is responsible for the Lamb shift, which is a crucial phenomenon in quantum electrodynamics (QED). In circuit QED, the readout or bus resonators that are dispersively coupled can result in a significant Lamb shift of the qubit. However, previous approaches or proposals for controlling the Lamb shift in circuit QED demand overheads in circuit designs or non-perturbative renormalization of the system's eigenbases, which can impose formidable limitations.In this work, we propose and demonstrate an all-microwave method for controlling the Lamb shift of fixed-frequency transmons. We employ the drive-induced longitudinal coupling between the transmon and resonator. By simply using an off-resonant monochromatic drive near the resonator frequency, we can control the net Lamb shift up to 30 MHz and engineer it to zero with the drive-induced longitudinal coupling without facing the aforementioned challenges. Our work establishes an efficient way of engineering the fundamental effects of the electromagnetic vacuum and provides greater flexibility in non-parametric frequency controls of multilevel systems.</description>

      <title>Response to "The measurement postulates of quantum mechanics are not redundant"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adrian Kent has recently presented a critique [arXiv:2307.06191] of our paper [Nat. Comms. 10, 1361 (2019)] in which he claims to refute our main result: the measurement postulates of quantum mechanics can be derived from the rest of postulates, once we assume that the set of mixed states of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space is finite-dimensional. To construct his argument, Kent considers theories resulting from supplementing quantum mechanics with hypothetical "post-quantum" measurement devices. We prove that each of these theories contains pure states (i.e. states of maximal knowledge) which are not rays of the Hilbert space, in contradiction with the "pure state postulate" of quantum mechanics. We also prove that these alternatives violate the finite-dimensionality of mixed states. Each of these two facts separately invalidates the refutation. In this note we also clarify the assumptions used in [Nat. Comms. 10, 1361 (2019)] and discuss the notions of pure state, physical system, and the sensitivity of the structure of the state space under modifications of the measurements or the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Learning Informative Latent Representation for Quantum State Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is the process of reconstructing the complete state of a quantum system (mathematically described as a density matrix) through a series of different measurements. These measurements are performed on a number of identical copies of the quantum system, with outcomes gathered as frequencies. QST aims to recover the density matrix or the properties of the quantum state from the measured frequencies. Although an informationally complete set of measurements can specify the quantum state accurately in an ideal scenario with a large number of identical copies, both the measurements and identical copies are restricted and imperfect in practical scenarios, making QST highly ill-posed. The conventional QST methods usually assume accurate measured frequencies or rely on manually designed regularizers to handle the ill-posed reconstruction problem, suffering from limited applications in realistic scenarios. Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNN) led to the emergence of deep learning in QST. However, existing DL-based QST approaches often employ generic DNN models that are not optimized for imperfect conditions of QST. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder architecture tailored for QST with imperfect measurement data. Our method leverages a transformer-based encoder to extract an informative latent representation (ILR) from imperfect measurement data and employs a decoder to predict the quantum states based on the ILR. We anticipate that the high-dimensional ILR will capture more comprehensive information about the quantum states. To achieve this, we conduct pre-training of the encoder using a pretext task that involves reconstructing high-quality frequencies from measured frequencies. Extensive simulations and experiments demonstrate the remarkable ability of the informative latent representation to deal with imperfect measurement data in QST.</description>

Abstract: We propose new entanglement measures as the detection performance based on the hypothesis testing setting. We clarify how our measures work for detecting an entangled state by extending the quantum Sanov theorem. Our analysis covers the finite-length setting. Exploiting this entanglement measure, we present how to derive an entanglement witness to detect the given entangled state by using the geometrical structure of this measure. We derive their calculation formulas for maximally correlated states, and propose their algorithms that work for general entangled states. In addition, we investigate how our algorithm works for solving the membership problem for separability. Further, employing this algorithm, we propose a method to find entanglement witness for a given entangled state.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of universality in the anyon model described by the $SU(2)$ Witten-Chern-Simons theory at level $k$. A classic theorem of Freedman-Larsen-Wang states that for $k \geq 3, \ k \neq 4$, braiding of the anyons of topological charge $1/2$ is universal for topological quantum computing. For the case of one qubit, we prove a stronger result that double-braiding of such anyons alone is already universal.</description>

Abstract: There are two powerful arguments against the possibility of extending quantum mechanics, the violation of Bell inequalities and the Kochen-Specker theorem, but the connection between the two remains confused. Following the distinctive strategy proposed by Cabello [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 070401 (2021)], Bell inequalities can be violated by state-independent contextuality sets. However, the experimental realization of such ideas is challenging as it requires high-dimensional entanglement. Orbital angular momentum provides an unlimited state space and the number of effective dimensions can be readily tailored as required. We performed an experimental test of non-locality based on Bell inequalities from contextuality, using orbital angular momentum entanglement in a bipartite photonic system. Our experiment not only shows a new way to produce non-locality but also connects contextuality and non-locality, two fundamental quantum resources that are critical for quantum computation and secure communication tasks.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state reconstruction is an essential element in quantum information processing. However, efficient and reliable reconstruction of non-trivial quantum states in the presence of hardware imperfections can be challenging. This task is particularly demanding for high-dimensional states encoded in continuous-variable (CV) systems, where a large number of grid-based measurements are often used to adequately sample relevant regions of phase space. In this work, we introduce an efficient and robust technique of Optimized Reconstruction with Excitation Number Sampling (ORENS) based on the idea of generalized Q-function. We use a standard bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) setup to experimentally demonstrate effective state reconstruction using the theoretically minimum number of measurements. Our investigation highlights that ORENS is naturally free of parasitic system dynamics and resilient to decoherence effects in the hardware, enabling it to outperform the conventional reconstruction techniques in cQED such as Wigner tomography. Finally, ORENS relies only on the ability to accurately measure the excitation number of a given CV state, making it a versatile and accessible tool for a wide range of CV platforms and readily scalable to multimode systems. Thus, our work provides a crucial and valuable primitive for practical quantum information processing using bosonic modes.</description>

Abstract: We consider entanglement distillation with noisy operations in which quantum measurements that constitute a general quantum operation are particularly noisy. We present a protocol for purifying noisy measurements and show that imperfect local operations can distill entanglement. The protocol works for arbitrary noisy measurements in general and is cost-effective and resource-efficient with single additional qubit per party to resolve the distillation of entanglement. The purification protocol is feasible with currently available quantum technologies and readily applied to entanglement applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient tensor-network-based approach for simulating large-scale quantum circuits, demonstrated using Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs). Our method effectively reduces exponential runtime growth to near-quadratic scaling with respect to the number of qubits in practical scenarios. Traditional state-vector simulations become computationally infeasible beyond approximately 50 qubits; in contrast, our simulator successfully handles QSVMs with up to 784 qubits, completing simulations within seconds on a single high-performance GPU. Furthermore, by employing the Message Passing Interface (MPI) in multi-GPU environments, the approach shows strong linear scalability, reducing computation time as dataset size increases. We validate the framework on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving successful multiclass classification and emphasizing the potential of QSVMs for high-dimensional data analysis. By integrating tensor-network techniques with high-performance computing resources, this work demonstrates both the feasibility and scalability of large-qubit quantum machine learning models, providing a valuable validation tool in the emerging Quantum-HPC ecosystem.</description>

Abstract: In generative learning, models are trained to produce new samples that follow the distribution of the target data. These models were historically difficult to train, until proposals such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) emerged, where a generative and a discriminative model compete against each other in a minimax game. Quantum versions of the algorithm were since designed, both for the generation of classical and quantum data. While most work so far has focused on qubit-based architectures, in this article we present a quantum GAN based on linear optical circuits and Fock-space encoding, which makes it compatible with near-term photonic quantum computing. We demonstrate that the model can learn to generate images by training the model end-to-end experimentally on a single-photon quantum processor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a first-of-its-kind analysis on post-Trotter simulation of U(1), SU(2) and SU(3) lattice gauge theories including fermions in arbitrary spatial dimension. We provide explicit circuit constructions as well as T-gate counts and logical qubit counts for Hamiltonian simulation. We find up to 25 orders of magnitude reduction in space-time volume over Trotter methods for simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories relevant to the standard model. This improvement results from our algorithm having polynomial scaling with the number of colors in the gauge theory, achieved by utilizing oracle constructions relying on the sparsity of physical operators, in contrast to the exponential scaling seen in state-of-the-art Trotter methods which employ explicit mappings onto Pauli operators. Our work demonstrates that the use of advanced algorithmic techniques leads to dramatic reductions in the cost of simulating fundamental interactions, bringing it in step with resources required for first principles quantum simulation of chemistry.</description>

      <title>Qudit Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Inequality and Nonlocality from Wigner Negativity</title>

Abstract: Nonlocality is an essential concept that distinguishes quantum from classical models and has been extensively studied in systems of qubits. For higher-dimensional systems, certain results for their two-level counterpart, like Bell violations with stabilizer states and Clifford operators, do not generalize. On the other hand, similar to continuous variable systems, Wigner negativity is necessary for nonlocality in qudit systems. We propose a new generalization of the CHSH inequality for qudits by inquiring correlations related to the Wigner negativity of stabilizer states under the adjoint action of a generalization of the qubit $\pi/8$-gate. A specified stabilizer state maximally violates the inequality among all qudit states based on its Wigner negativity. The Bell operator not only serves as a measure for the singlet fraction but also quantifies the volume of Wigner negativity. Additionally, we show how a bipartite entangled qudit state can serve as a witness for contextuality when it exhibits Wigner negativity. Furthermore, we give deterministic Bell violations, as well as violations with a constant number of measurements, for the Bell state relying on operators innate to higher-dimensional systems than the qudit at hand.</description>

      <title>Universal perspective on nonadiabatic quantum control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stable and fast path linking two arbitrary states of a quantum system is generally required for state-engineering protocols, such as stimulated Raman adiabatic passage, shortcuts to adiabaticity, and holonomic transformation. Such a path is also fundamental to the exact solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. We construct a universal control framework using an ancillary picture, in which the time-dependent Hamiltonian can be diagonalized. Multiple desired paths can be derived by the von Neumann equation for parametric ancillary projection operators. No transition exists among the ancillary basis states during the time evolution. Under various conditions, our control framework reduces to the nonadiabatic holonomic transformation, the Lewis-Riesenfeld theory for invariants, and counterdiabatic driving methods. In addition, it is applicable to the cyclic transfer of system populations that could be a hard problem for existing methods. Our work can provide a full-rank time-evolution operator for a time-dependent quantum system with a finite number of dimensions.</description>

Abstract: In this short letter, I present a powerful application in dimensionality reduction of the lesser-used Jacobi-Davidson algorithm for the generalized eigenvalue decomposition. When combined with matrix-free implementations of relevant operators, this technique allows for the computation of the dynamics of an arbitrary quantum state to be done in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time, where $n$ is the size of the original Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Squeezed states of light after high-harmonic generation in excited atomic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) has recently emerged as a promising method for generating non-classical states of light with frequencies spanning from the infrared up to the extreme ultraviolet regime. In this work, we theoretically investigate the generation of squeezed states of light through HHG processes in atomic systems that had been initially driven to their first excited state. Our study reveals significant single-mode squeezing in both the driving field and low-order harmonic modes. Additionally, we characterize two-mode squeezing features in the generated states, both between fundamental and harmonic modes, and among the harmonic modes themselves. Using these correlations, we demonstrate the generation of optical Schr\"odinger kitten states through heralding measurements, specifically via photon subtraction in one of the modes influenced by two-mode squeezing.</description>

Abstract: The ability to process and store information on surrounding nuclear spins is a major requirement for group-IV color center-based repeater nodes. We demonstrate coherent control of a ${}^{13}$C nuclear spin strongly coupled to a negatively charged germanium-vacancy center in diamond with coherence times beyond 2.5s at mK temperatures, which is the longest reported for group-IV defects. Detailed analysis allows us to model the system's dynamics, extract the coupling parameters, and characterize noise. We estimate an achievable memory time of 18.1s with heating limitations considered, paving the way to successful applications as a quantum repeater node.</description>

Abstract: On-chip thermometry at deep-cryogenic temperatures is vital in quantum computing applications to accurately quantify the effect of increased temperature on qubit performance. In this work, we present a sub-1 K temperature sensor in CMOS technology based on the temperature dependence of the critical current of a superconducting (SC) thin-film. The sensor is implemented in 22-nm fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI) technology and comprises a 6 nA resolution current-output digital-to-analog converter (DAC), a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) with a SC thin-film as a gain element, and a voltage comparator. The circuit dissipates 1.5 uW and is demonstrated operating at ambient temperatures as low as 15 mK, providing a variable temperature resolution reaching sub-10 mK.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Robust High-Precision Atomic Gravimetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic gravimeters are the most accurate sensors for measuring gravity, yet a significant challenge lies in achieving high precision while also maintaining high dynamic range and robustness. Here, we develop a protocol for achieving robust high-precision atomic gravimetry based upon adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation. Our protocol incorporates a sequence of interferometry measurements taken with short to long interrogation times and offers several crucial advantages. Firstly, it enables a high dynamic range without the need to scan multiple fringes for pre-estimation, making it more efficient than the conventional frequentist method. Secondly, it improves robustness against noise, allowing for a significant improvement in measurement precision in noisy environments. The enhancement can be more than 5 times for a transportable gravimeter [Sci. Adv. 5, eaax0800 (2019)] and up to an order of magnitude for a state-of-the-art fountain gravimeter [Phys. Rev. A 88, 043610 (2013)]. Notably, by optimizing the interferometry sequence, our approach can improve the scaling of the measurement precision ($\Delta g_{est}$) versus the total interrogation time ($\tilde{T}$) to $\Delta g_{est} \propto \tilde{T}^{-2}$ or even better, in contrast to the conventional one $\Delta g_{est} \propto \tilde{T}^{-0.5}$. Our approach offers superior precision, increased dynamic range, and enhanced robustness, making it highly promising for a range of practical sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Challenging Excited States from Adaptive Quantum Eigensolvers: Subspace Expansions vs. State-Averaged Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prediction of electronic structure for strongly correlated molecules represents a promising application for near-term quantum computers. Significant attention has been paid to ground state wavefunctions, but excited states of molecules are relatively unexplored. In this work, we consider the ADAPT-VQE algorithm, a single-reference approach for obtaining ground states, and its state-averaged generalization for computing multiple states at once. We demonstrate for both rectangular and linear H$_4$, as well as for BeH$_2$, that this approach, which we call MORE-ADAPT-VQE, can make better use of small excitation manifolds than an analagous method based on a single-reference ADAPT-VQE calculation, q-sc-EOM. In particular, MORE-ADAPT-VQE is able to accurately describe both avoided crossings and crossings between states of different symmetries. In addition to more accurate excited state energies, MORE-ADAPT-VQE can recover accurate transition dipole moments in situations where traditional ADAPT-VQE and q-sc-EOM struggle. These improvements suggest a promising direction toward the use of quantum computers for difficult excited state problems.</description>

      <title>Simplified projection on total spin zero for state preparation on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simple algorithm for projecting on $J=0$ states of a many-body system by performing a series of rotations to remove states with angular momentum projections greater than zero. Existing methods rely on unitary evolution with the two-body operator $J^2$, which when expressed in the computational basis contains many complicated Pauli strings requiring Trotterization and leading to very deep quantum circuits. Our approach performs the necessary projections using the one-body operators $J_x$ and $J_z$. By leveraging the method of Cartan decomposition, the unitary transformations that perform the projection can be parameterized as a product of a small number of two-qubit rotations, with angles determined by an efficient classical optimization. Given the reduced complexity in terms of gates, this approach can be used to prepare approximate ground states of even-even nuclei by projecting onto the $J=0$ component of deformed Hartree-Fock states. We estimate the resource requirements in terms of the universal gate set {$H$,$S$,CNOT,$T$} and briefly discuss a variant of the algorithm that projects onto $J=1/2$ states of a system with an odd number of fermions.</description>

Abstract: A new solver, named FLiMESolve, is exhibited which is well suited for time-periodic (Floquet-type) Hamiltonians. This solver maintains the benefits of other solvers presently considered, while superceding their usefulness within its own regime. FLiMESolve is able to efficiently and accurately simulate time-periodic systems while being faster and more accurate than other solvers and with the ability to relax the secular approximation inherent to the Lindblad Equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum correlations in four-wave-mixing from ensembles of cold two-level atoms may prevail without filtering over background light with well-known classical interpretations, such as Rayleigh scattering, as recently experimentally demonstrated in Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 128}, 083601 (2022). Here we provide an extended investigation of this effect, in which we detail the experimental procedure and the variation of the quantum correlation with various parameters of the system. Particularly, we show that the decay rate of the quantum correlations changes with the number of atoms in the sample, providing another indication of its superradiance-like nature. The nonclassical aspects of the signal occur for short timescales, but the long timescales carry as well a lot of information on the classical correlations of the system. This slow classical regime presents also two clearly distinct timescales, which we explain by two different pathways for the creation of biphotons. From the global analysis of the data in all its timescales, we are able to derive an empirical expression to fit the data, resulting in information on, among other parameters, the sample's temperature and superradiant-like acceleration. In general, the reported quantum correlations present a dependence on critical parameters of the system, such as optical depth and excitation power, that is quite different from other systems used for biphoton generation, and are more robust to changes in these parameters. This opens the possibility of exploring this process for efficient generation of narrow-band biphotons or of other quantum-correlated photonic states of higher order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open many-body quantum systems can exhibit intriguing nonequilibrium phases of matter, such as time crystals. In these phases, the state of the system spontaneously breaks the time-translation symmetry of the dynamical generator, which typically manifests through persistent oscillations of an order parameter. A paradigmatic model displaying such a symmetry breaking is the boundary time crystal, which has been extensively analyzed experimentally and theoretically. Despite the broad interest in these nonequilibrium phases, their thermodynamics and their fluctuating behavior remain largely unexplored, in particular for the case of coupled time crystals. In this work, we consider two interacting boundary time crystals and derive a consistent interpretation of their thermodynamic behavior. We fully characterize their average dynamics and the behavior of their quantum fluctuations, which allows us to demonstrate the presence of quantum and classical correlations in both the stationary and the time-crystal phases displayed by the system. We furthermore exploit our theoretical derivation to explore possible applications of time crystals as quantum batteries, demonstrating their ability to efficiently store energy.</description>

      <title>Non-classicality induces recombination in high-harmonic generation with circularly polarized fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear process in which a strong driving field interacts with a material, resulting in the frequency up-conversion of the driver into its high-order harmonics. This process is highly sensitive to the field's polarization: circular polarization, for instance, inhibits HHG. In this work, we demonstrate that the use of non-classical structured light enables HHG in this otherwise prohibitive configuration for classical drivers. In particular, we consider circularly polarized light with non-classical fluctuations, introduced via squeezing along one polarization direction, and show that these non-classical features prompt the HHG process, with the spectral properties of the emitted harmonics depending on the type of squeezing applied. We examine the electron dynamics during HHG, revealing that non-classical fluctuations act as an effective force that guides the electron trajectories toward recombination. This approach opens new pathways for integrating quantum optics in HHG, providing novel means of controlling the light-matter interaction dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14416v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a longstanding question of Aaronson and Kuperberg on whether there exists a classical oracle separating $\mathsf{QMA}$ from $\mathsf{QCMA}$. Settling this question in either direction would yield insight into the power of quantum proofs over classical proofs. We show that such an oracle exists if a certain quantum pseudorandomness conjecture holds. Roughly speaking, the conjecture posits that quantum algorithms cannot, by making few queries, distinguish between the uniform distribution over permutations versus permutations drawn from so-called "dense" distributions.
  Our result can be viewed as establishing a "win-win" scenario: either there is a classical oracle separation of $\mathsf{QMA}$ from $\mathsf{QCMA}$, or there is quantum advantage in distinguishing pseudorandom distributions on permutations.</description>

Abstract: Quantum error mitigation is regarded as a possible path to near-term quantum utility. The methods under the quantum error mitigation umbrella term, such as probabilistic error cancellation, zero-noise extrapolation or Clifford data regression are able to significantly reduce the error for the estimation of expectation values, although at an exponentially scaling cost, i.e., in the sampling overhead. In this work, we present a straightforward method for reducing the sampling overhead of PEC on Clifford circuits (and Clifford subcircuits) via Pauli error propagation alongside some classical preprocessing. While the methods presented in this work are restricted to Clifford circuits, we argue that Clifford sub circuits often occur in relevant calculations as for example the resource state generation in measurement based quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: We develop a diffeomorphism-invariant formulation of differential entropy for Riemannian spaces, addressing the lack of a fine-grained, coordinate-independent notion of information for continuous variables in physical space. We extend this formulation to the quantum domain by generalizing Wigner's quasiprobability density function to arbitrary Riemannian spaces and analytically continuing Shannon's differential entropy to include contributions from intermediate virtual quantum states. To demonstrate this framework, we compute the quantum phase space entropy of the harmonic oscillator energy eigenstates in Minkowski and anti-de Sitter geometries. Additionally, we derive a generalized quantum entropic uncertainty relation, extending the Bialynicki-Birula and Mycielski inequality to curved backgrounds. This work bridges concepts from information theory, geometry, and quantum physics to provide a systematic approach to studying quantum information in continuous and curved sample spaces.</description>

      <title>End-to-end switchless architecture for fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonics represents one of the most promising approaches to large-scale quantum computation with millions of qubits and billions of gates, owing to the potential for room-temperature operation, high clock speeds, miniaturization of photonic circuits, and repeatable fabrication processes in commercial photonic foundries. We present an end-to-end architecture for fault-tolerant continuous variable (CV) quantum computation using only passive on-chip components that can produce photonic qubits above the fault tolerance threshold with probabilities above 90%, and encodes logical qubits using physical qubits sampled from a distribution around the fault tolerance threshold. By requiring only low photon number resolution, the architecture enables the use of high-bandwidth photodetectors in CV quantum computing. Simulations of our qubit generation and logical encoding processes show a Gaussian cluster squeezing threshold of 12 dB to 13 dB. Additionally, we present a novel magic state generation protocol which requires only 13 dB of cluster squeezing to produce magic states with an order of magnitude higher probability than existing approaches, opening up the path to universal fault-tolerant quantum computation at less than 13 dB of cluster squeezing.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking in mixed states emerging from the quantum Ising model under multiple decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as R\'{e}nyi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of quantum operators written as a linear combination of permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider matrices given as a linear combination of permutations and analyze the impact of bit and phase flips on the perturbation of the eigenvalues. When the coefficients in the linear combination are positive, we observe that the eigenvalues of the resulting matrices are resilient to quantum bit-flip errors. In addition, we analyze the bit flips in combination with positive and negative coefficients and the phase flips. Although they are not much resilient to the errors, the numerical evidence shows that the perturbation of the eigenspectrum is very small when the rate of these errors is small. We also discuss the situation when this matrix is implemented through block encoding and there is a control register. Since any square matrix can be written as a sum of permutations with some coefficients, this paper gives a framework to study matrix computations in quantum algorithms related to numerical linear algebra. In addition, it can give ideas to design more error-resilient algorithms that may involve quantum registers with different error characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonance fluorescence spectra of a driven Kerr nonlinear resonator is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. When the Kerr nonlinear resonator is driven strongly such that the induced Rabi frequency is comparable to or larger than the Kerr nonlinearity, the system cannot be approximated as a two-level system. We theoretically derive characteristic features in the fluorescence spectra such as the decrease of the center-peak intensity and the asymmetric sideband peaks in the presence of finite dephasing. Those features are consistently explained by the population of the initial dressed state and its transition matrix element to the final dressed state of the transition corresponding to each peak. Finally, we experimentally measure the resonance fluorescence spectra of a driven superconducting Kerr nonlinear resonator and find a quantitative agreement with our theory.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient nonvolatile magnetization switching and multi-level states by current in single van der Waals topological ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.13022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust multi-level spin memory with the ability to write information electrically is a long-sought capability in spintronics, with great promise for applications. Here we achieve nonvolatile and highly energy-efficient magnetization switching in a single-material device formed of van-der-Waals topological ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2, whose magnetic information can be readily controlled by a tiny current. Furthermore, the switching current density and power dissipation are about 400 and 4000 times smaller than those of the existing spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory based on conventional magnet/heavy-metal systems. Most importantly, we also demonstrate multi-level states, switched by electrical current, which can dramatically enhance the information capacity density and reduce computing costs. Thus, our observations combine both high energy efficiency and large information capacity density in one device, showcasing the potential applications of the emerging field of van-der-Waals magnets in the field of spin memory and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Broken inversion symmetry in van der Waals topological ferromagnetic metal iron germanium telluride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inversion symmetry breaking is critical for many quantum effects and fundamental for spin-orbit torque, which is crucial for next-generation spintronics. Recently, a novel type of gigantic intrinsic spin-orbit torque has been established in the topological van-der-Waals (vdW) magnet iron germanium telluride. However, it remains a puzzle because no clear evidence exists for interlayer inversion symmetry breaking. Here, we report the definitive evidence of broken inversion symmetry in iron germanium telluride directly measured by the second harmonic generation (SHG) technique. Our data show that the crystal symmetry reduces from centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1 space group, giving the three-fold SHG pattern with dominant out-of-plane polarization. Additionally, the SHG response evolves from an isotropic pattern to a sharp three-fold symmetry upon increasing Fe deficiency, mainly due to the transition from random defects to ordered Fe vacancies. Such SHG response is robust against temperature, ensuring unaltered crystalline symmetries above and below the ferromagnetic transition temperature. These findings add crucial new information to our understanding of this interesting vdW metal, iron germanium telluride: band topology, intrinsic spin-orbit torque and topological vdW polar metal states.</description>

      <title>All van der Waals three-terminal SOT-MRAM realized by topological ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted massive attention because of their academic interest and application potential for the past few years. Its main advantage is the intrinsic two-dimensionality, enabling much smaller devices of novel concepts. One particular exciting direction lies in the current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT). Here, we, for the first time, realize an all vdW three-terminal SOT memory, employing the unique physics principle of gigantic intrinsic SOT of Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) and the well-known industry-adopted tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We designed the device operation procedure and fabricated the FGT/h-BN/FGT vdW heterostructure as a proof of concept. This device exhibits a classical TMR effect and unambiguously demonstrates the conception by precise performance as expected: the magnetic information of the top-FGT is written by current-driven SOT and read out by TMR separately. The writing and reading current paths are physically decoupled, enhancing the design and optimization flexibility substantially and further strengthening the device's endurance naturally. Our work would prompt more expansive use of vdW magnets for spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Iron chalcogenides superconductors, such as Fe(Te,Se) have recently garnered significant attention due to their simple crystal structure with a relatively easy synthesis process, high-temperature superconductivity, intrinsic topological band structure, and an unconventional pairing of superconductivity with ferromagnetism. Here, we report the complex in-plane refractive index measurement of nanometer-thin Fe(Te,Se) flake exfoliated from a single crystal FeTe$_{\text{0.6}}$Se$_{\text{0.4}}$ for photon wavelengths from 450 to 1100 nm over a temperature range from 4 K to 295 K. The results were obtained by employing a two-Drude model for the dielectric function of Fe(Te,Se), a multiband superconductor, and fitting the absolute optical reflection spectra using the transfer matrix method. A high extinction coefficient in the visible to near-infrared range makes nanometer-thin Fe(Te,Se) flakes a promising material for photodetection applications.</description>

      <title>Current Correlations and Conductivity in SYK-Like Systems: An Analytical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a functional-based approach to compute thermal expectation values for actions expressed in the $G-\Sigma$ formalism, applicable to any time sequence ordering. Utilizing this framework, we analyze the linear response to an electric field in various Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) chains. We consider the SYK chain where each dot is a complex $q/2$-body interacting SYK model, and we allow for $r/2$-body nearest-neighbor hopping where $r=\kappa q$. We find exact analytical expressions in the large-$q$ limit for conductivities across all temperatures at leading order in $1/q$ for three cases, namely $\kappa = \{ 1/2, 1, 2\}$. When $\kappa = \{1/2, 1\}$, we observe linear-in-temperature $T$ resistivities at low temperatures, indicative of strange metal behavior. Conversely, when $\kappa = 2$, the resistivity diverges as a power law at low temperatures, namely as $1/T^2$, resembling insulating behavior. As $T$ increases, there is a crossover to Fermi liquid behavior ($\sim T^2$) at the minimum resistivity. Beyond this, another crossover occurs to strange metal behavior ($\sim T$). In comparison to previous linear-in-$T$ results in the literature, we also show that the resistivity behavior exists even below the MIR bound, indicating a true strange metal instead of a bad metal. In particular, we find for the $\kappa = 2$ case a smooth crossover from an insulating phase to a Fermi liquid behavior to a true strange metal and eventually becoming a bad metal as temperature increases. We extend and generalize previously known results on resistivities to all temperatures, do a comparative analysis across the three models where we highlight the universal features and invoke scaling arguments to create a physical picture out of our analyses. Remarkably, we find a universal maximum DC conductivity across all three models when the hopping coupling strength becomes large.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compute the partition functions of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA for different boundary topologies, i.e. sphere and torus, using super-Virasoro TQFT. We use fusion and modular kernels of the super-Liouville theory to compute the necklace-channel conformal block and showcase formalism by proving that the inner product holds for superconformal blocks, defined as states in the Hilbert space. Finally, we compute the out-of-time-order correlator for the torus topology with superconformal primary insertions as matter using the tools of super-Virasoro TQFT and investigate its early-time behaviour.</description>

      <title>Types of dynamical behavior in a quasiperiodic mosaic lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic mosaic systems with the quasiperiodic potential being added periodically with a fixed lattice interval have attracted significant attention due to their peculiar spectral properties with exactly known mobility edges, which separate localized from delocalized states. These mobility edges do not vanish even in the region of large quasiperiodic potential strength, although the width of the energy window of extended states decreases with the increase in potential strength and thus becomes very narrow in the limit of strong quasiperiodic disorder. In this paper, we study the dynamics of a quasiperiodic mosaic lattice and unravel its peculiar dynamical properties. By scrutinizing the expansion dynamics of wave packet and the evolution of density distribution, we unveil that the long-time density distribution displays obviously different behaviors at odd and even sites in the region of large quasiperiodic potential strength. Particularly, the timescale of dynamics exhibits an inverse relationship with the quasiperiodic potential strength. To understand these behaviors, we derive an effective Hamiltonian in the large quasiperiodic potential strength region, which is composed of decoupled Hamiltonians defined on the odd and even sites, respectively. While all eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian defined on even sites are localized, the eigenstates of effective Hamiltonian defined on odd sites include both localized and extended eigenstates. Our results suggest that the effective Hamiltonian can describe the dynamical behaviors well in the large quasiperiodic potential strength region and provides an intuitive framework for understanding the peculiar dynamical behaviors in the quasiperiodic mosaic lattice.</description>

      <title>Two transitions in complex eigenvalue statistics: Hermiticity and integrability breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems have complex energy eigenvalues which are expected to follow non-Hermitian random matrix statistics when chaotic, or 2-dimensional (2d) Poisson statistics when integrable. We investigate the spectral properties of a many-body quantum spin chain, the Hermitian XXZ Heisenberg model with imaginary disorder. Its rich complex eigenvalue statistics is found to separately break both Hermiticity and integrability at different scales of the disorder strength. With no disorder, the system is integrable and Hermitian, with spectral statistics corresponding to the 1d Poisson point process. At very small disorder, we find a transition from 1d Poisson statistics to an effective $D$-dimensional Poisson point process, showing Hermiticity breaking. At intermediate disorder we find integrability breaking, as inferred from the statistics matching that of non-Hermitian complex symmetric random matrices in class AI$^\dag$. For large disorder, as the spins align, we recover the expected integrability (now in the non-Hermitian setup), indicated by 2d Poisson statistics. These conclusions are based on fitting the spin chain data of numerically generated nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour spacing distributions to an effective 2d Coulomb gas description at inverse temperature $\beta$. We confirm such an effective description of random matrices also applies in class AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$ up to next-to-nearest neighbour spacings.</description>

      <title>Unifying error-correcting code/Narain CFT correspondences via lattices over integers of cyclotomic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify Narain conformal field theories (CFTs) that correspond to code lattices for quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) over integers of cyclotomic fields $Q(\zeta_p)$ $(\zeta_p=e^{\frac{2\pi i}p})$ for general prime $p\geq 3$. This code-lattice construction is a generalization of more familiar ones such as Construction A${}_C$ for ternary codes and (after the generalization stated below) Construction A for binary codes, containing them as special cases. This code-lattice construction is redescribed in terms of root and weight lattices of Lie algebras, which allows to construct lattices for codes over rings $Z_q$ with non-prime $q$. Corresponding Narain CFTs are found for codes embedded into quotient rings of root and weight lattices of $ADE$ series, except $E_8$ and $D_k$ with $k$ even. In a sense, this provides a unified description of the relationship between various QECCs over $F_p$ (or $Z_q$) and Narain CFTs. A further extension on constructing the $E_8$ lattice from codes over the Mordell-Weil groups of extremal rational elliptic surfaces is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave and Quantum Graviton Interferometer Arm Detection of Gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the quantum and classical descriptions of gravitational wave detection in interferometers like LIGO. We demonstrate that a graviton scattering and quantum optics model succeeds in explaining the observed arm displacements, while the classical gravitational wave approach and a quantum graviton energy method also successfully predict the correct results. We provide a detailed analysis of why the quantum graviton energy approach succeeds, highlighting the importance of collective behavior and the quantum-classical correspondence in gravitational wave physics. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion about the quantum nature of gravity and its observable effects in macroscopic physics.</description>

      <title>Spin and Density Modes in a Binary Fluid of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the experimental observation of spin and density modes in a binary mixture of superfluids of light. A miscible Bose-Bose mixture with repulsive interactions is obtained by propagating, in the paraxial limit, the two circular polarization components of a laser through a non-linear hot atomic vapor. Controlling the intensity and phase for both polarizations allows us to selectively excite the fundamental modes of the mixture. Using a Bragg-like spectroscopy technique, we measure the dispersion relation and identify two distinct branches with different speeds of sound corresponding to the spin and density modes. At large photon density, we observe a crossing of these branches, which is due to an effective photon-photon interaction beyond the two-body regime and related to the saturation of the medium nonlinearity. This novel degree of freedom allows for precise control over the ratio of spin and density sound velocities and provide new insights into the control of binary mixtures collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-order tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. This work, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contraction with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023b), through this path matrices technique. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body dynamics for fermionic t-J model simulated with atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fermionic t-J model has been widely recognized as a canonical model in understanding various strongly correlated phases like cuprate high-Tc superconductivity. Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</description>

      <title>On Computational Complexity of 3D Ising Spin Glass: Lessons from D-Wave Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding an exact ground state of a 3D Ising spin glass is proven to be an NP-hard problem. Given validity of the exponential time hypothesis, its computational complexity was proven to be no less than $2^{N^{2/3}}$, where $N$ is the total number of spins. Here we report results of extensive experimentation with D-Wave 3D annealer with $N\leq 5627$. We found exact ground states (in a probabilistic sense) for typical realizations of 3D spin glasses with the efficiency, which scales as $2^{N/\beta}$ with $\beta\approx 10^{3}$. Based on statistical analysis of low energy states, we argue that with an improvement of annealing protocols and device noise reduction, $\beta$ can be increased even further. This suggests that, for $N&lt;\beta^3$, annealing devices provide a most efficient way to find the ground state.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric effect in van der Waals magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetoelectric (ME) effect is a fundamental concept in modern condensed matter physics and represents the electrical control of magnetic polarisations or vice versa. Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a new class of materials and exhibit novel ME effects with diverse manifestations. This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.</description>
