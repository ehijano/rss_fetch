      <title>Fast and direct preparation of a genuine lattice BEC via the quantum Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for dissipatively preparing a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) directly on a lattice, avoiding the need for a two-staged preparation procedure currently used in ultracold atom platforms. Our protocol is based on driving the lattice-subsystem into a non-equilibrium steady state, which we show to exhibit a lattice analog of a true BEC, where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. Furthermore, exploiting a symmetry-based Mpemba effect, we analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics, quantitatively assessing the speedups yielded by our protocol, as well as the fidelities of the prepared BEC.</description>

      <title>Quantum-stabilized states in magnetic dipolar quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A decade ago, a universal stabilization mechanism driven by quantum fluctuations was discovered in ultracold Bose gases of highly magnetic atoms. This mechanism prevents these systems from collapsing and instead allows exotic states of matter to arise, including ultradilute quantum droplets, crystallized quantum states, and specifically supersolids. We review the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these quantum-stabilized states, their emergence, and intriguing properties.</description>

      <title>Paraxial fluids of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paraxial fluids of light are a promising platform for exploring collective phenomena in a highly tunable environment. These systems, which map the propagation of light through nonlinear media onto the wavefunction of effective 2D quantum fluids, offer a complementary approach to traditional platforms such as cold atomic gases or superfluid helium. In this review, we present a detailed overview of the theoretical framework underlying paraxial fluids of light, including the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) and its mapping to the 2D+1 Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). We explore the hydrodynamic formulation of these systems and we provide a comparative analysis of fluids of light and cold atomic gases, examining key parameters and figures of merit.
  We then review the recent experimental advances and the experimental platforms currently used to realize paraxial fluids of light, including hot atomic vapors, photorefractive crystals, and thermo-optic media. Additionally, we question the geometry of the system extending the analogy from 2D+1 to lower or higher dimensions.
  Looking forward, we outline the potential future directions for the field, including the use of laser cooled atoms as nonlinear media, the study of two-component mixtures, and the exploration of quantum effects beyond the mean-field approximation. These developments promise to deepen our understanding of quantum fluids and potentially contribute to advances in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Topologically correlated bound states via a dynamical gauge field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in topological phases have opened new frontiers in materials science and quantum physics. However, their emergence in strongly correlated systems are less understood due to the complex interplay between particle interactions and band topology. In this work, we consider a cold-atom-based spin-dependent Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with a non-Hermitian dynamical gauge field (DGF), where two kinds of topologically correlated bound states are found to emerge from the DGF. Specifically, edge bound states with co-localization of both spin species arise from the interplay between DGF and nontrivial single-particle topology, and bulk bound states with extended distribution in the lattice emerges from nontrivial topology of inter-species band inversion. These bound states can coexist in same parameter regimes and compete with each other, leading to distinguished dynamical signatures. This work bridges the gap between conventional band topology and strongly correlated physics, establishing a new paradigm for discovering emergent topological phenomena in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Multiphoton-Multiatom Processes in Atomic Gases under Laser Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate simultaneous multiphoton-multiatom processes in atomic gases exposed to laser fields under specific frequency conditions, where multiple atoms are simultaneously excited through the absorption of one laser photon each. These processes represent natural high-order quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects that occur independently of inter-atomic interactions. A characteristic length scale emerges, governing the physical range over which these phenomena manifest. We propose experiments to demonstrate the fundamental aspects of these collective QED processes.</description>

      <title>The complete trans-series for conserved charges in the Lieb-Liniger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the complete trans-series solution for the (non-relativistic) moments of the rapidity density in the Lieb-Liniger model. The trans-series is written explicitly in terms of a perturbative basis, which can be obtained from the already known perturbative expansion of the density by solving several ordinary differential equations. Unknown integration constants are fixed from Volin's method. We have checked that our solution satisfies the analytical consistency requirements including the newly derived resurgence relations and agrees with the high precision numerical solution. Our results also provides the full analytic trans-series for the capacitance of the coaxial circular plate capacitor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the emergent properties of impurities immersed in a quantum bath is a fundamental challenge that can defy quasiparticle treatments. Here, we measure the spectral properties and real-time dynamics of mobile impurities injected into a weakly interacting homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, using two broad Feshbach resonances to tune both the impurity-bath and intrabath interactions. For attractive impurity-bath interactions, the impurity spectrum features a single branch, which away from the resonance corresponds to a well-defined attractive polaron; near the resonance we observe dramatic broadening of this branch, suggesting a breakdown of the quasiparticle picture. For repulsive impurity-bath interactions, the spectrum features two branches: the attractive branch that is dominated by excitations with energy close to that of the Feshbach dimer, but has a many-body character, and the repulsive polaron branch. Our measurements show that the behavior of impurities in weakly interacting baths is remarkably universal, controlled only by the bath density and a single dimensionless interaction parameter.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the information extractable from measurement distributions of two non-commuting spin observables in a multi-well spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. We provide a variety of analytic and numerical evidence that suitably chosen classical entropies and classical mutual informations thereof contain the typical feature of quantum entropies known in quantum field theories, that is, the area law, even in the non-Gaussian regime and for a non-zero temperature. Towards a feasible experimental implementation, we estimate entropic quantities from a finite number of samples without any additional assumptions on the underlying quantum state using k-nearest neighbor estimators.</description>

      <title>The Smearing of Quasi-Particles: Signatures in the Entanglement Entropy of Excited Many-Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entanglement spectrum serves as a powerful tool for probing the structure and dynamics of quantum many-body systems, revealing key information about symmetry, topology, and excitations. While the entanglement entropy (EE) of ground states typically follows an area law, highly excited states obey a volume law, leading to a striking contrast in their scaling behavior. In this paper, we investigate the crossover between these two regimes, focusing on the role of quasi-particles (QPs) in mediating this transition. By analyzing the energy dependence of EE in various many-body systems, we explore how the presence of long-lived QPs influences the entanglement structure of excited states. We present numerical results for spinless fermions, a spin chain near a many-body localization transition, and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which lacks a conventional QP description. Our findings are complemented by a theoretical model based on Fermi liquid theory, providing insight into the interaction-dependent scaling of EE and its consistency with numerical simulations. We find that a hallmark of QPs is a linear dependence of the eigenstate EE on energy, which breaks down at high energy and in the limit of strong interaction. The slope of this linear dependence reflects the QP weight, which reduces with interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Synthetic Gauge Fields in Ultracold Atoms via Spatially Engineered Vector Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme to generate synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms via VB-mediated coupling of internal states. This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</description>

      <title>Tunable pairing with local spin-dependent Rydberg molecule potentials in an atomic Fermi superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the energy spectrum and eigenstates of two-component atomic Fermi superfluids with tunable pairing interactions in the presence of spin-dependent ultra long-range Rydberg molecule (ULRM) potentials, within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. The attractive ULRM potentials lead to local density accumulation, while their difference results in a local polarization potential and induces the in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states whose energies lie below the bulk energy gap. A transition from equal-population to population-imbalance occurs as the pairing strength falls below a critical value, accompanied by the emergence of local Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) like states characterized by out-of-phase wave functions and lower energies compared to the YSR states. The negative contribution emanating from the FFLO-like states also causes a sign change in the gap function within the ULRM potentials. Depending on the Rydberg state generating the ULRM potentials, the transition towards population-imbalance can be on either the BCS or the Bose-Einstein condensation side of the Fermi superfluid. Additionally, spin-polarized bound states arise along with oscillatory ``clumpy states" to compensate for the local density difference. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations and measurements of the composite Rydberg atom-Fermi superfluid system.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms to solve atom reconfiguration problems. I. The redistribution-reconfiguration (red-rec) algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the redistribution-reconfiguration (red-rec) algorithm to prepare large configurations of atoms using arrays of dynamic optical traps. Red-rec exploits simple heuristics and exact subroutines to solve atom reconfiguration problems on grids. It admits a fast and efficient implementation suitable for real-time operation. We numerically quantify its performance using realistic physical parameters and operational constraints, both in the absence and presence of loss. Red-rec enables assembling large configurations of atoms with high mean success probability. Fast preparation times are achieved by harnessing parallel control operations that actuate multiple traps simultaneously. Faster preparation times are achieved by rejecting configurations of atoms containing fewer atoms than a given threshold. However, the number of traps required to prepare a compact-centered configuration of atoms on a grid with a probability of 0.5 scales as the 3/2 power of the number of desired atoms. This finding highlights some of the challenges associated with scaling up configurations of atoms beyond tens of thousands of atoms.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms to solve atom reconfiguration problems. II. The assignment-rerouting-ordering (aro) algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Programmable arrays of optical traps enable the assembly of configurations of single atoms to perform controlled experiments on quantum many-body systems. Finding the sequence of control operations to transform an arbitrary configuration of atoms into a predetermined one requires solving an atom reconfiguration problem quickly and efficiently. A typical approach to solve atom reconfiguration problems is to use an assignment algorithm to determine which atoms to move to which traps. This approach results in control protocols that exactly minimize the number of displacement operations; however, this approach does not optimize for the number of displaced atoms or the number of times each atom is displaced, resulting in unnecessary control operations that increase the execution time and failure rate of the control protocol. In this work, we propose the assignment-rerouting-ordering (aro) algorithm to improve the performance of assignment-based algorithms in solving atom reconfiguration problems. The aro algorithm uses an assignment subroutine to minimize the total distance traveled by all atoms, a rerouting subroutine to reduce the number of displaced atoms, and an ordering subroutine to guarantee that each atom is displaced at most once. The ordering subroutine relies on the existence of a partial ordering of moves that can be obtained using a polynomial-time algorithm that we introduce within the formal framework of graph theory. We numerically quantify the performance of the aro algorithm in the presence and in the absence of loss, and show that it outperforms the exact, approximation, and heuristic algorithms that we use as benchmarks. Our results are useful for assembling large configurations of atoms with high success probability and fast preparation time, as well as for designing and benchmarking novel atom reconfiguration algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hall response in interacting bosonic and fermionic ladders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use bosonization, retaining band curvature terms, to analyze the Hall response of interacting bosonic and fermionic two-leg ladders threaded by a flux. We derive an explicit expression of the Hall imbalance in a perturbative expansion in the band curvature, retaining fully the interactions. We show that the flux dependence of the Hall imbalance allows to distinguish the two phases (Meissner and Vortex) that are present for a bosonic ladder. For small magnetic field we relate the Hall resistance, both for bosonic and fermionic ladders, to the density dependence of the charge sitffness of the system in absence of flux. Our expression unveil a universal interaction-independent behavior in the Galilean invariant case.</description>

Abstract: Landauer's principle bridges information theory and thermodynamics by linking the entropy change of a system during a process to the average energy dissipated to its environment. Although typically discussed in the context of erasing a single bit of information, Landauer's principle can be generalised to characterise irreversibility in out-of-equilibrium processes, such as those involving complex quantum many-body systems. Specifically, the relationship between the entropy change of the system and the energy dissipated to its environment can be decomposed into changes in quantum mutual information and a difference in relative entropies of the environment. Here we experimentally probe Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime using a quantum field simulator of ultracold Bose gases. Employing a dynamical tomographic reconstruction scheme, we track the temporal evolution of the quantum field following a global mass quench from a massive to massless Klein-Gordon model and analyse the thermodynamic and information-theoretic contributions to a generalised entropy production for various system-environment partitions of the composite system. Our results verify the quantum field theoretical calculations, interpreted using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture. Our work demonstrates the ability of ultracold atom-based quantum field simulators to experimentally investigate quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Dual-Space Invariance as a Definitive Signature of Critical States in Anderson Localization</title>

Abstract: Critical states represent a fundamental and fascinating research frontier in Anderson localization physics, known for their non-ergodic properties, including multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, exactly characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge up to now. In this work, we establish a universal mechanism demonstrating that critical states must maintain dual-space invariance in both position and momentum representations, leading to delocalized dynamics in both spaces. Therefore, our discovery soundly answers this long-standing unsolved puzzle regarding the definition of the critical state and its rigorous characterization. Furthermore, keeping pace with the idea of Liu-Xia criterion, we prove rigorously that physical quantities being directly observed in experiments, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces as expected. Subsequent numerical simulations provide the smoking gun for the correctness of the dual-space invariance, thereby not only highlighting the universality of the rigorous mechanism, but also establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</description>
