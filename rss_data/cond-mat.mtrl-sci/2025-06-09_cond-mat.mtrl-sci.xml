      <title>On the role of secondary electrons in the color change of high-dose X-ray irradiated topaz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to its high brightness, synchrotron light allows for investigating with extreme precision the physical properties of matter. The irradiation with high-dose X-ray beams may also lead to modification of the latter, thus allowing for material processing. Here we investigate the color change of topaz irradiated with synchrotron light, shedding light on the role played by secondary electrons in the formation of color centers. As a matter of fact, treatments of natural topaz to induce its color change are largely used in the jewelry industry. Nevertheless, the physical mechanisms behind the topaz's color change have not yet been fully understood. To date, it has been shown that the combined action of high-energy beam irradiation (either electrons, neutrons, or {\gamma}-rays) and thermal annealing permits to provide colorless natural topaz with an artificial blue color, which is largely appealed in the gem market. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to irreversibly provide natural topaz with a blue color even by exploiting lower energy beams, such as X-rays, provided that enough dose is absorbed, thus paving the way for developing novel protocols for making artificially blue topazes.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Analysis of Combustion and Ignition in As-milled and Annealed Al/Zr Composite Powders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micron-scale metal-based composite powders are promising for energetic applications due to their tailored ignition and combustion properties. In particular, ball-milled Al/Zr composites exhibit lower ignition thresholds than pure aluminum, driven by exothermic intermetallic formation reactions and have demonstrated enhanced combustion properties. However, the extent to which this heat release governs ignition and combustion remains unclear, especially when progressively removed through annealing. To systematically investigate this effect, we synthesized Al/Zr powders (3Al:Zr, Al:Zr, and Al:3Zr at%) via ball milling, annealed them in argon up to 1000 C to partially complete the formation reactions, and characterized their ignition and combustion behavior. Ignition thresholds were measured using a hot wire method across different environments, while high-speed hyperspectral imaging tracked single-particle burn durations and temperatures. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method was developed to quantify the frequency of microexplosions. Results show that annealing - and thus reducing available reaction heat - increases ignition thresholds, most significantly for Al-rich compositions. In contrast, Zr-rich powders exhibit little change in ignition thresholds due to oxidation aiding ignition. Despite removing the available heat that drives ignition, average combustion temperatures range from 2400-3000 K and increased with annealing for Al- and Zr-rich powders. Average maximum temperatures are 100 to 400 K higher. The frequency of microexplosions remains high (&gt;46%) and increases with annealing for all but the Al-rich powders. These findings suggest that while homogeneous Al/Zr powders (e.g., atomized) may exhibit higher ignition thresholds, they can achieve comparable combustion performance once ignited.</description>

      <title>Momentum-space Metric Tensor from Nonadiabatic Evolution of Bloch Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal a fundamental geometric structure of momentum space arising from the nonadiabatic evolution of Bloch electrons. By extending semiclassical wave packet theory to incorporate nonadiabatic effects, we introduce a momentum-space metric tensor -- the nonadiabatic metric. This metric gives rise to two velocity corrections, dubbed geometric and geodesic velocities, providing a unified and intuitive framework for understanding nonlinear and nonadiabatic transport phenomena beyond Berry phase effects. Furthermore, we show that the nonadiabatic metric endows momentum space with a curved geometry, recasting wave packet dynamics as forced geodesic motion. In this picture, the metric defines distances, the Berry connection acts as a gauge potential, band dispersion serves as a scalar potential, and the toroidal topology of the Brillouin zone imposes periodic boundary conditions. When the nonadiabatic metric is constant, it reduces to an effective mass, allowing electrons to behave as massive particles in flat bands. In a flat Chern band with harmonic attractive interactions, the two-body wave functions mirror the Landau-level wave functions on a torus.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic defects explain n-type conductivity in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling native defects is essential for unlocking the full potential of two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors. Here, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles calculations are used to explore the electronic properties of bulk CrSBr. ARPES measurements reveal clear signatures of conduction band filling in as-grown crystals, indicative of unintentional doping. An analysis of intrinsic defects based on density functional theory (DFT) identifies chromium interstitials ($Cr_i$) stabilized between CrSBr layers as the most favorable shallow donors. Bromine-on-sulfur antisites ($Br_S$) and bromine vacancies ($V_{Br}$) are also found to act as potential donors, albeit with deeper ionization energies. Our results shed light on the origin of unintentional $\textit{n}$-type doping of CrSBr and pave the way for new strategies for defect control and electronic property tuning in this van der Waals magnet.</description>

      <title>Imaging 3D polarization dynamics via deep learning 4D-STEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in ferroelectrics highlight the role of three-dimensional (3D) polar entities in forming topological polar textures and generating giant electromechanical responses, during polarization rotation. However, current electron microscopy methods lack the depth resolution to resolve the polarization component along the electron beam direction, which restricts full characterization. Here, we present a deep learning framework combined with four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy to reconstruct 3D polarization maps in Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 thin-film capacitors with picometer-level accuracy under applied electric fields. Our approach enables observation of polar nanodomains consistent with the polar slush model and shows that switching occurs through coordinated vector rotation toward &lt;111&gt; energy minima, rather than magnitude changes. Furthermore, regions with higher topological density exhibit smaller polarization variation when the electric field changes, indicating topological protection. Our work reveals the value of 3D polarization mapping in elucidating complex nanoscale polar phenomena, with broad implications for emergent ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing z spin generation in trivial spin Hall materials for scalable, energy-efficient, field-free, complete spin-orbit torque switching applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable efforts in the past two decades, it has remained a major challenge to achieve switching of perpendicularly magnetized spin-orbit torque devices in a scalable, energy-efficient, field-free, integration-friendly, and complete manner. Here, we report giant enhancement of z spin generation in low-resistivity spin Hall metal/FeCoB devices by alloying the spin Hall metal Pt with Ti and by electric asymmetry engineering. The dampinglike spin torques of z spins and y spins are enhanced by 6 and 3 times relative to that of conventional Pt/FeCoB and enable complete, record-low-power, deterministic switching of FeCoB devices with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and high coercivity. The Pt75Ti25/FeCoB heterostructure also exhibits relatively low resistivity, wafer-scale uniform sputter-deposition on silicon oxide, good compatibility with magnetic tunnel junctions, and excellent thermal stability of exceeding 400 C. These results unambiguously establish the Pt75Ti25/FeCoB as the most compelling candidate for solving the bottleneck of scalable, energy-efficient, field-free, integration-friendly, and complete spin-orbit torque switching technologies. This work also provides a universal strategy for developing high-performance generators of z spin current and will stimulate the exploration of exotic spin currents by alloying trivial spin Hall materials.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Simulations of Cation Distribution and Defect Effects on the Performance of Substituted Ferrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates Mn-Zn ferrites (nominal composition \ce{Mn_{0.5}Zn_{0.5}Fe2O4}, MZF) substituted with tetravalent (\ce{Si^{4+}}), trivalent (\ce{Co^{3+}}), and divalent (\ce{Ca^{2+}}, \ce{Mg^{2+}}, \ce{Sn^{2+}}) ions. We comprehensively analyze how substitutions at specific tetrahedral and octahedral crystallographic sites modulate the spinel lattice's structural stability, electronic band structure, magnetic anisotropy, and electrical conductivity. Density functional theory (DFT) combined with Boltzmann transport theory is employed to probe the thermoelectric and phonon transport properties of pristine and doped MZF systems. Formation energy calculations indicate that substitutions with \ce{Si^{4+}}, \ce{Ca^{2+}}, and \ce{Mg^{2+}} enhance the thermodynamic stability of MZF, while \ce{Co^{3+}} and \ce{Sn^{2+}} substitutions exhibit slightly higher formation energies, indicating relatively lower stability. Electronic structure analyses confirm all substituted variants retain a finite band gap, preserving their semiconducting nature. Magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) calculations reveal that ferrites with mixed octahedral/tetrahedral substitutions display a narrower MAE distribution, signifying more uniform magnetic anisotropy. Thermoelectric property analysis at 300 K demonstrates that multivalent ion doping at either crystallographic site reduces electrical conductivity ($\sigma$) while concurrently enhancing the Seebeck coefficient ($S$). This inverse correlation highlights a doping-induced trade-off, likely driven by increased carrier scattering at defect sites and modifications to the electronic density of states near the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>Polarized electroluminescence with magnetic spectral tuning in van der Waals magnet CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized wavelength-tunable electroluminescence (EL) represents a critical on-demand functionality for next-generation optoelectronics. While conventional van der Waals (vdW) EL devices offer discrete wavelength switching constrained by fixed emission states, we report a novel platform enabling continuous spectral tuning combined with intrinsically polarized emission. By leveraging exciton-assisted inelastic tunneling in the anisotropic magnet CrSBr, our devices achieve uniform EL with a near unity degree of linear polarization ($\approx$ 94.3$\%$). The strong magneto-electronic coupling in CrSBr facilitates continuous magnetic-field-controlled spectral tuning through spin canting-induced band renormalization. This work establishes vdW magnets as a versatile platform for developing reconfigurable polarized light sources with simultaneous spectral and polarization control.</description>

      <title>What Really Drives Thermopower: Specific Heat or Entropy as the Unifying Principle Across Magnetic, Superconducting, and Nanoscale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermopower, a key parameter in thermoelectric performance, is often linked to either specific heat or entropy, yet the fundamental quantity that governs it has remained elusive. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework that identifies entropy per carrier, not specific heat, as the universal driver of thermopower across both closed and open systems. Using thermodynamic identities and the Onsager-Kelvin relation, we show that thermopower is universally proportional to entropy per carrier, while its apparent proportionality to specific heat arises only in systems where the specific heat follows a continuous power-law temperature dependence. To extend this framework to magnetic systems, we derive a general expression for magnon-drag thermopower that holds in both Newtonian (massive, parabolic) and relativistic (massless, linear) magnon regimes. In particular, we reformulate the momentum balance using a relativistic energy-momentum tensor, resolving conceptual inconsistencies in prior models that relied on ill-defined magnon masses in antiferromagnets. Our framework is further illustrated through three representative systems: (i) magnetic materials, where magnon and paramagnon entropy sustain thermopower across TC and TN; (ii) superconducting Nb, where anomalous thermopower emerges from entropy carried by Bogoliubov quasiparticles near TC; and (iii) a single-molecule junction, where entropy from occupation-number fluctuations governs thermopower in an open quantum system. We validate our unifying principle by comparing it with experimental data: thermopower measurements of superconducting niobium reveal the role of quasiparticle entropy near the critical temperature, and literature-reported specific heat data from a wide range of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials demonstrate consistent entropy-based scaling across magnetic transitions.</description>

      <title>Optoelectronically Active GaAs/GeSn-MQW/Ge Heterojunctions Created via Semiconductor Grafting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, advancements in semiconductor devices have been driven by lattice-matched heterojunctions with tailored band alignments through heteroepitaxy techniques. However, there is significant interest in expanding the capabilities of heterojunction devices, in particular utilizing extreme lattice mismatches. We demonstrate the manipulation of device behaviors and performance enhancement achievable through a lattice-mismatched, single-crystalline GaAs/GeSn-multi-quantum well (MQW)/Ge n-i-p heterojunction by employing advanced semiconductor grafting technology. With engineered band alignment and optical field distribution, the grafted GaAs/GeSn-MQW/Ge n-i-p photodiode achieved outstanding performance: a record-low dark current density of 1.22E10^-7 A/cm^2, an extended spectral response from ~0.5 to 2 um, and improved photoresponsivity of RVIS of 0.85 A/W and RNIR of 0.40 A/W at 520 and 1570 nm, respectively. The dark current density is at least 5 orders of magnitude lower than state-of-the-art GeSn photodiodes. The photoresponsivity demonstrates an approximately sevenfold enhancement in the VIS range and a threefold improvement in the NIR range compared to the reference epitaxial photodiode. This work presents a unique strategy for constructing lattice-mismatched semiconductor heterojunction devices. More importantly, the implications transcend the current GaAs/GeSn-MQW/Ge example, offering potential applications in other material systems and freeing device design from the stringent lattice-matching constraints of conventional heteroepitaxy.</description>

      <title>Exact eigenvalues and experimental signatures of Heisenberg-Kitaev interactions in spin-1/2 quantum clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and energy eigenstates of a spin-1/2 coupled trimer, tetramer in a star configuration, and tetrahedron. Using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with additional Kitaev interactions, we explore the thermodynamic signatures of the Kitaev interaction. Our results show that introducing a Kitaev interaction generates a second Schottky anomaly in the heat capacity for systems with a large K/J ratio. The Kitaev term also introduces nonlinear eigenvalues with respect to a magnetic field, pushing the clusters toward a regime similar to the incomplete Paschen-Back effect and triggering first and second-order quantum phase transitions along with robust thermodynamic behavior. Through this approach, we provide exact analytical solutions that offer insights into Kitaev interactions, both in molecular magnets and in extended systems such as honeycomb or Kagome lattices. Furthermore, we provide insight into experimental measurements for detecting Kitaev interactions in clusters.</description>

      <title>Spin fluctuations, absence of magnetic order, and crystal electric field studies in the Yb$^{3+}$-based triangular lattice antiferromagnet Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive experimental investigation of the structural, thermodynamic, static, and dynamic properties of a triangular lattice antiferromagnet Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$. Through the analysis of magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and specific heat, complemented by crystal electric field (CEF) calculations, we confirm the Kramers' doublet with effective spin $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ ground state. Magnetic susceptibility and isothermal magnetization analysis reveal a weak antiferromagnetic interaction among the $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ spins, characterized by a small Curie-Weiss temperature ($\theta_{\text{CW}}^{\text{LT}}\simeq-0.26$ K) or a reduced exchange coupling ($J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 0.18$ K). The $^{51}$V NMR spectra and spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) show no evidence of magnetic long-range-order down to 1.6 K but reflect strong influence of CEF excitations in the intermediate temperatures. At low temperatures, $1/T_1(T)$ shows pronounced frequency dependence and $1/T_1$ vs field in different temperatures follows the scaling behaviour, highlighting the role of paramagnetic fluctuations. The CEF calculations using the point charge approximation divulge a large energy gap ($\sim 18.61$ meV) between the lowest and second lowest energy doublets, further establishing Kramers' doublet as the ground state. Our calculations also reproduce the experimental magnetization and specific heat data and indicate an in-plane magnetic anisotropy. These findings position Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$ as an ideal and disorder-free candidate to explore intrinsic quantum fluctuations and possible quantum spin-liquid physics in a Yb$^{3+}$-based triangular lattice antiferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Tunability of Robust Exciton-Trion Polaritons in Atomically Thin WS2 Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herein, we present an experimental demonstration of the robust exciton-trion polaritons (ETPs) by measuring and simulating the resonance reflectance spectra of various configurational WS2 monolayers with different dielectric screenings. Moreover, the oscillator strength and decoherent behavior of such hybrid ETPs can be tuned via utilizing dielectric screening effect. The effect is attributed to the regulation of the Coulomb coupling between excitons and trions by changing the surrounding dielectric constant. The demonstration and tunability of the robust ETPs offers a novel pathway for researching novel phases of quantum matter in a quantum many-body physics regime.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Two-Dimensional Materials Research via a Universal Interatomic Potential and Large Language Model Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate interatomic potentials (IAPs) are essential for modeling the potential energy surfaces (PES) that govern atomic interactions in materials. However, most existing IAPs are developed for bulk materials and struggle to accurately and efficiently capture the diverse chemical environment of two-dimensional (2D) materials. This limitation poses a significant barrier to the large-scale design and simulation of emerging 2D systems. To address this challenge, we present a universal interatomic potential tailored for 2D materials. Our model is trained on a dataset comprising 327,062 structure-energy-force-stress mappings derived from 20,114 2D materials, spanning 89 chemical elements. The results show high predictive accuracy, with mean absolute errors of 6 meV/atom for energies, 80 meV/\AA for atomic forces, and 0.067 GPa for stress tensors. It demonstrates broad applicability across a range of atomistic tasks, including structural relaxation, lattice dynamics, molecular dynamics, material discovery, and so on. To further enhance usability and accessibility, we introduce an intelligent agent powered by a large language model (LLM), enabling natural language interaction for 2D materials property simulations. Our work provides not only a precise and universal IAP for 2D systems, but also an intelligent, user-friendly platform that enables high-throughput screening, property prediction, and theoretical exploration, thereby accelerating advances in 2D materials research.</description>

      <title>All-optical control of antiferromagnetic domains via an inverse optical magnetoelectric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets are a promising platform for next-generation spintronics due to their ultrafast spin dynamics and robustness to external fields. All-optical control of antiferromagnetic order is essential to fully exploit their potential in energy-efficient and high-speed spintronic and memory applications. However, optical writing of antiferromagnetic domains remains a fundamental challenge, as conventional magneto-optical techniques rely on net magnetization, which is absent in antiferromagnets. In certain multiferroic antiferromagnets, the magnetic toroidal moment provides an additional degree of freedom through its inherent magnetoelectric coupling. This coupling at higher frequencies results in the optical magnetoelectric effect (OME), which manifests as a directional asymmetry in light propagation and enables optical probing of antiferromagnetic states. Here, we demonstrate all-optical writing of antiferromagnetic domains using the inverse optical magnetoelectric effect (IOME) in ferrotoroidic LiNiPO4. The writing process is nonvolatile, non-thermal, and deterministic, driven solely by reversing the light propagation direction. This directional control arises from a strong coupling between the photon linear momentum and the magnetic toroidal moment, enabling the repeatable switching between time-reversed domains with arbitrary light polarization. Our findings establish IOME as a distinct mechanism for manipulating antiferromagnetic order, opening a new paradigm in opto-magnetism driven by photon momentum.</description>

      <title>Nickel Doping Unlocks Ambient-condition Photostability in Individual Cesium Lead Bromide Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing efficient single-photon sources is fundamental to advancing photonic quantum technologies. In particular, achieving scalable, cost-effective, stable, high-rate, and high-purity single-photon emission at ambient conditions is paramount for free-space quantum communication. However, fulfilling all the requirements simultaneously under ambient conditions has remained a significant challenge. Here, the scalable, cost-effective ambient condition synthesis of nickel doped (Ni doped) CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (NPQDs) is presented using a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) method. The resulting individual NPQDs demonstrate remarkable photostability, sustaining their performance for over 10 minutes under ambient conditions with environment humidity of ~55%, and exhibit exceptional single-photon purity (&gt;99%) with a narrow emission linewidth (~70 meV). The remarkable photostability could be attributed to the spatial localization of exciton by Ni atoms on the surface of the nanocrystal, reducing its interaction with the environment. Our results demonstrated that NPQDs with outstanding combinations of quantum emitting properties can be both synthesized and operated at ambient conditions. These findings mark a significant step toward scalable, cost-effective quantum light sources for real-world applications, paving the way for robust quantum communication systems and devices.</description>

      <title>Extreme-Band-Gap Semiconductors with Shallow Dopants and Mobile Carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional distinction between semiconductors and insulators is often based on the magnitude of the band gap, with materials exhibiting gaps wider than 3 eV typically classified as insulators. However, the emergence of ultra-wide-band-gap (UWBG) semiconductors such as AlGaN, diamond, BN, and Ga2O3 challenges this paradigm for materials classification and raises fundamental questions about the upper bound of band gaps compatible with semiconducting behavior. Here we develop a computational-discovery strategy to identify semiconductors with band gaps exceeding that of AlN (6.2 eV), while retaining essential semiconducting properties such as shallow dopants and mobile charge carriers. We discover that materials composed of light elements in densely packed crystal structures exhibit wide band gaps and light carrier effective masses that enable shallow dopants, high mobility, and weak polaron binding. By applying the hydrogenic Bohr model and first-principles defect calculations - validated against available experimental data - to screen for materials with shallow dopants, we identify dopable compounds with gaps as wide as 9.5 eV that nonetheless host mobile charge carriers. Our findings demonstrate that semiconducting behavior persists even at extreme band gaps, far beyond conventional upper bounds traditionally associated with semiconductor materials.</description>

      <title>High heating rate effects in sintering: A phase-field study of La-doped alumina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years high heating rate sintering methods have become a hot topic for reasons of energy efficiency and microstructural optimization. This paper aims to shed light on the microstructural evolution these methods induce by means of phase-field modeling and simulations. A particle-based temperature model suited for the sintering process is developed and coupled with a multiphysics phase-field solver. It is shown that the coupled model exhibits many characteristics typical of high heating rate sintering. Furthermore, the occurrence of temperature and microstructural inhomogeneity as well as their interplay is simulatively explored.</description>

      <title>Zeeman-type spin splittings in strained d-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, altermagnetic materials have become rather attractive because such materials showcase combined advantages of ferromagnets (e.g., spin current) and antiferromagnets (e.g., low stray field and ultrafast spin dynamics). Symmetry arguments imply that d-wave altermagnets may host strain-induced nonrelativistic Zeeman-type spin splittings (ZSSs), but a theoretical, numerical, and experimental justification remains lacking. In the present work, we work with collinear spin point groups (SPGs) and use symmetry analysis to identify 15 SPGs that host strain-induced nonrelativistic ZSSs. These 15 SPGs coincide with the cases associated with d-wave altermagnetic spin splittings reported in literature. We further corroborate our analysis by first-principles numerical simulations, which indicate that a shear strain of 2% creates sizable nonrelativistic ZSSs of up to 177, 100, and 102 meV in CoF2, LiFe2F6 and La2O3Mn2Se2 d-wave altermagnetic semiconductors, respectively. Our work suggests an alternative route toward creating spin current in altermagnets, which may be used to design altermagnetic-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Structure-Informed Learning of Flat Band 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat electronic bands enhance electron-electron interactions and give rise to correlated states such as unconventional superconductivity or fractional topological phases. However, most current efforts towards flat-band materials discovery rely on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and manual band structures inspection, restraining their applicability to vast unexplored material spaces. While data-driven methods offer a scalable alternative, most existing models either depend on band structure inputs or focus on scalar properties like bandgap, which fail to capture flat-band characteristics. Here, we report a structure-informed framework for the discovery of previously unrecognized flat-band two-dimensional (2D) materials, which combines a data-driven flatness score capturing both band dispersion and density-of-states characteristics with multi-modal learning from atomic structure inputs. The framework successfully identified multiple flat-band candidates, with DFT validation of kagome-based systems confirming both band flatness and topological character. Our results show that the flatness score provides a physically meaningful signal for identifying flat bands from atomic geometry. The framework uncovers multiple new candidates with topologically nontrivial flat bands from unlabeled data, with consistent model performance across structurally diverse materials. By eliminating the need for precomputed electronic structures, our method enables large-scale screening of flat-band materials and expands the search space for discovering strongly correlated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Si Intercalation Beneath Epitaxial Graphene: Modulating Mott States at the SiC(0001) Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intercalation has proven to be a powerful tool for tailoring the electronic properties of freestanding graphene layers as well as for stabilizing the intercalated material in a two-dimensional configuration. This work examines Si intercalation of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) using three preparation methods. Dangling bond states at the interface were found to undergo a Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition as a result of a significant on-site repulsion. Comparing this heterostructure consisting of graphene and a Mott insulator with a similar system without graphene, reveals the screening ability of graphene's conduction electrons on the on-site repulsion. The system presented here can serve as a template for further research on Mott insulators with variable band gap.</description>

      <title>Roles of Non-switchable Domains and Internal Bias in Electrocaloric and Pyroelectric effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state cooling and energy harvesting via pyroelectric effect (PEE) and electrocaloric effect (ECE) in ferroelectric thin films could be enhanced beyond their intrinsic ferroelectric response by exploiting the recently observed direction-dependent enhancement of the PEE; however, its microscopic origin remains unknown. Herein, we report direct hysteresis measurements of pyrocurrent ($I_{\rm p}$) and ECE-induced temperature change versus bias voltage in 1-$\mu$m-thick Pb(Zr$_{0.65}$Ti$_{0.35}$)O$_3$ capacitors. Both hysteresis loops exhibit pronounced asymmetries along the voltage and response axes. By superimposing direct current voltage offsets, we isolate a residual $I_{\rm p}$-axis shift, revealing a contribution of non-switchable ferroelectric polarization. This non-switchable polarization can be converted into switchable polarization via poling with bipolar triangular pulses, confirming the governing role of defect-induced domain pinning. After 100 pulses, time-dependent aging was observed for pyroelectric and electrocaloric responses, with the switchable contribution markedly decaying and the non-switchable component remaining nearly constant, indicating partial repinning. The change in voltage-axis shift agrees well with the ratio of non-switchable to switchable polarization, demonstrating that voltage shift also arises from pinned domains. These insights clarify the critical role of non-switchable polarization in the PEE and ECE performance, suggesting strategies to optimize the directional response in ferroelectric devices through controlled poling and defect engineering.</description>

      <title>Beyond Scaling: Chemical Intuition as Emergent Ability of Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) have successfully demonstrated scaling behavior, i.e. the power-law improvement in training performance, however the emergence of novel capabilities at scale remains unexplored. We have developed Edge-wise Emergent Decomposition (E3D) framework to investigate how an MLIP develops the ability to derive physically meaningful local representations of chemical bonds without explicit supervision. Employing an E(3)-equivariant network (Allegro) trained on molecular data (SPICE~2), we found that the trained MLIP spontaneously learned representations of bond dissociation energy (BDE) by decomposing the global potential energy landscape. The learned BDE values quantitatively agree with literature and its scalability are found to be robust across diverse training datasets, suggesting the presence of underlying representation that captures chemical reactions faithfully beyond given training information. Our E3D analysis utilizing Shannon's entropy reveals a close interplay between the decomposability of potential energy learning, scalability of learning, and emergent chemical reactivity, thus providing novel insights of scaling limitations and pathways toward more physically interpretable and predictive simulations.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hall Effect Enables Field-Free Magnetization Reversal in Ferrimagnets without Additional Conversion Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin Hall effect (SHE) enables efficient electrical manipulation of magnetization through the spin Hall current \left(\mathbit{J}_{\mathbit{SHE}}\right), advancing energy-efficient spintronics. In parallel, the orbital Hall effect (OHE) offers an alternative pathway to SHE for converting charge current into an angular momentum flow. In this study, we demonstrate field-free current-induced perpendicular ferrimagnetic deterministic switching within a Mo/CoGd device without an additional orbital-to-spin conversion layer. This is achieved by harnessing localized orbital Hall currents \left(\mathbit{J}_{\mathbit{OHE}}\right) generated in the Mo layer. The in-plane symmetry breaking at the Mo/CoGd surface-interface layer, validated by a pronounced planar Hall effect, gives rise to a substantial unconventional z-polarized damping-like torque. The CoGd serves a dual role: not only as a converter that transforms the significant \mathbit{J}_{\mathbit{OHE}} into \mathbit{J}_{\mathbit{SHE}} but also as a ferrimagnetic self-switching mechanism. This dual functionality enables highly efficient field-free current-induced magnetization switching with a critical current density as low as \mathbf{2}.\mathbf{51}\ \times{\mathbf{10}}^\mathbf{6} A cm-2. Our work highlights the potential of orbital Hall currents for energy-efficient magnetization switching, making a notable contribution to the burgeoning field of orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Interacting Dirac magnons in honeycomb ferromagnets CrBr$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of magnon-magnon interactions in the two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet CrBr$_3$ focusing on its honeycomb lattice structure. Motivated by earlier theoretical predictions of temperature-induced spectral shifts and van Hove singularities in the magnon dispersion~\cite{PhysRevX.8.011010}, we go beyond the commonly used thermal magnon approximation by applying second-order perturbation theory in a fully numerical framework. Our analysis uncovers significant deviations from previous analysis: in particular, the predicted singularities are absent, consistent with recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements~\cite{PhysRevLett.129.127201}. Moreover, we find that the temperature dependence of the renormalized magnon spectrum exhibits a distinct $T^3$ behavior for the optical magnon branch, while retaining $T^2$ behavior for the acoustic or down magnon band. This feature sheds new light on the collective dynamics of Dirac magnons and their interactions. We further compare the honeycomb case with a triangular Bravais lattice, relevant for ferromagnetic monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, and show that both systems lack singular features while displaying quite distinct thermal trends.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of ferroelectric and topological materials offers a promising avenue for advancing the development of quantum material devices. In this work, we explore the strong coupling between topological states and ferroelectricity in the heterostructure formed by interfacing MnBi2Te4 (MBT) thin films and monolayer In2Te3. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the polarization direction in In2Te3 can strongly alter electronic band structures in the MBT/In2Te3 heterostructure, and even induces a topological phase transition between quantum anomalous Hall (C = 1) and trivial (C = 0) insulating states, originating from the change of band order induced by the switch of out-of-plane polarization. Our work highlights the promising potential of ferroelectric-topological heterostructures in aiding the development of reconfigurable quantum devices, and creating new possibilities for progress in advanced microelectronic and spintronic systems</description>

      <title>$d$-Wave Flat Fermi Surface in Altermagnets Enables Maximum Charge-to-Spin Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets combine antiferromagnetic order with ferromagnet-like spin splitting, a duality that unlocks ultrafast spin-dependent responses. This unique property creates unprecedented opportunities for spin-current generation, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of conventional spin-transfer and spin-orbit torque approaches in magnetic memory technologies. Here, we establish a fundamental relationship between Fermi surface geometry and time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) spin currents in altermagnets through combined model analysis and first-principles calculations. We demonstrate that a $d$-wave altermagnet with a flat Fermi surface can achieve a theoretical upper limit of charge-to-spin conversion efficiency (CSE) of 100%. This mechanism is realized in the newly discovered room-temperature altermagnetic metal KV$_2$O$_2$Se, which exhibits a CSE of $\sim$78% at the charge neutrality point, nearly double that of RuO$_2$, setting a new record for $\mathcal{T}$-odd CSE. Under electron doping, this efficiency further increases to $\sim$98%, approaching the theoretical limit. Our work advances the fundamental understanding of $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin currents via Fermi surface geometry engineering and provides key insights for developing next-generation altermagnet-based memory devices.</description>

Abstract: The 6H-perovskite Ba3RRu2O9 (R = rare-earth), composed of Ru2O9 dimers connected through RO6 octahedra, exhibits an intriguing variety of magnetic ground states, ranging from non-magnetic to ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, depending on the specific R ion. In this study, we investigate the compound Ba3TbRu2O9 using magnetic susceptibility measurements and time-of-flight neutron diffraction experiments. Our combined bulk and microscopic analyses reveal that the Tb4+ (4f7) electronic configuration results in an s-like state with an orbital moment L=0 and spin-only value of S=7/2, and Ru4+ exhibits a spin-only value of S=1 despite the presence of strong spin-lattice coupling in this compound, representing a sharp contrast to other reported members of this family. A cooperative 4d-4f spin ordering is observed below the Neel temperature (around 9.5 K), indicating strong Ru(4d)=Tb(4f) correlations in the system. The Tb-moments order antiferromagnetically in the bc-plane, whereas the Ru-moments are aligned antiferromagnetically along the b-axis. Furthermore, a collinear antiferromagnetic arrangement of spins is observed within the Ru2O9 dimers throughout the structure, unlike other reported members of this series (e.g., Ho and Nd).</description>

      <title>Excitonic Properties and Optical Signatures in Quasi-1D Metal-Halide Perovskites with Tunable Octahedral Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing the dimensionality of metal-halide perovskites enhances quantum and dielectric confinement, enabling tunable excitonic properties. In one dimension, the arrangement of metal-halide octahedra in chains with corner-, edge-, or face-sharing connectivity allows for additional structural flexibility. This not only expands material design possibilities but also reflects quasi-one-dimensional motifs that arise during perovskite formation but are poorly understood. Using first-principles many-body perturbation theory within the $GW$ and Bethe-Salpeter Equation framework, we provide a comprehensive picture of how one-dimensional confinement, octahedral connectivity and dielectric screening affect optical absorption and exciton photophysics in these materials. Our calculations reveal that increasing octahedral connectivity leads to increased exciton binding and complex, anisotropic optical signatures. However, in experimental compounds, pronounced dielectric screening effects can shift exciton binding energies by several hundred meV, altering these trends. These findings offer insights and design principles for excitonic properties, and aid the interpretation of optical experiments on one-dimensional perovskites.</description>

      <title>Experiment and k$\cdot$p analysis of the luminescence from modulation-doped CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum wells at magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spite of a large quantity of papers devoted to the mangetoluminescence from CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te, quantum wells there have been no attempts to analyze it on the basis of the band-structure calculations. This has been proposed in the present paper. Samples containing one or ten CdTe quantum wells with Cd$_{0.7}$Mg$_{0.3}$Te barriers are grown by a molecular beam epitaxy on a semi-insulating GaAs substrate. Each well is modulation-doped with iodine donors which leads to the creation of a two-dimensional electron gas in the wells. Polarization-resolved ($\sigma^+/\sigma^-$) photoluminescence spectra are measured at liquid helium temperatures and magnetic fields up to 9 T. The results are interpreted on the basis of calculations of the energy of Landau levels in the conduction and valence bands. In the latter case, we use the Luttinger Hamiltonian while the conduction band is described within a three-level k$\cdot$p model. Both models, originally formulated for bulk materials, are adapted for two-dimensional structures. We have found that the majority of all observed transitions is well reproducede by this theory. However, some strong transitions are not which allows us to propose an enlarged scheme of selection rules of the photoluminescence transitions resulting from mixing of the conduction and valence bands. We observe transitions involving Landau levels in the valence band with the index up to 7. To understand the origin of occupation with photoexcited holes of these levels, lying deep in the valence band, we carry out time-resolved measurements which show that the photoexcited barrier is a source of long-lived holes tunneling into the quantum wells. Calculations of the conduction band electron effective g-factor show its strong variation with the electron's energy and the external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Strain Transfer and Optoelectronic Performance in MoS2 Devices via Formvar Encapsulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the influence of polyvinyl formal (PVFM), commonly known as Formvar, in comparison to polycarbonate (PC) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), as encapsulation materials on the strain performance of MoS2 monolayer and bilayer flakes on flexible polypropylene (PP) substrates. Notably, optical differential reflectance measurements reveal that PVFM and PMMA encapsulation significantly enhances the mechanical and thermal strain gauge factors by approximately 2-fold (up to ~-50 meV/%) and 6-fold (up to ~-1.5 meV/{\deg}C), respectively, while PC shows a slightly lower enhancement. Moreover, all three polymers increase the maximum achievable strain from approximately 1.4% to 2.3%. Furthermore, devices fabricated on PP substrates exhibit improved optoelectronic performance when encapsulated with PVFM, including increased and faster photocurrent response and extended device lifetime.</description>

      <title>Predicting aqueous and electrochemical stability of 2D materials from extended Pourbaix analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge for computational discovery of electrocatalytic materials is the reliable prediction of thermodynamic stability in aqueous environment and under different electrochemical conditions. In this work, we first evaluate the electrochemical stability of more than 3000 two-dimensional (2D) materials using conventional Pourbaix diagrams (CPDs). Due to the complete neglect of thermodynamic barriers along the (often complex) reaction pathways, the vast majority of the materials are predicted to be unstable even though some are known to be stable in practice. We then introduce an analysis based on the surface Pourbaix diagram (SPD) including 'early intermediate states' that represent the first steps of the key surface passivation and dissolution reactions. The SPD framework is applied to the 2D materials MoS$_2$, phosphorene, and the MXene Ti$_2$C, all of which are predicted to be unstable by the CPD. For MoS$_2$, our approach reproduces the experimental pH-U stability window as well as the experimental desulphurization potential. For phosphorene and Ti2$_C$, the SPD approach is used to investigate the spontaneous degradation mechanism and the potential-dependent surface termination, respectively, again yielding good agreement with experiments. The SPD-based stability analysis emerges as a versatile and quantitative method for prediction of stability and investigation of surface structures in electrochemical environments.</description>

      <title>Common origin of the photoplastic and electroplastic effect in ZnS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocation motion -- the atomic-scale mechanism of crystal plasticity -- governs the strength and ductility of materials. In functional materials, external stimuli beyond mechanical stress can also affect dislocation glide. In the wide band gap semiconductor ZnS, optical illumination suppresses plasticity, whereas electric fields can enhance dislocation motion. Here, we show that the common underlying mechanism for these phenomena is the charged dislocations that respond to the changes in carrier concentration. Our prior theoretical work showed that locally charged dislocations in ZnS trap excess carriers, triggering core reconstructions that modify their mobility, with the positively charged Zn-rich core dislocations showing the most drastic change. Here, we validate this prediction experimentally by showing that either optical excitation or electronic doping selectively inhibits the glide of Zn-rich dislocations in epitaxially grown ZnS. First, imaging individual interface misfit dislocations under different optical excitation conditions shows that Zn-core glide is strongly reduced as optical power is increased, while the S-core dislocations show negligible sensitivity to light, marking the first, single dislocation imaging of the photoplastic effect. Next, we show that a similar behavior is observed with direct electron (n-type) doping of ZnS epitaxial layers grown beyond the critical thickness. As the n-type dopant density is increased, the resulting Zn-core dislocation density is reduced by more than one order of magnitude, while the S-core density remains essentially unchanged, causing a sign reversal of the strain-anisotropy with n-type doping. These results demonstrate a common origin for the opto-electronic sensitivity of dislocations in ZnS and provide a pathway for the engineering of dislocation content in compound semiconductors.</description>

      <title>First-principles characterization of native defects and oxygen impurities in GaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation of native point defects and oxygen impurities in gallium arsenide (GaAs) using hybrid density-functional calculations. Defects are characterized by their structural, electronic, and optical properties. Dominant native defects are Ga antisites (Ga$_{\rm As}$), As antisites (As$_{\rm Ga}$), and/or Ga vacancies ($V_{\rm Ga}$) in which As$_{\rm Ga}$ and $V_{\rm Ga}$ are charge-compensating defects under As-rich conditions. On the basis of the calculated defect transition levels, the isolated As$_{\rm Ga}$ may be identified with the EL2 center reported in experiments. The defect, however, has a negligible nonradiative electron capture cross section and thus cannot be the "main electron trap" as commonly believed. We find that GaAs can have multiple O-related defect centers when prepared under As-rich conditions. The quasi-substitutional O impurity (O$_{\rm As}$) and its complex with two As$_{\rm Ga}$ defects (O$_{\rm As}$-2As$_{\rm Ga}$) have a metastable and paramagnetic middle (neutral) charge state. These two defects have large nonradiative electron capture cross sections and can be effective recombination centers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogeneous electron and nuclear gases are transformed to a localized trial density in absolute coordinates of the multi-component hamiltonian to determine the stability of forming bound states. Regions of stability were found both at the high density and low density regimes, where electron-nuclear correlations could play a critical role in the intermediate density regime. The use of Galilean coordinates is motivated for its use in density functional theory to develop kinetic and potential density functionals, from which suitable coordinate transformations to capture electron-nuclear correlations are applied.</description>

      <title>Unraveled origin of the multi-directional and super wide optical-response found on metal/n-Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical responses for UV to NIR and muti-directional photo current have been found on Au (metal) on n-Si device. The unique phenomena have been unresolved since the first sample fabricated in 2007. The self organized sub-micron metal with various crystal faces was supposed to activate as an optical wave guide into Si surface. This, however, is insufficient to explain the unique features above. Thus, for more deep analysis, returning to consider the Si-band structure, indirect/direct transitions of inter conduction bands: X-W, X-K and {\Gamma}-L in the 1st Brillouin Zone/Van Hove singularity at L point, synchronizing with scattering, successfully give these characteristics a reasonable explanation. The calculation of the quantum efficiency between X-W and X-K agreed with those sensitivity for visible region (1.1 to 2.0 eV), the doping process well simulates it for NIR (0.6 to 1.0 eV). Doping electrons (~10^18/cm3) are filled up the zero-gap at around X of a reciprocal lattice point. This is why a lower limit of 0.6 eV was arisen in the sensitivity measurement. When the carrier scattering model was applied to the inter band (X-W, X-K and {\Gamma}-L) transitions, the reasonable interpretation was obtained for the directional dependence of photo-currents with UV (3.4 eV) and Visible (3.1 and 1.9 eV) excitation. Band to band scatterings assist to extend the available optical range and increase variety of directional responses. Utilizing this principle for some indirect transition semiconductors, it will be able to open the new frontier in photo-conversion system, where it will be released from those band gaps and directivity limitations.</description>

      <title>ChemGraph: An Agentic Framework for Computational Chemistry Workflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science, accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models (LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows, while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o. Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal lithography has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional nanofabrication techniques, offering the ability to create nanoscale patterns in a cost-effective and scalable manner. However, it has been so far limited by defects such as empty areas or multilayered regions, hindering its application. We introduce a novel "ice-assisted transfer" technique that combines rubbing-based particle assembly on elastomer substrates with ice-mediated transfer to achieve defect-free, high-quality polycrystalline particle monolayers. This approach eliminates foreign material contamination and enables precise control of particle arrangement and density. By optimizing process parameters, including surfactant concentration and water film thickness, we minimized defects and demonstrated the versatility of this method in fabricating functional nanoscale structures. We highlighted the benefits of this process through two applications: (1) antireflective "moth-eye" coatings, which achieved near-zero reflection in the mid-infrared spectrum due to improved particle monolayer quality; and (2) nanostructured surfaces for ligand-free T-cell activation, whose topography enhanced cell activation, showcasing potential for immunotherapy applications. The process achieves rapid, cost-efficient patterning without requiring specialized equipment, making it suitable for diverse fields requiring scalable nanostructuring. This work represents a significant advancement in colloidal lithography, addressing critical challenges and unlocking its potential for practical applications in optics, biotechnology, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Standardizing Force Reconstruction in Dynamic Atomic Force Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) enables high-resolution imaging and quantitative force measurement, which is critical for understanding nanoscale mechanical, chemical, and biological interactions. In dynamic AFM modes, however, interaction forces are not directly measured; they must be mathematically reconstructed from observables such as amplitude, phase, or frequency shift. Many reconstruction techniques have been proposed over the last two decades, but they rely on different assumptions and have been applied inconsistently, limiting reproducibility and cross-study comparison. Here, we systematically evaluate major force reconstruction methods in both frequency- and amplitude-modulation AFM, detailing their theoretical foundations, performance regimes, and sources of error. To support benchmarking and reproducibility, we introduce an open-source software package that unifies all widely used methods, enabling side-by-side comparisons across different formulations. This work represents a critical step toward achieving consistent and interpretable AFM force spectroscopy, thereby supporting the more reliable application of AFM in fields ranging from materials science to biophysics.</description>

      <title>Lithography defined semiconductor moires with anomalous in-gap quantum Hall states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum materials and phenomena have attracted great interest for their potential applications in next-generation microelectronics and quantum-information technologies. In one especially interesting class of quantum materials, moire superlattices (MSL) formed by twisted bilayers of 2D materials, a wide range of novel phenomena are observed. However, there exist daunting challenges such as reproducibility and scalability of utilizing 2D MSLs for microelectronics and quantum technologies due to their exfoliate-tear-stack method. Here, we propose lithography defined semiconductor moires superlattices, in which three fundamental parameters, electron-electron interaction, spin-orbit coupling, and band topology, are designable. We experimentally investigate quantum transport properties in a moire specimen made in an InAs quantum well. Strong anomalous in-gap states are observed within the same integer quantum Hall state. Our work opens up new horizons for studying 2D quantum-materials phenomena in semiconductors featuring superior industry-level quality and state-of-the-art technologies, and they may potentially enable new quantum information and microelectronics technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we present our recent works on materials whose common point is the presence of electronic bands of very low dispersion, called "flat bands", which are always the signature of an electronic confinement. A first part is devoted to the cases where this confinement is due to the long-range geometry of the defect-free structure. We have thus studied periodic approximant structures of quasiperiodic Penrose and octagonal tilings, and twisted bilayers of graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) whose rotation angle between the two layers assumes a special value, called "magic angle". In these materials, the flat bands correspond to electronic states distributed over a very large number of atoms (several hundreds or even thousands of atoms) and are very sensitive to small structural distortions such as "heterostrain". Their electronic transport properties cannot be described by usual Bloch-Boltzmann theories, because the interband terms of the velocity operator dominate the intraband terms as far as quantum diffusion is concerned. In twisted bilayer graphene, flat bands can induce a magnetic state and other electron-electron correlation effects. The second part focuses on 2D nanomaterials in the presence of local point defects that cause resonant electronic states (vacancies, adsorbed atoms or molecules). We present studies on monolayer graphene, twisted or Bernal bilayer graphene, carbon nanotubes, monolayer and multilayer black phosphorene, and monolayer TMDs. A recent result is the discovery that the selective functionalization of a Bernal bilayer graphene sublattice leads to a metallic or insulating behavior depending on the functionalized sublattice type. This result, which seems to be confirmed by very recent experimental measurements, suggests that functionalization can be a key parameter to control the electronic properties of two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Half-Metallicity and Giant Wiedemann-Franz Violation in Monolayer NiI$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strain engineering provides a powerful pathway to manipulate quantum transport in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate that biaxial strain induces a semiconductor-to-half-metal transition in monolayer NiI$_2$, triggered by the selective closure of its spin-down band gap while maintaining a robust ferromagnetic ground state. This transition is accompanied by a dramatic and non-monotonic violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, with the Lorenz number exceeding seven times the Sommerfeld limit ($L/L_0 \approx 7.17$). The anomaly arises from the strain-sensitive hybridization between Ni-$d$ and I-$p$ orbitals, leading to a pronounced decoupling between charge and heat transport. These findings establish monolayer NiI$_2$ as a tunable platform for spin-caloritronic functionalities and a model system for exploring non-Fermi-liquid behavior in low dimensions, thereby opening avenues for energy-efficient quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Stress-driven photo-reconfiguration of surface microstructures with vectorial light fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pattern formation driven by mechanical stress plays a fundamental role in shaping structural organization in both natural and human-made systems. However, achieving localized and programmable control of individual microstructures remains a challenge. Here, we present a vectorial field-guided lithography as a novel and versatile method for the photo-reconfiguration of photosensitive azopolymer microstructures. Building on the Viscoplastic PhotoAlignment model, recently proposed to describe the stress-driven response of azomaterials, we reveal structured polarization fields that are directly mapped into programmable surface architectures through stress-driven deformation. Using a digital polarization rotator implemented via a spatial light modulator, we prove the single-step fabrication of anisotropic, bent, and chiral microstructures from a single pre-patterned geometry, highlighting the power of polarization vector fields as active design parameters. Experimentally, we validate the theoretical model and demonstrate its predictive strength even under fully structured light, establishing for the first time a comprehensive theoretical framework capable of quantitively designing target morphologies. Our work demonstrates that the full vectorial nature of light, and not just its intensity, can dictate the mechanical reshaping of functional polymer surfaces, providing a new platform for the programmable design of complex micro-architectures with applications in photonics, microfluidics, and biology.</description>

      <title>An Agentic Framework for Autonomous Metamaterial Modeling and Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent significant advances in integrating multiple Large Language Model (LLM) systems have enabled Agentic Frameworks capable of performing complex tasks autonomously, including novel scientific research. We develop and demonstrate such a framework specifically for the inverse design of photonic metamaterials. When queried with a desired optical spectrum, the Agent autonomously proposes and develops a forward deep learning model, accesses external tools via APIs for tasks like simulation and optimization, utilizes memory, and generates a final design via a deep inverse method. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated in its ability to automate, reason, plan, and adapt. Notably, the Agentic Framework possesses internal reflection and decision flexibility, permitting highly varied and potentially novel outputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate spin pumping driven by a strongly coupled magnon-photon system using a ferromagnet-coplanar superconducting resonator hybrid system at 1.4 K. Electrical readout via the inverse spin-Hall effect reveals characteristic coupling features, including mode splitting and linewidth broadening, demonstrating the electrical detection of strongly coupled microwave photons and magnons. The magnon-photon coupling strength obtained by combined spin pumping and inverse spin-Hall effect measurements is compared to microwave transmission experiments. Furthermore, microwave power-dependent measurements reveal a decrease in the coupling strength with increasing microwave power alongside the onset of nonlinearities of the superconducting resonator above a critical microwave power threshold.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Fingerprint of Controlled Structural Disorder in Artificial Spin Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the emergence of complexity in disordered interacting systems, central to fields like spin glass physics, remains challenging due to difficulties in systematic experimental tuning. We introduce a tunable artificial spin lattice platform to directly probe the connection between controlled structural disorder and collective spin-wave dynamics. By precisely varying positional and rotational randomness in Ni81Fe19 nanobar arrays from periodic to random, we map the evolution from discrete spectral modes to a complex, dense manifold. Crucially, we establish a quantitative correlation between information-theoretic measures of static disorder and the dynamic spectral complexity derived from the GHz spin-wave response. This correlation provides a dynamic fingerprint of an increasingly complex energy landscape resulting from tuned disorder. Furthermore, thermal probe via thermal Brillouin light scattering reveal significantly richer microstates diversity in disordered states than driven probe using broadband ferromagnetic resonance. Our work presents a unique experimental testbed for studying how the ingredients of glassy physics manifest in high-frequency dynamics, offering quantitative insights into the onset of complexity in interacting nanomagnet systems.</description>

      <title>Dimensionless Hierarchical Topological Phononic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators exhibit unique boundary states that are protected by the topology of the bulk bands, a phenomenon that has now been extended to classical systems such as phononics and mechanics. Typically, nontrivial topology in an $n$-dimensional bulk leads to the emergence of $(n-1)$-dimensional topologically protected boundary states. However, these states can often be gapped out by breaking the symmetry that protects them, resulting in the possible creation of new in-gap higher-order topological modes. A notable example of this is the higher-order topological insulator (HOTI), where gapping out surface states leads to the formation of lower-dimensional topological modes, such as hinge or corner states. This process reduces the spatial dimensionality of the protected modes from $(n-1)$ to $(n-2)$ or even lower. In this work, we propose an alternative method to achieve higher-order topological modes using a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Instead of relying on dimensional reduction, we manipulate the positions of domain walls to gap out the originally topologically protected domain-wall states, thereby inducing new higher-order topological states. These new higher-order topological states can be characterized using a generalized winding number calculation. This approach allows for the realization of multiple (and even infinite) topological orders within simple 1D lattices while maintaining the principle of bulk-boundary correspondence. Our study reveals a new mechanism that enriches topological hierarchies beyond conventional classifications. Such a mechanism could also be extended to higher dimensions, potentially creating intricate networks of topological states and advancing our control over wave phenomena.</description>

      <title>FeTaX2: A ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose that the van der Waals layered ternary transition metal chalcogenide FeTaX$_2$ (X = S, Se, Te) is a new family of ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulators with sizable bulk gap and Chern number C = -2. The magnetic ordering originates predominantly from the Fe atoms, where strong ferromagnetic exchange interactions between them induce magnetic moments on the Ta sites, yielding a collinear ferrimagnetic ground state. The large topological gap arises from the deep sd-type band inversion between spin-down Ta d$_{z^2}$ and d$_{xy}$ orbitals near the Fermi level-a mechanism unique to d-orbital systems. Remarkably, the Curie temperature of monolayer FeTaX$_2$ is predicted to significantly exceed that of monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Furthermore, both the Curie temperature and topological gap scale positively with the spin orbit coupling strength of the $d$ electrons, suggesting a common physical origin. These findings, if realized experimentally, could open new avenues for the research and application of topological quantum physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of contemporary materials testing, the demand for scalability, adaptability, parallelism, and speed has surged due to the proliferation of diverse materials and testing standards. Traditional controller-based systems often fall short in meeting these requirements, resulting in adaptability and processing speed limitations. Conversely, FPGA-based controllers present a multifaceted, high-performance solution. Key advantages of FPGA-based controllers in materials testing encompass reconfiguration capabilities for cost-effective adaptation to evolving materials and standards. FPGAs also enable the integration of parallel control and data acquisition circuits, vital for multichannel test equipment demanding simultaneous, independent operation of multiple control channels.</description>

      <title>Electrical Conductivity of Superionic Hydrous SiO2 and the Origin of Lower-mantle High Conductivity Anomalies Beneath Subduction Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical conductivity (EC) is one of the important physical properties of minerals and rocks that can be used to characterize the composition and structure of the deep interior of the Earth.Theoretical studies have predicted that the CaCl2-type hydrous Al-bearing SiO2 phase, present in subducted crustal materials, becomes superionic-meaning that protons are no longer bonded to a specific oxygen atom but instead become mobile within the SiO2 lattice-under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions corresponding to the lower mantle. The enhancement of the EC upon such superionic transition has not been experimentally verified yet. Here, we measured the EC of Al-bearing SiO2 containing 1750 ppm H2O at pressures up to 82 GPa and temperatures up to 2610 K by employing a recently developed technique designed for measuring transparent materials. Results demonstrate a sudden increase in EC to approximately 10 S/m at temperatures of 1100-2200 K, depending on pressure, which is several to ten times higher than that of the surrounding shallow to middle part of the lower mantle, which is attributed to a transition to the superionic state. If hydrous SiO2 is substantially weaker than other coexisting phases and thus forms an interconnected film in subducted MORB crust, the EC of the bulk MORB materials is significantly enhanced by superionic SiO2 in the lower mantle up to ~1800 km depth, which may explain the high EC anomalies observed at subduction zones underneath northeastern China. The observed EC anomalies can be matched by the EC of subducted MORB materials containing Al-bearing SiO2 with a water content of approximately 0.2 wt%, providing insights into the deep H2O circulation and distribution in the Earth's mantle.</description>

      <title>The role of spin-orbit coupling and state-crossing topography in the non-radiative decay of Ir(III) complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A pillar of our current understanding of the photoluminescence of Ir(III) complexes is the assumption that the population of triplet metal-centered states determines an efficient non-radiative decay to the ground state minimum. Based on that assumption, the energy separation between the emitting state and the minimum-energy crossing point of the triplet metal-centered and the ground states has been employed as a key variable for evaluating the ability of Ir(III) complexes to decay non-radiatively. We demonstrate that the strong spin-orbit coupling between the triplet metal-centered and the ground state of Ir(III) complexes, together with the sloped topography of their crossing, lead to a significant energy separation between the two states, resulting in a reduced rate of non-radiative ground state recovery. Therefore, we propose that the role of metal-centered states is defined by the tendency of the excited state population to remain trapped in the metal-centered minima.</description>

      <title>Scalable Machine Learning Models for Predicting Quantum Transport in Disordered 2D Hexagonal Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce scalable machine learning models to accurately predict two key quantum transport properties, the transmission coefficient T(E) and the local density of states (LDOS) in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal materials with magnetic disorder. Using a tight binding Hamiltonian combined with the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism, we generate a large dataset of over 400,000 unique configurations across graphene, germanene, silicene, and stanene nanoribbons with varying geometries, impurity concentrations, and energy levels. A central contribution of this work is the development of a geometrydriven, physically interpretable feature space that enables the models to generalize across material types and device sizes. Random Forest regression and classification models are evaluated in terms of accuracy, stability, and extrapolation ability. Regression consistently outperforms classification in capturing continuous transport behavior on in-domain data. However, extrapolation performance degrades significantly, revealing the limitations of tree-based models in unseen regimes. This study highlights both the potential and constraints of scalable ML models for quantum transport prediction and motivates future research into physics-informed or graph-based learning architectures for improved generalization in spintronic and nanoelectronic device design.</description>

Abstract: We study the effect of doping on the electron-phonon interaction and on the phonon frequencies in doped semiconductors, taking into account the screening in presence of free carriers at finite temperature. We study the impact of screening on the Fr\"ohlich-like vertex and on the long-range components of the dynamical matrix, going beyond the state-of-the-art description for undoped crystals, thanks to the development of a computational method based on maximally localized Wannier functions. We apply our approach to cubic silicon carbide, where in presence of doping the Fr\"ohlich coupling and the longitudinal-transverse phonon splitting are strongly reduced, thereby influencing observable properties such as the electronic lifetime.</description>

Abstract: Electron-phonon interaction and phonon frequencies of doped polar semiconductors are sensitive to long-range Coulomb forces and can be strongly affected by screening effects of free carriers, the latter changing significantly when approaching the two-dimensional limit. We tackle this problem within a linear-response dielectric-matrix formalism, where screening effects can be properly taken into account by generalized effective charge functions and the inverse scalar dielectric function, allowing for controlled approximations in relevant limits. We propose complementary computational methods to evaluate from first principles both effective charges -- encompassing all multipolar components beyond dynamical dipoles and quadrupoles -- and the static dielectric function of doped two-dimensional semiconductors, and provide analytical expressions for the long-range part of the dynamical matrix and the electron-phonon interaction in the long-wavelength limit. As a representative example, we apply our approach to study the impact of doping in disproportionated graphene, showing that optical Fr\"ohlich and acoustic piezoelectric couplings, as well as the slope of optical longitudinal modes, are strongly reduced, with a potential impact on the electronic/intrinsic scattering rates and related transport properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we perform electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) of freestanding graphene with high energy and momentum resolution to disentangle the quasielastic scattering from the excitation gap of Dirac electrons close to the optical limit. We show the importance of many-body effects on electronic excitations at finite transferred momentum by comparing measured EELS with ab initio calculations at increasing levels of theory. Quasi-particle corrections and excitonic effects are addressed within the GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter equation, respectively. Both effects are essential in the description of the EEL spectra to obtain a quantitative agreement with experiments, with the position, dispersion, and shape of both the excitation gap and the $\pi$ plasmon being significantly affected by excitonic effects.</description>

      <title>Geodynamics and artificial gravity in space-time crystals under slow perturbation and deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16918v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory of geodynamics in a space-time crystal based on an event wave packet constructed from the Floquet-Bloch waves, which not only involve a scalar dispersion function but also a Berry curvature tensor in the phase space manifold of space-time and the reciprocal quasi energy-momentum. In the presence of structural deformation, this theory is naturally extended into a covariant form with the introduction of a lattice connection constructed out of the gradients of the local lattice vectors. The geodesic equation for a particle not only involves the lattice connection but also higher-order corrections from space-time inhomogeneity of Berry curvatures and quasi energy-momentum dispersion gradients. These emergent connections and metric terms in the geodesic equations indicate the potential to experimentally realize artificial gravitational effects, thereby establishing a direct conceptual link between general relativity and quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Flipping of electronic spins in BiFeO$_3$ via chiral $d-d$ excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BiFeO$_3$ is a multiferroic material featuring ferroelectricity and noncollinear antiferromagnetism. Definitive and efficient control of the characteristic spin texture of BiFeO$_3$ is attractive for emerging quantum devices. In this regard, crystal-field $d\rightarrow d$ excitations localized on Fe atomic sites in BiFeO$_3$ provide an avenue for manipulation of the spin texture as they induce a complex interplay among the spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom. In this work, the \textit{ab initio} \textit{GW}-BSE method is used to characterize these excitations within an excitonic picture. We find that the $d-d$ transitions appear as strongly bound, chiral, spin-flip excitons deep within the electronic band gap as a result of the intricate competition between the lattice potential, the antiferromagnetic ordering, the spin-orbit coupling, and the electron-hole interaction. Most crucially, these excitons are composed of electron-hole pairs with opposite spins that constitute almost all of their $\pm \hbar$ total angular momentum. These excitons of specific angular momentum can be selectively excited using circularly polarized light, consequently modulating the local magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio Van der Waals electrodynamics: polaritons and electron scattering from plasmons and phonons in BN-capped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmons and polar phonons are elementary electrodynamic excitations of matter. In 2d and at long wavelengths, they couple to light and act as the system polaritons. They also dictate the scattering of charged carriers. Van der Waals heterostructures offer the opportunity to couple excitations from different layers via long-range Coulomb interactions, modifying both their dispersion and their scattering of electrons. Even when the excitations do not couple, they are still influenced by the screening from all layers, leading to complex dynamical interactions between electrons, plasmons and polar phonons. We develop an efficient ab initio model to solve the dynamical electric response of Van der Waals heterostructures, accompanied by a formalism to extract relevant spectroscopic and transport quantities. Notably, we obtain scattering rates for electrons of the heterostructure coupling remotely with electrodynamic excitations. We apply those developments to BN-capped graphene, in which polar phonons from BN couple to plasmons in graphene. We study the nature of the coupled excitations, their dispersion and their coupling to graphene's electrons. Regimes driven by either phonons or plasmons are identified, as well as a truly hybrid regime at long wavelengths. Those are studied as a function of the graphene's Fermi level and the number of BN layers. In contrast with descriptions in terms of surface-optical phonons, we find that the electron-phonon interaction stems from different modes. Moreover, the dynamical screening of the coupling between BN's LO phonons and graphene's electrons crosses over from inefficient to metal-like depending on the relative value of the phonons' frequency and the energetic onset of interband transitions. While the coupling is significant in general, the associated scattering of graphene's carriers is found to be negligible in the context of electronic transport.</description>

      <title>Quantized Born Effective charges as probes for the topological phase transition in the Haldane and Kane-Mele models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18329v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to study the transition between different topological states, based on the assessment of the vibrational resonances in infrared spectra. We consider the Haldane and Kane-Mele models finding that Born effective charges are nearly quantized, with a discontinuous jump concomitant with the topological phase transition. In particular, Born effective charges display a finite value in the trivial phase and a null one in the nontrivial one. This is rooted in the connection between Born effective charges and electronic Berry curvature at the band edges. Finally, at the topological phase transition of the Haldane model, we also observe a nearly quantized jump of the chiral splitting of the zone-center phonon frequencies, induced by time-reversal symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>First principles calculations of dynamical Born effective charges, quadrupoles and higher order terms from the charge response in large semiconducting and metallic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the context of first principles techniques we present a theoretical and computational framework to quickly determine, at finite momentum, the self-consistent (longitudinal) charge response to an external perturbation, that enters the determination of the scattering cross section of inelastic scattering processes such as EELS. We also determine the (tranverse) charge response computed in short-circuit condition. The all-order quasimomentum expansion of the tranverse charge response to an atomic displacement are the Born effective charges, quadrupoles, octupoles etc. We demonstrate that the transverse charge response can be related to the longitudinal one via a well-defined long-range dielectric function. Our advancements lead to an efficient use of perturbation theory. Due to its more favorable scaling, our method provides an interesting computational alternative to the use of the 2n+1 theorem, especially for semiconductors and metals with large unit cells. For semiconductors, we compute the piezoelectric properties of a large cell solid-solution of semiconducting hafniun oxide containing 96 atoms. We here show that the clamped ion piezoelectric response can be decomposed into real-space localized contributions that mostly depend on the chemical environment, paving the way for the use of machine-learning techniques in the material search for optimized piezoelectrics. We further apply our methodology to determine the density response of metals. Here, the leading terms of the charge expansion are related to the Fermi energy shift of the potential and by Born effective charges which do not sum to zero over the atoms. We apply our developments to the TEM-EELS spectroscopy of lithium intercalated graphites, where we find that the use of the atomic form-factor in the long-wavelength limit does not take into account for the anisotropy of the atomic chemical bonding.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in presence of nonlocal exchange interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22889v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the dynamical electronic response function in theoretical frameworks that include nonlocal exchange interactions, such as the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction, Hartree-Fock, and range-separated Hybrid DFT approaches. Within these pictures, we demonstrate that any time-dependent electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The screen-screen formulation can be further extended partitioning the electronic interaction in separate contributions, expressing the response in terms of partially screened electronic vertices (`partial screen-partial screen'), preserving the stationary properties. We numerically validate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects. To do so, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on a tight-binding model, including exchange effects in the response of graphene. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.</description>

      <title>Imprinting electrically switchable scalar spin chirality by anisotropic strain in a Kagome antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological chiral antiferromagnets, such as Mn$_{3}$Sn, are emerging as promising materials for next-generation spintronic devices due to their intrinsic transport properties linked to exotic magnetic configurations. Here, we demonstrate that anisotropic strain in Mn$_{3}$Sn thin films offers a novel approach to manipulate the magnetic ground state, unlocking new functionalities in this material. Anisotropic strain reduces the point group symmetry of the manganese (Mn) Kagome triangles from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{1}$, significantly altering the energy landscape of the magnetic states in Mn$_{3}$Sn. This symmetry reduction enables even a tiny in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction to induce canting of the Mn spins out of the Kagome plane. The modified magnetic ground state introduces a finite scalar spin chirality and results in a significant Berry phase in momentum space. Consequently, a large anomalous Hall effect emerges in the Kagome plane at room temperature - an effect that is absent in the bulk material. Moreover, this two-fold degenerate magnetic state enables the creation of multiple-stable, non-volatile anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) memory states. These states are field-stable and can be controlled by thermal assisted current-induced magnetization switching requiring modest current densities and small bias fields, thereby offering a compelling new functionality in Mn$_{3}$Sn for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Four-fold Anisotropic Magnetoresistance in Antiferromagnetic Epitaxial Thin Films of MnPt$_{x}$Pd$_{1-x}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets are emerging as promising alternatives to ferromagnets in spintronics applications. A key feature of antiferromagnets is their anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), which has the potential to serve as a sensitive marker for the antiferromagnetic order parameter. However, the underlying origins of this behavior remains poorly understood, particularly, in thin film geometries. In this study, we report the observation of AMR in epitaxial thin films of the collinear L1$_{0}$ antiferromagnet MnPt$_{x}$Pd$_{1-x}$. In the thicker films, AMR is dominated by a non-crystalline two-fold component, which emerges from domain reconfiguration and spin canting under applied magnetic field. As the film thickness is reduced, however, a crystalline four-fold component emerges, accompanied by the appearance of uncompensated magnetic moment, which strongly modifies the magnetotransport properties in the thinner films. We demonstrate that interfacial interactions lead to a large density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level. This enhanced DOS, combined with disorder in the thinner films, stabilizes the uncompensated moment and results in a four-fold modulation of the DOS as the Neel vector rotates, explaining the observed AMR behavior.</description>

      <title>Universal machine learning interatomic potentials poised to supplant DFT in modeling general defects in metals and random alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, combined with the generation of extensive density functional theory (DFT) datasets, have enabled the development of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs). These models offer broad applicability across the periodic table, achieving first-principles accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional DFT calculations. In this study, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art pretrained uMLIPs can effectively replace DFT for accurately modeling complex defects in a wide range of metals and alloys. Our investigation spans diverse scenarios, including grain boundaries and general defects in pure metals, defects in high-entropy alloys, hydrogen-alloy interactions, and solute-defect interactions. Remarkably, the latest EquiformerV2 models achieve DFT-level accuracy on comprehensive defect datasets, with root mean square errors (RMSE) below 5 meV/atom for energies and 100 meV/{\AA} for forces, outperforming specialized machine learning potentials such as moment tensor potential and atomic cluster expansion. We also present a systematic analysis of accuracy versus computational cost and explore uncertainty quantification for uMLIPs. A detailed case study of tungsten (W) demonstrates that data on pure W alone is insufficient for modeling complex defects in uMLIPs, underscoring the critical importance of advanced machine learning architectures and diverse datasets, which include over 100 million structures spanning all elements. These findings establish uMLIPs as a robust alternative to DFT and a transformative tool for accelerating the discovery and design of high-performance materials.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) Metal Halides present unique and tunable properties. However, direct and oriented synthesis is challenging due to low formation energies that lead to rapid, uncontrolled growth during solution-based processing. Here, we report the solvent-free growth of oriented and n = 1 2D $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ RP films by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). In situ photoluminescence (PL) during deposition reveals formation of the n =1 phase at the ear;y stages of growth. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering (GIWAXS) confirm a single oriented n = 1 phase, independent of the substrate. Co-localized spatially resolved PL and AFM further validate the conformal growth on strained epitaxial $\mbox{MAPbI}_3$ remain stable for over 184 days without any sign of cation exchange. This work highlights the potential of PLD for direct, room-temperature synthesis of 2D $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ RP films and stable 2D/3D heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: Microstructure imaging is crucial in materials science, but experimental images often introduce noise that obscures critical structural details. This study presents a novel deep learning approach for robust microstructure image denoising, combining phase-field simulations, Fourier transform techniques, and an attention-based neural network. The innovative framework addresses dataset limitations by synthetically generating training data by combining computational phase-field microstructures with experimental optical micrographs. The neural network architecture features an attention mechanism that dynamically focuses on important microstructural features while systematically eliminating noise types like scratches and surface imperfections. Testing on a FeMnNi alloy system demonstrated the model's exceptional performance across multiple magnifications. By successfully removing diverse noise patterns while maintaining grain boundary integrity, the research provides a generalizable deep-learning framework for microstructure image enhancement with broad applicability in materials science.</description>

      <title>Real-space methods for ab initio modelling of surfaces and interfaces under external potential bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate ab initio modelling of surfaces and interfaces, especially under an applied external potential bias, is important for describing and characterizing various phenomena that occur in electronic, catalytic, and energy storage devices. Leveraging the ability of real-space density functional theory (DFT) codes to accommodate generic boundary conditions, we introduce two methods for applying an external potential bias that can be suitable for modelling surfaces and interfaces. In the first method, an external constant electric field is applied by modifying the DFT Hamiltonian via the introduction of an auxiliary linear potential while solving the electrostatic potential arising in DFT using a Poisson equation with zero-Neumann boundary conditions. The second method directly enforces the desired external potential bias by imposing constraints on the electrostatic potential, thereby naturally mimicking experimental conditions. We describe the underlying DFT governing equations for the two setups within the real-space formalism employing finite-element discretization. First, we validate the constant electric field setup within real-space finite-element DFT (DFT-FE) with an equivalent approach using plane-wave DFT (i.e., using periodic boundary conditions) on three representative benchmark systems, namely La-terminated Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$, GaAs (111), and Al FCC (111) slabs. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the two setups in terms of the average ground-state properties, such as surface and adsorption energies. The methods developed in our work provide an attractive alternative to plane-wave DFT approaches in applying external potential bias that usually suffer from the periodic boundary conditions restrictions and poor scalability on parallel computing architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin defects in solids offer promising platforms for quantum sensing and memory due to their long coherence times and compatibility with quantum networks. Here, we integrate a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond with scanning probe microscopy to discover, read out, and spatially map arbitrary spin-based quantum sensors at the nanoscale. Using the boron vacancy (V$_\mathrm{B}^-$) center in hexagonal boron nitride$\unicode{x2013}$an emerging two-dimensional spin system$\unicode{x2013}$as a model, we detect its electron spin resonance indirectly via changes in the spin relaxation time ($T_1$) of a nearby NV center, eliminating the need for optical excitation or fluorescence detection of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$. Cross-relaxation between NV and V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles significantly reduces NV $T_1$, enabling quantitative nanoscale mapping of defect densities beyond the optical diffraction limit and clear resolution of hyperfine splitting in isotopically enriched h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N. Our method demonstrates interactions between 3D and 2D spin sensors, establishing NV centers as versatile probes for characterizing otherwise inaccessible spin defects.</description>

      <title>Unconventional compensated magnetic material LaMn$_2$SbO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconventional magnetism including altermagnetism and unconventional compensated magnetism, characterized by its duality of real-space antiferromagnetic alignment and momentum-space spin splitting, has garnered widespread attention. While altermagnetism has been extensively studied, research on unconventional compensated magnetism remains very rare. In particular, unconventional compensated magnetic materials are only theoretically predicted and have not yet been synthesized experimentally. In this study, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict that LaMn$_2$SbO$_6$ is a unconventional compensated magnetic semiconductor. Given that the Mn ions at opposite spin lattice cannot be connected by any symmetry, the spin splitting in LaMn$_2$SbO$_6$ is isotropic. More importantly, LaMn$_2$SbO$_6$ has already been synthesized experimentally, and its magnetic structure has been confirmed by neutron scattering experiments. Therefore, LaMn$_2$SbO$_6$ serves as an excellent material platform for investigating the novel physical properties of unconventional compensated magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Resistive switching and charge accumulation in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09715v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revealed the resistive switching, negative differential resistance and charge accumulation effects in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders sintered by the auto-combustion sol-gel method and annealed at temperatures from 500{\deg}C to 800{\deg}C. The fraction of the orthorhombic phase, determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), decreases from 91 vol.% to 7 vol.% with an increase in the annealing temperature from 600{\deg}C to 800{\deg}C. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra reveal the great amount of oxygen vacancies in the annealed samples, at that the decrease of the orthorhombic phase fraction (observed with an increase in the annealing temperature) correlates with a decrease in the intensity of EPR spectral lines associated with the oxygen vacancies and impurities. This indicates the participation of oxygen vacancies and other defects in the formation of the orthorhombic phase in the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders. To explain the results of electrophysical measurements, we compare the features of the current-voltage characteristics with the phase composition of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders and with the peculiarities of their EPR spectra. The analysis allows us to relate the resistive switching and charge accumulation observed in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders with the appearance of the ferroelectric-like polar regions in the orthorhombic phase of the nanoparticles, which agrees with the calculations performed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics versus Coherence in Ultra Narrow Linewidth Optical Solid State Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coherence properties of optical emitters in crystals are crucial for quantum technologies and optical frequency metrology. Cooling to sub-kelvin temperatures can markedly enhance coherence, making it important to identify the parameters governing emitter and host crystal behavior in this regime. We investigate a Czochralski-grown europium-doped yttrium orthosilicate crystal, reporting measurements of its heat capacity and optical coherence. Heat capacity not only informs thermal noise limits in metrology schemes but can also reveal two-level systems (TLS) arising from crystal imperfections via a linear-in-temperature term. Below 1 K, where phonon contributions are suppressed, TLS can drive decoherence, leading to a linear broadening of the homogeneous linewidth. From our data, we place an upper bound on the TLS contribution. This, together with constant optical linewidths between 300 mK and 2 K measured via photon-echo lifetimes, indicates minimal TLS effects in our sample. These findings highlight the promise of ultralow-temperature operation for enhancing the performance of optical quantum devices based on doped crystals.</description>

      <title>Probing enhanced electron-phonon coupling in graphene by infrared resonance Raman spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on resonance Raman spectroscopy measurements with excitation photon energy down to 1.16 eV on graphene, to study how low-energy carriers interact with lattice vibrations. Thanks to the excitation energy close to the Dirac point at $\mathbf{K}$, we unveil a giant increase of the intensity ratio between the double-resonant 2D and 2D$^\prime$ peaks with respect to that measured in graphite. Comparing with fully \textit{ab initio} theoretical calculations, we conclude that the observation is explained by an enhanced, momentum-dependent coupling between electrons and Brillouin zone-boundary optical phonons. This finding applies to two dimensional Dirac systems and has important consequences for the modeling of transport in graphene devices operating at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Effective Hamiltonian approach to kinetic Ising models: Application to an infinitely long-range Husimi-Temperley model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The probability distribution (PD) of spin configurations in kinetic Ising models has been cast in the form of the canonical Boltzmann PD with a time-dependent effective Hamiltonian (EH). It has been argued that in systems with extensive energy EH depends linearly on the number of spins $N$ leading to the exponential dependence of PD on the system size. In macroscopic systems the argument of the exponential function may reach values of the order of the Avogadro number which is impossible to deal with computationally, thus making unusable the linear master equation (ME) governing the PD evolution. To overcome the difficulty, it has been suggested to use instead the nonlinear ME (NLME) for the EH density per spin. It has been shown that in spatially homogeneous systems NLME contains only terms of order unity even in the thermodynamic limit. The approach has been illustrated with the kinetic Husimi-Temperley model (HTM) evolving under the Glauber dynamics. At finite $ N $ the known numerical results has been reproduced and extended to broader parameter ranges. In the thermodynamic limit an exact nonlinear partial differential equation of the Hamilton-Jacobi type for EH has been derived. It has been shown that the average magnetization in HTM evolves according to the conventional kinetic mean field equation.</description>

      <title>Introducing new resonant soft x-ray scattering capability in SSRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSXS) is a powerful technique for probing both spatial and electronic structures within solid-state systems. We present a newly developed RSXS capability at beamline 13-3 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), designed to enhance materials science research. This advanced setup achieves a base sample temperature as low as 9.8 K combined with extensive angular motions (azimuthal \phi and flipping \chi), enabling comprehensive exploration of reciprocal space. Two types of detectors, an Au/GaAsP Schottky photodiode and a CCD detector with over 95% quantum efficiency, are integrated to effectively capture scattered photons. Extensive testing has confirmed the enhanced functionality of this RSXS setup, including its temperature and angular performance. The versatility and effectiveness of the system have been demonstrated through studies of various materials, including superlattice heterostructures and high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Discovery of magnetic-field-tunable density waves in a layered altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets recently came into the spotlight as a new class of magnetic materials, arising as a consequence of specific crystal symmetries. They are characterized by a spin-polarized electronic band structure similar to ferromagnets, but with net zero magnetization, and touted as a promising platform to host a slew of exotic properties, many of which are yet to be explored. Here we study a new layered triangular lattice altermagnet, Co-intercalated NbSe$_2$ using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S). Differential conductance dI/dV spectra at low temperature reveal a surprising partial gap opening centered at the Fermi level, which is not captured by density functional theory calculations of the system in the pure altermagnetic state. Spatial mapping using spectroscopic-imaging STM and spin-polarized STM further reveals emergent tri-directional charge and spin density modulations with a 2a$_0$ wave length. Interestingly, we discover that out-of-plane magnetic field can serve as a knob to tune the amplitudes of the modulations as well as alter the overall electronic density-of-states in a manner that is strongly dependent on the field direction and strength. This can be attributed to the tilting of spins by the external magnetic field, which can have profound implications on the electronic properties of the altermagnet. By providing elusive atomic-scale insights, our work uncovers a tunable density wave accompanied by concomitant changes in the electronic band structure, and sets the foundation for studies of correlated electronic phenomena in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet interband plasmonics down to the vacuum UV with ultrathin amorphous silicon nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon dominates electronics, optoelectronics, photovoltaics and photonics thanks to its suitable properties, abundance, and well-developed cost-effective manufacturing processes. Recently, crystalline silicon has been demonstrated to be an appealing alternative plasmonic material, both for the infrared where free-carrier plasmons are enabled by heavy doping, and for the ultraviolet where plasmonic effects are induced by interband transitions. Herein, we demonstrate that nanostructured amorphous silicon exhibits such so-called interband plasmonic properties in the ultraviolet, as opposed to the expectation that they would only arise in crystalline materials. We report optical plasmon resonances in the 100-to-300 nm wavelength range in ultrathin nanostructures. These resonances shift spectrally with the nanostructure shape and the nature of the surrounding matrix, while their field enhancement properties turn from epsilon-near-zero plasmonic to surface plasmonic. We present a vacuum ultraviolet wavelength- and polarization-selective ultrathin film absorber design based on deeply-subwavelength anisotropically-shaped nanostructures. These findings reveal amorphous silicon as a promising material platform for ultracompact and room-temperature-processed ultraviolet plasmonic devices operating down to vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths, for applications including anticounterfeiting, data encryption and storage, sensing and detection. Furthermore, these findings raise a fundamental question on how plasmonics can be based on amorphous nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Infrared markers of topological phase transitions in quantum spin Hall insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using first principles techniques, we show that infrared optical response can be used to discriminate between the topological and the trivial phases of two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHI). We showcase germanene and jacutingaite, of recent experimental realization, as prototypical systems where the infrared spectrum is discontinuous across the transition, due to sudden and large discretized jumps of the value of Born effective charges (up to 2). For these materials, the topological transition can be induced via the application of an external electrostatic potential in the field-effect setup. Our results are rationalized in the framework of a low-energy Kane-Mele model and are robust with respect to dynamical effects which come into play when the energy gap of the material is of the same order of the infrared active phonon frequency. In the small gap QSHI germanene, due to dynamical effects, the in-plane phonon resonance in the optical conductivity shows a Fano profile with remarkable differences in the intensity and the shape between the two phases. Instead, the large gap QSHI jacutingaite presents several IR-active phonon modes whose spectral intensities drastically change between the two phases.</description>

Abstract: Ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals with Kagome lattice structures exhibit a strong coupling between magnetism and topological band features. Co3Sn2S2 is a prime example, showing a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE) driven by Berry curvature from the Weyl nodes. We investigated the temperature and angular dependence of Hall conductivity in thick Co3Sn2S2 crystals, aiming to distinguish between topological and conventional magnetic contributions. Our measurements reveal a robust Hall response even at low magnetic fields and temperatures above 77 K, suggesting a dominant topological origin and weak sensitivity to external conditions.</description>

      <title>Toward Greater Autonomy in Materials Discovery Agents: Unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal materials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning, physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous materials discovery.</description>
