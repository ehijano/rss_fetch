      <title>Probing the ringdown perturbation in binary black hole coalescences with an improved quasi-normal mode extraction algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using gravitational waves to probe the geometry of the ringing remnant black hole formed in a binary black hole coalescence is a well-established way to test Einstein's theory of general relativity. However, doing so requires knowledge of when the predictions of black hole perturbation theory, i.e., quasi-normal modes (QNMs), are a valid description of the emitted gravitational wave as well as what the amplitudes of these excitations are. In this work, we develop an algorithm to systematically extract QNMs from the ringdown of black hole merger simulations. Our algorithm improves upon previous ones in three ways: it fits over the two-sphere, enabling a complete model of the strain; it performs a reverse-search in time for QNMs using a more robust nonlinear least squares routine called \texttt{VarPro}; and it checks the variance of QNM amplitudes, which we refer to as ``stability'', over an interval matching the natural time scale of each QNM. Using this algorithm, we not only demonstrate the stability of a multitude of QNMs and their overtones across the parameter space of quasi-circular, non-precessing binary black holes, but we also identify new quadratic QNMs that may be detectable in the near future using ground-based interferometers. Furthermore, we provide evidence which suggests that the source of remnant black hole perturbations is roughly independent of the overtone index in a given angular harmonic across binary parameter space, at least for overtones with $n\leq2$. This finding may hint at the spatiotemporal structure of ringdown perturbations in black hole coalescences, as well as the regime of validity of perturbation theory in the ringdown of these events. Our algorithm is made publicly available at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/keefemitman/qnmfinder.</description>

      <title>Results from an Einstein@Home search for continuous gravitational waves from Cassiopeia A and Vela Jr. using LIGO O2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct two searches for continuous, nearly monochromatic gravitational waves originating from the central compact objects in the supernova remnants Cassiopeia A and Vela Jr. using public LIGO data. The search for Cassiopeia A targets signal frequencies between 20 Hz and 400 Hz; the Vela Jr. search between 400 Hz and 1700 Hz, and both investigate the broadest set of waveforms ever considered with highly sensitive deterministic search methods. Above 1500 Hz the Vela Jr. search is the most sensitive carried out thus far, improving on previous results by over 300\%. Above 976 Hz these results improve on existing ones by 50\%. In all we investigate over $10^{18}$ waveforms, leveraging the computational power donated by thousands of Einstein@Home volunteers. We perform a 4-stage follow-up on more than 6 million waveforms. None of the considered waveforms survives the follow-up scrutiny, indicating no significate detection candidate. Our null results constrain the maximum amplitude of continuous signals as a function of signal frequency from the targets. The most stringent 90\% confidence upper limit for Cas A is $h_0^{90 \%}\approx 7.3\times10^{-26}$ near 200 Hz, and for Vela Jr. it is $h_0^{90 \%}\approx 8.9\times10^{-26}$ near 400 Hz. Translated into upper limits on the ellipticity and r-mode amplitude, our results probe physically interesting regions: for example the ellipticity of Vela Jr. is constrained to be smaller than $10^{-7}$ across the frequency band, with a tighter constraint of less than $2\times10^{-8}$ at the highest frequencies.</description>

      <title>Internal symmetry to the rescue: well-posed 1+1 evolution of self-interacting vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have identified potential instabilities in self-interacting vector theories associated with the breakdown of the well-posedness of the initial-value problem. However, these conclusions are restricted to Abelian vector fields, leaving room to explore alternative setups, such as non-Abelian vector fields with internal symmetries. Building on this idea, we study the well-posed 1+1 evolution of self-interacting SU(2) vector fields minimally coupled to gravity within the framework of the 't Hooft-Polyakov magnetic monopole configuration. In this context, we present a counterexample in which self-interacting vector fields retain a well-posed initial value problem formulation. Remarkably, this system exhibits the same characteristic speeds as those found in general relativity (GR) in one spatial dimension. Unlike its Abelian counterpart, we achieve stable numerical evolutions across a wide range of initial conditions within a fully non-linear dynamical background, as evidenced in our time integration algorithm. Although our conclusions are strictly valid for the spherical symmetry case with only magnetic part for the vector field, this study serves as a valuable diagnostic tool for investigating more realistic astrophysical scenarios in three-dimensional settings and under more general background and vector field configurations.</description>

      <title>Calculation of Dark Matter as a Feature of Space-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the first analytical formula for the density of "Dark Matter" (DM) at all length scales, thus also for the rotation curves of stars in galaxies, for the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and for planetary systems, from Einstein's equations (EE) and classical approximations, in agreement with observations. DM is defined in Part I as the energy of the coherent gravitational field of the universe, represented by the additional equivalent ordinary matter (OM), needed at all length scales, to explain classically, with inclusion of the OM, the observed coherent gravitational field. Our derivation uses both EE and the Newtonian approximation of EE in Part I, to describe semi-classically in Part II the advection of DM, created at the level of the universe, into galaxies and clusters thereof. This advection happens proportional with their own classically generated gravitational field g, due to self-interaction of the gravitational field. It is based on the universal formula rD=lgg'g' for the density rD of DM advected into medium and lower scale structures of the observable universe, where l is a universal constant fixed by the Tully-Fisher relations. Here g' is the gravitational field of the universe; g' is in main part its own source, as implied in Part I from EE. We start from a simple electromagnetic analogy that helps to make the paper generally accessible. This paper allows for the first time the exact calculation of DM in galactic halos and at all levels in the universe, based on EE and Newtonian approximations, in agreement with observations.</description>

      <title>Near-Horizon Symmetries of Local Black Holes in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the near-horizon symmetries of static, axisymmetric, four-dimensional black holes with spherical and toroidal horizon topologies in vacuum general relativity. These black hole solutions, collectively referred to as local/distorted black holes, are known in closed form and are not asymptotically flat. Building on earlier works in the literature that primarily focused on black holes with spherical topology, we compute the algebra of the Killing vector fields that preserve the asymptotic structure near the horizons and the algebra of the associated Noether-Wald charges under the boundary conditions that produce the spin-$s$ BMS$_d$ and the Heisenberg-like algebras. We show that a similar analysis extends to all local axisymmetric black holes. The toroidal topology of the holes changes the algebras considerably. For example, one obtains two copies of spin-$s$ BMS$_3$ instead of spin-$s$ BMS$_4$. We also revisit the thermodynamics of black holes under these boundary conditions. While previous studies suggested that spin-$s$ BMS$_d$ preserves the first law of thermodynamics for isolated horizons ($\kappa= \text{const.}$), our analysis indicates that this is not generally the case when the spin parameter $s$ is nonzero. A nonzero $s$ can be seen as introducing a conical singularity (in the Euclidean quantum gravity sense) or a Hamiltonian that causes soft hairs to contribute to the energy. This leads us to interpret the spin-$s$ BMS$_d$ boundary condition as arising in the context of dynamical black holes.</description>

      <title>Korteweg-de Vries Integrals for Modified Black Hole Potentials: Instabilities and other Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors are some of the most characteristic features of the dynamics of black holes (BHs) and represent the basis for a number of fundamental physics tests with gravitational wave observations. It is therefore important to understand the properties of these quantities, naturally introduced within BH perturbation theory, in particular the stability properties under modifications of the BH potential. Instabilities in the QNMs have been recently shown to appear in the BH pseudospectrum under certain circumstances. In this work, we give a novel point of view based on the existence of some recently discovered hidden symmetries in BH dynamics and the associated infinite series of conserved quantities, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals. We provide different motivations to use the KdV integrals as indicators of some crucial BH spectral properties. In particular, by studying them in different scenarios described by modified BH barriers, we find strong evidence that the KdV conserved quantities represent a useful tool to look for instabilities in the BH spectrum of QNMs and in their greybody factors.</description>

      <title>Black-bounce solutions in a k-essence theory under the effects of bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we analyze the effects of violation of Lorentz symmetry for black-bounce solutions in a $k$-essence theory that has the form of a power law for the configuration $n=1/3$. We perform such analysis for a known model explored in previous work $\Sigma^2=x^2+a^2$ and complement the proposal with a new black-bounce model for the area functions $\Sigma^2_1=\sqrt{x^4+d^4}$. This model has the Schwarzschild-de Sitter asymptomatic behavior for $x\to{-\infty}$, and we investigate the scalar field, potential, and energy conditions for both models. We have shown that the violation of Lorentz symmetry can be generated through $k$-essence without the need for an additional field. These results corroborate the validation of other previously investigated wormhole solutions.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum criticality near the BTZ black hole horizon: Insights from coupled fermion-antifermion pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analytically examine the behavior of a fermion-antifermion pair near the horizon of a static BTZ black hole using a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation with a position-dependent mass. This formulation leads to a set of four first-order equations that can be reduced to a second-order wave equation, enabling the analysis of gravitational effects on quantum interactions. Two mass modifications are considered: (i) \(m \rightarrow m - a/r\), representing an attractive Coulomb interaction, and (ii) \(m \rightarrow m - a/r + b r\), corresponding to a Cornell potential. For case (i), an exact analytical solution is obtained, while for case (ii), conditionally exact solutions involving biconfluent Heun functions are derived. For the lowest mode (\(n=0\)), the results indicate that real oscillations without energy loss occur when \(a &gt; 0.25\) in scenario (i) and \(a &gt; 0.75\) in scenario (ii), suggesting stable oscillatory behavior. When \(a &lt; 0.25\) in scenario (i) or \(a &lt; 0.75\) in scenario (ii), the state exhibits decay, indicating instability below these critical thresholds. At \(a = 0.25\) (scenario (i)) and \(a = 0.75\) (scenario (ii)), the system reaches a state where its evolution ceases over time. These findings provide insights into the stability conditions of fermion-antifermion pairs near the black hole horizon and may have relevance for determining critical coupling strengths in systems such as holographic superconductors. Furthermore, this work adopts an effective semi-classical quantum gravity approach, offering a practical framework for incorporating gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Reformulation of Einstein equations in the Fully Constrained Formulation: local-uniqueness, post-Newtonian expansion and initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein equations can be written in the so-called Fully Constrained Formulation (FCF). This formulation has two different sectors: the elliptic sector, formed by the Hamiltonian and Momentum constraints together with the equations derived from the gauge choice; and the hyperbolic sector, formed by the evolution of the rest of the spacetime metric variables, which encodes the gravitational radiation. In this work, we present a modification of both sectors that keeps local uniqueness properties of the elliptic system of equations and includes a hierarchical post-Newtonian structure of all the elliptic and hyperbolic equations. This reformulation can have potential applications in cosmology and relativistic astrophysics. Moreover, we show how initial stationary data can be computed numerically using this formulation without assuming a conformally flat spatial metric, with the illustrative example of a rotating neutron star.</description>

      <title>Increasing quantum speed meter sensitivity using optical spring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double-pass interferometer scheme was proposed in Ref.\,[Light Sci. Appl. {\bf 7}, 11 (2018)] as the method of implementation of the quantum speed meter concept in future laser gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Later it was shown in Ref.\,[Phys. Rev. D {\bf 110}, 062006 (2024)] that it allows to implement the new type of the optical spring that does not require detuning of the interferometer. Here we show that both these regimes can coexist, combining the speed meter type broadband sensitivity gain with the additional lows-frequency minimum in the quantum noise originated from the optical spring. We show that the location of this minimum can be varied without affecting the core optics of the interferometer, allowing to tune the quantum noise shape in real time to follow the ``chirp'' GW signals.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fact that quantum theory is non-differentiable, while general relativity is built on the assumption of differentiability sources an incompatibility between quantum theory and gravity. Higher order geometry addresses this issue directly by extending differential geometry, such that it can be applied to theories that are non-differentiable, but have a certain degree of H\"older regularity. As this includes the path integral formulation of quantum theory, it provides a natural mathematical framework for describing the interplay between gravity and quantum theory. In this article, we review the motivation for and the basic features of this framework and point towards future developments.</description>

      <title>Physical Interpretations of Integration Constants in the Solutions of Einstein Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As in other partial differential equations, one ends up with some arbitrary constants or arbitrary functions when one integrates Einstein's equations, or more generally field equations of any other gravity. Interpretation of these arbitrary constants and functions as some physical quantities that can in principle be measured is a non-trivial matter. Concentrating on the case of constants, one usually identifies them as conserved mass, momentum, angular momentum, center of mass, or some other hairs of the solution. This can be done via the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM)-type construction based on pure geometry; and the solution is typically a black hole. Hence, one talks about the black hole mass and angular momentum etc. Here we show that there are several misunderstandings: First of all, the physical interpretation of the constants of a given geometry depends not only on pure geometry, i.e. the metric, but also on the theory under-consideration. This becomes quite important especially when there is a cosmological constant. Secondly, one usually assigns the maximally symmetric spacetime, say the flat or the (anti)-de Sitter spacetime, to have a zero mass and angular momentum and linear momentum. This declares the maximally symmetric spacetime to be the vacuum of the theory, but such an assignment depends on the coordinates in the ADM-type constructions and their extensions: in fact, one can introduce large gauge transformations (new coordinates) which map, say, the flat spacetime to flat spacetime but the resultant flat spacetime can have a nontrivial mass and angular momentum, if the new coordinates are such that the metric components do not decay properly. These issues, which are often overlooked, will be examined in detail, and a resolution, via the use of a divergence-free rank $(0,4)$-tensor will be shown for the case of anti-de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Spherical accretion of a collisionless kinetic gas into a generic static black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a nontrivial extension of the problem of spherical accretion of a collisionless kinetic gas into the standard Schwarzschild black hole. This extension consists of replacing the Schwarzschild black hole by generic static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes with the aim of studying the effects of either modified gravitational theories beyond Einstein gravity or matter sources coupled to general relativity on the accretion process. This generalization also allows us to investigate the accretion into other types of black hole spacetimes, such as ones inspired by loop quantum gravity and string theory. To do so, we take into account a large class of static and spherically symmetric black holes whose spacetime is asymptotically flat with a positive total mass, has a regular Killing horizon, and satisfies appropriate monotonicity conditions of the metric functions. We provide the most general solution of the collisionless Boltzmann equation on such spacetimes by expressing the one-particle distribution function in terms of suitable symplectic coordinates on the cotangent bundle, and we calculate the relevant observables, such as particle current density and energy-momentum-stress tensor. Specializing to the case where the gas is described by an isotropic ideal fluid at rest at infinity, we compute the mass accretion rate and compression ratio, and we show that the tangential pressure is larger than the radial one at the horizon, indicating that the behavior of a collisionless gas is different from the one of an isotropic perfect fluid. As an example, we apply our generic formulae to two special black hole spacetimes, namely the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and a loop quantum corrected black hole. We explore the effects of the free parameters on the observables and accretion rate, and we compare the results with those corresponding to the Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of gravitational-wave signals with frequency-dependent antenna responses and higher-modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement frequency-dependent antenna responses and develop likelihood classes (standard likelihood, multibanded likelihood, and the relative binning (RB) likelihood) capable of handling the same within the framework of \texttt{Bilby}. We validate the approximate likelihoods by comparing them with the exact likelihood for a GW170817-like signal (signal-to-noise ratio ~ 1900) containing higher-order modes of radiation. We use the relative-binning likelihood to perform parameter estimation (PE) for a GW170817-like signal, including Earth-rotation effects, detector-size effects, and higher-order modes. We study the system in several detector networks consisting of a single 40 km Cosmic Explorer, a 20 km CE and a present-generation detector at A+ sensitivity. The PE runs with RB take around a day to complete on a typical cluster.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Subcycling Time Integration with the Einstein Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) with subcycling in time enables different grid levels to advance using their own time steps, ensuring finer grids employ smaller steps for accuracy while coarser grids take larger steps to improve computational efficiency. We present the development, validation, and performance analysis of a subcycling in time algorithm implemented within the CarpetX driver in the Einstein Toolkit framework. This new approach significantly improves upon the previous subcycling implementation in the Carpet driver by achieving higher-order convergence -- fourth order in time instead of second order -- and enhanced scaling performance. The key innovation lies in optimizing the exchange of ghost points at refinement boundaries, limiting it to the same number as those at inter-process boundaries using dense output from coarser levels, thereby reducing computational and communication overhead compared to the implementation in Carpet, which required a larger number of buffer zones.
  To validate the algorithm, we first demonstrate its fourth-order convergence using a scalar wave test. We then apply the algorithm to binary black hole (BBH) simulations, confirming its robustness and accuracy in a realistic astrophysical scenario. The results show excellent agreement with the well-established LazEv code. Scaling tests on CPU (Frontera) and GPU (Vista) clusters reveal significant performance gains, with the new implementation achieving improved speed and scalability compared to the Carpet-based version.</description>

      <title>On observers in holographic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A straightforward gravitational path integral calculation implies that closed universes are trivial, described by a one dimensional Hilbert space. Two recent papers by Harlow-Usatyuk-Zhao and Abdalla-Antonini-Iliesiu-Levine have sought to ameliorate this issue by defining special rules to incorporate observers into the path integral. However, the proposed rules are different, leading to differing results for the Hilbert space dimension. Moreover, the former work offers a holographic map realized using a non-isometric code construction to complement their path integral result and clarify its physics. In this work, we propose a non-isometric code that implements the second construction, allowing thorough comparison. Our prescription may be thought of as simply removing the portion of the map that acts on the observer, while preserving the rest, creating an effective holographic boundary at the observer-environment interface. This proposal can be directly applied to general holographic maps for both open and closed universes of any dimension.</description>

      <title>Further constraining the neutron star-black hole merger rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current template-based gravitational-wave searches for compact binary mergers neglect the general relativistic phenomenon of spin-induced orbital precession. Owing to their asymmetric masses, gravitational-waves from neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries are prime candidates for displaying strong imprints of spin-precession. As a result, current searches may be missing a significant fraction of the astrophysical population, and the detected NSBH population may be significantly suppressed or biased. Here we report the most sensitive search for NSBH binaries to date by including spin-precession for the first time. We analyze data from the entirety of the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave observing run and show that when accounting for spin-precession, our search is up to 100% more sensitive than the search techniques currently adopted by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration (for systems with strong precessional effects). This allows us to more tightly constrain the rate of NSBH mergers in the local Universe. Firstly, we focus on a precessing subpopulation of NSBH mergers; the lack of observed candidates allows us to place an upper limit on the merger rate of $R_{90} = 79\, \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with 90% confidence. Secondly, we tighten the overall rate of NSBH mergers; we show that if there is no preferred direction of component spin, the rate of NSBH mergers is on average 16% smaller than previously believed. Finally, we report four new subthreshold NSBH candidates, all with strong imprints of spin precession, but note that these are most likely to be of terrestrial origin.</description>

      <title>Probing Leptogenesis at LISA: A Fisher analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In JCAP 11 (2024) 051, we discussed how different regimes (flavoured) of leptogenesis can be probed through a ``tomographic'' approach using primordial gravitational waves. By examining the theory's parameter space, we identified regions where right-handed neutrino mass-dependent non-standard cosmological expansion leaves characteristic imprints on propagating gravitational waves. Our analysis focused on inflationary blue-tilted gravitational waves, modeled by a power-law tensor power spectrum with a constant spectral index. The resulting double-peak spectrum -- where peak and dip frequencies are sensitive to leptogenesis parameters -- provided marked signatures of different leptogenesis regimes. In this follow-up article, we conduct a statistical analysis of two-flavour leptogenesis signals, particularly those producing a peak (more generally, a broken power-law signal) within the LISA frequency band. Using a Fisher matrix analysis, we delineate the regions of parameter space that LISA can probe with minimal uncertainty, accounting for galactic and extragalactic foregrounds along with LISA's instrumental noise.</description>

      <title>$T\overline{T}$ Deformation: Introduction and Some Recent Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review explores recent advances in the theory of $T\bar{T}$ deformation, an irrelevant yet solvable deformation of quantum field theories defined via the quadratic form of the energy-momentum tensor. It addresses classical and quantum aspects, highlighting significant developments across various fields, including field theory, holography, and string theory. Classically, $T\bar{T}$ deformation manifests through multiple geometric interpretations, notably random geometry, Jackiw-Teitelboim-like gravity, and uniform light-cone gauge frameworks. For quantum aspects, the deformation introduces notable features such as non-locality, UV-IR mixing, solvable renormalization structures, and intriguing modifications to correlation functions and entanglement properties. Furthermore, the paper examines the profound relationship between $T\bar{T}$ deformation and holography, particularly within the mixed boundary conditions/cutoff AdS holography proposal and holographic entanglement entropy. Connections to string theory through single-trace deformations and their holographic duals further reveal the deformed structure of the worldsheet. This review synthesizes recent developments and outlines potential directions for future research in the study of $T\bar{T}$-like deformation.</description>

      <title>Model-independent $H_0$ within FLRW: Joint constraints from GWTC-3 standard sirens and strong lensing time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension has emerged as a critical crisis in cosmology, with the cause remaining unclear. Determining the Hubble constant ($H_0$) independently of cosmological models and distance ladders will help resolve this crisis. In this letter, we for the first time use 47 gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog to calibrate distances in the strong lensing system, RXJ1131-1231, and constrain $H_0$ through the distance-sum rule, with minimal cosmological assumptions. We assume that light propagation over long distances is described by the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric and that geometrical optics holds, but we do not need to assume the universe's contents or the theory of gravity on cosmological scales. Fixing $\Omega_K=0$, we obtain $H_0=73.22^{+5.95}_{-5.43}$ ${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $H_0=70.40^{+8.03}_{-5.60}$ ${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ by using the deflector galaxy's mass model and kinematic measurements to break mass-sheet transform, respectively. When $\Omega_K$ is not fixed, the central value of $H_0$ increases further. We find that our results are still dominated by statistical errors, and at the same time, we notice the great potential of using GW dark sirens to provide calibration, owing to their higher redshifts. When using 42 binary black holes and RXJ1131-1231, we obtain a $8.46 \%$ $H_0$ constraint precision, which is better than that from the bright siren GW170817 using the Hubble law by about $40\%$. In the future, as the redshift range of GW dark sirens increases, more and more SGLTDs can be included, and we can achieve high-precision, model-independent measurements of $H_0$ without the need for GW bright sirens.</description>

      <title>The stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic superstrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by a network of cosmic superstrings and demonstrate that incorporating higher-mass string species, beyond the fundamental string, is crucial for accurately modeling the resulting gravitational wave spectrum across frequencies ranging from nanohertz to kilohertz. Using the multi-tension velocity-dependent one-scale model to evolve the cosmic superstring network, we perform several fits to the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension, string coupling and effective size of compact extra dimensions. We find that the cosmic superstring best-fits are comparable in likelihood to Supermassive Black Hole models, thought by many to be the leading candidate explanation of the signal. The implications of the best-fit spectra are discussed within the context of future gravitational wave experiments. We obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension of $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-11.5^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$($-11.6^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$) for gravitational waves originating from large cuspy (kinky) cosmic superstring loops and $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-9.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$($-9.9^{+1.0}_{-0.5}$) for small cuspy (kinky) loops. We also place $2\sigma$ upper bounds on the string coupling, finding $g_s&lt;0.65$ in all cases, and comment on the implication of our results for the effective size of the compact extra dimensions.</description>

      <title>Deep source separation of overlapping gravitational-wave signals and non-stationary noise artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band, detecting signals from a vast number of astrophysical sources embedded in instrumental noise. Extracting individual signals from these overlapping contributions is a fundamental challenge in LISA data analysis and is traditionally addressed using computationally expensive stochastic Bayesian techniques. In this work, we present a deep learning-based framework for blind source separation in LISA data, employing an encoder-decoder architecture commonly used in digital audio processing to isolate individual signals within complex mixtures. Our approach enables signals from massive black-hole binaries, Galactic binaries, and instrumental glitches to be disentangled directly in a single step, circumventing the need for sequential source identification and subtraction. By learning clustered latent space representations, the framework provides a scalable alternative to conventional methods, with applications in both low-latency event detection and full-scale global-fit analyses. As a proof of concept, we assess the model's performance using simulated LISA data in a controlled setting with a limited number of overlapping sources. The results highlight deep source separation as a promising tool for LISA, paving the way for future extensions to more complex datasets.</description>

      <title>A search for sterile neutrinos in interacting dark energy models using DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and DES supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos can influence the evolution of the universe, and thus cosmological observations can be used to search for sterile neutrinos. In this study, we utilized the latest baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI, combined with the cosmic microwave background data from Planck and the five-year supernova data from DES, to constrain the interacting dark energy (IDE) models involving both cases of massless and massive sterile neutrinos. We consider four typical forms of the interaction term $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm de}$, $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm c}$, $Q=\beta H_{0} \rho_{\rm de}$, and $Q=\beta H_{0} \rho_{\rm c}$, respectively. Our analysis indicates that the current data provide only a hint of the existence of massless sterile neutrinos (as dark radiation) at about the $1\sigma$ level. In contrast, no evidence supports the existence of massive sterile neutrinos. Furthermore, in IDE models, the inclusion of (massless/massive) sterile neutrinos has a negligible impact on the constraint of the coupling parameter $\beta$. The IDE model of $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm c}$ with sterile neutrinos does not favor an interaction. However, the other three IDE models with sterile neutrinos support an interaction in which dark energy decays into dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basic observables in cosmology are known as in-in correlators. Recent calculations have revealed that in-in correlators in four dimensional de Sitter space exhibit hidden simplicity stemming from a close relation to scattering amplitudes in flat space. In this paper we explain how to make this property manifest by dressing flat space Feynman diagrams with certain auxiliary propagators. These dressing rules hold for any order in perturbation theory and can be derived for a broad range of scalar theories, including those with infrared divergences. In the latter case we show that they reproduce the same infrared divergences predicted by the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism.</description>

      <title>3+1 formulation of light modes in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a 3+1 formulation of the light modes in nonlinear electrodynamics described by Plebanski-type Lagrangians, which include Post-Maxwellian, Born-Infeld, ModMax, and Heisenberg-Euler-Schwinger QED Lagrangians. In nonlinear electrodynamics, strong electromagnetic fields modify the vacuum to acquire optical properties. Such a field-modified vacuum can possess electric permittivity, magnetic permeability, and magneto-electric response, inducing novel phenomena like vacuum birefringence. By exploiting the mathematical structures of Plebanski-type Lagrangians, we obtain a streamlined procedure and explicit formulas to determine light modes, i.e., refractive indices and polarization vectors for a given propagation direction. We also work out the light modes of the mentioned Lagrangians for an arbitrarily strong magnetic field. The 3+1 formulation advanced in this paper has direct applications to the current vacuum birefringence research: terrestrial experiments using permanent magnets/ultra-intense lasers for the subcritical regime and astrophysical observation of the x-rays from highly magnetized neutron stars for the near-critical and supercritical regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accepted idea that the expansion of the universe is accelerating needs, for compatibility to general relativity, the introduction of some unusual forms of matter. However, several authors have proposed that instead of making weird hypothesis on some yet unobservable species of matter, one should follow the original idea of the first Einstein's paper on cosmology and consider that in the cosmic scene one has to modify the equations that controls the gravitational metric. This possibility led us to re-examine the evolution of the topological invariant containing two duals in a dynamical universe, the so called Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant. The particular interest on this invariant is due to the fact that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe this invariant drives the cosmic acceleration. In a decelerating scenario and as a necessary previous condition of an ulterior acceleration this invariant must have an extremum identified to its maximum value. We will examine the conditions for this to occur, and a description of the universe with epochs of accelerated and decelerated expansion.</description>

Abstract: To investigate the model and extra frictional effects in standard siren simulation of $f(Q)$ cosmologies, we simulated three types of standard siren data based on different fiducial models ($\Lambda$CDM and $f(Q)$ models). Both effects are important in standard siren simulation. Explicitly, the $f(Q)_P$ and $f(Q)_E$ models need more observational data (e.g.growth factor) to further study. The $f(Q)_{PE}$ model could be ruled out by the EM data. And both the $f(Q)_{HT}$ models will be excluded by the future standard siren data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: So far, no one has studied regular black holes using the Parikh-Wilczek method. In this paper, we calculated the emission rate of magnetized particles passing through the event horizon of the Bardeen black hole by using the Parikh-Wilczek method. The emission spectrum deviates from the pure thermal spectrum, but conforms to the unitary principle of quantum mechanics. Our results support the conservation of information.</description>

      <title>Shadows and parameter estimation of rotating quantum corrected black holes and constraints from EHT observation of M87* and Sgr A*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09198v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scarcity of quantum gravity (QG) inspired rotating black holes limits the progress of testing QG through Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations. The EHT imaged the supermassive black holes, Sgr A* and M87*, revealing an angular shadow diameter of $d_{sh} = 48.7 \pm 7 \mu$as with a black hole mass of $M = 4.0_{-0.6}^{+1.1} \times 10^6 M\odot$ for Sgr A*. For M87*, with a mass of $M = (6.5 \pm 0.7) \times 10^9 M_\odot$, the EHT measured an angular diameter of $\theta_d = 42 \pm 3 \mu$as. We present rotating quantum-corrected black hole (RQCBH) spacetimes with an additional QC parameter $\alpha$ and constrain it by EHT observations. For angular shadow diameter ($d_{sh}$) of Sgr A* at $\theta_o = 50^0$, the bounds are $0.0 \leq \alpha \leq 1.443 M^2$ and $a \in (0, 0.8066 M)$. For $\theta_o = 90^0$, the bounds are $0.0 \leq \alpha \leq 1.447 M^2$ and $a \in (0, 0.894 M)$. While for M87* at inclination $\theta_o = 17^0$, the bounds are $a \in (0, 0.8511 M)$ at $\alpha=0$ and $a \in (0, 0.6157 M)$ at $\alpha=0.8985 M^2$. For $\theta_o = 90^0$, the bounds are $a \in (0, 0.8262 M)$ at $\alpha=0$ and $a \in (0, 0.9799 M)$ at $\alpha=0.4141 M^2$. These results show that $\alpha$ significantly affects the shadows, offering key constraints on QG models. With EHT constraints from Sgr A and M87*, RQCBHs and Kerr black holes are indistinguishable in much of the EHT-constrained parameter space, making RQCBHs strong candidates for astrophysical black holes along with other BHs, e.g., regular black holes and other quantum-corrected solutions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of high order correction for Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the premise that quantum gravity becomes non-negligible, higher-order corrections of non-commutative geometry dominate. In this paper, we studied the thermodynamics of high-order corrections for Schwarzschild-AdS black hole with Lorentz distribution in the framework of non-commutative geometry. Our results indicate that when high-order corrections dominate, the thermodynamic behavior of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry will gradually approach that of ordinary Schwarzschild-AdS black hole. In addition, we also studied the Joule-Thomson effect of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole under high-order corrections.</description>

      <title>C-metric in a (nut)shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the C-metric in $2+1$ dimensions, placing it within a shell of stress energy and matching it to an exterior vacuum AdS metric. The $2+1$ C-metric is not circularly symmetric and hence neither are the constructed shells, which instead take on a cuspoidal or teardrop shape. We interpret the stress energy of the shells as a perfect fluid, calculating the energy density and pressure. For accelerating particles (Class I), we find the stress energy is concentrated on the part of shell farthest from the direction of acceleration and always respects the strong and weak energy conditions. For accelerating black holes (Class I$_{\mathrm{C}}$, II, and III), the shell stress energy may either respect or violate the energy conditions depending on the parameter of the exterior metric -- between the two regimes lies a critical value of the external parameter for which the shell stress energy vanishes, leading to new solutions of Einstein's field equations, which fall into three categories: an accelerated black hole pulled by a finite-length string with a point particle at the other end, an accelerated black hole pushed by a finite-length strut with a point particle at the other end, and an accelerated black hole pushed from one side by a finite-length strut and pulled from the other by a finite-length string, each with a point particle at the other end.</description>

Abstract: The loop quantum gravitational collapse of the dust ball in presence of positive cosmological constant is investigated within the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario. The dust ball interior is described within the framework of loop quantum cosmology, while its exterior geometry is determined by the differentiability of the spacetime metric at the dust ball surface and the assumption of the (vacuum) exterior to be stationary. In order to determine the global causal structure of the investigated spacetime a robust (numerical) method of constructing Penrose-Carter diagrams is built. Unfortunately the presence of cosmological constant does not cure the problems already present in the case of it vanishing -- the exterior geometry resembles that of Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black hole, in particular featuring timelike singularties.</description>

      <title>Causal structure of nonhomogeneous dust collapse in effective loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the causal structure for spherically symmetric dust collapse within a model of effective loop quantum gravity. We develop a general strategy (working beyond the dynamical model of our consideration) for constructing double null coordinates, allowing the extraction of conformal diagrams within single coordinate charts. With the methods introduced, we confirm that the homogeneous Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario resembles the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like picture. For the nonhomogenous collapse scenario, we construct the conformal diagrams, subsequently, we study its relevant properties, in particular, dust particles' trajectories, apparent horizons and shell-crossing singularities. We conclude that a significant region of spacetime remains inaccessible to the model's dynamics due to the formation of the shell-crossing singularities. The question of whether a timelike singularity, similar to that in the homogeneous dust ball collapse scenario, arises in the nonhomogeneous case remains unresolved. Furthermore, we find that phenomena such as black hole explosions or gravitational shock waves cannot be witnessed by an external observer who does not cross any horizon. Indeed, the collapse cannot take place within single asymptotic region.</description>

      <title>Probing black holes via quasinormal modes in a dark energy-induced dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study delves into the existence of dark matter around supermassive black holes in galactic cores using a novel gravitational model. By analyzing gravitational waves emitted during the ringdown phase of black holes under different field perturbations, we explore the potential for detecting dark matter. The model hypothesizes that the dark matter distribution around black hole is driven by a mechanism where dark energy endows gravitons with mass, thereby forming a new spacetime structure. Results reveal that as relevant parameters increase, the quasinormal modes (QNMs) exhibit a gradual reduction in real parts, with negative imaginary parts whose absolute values also decrease. Moreover, compared to gravitational wave signals from Schwarzschild black hole without dark matter, this system demonstrates significant differences in oscillation modes and frequencies. This achievement not only validates the self-consistency of the new gravitational model but also lays a theoretical foundation for subsequent gravitational wave detection within dark matter. Simultaneously, it provides new theoretical support for understanding the mechanism of dark energy in large-scale cosmic structures and broadens the research perspective on the relationships between black hole physics, dark matter, and dark energy.</description>

      <title>Rotating and swirling binary black hole system balanced by its gravitational spin-spin interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first exact and analytical solution representing an equilibrium configuration of two stationary black holes, in general relativity, is presented. The metric models two collinear extremal Kerr black holes immersed into an external and back-reacting rotating tidal drag. The gravitational attraction is balanced by the repulsive gravitational spin-spin interaction generated by the interplay between black holes angular momenta with the rotational background. The new solution is built by embedding the double Kerr metric into a swirling universe by means of the Ehlers transformation. The geometry is completely regular outside the event horizons. Thermodynamic properties of the binary black hole system are studied, the Smarr law, the first law and the Christodoulou-Ruffini formulas are verified. Microscopic degrees of freedom of the entropy are computed from the dual CFT living on the boundary of the near horizon geometries.</description>

      <title>Extraction of energy from a black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it has been discovered that the nonlinear self-interaction of matter can induce energy extraction from black holes beyond superradiant instability. This process is closely associated with the occurrence of a dynamical first-order transition between different types of static black holes. To explore whether first-order phase transitions invariably lead to energy extraction, we have investigated the evolution of black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar model with a higher-order coupling. In this model, there are also dynamical first-order phase transitions between black hole solutions. Our findings indicate that energy can only be extracted from a small, stable hairy black hole in this model. However, this energy extraction is more closely related to the growth of the black hole horizon radius, rather than the dynamical transition between different types of black holes. This suggests that a dynamical first-order phase transition does not necessarily result in energy extraction.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum effects of big bang and black hole singularities on massive conformal gravity. We do this by analyzing the behavior of the on-shell effective action of the theory at these singularities. The result is that such singularities are harmless in MCG because the on-shell effective action of the theory does not diverge at them.</description>

Abstract: We consider two simple criteria for when a physical theory should be said to be "generally covariant", and we argue that these criteria are not met by Yang-Mills theory, even on geometric formulations of that theory. The reason, we show, is that the bundles encountered in Yang-Mills theory are not natural bundles; instead, they are gauge-natural. We then show how these observations relate to previous arguments about the significance of solder forms in assessing disanalogies between general relativity and Yang-Mills theory. We conclude by suggesting that general covariance is really about functoriality.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compute the WQFT partition function, specifically the eikonal phase in a black hole scattering event in the dynamical Chern-Simons theory, using the techniques of spinning worldline quantum field theory. We consider the scattering of spinning black holes and highlight the necessary details for the calculation of the partition function. We present the $\epsilon$-expansion of the essential two-loop integrals using Integration-by-Parts (IBP) reduction and differential equation techniques, which we then utilize to compute the linear-in-order spin eikonal phase up to 3PM. Additionally, we discuss the dependence of the phase on the spin orientations of the black holes.</description>

      <title>Non-extremal Island in de Sitter Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the challenges and resolutions in computing the entanglement entropy for the quantum field theory coupled to de Sitter (dS) gravity along a timelike boundary. The conventional island formula, originally designed to calculate the fine-grained entropy for a non-gravitational system coupled to anti-de Sitter (AdS) gravity, encounters difficulties in de Sitter gravitational spacetime, failing to provide a physically plausible extremal island. To overcome these problems, we introduce a doubly holographic model by embedding a dS$_2$ braneworld in an AdS$_3$ bulk spacetime. This approach facilitates the computation of entanglement entropy through holographic correlation functions, effectively circumventing the constraints of the island formula. We demonstrate that the correct recipe for calculating entanglement entropy with dS gravity involves the non-extremal island, whose boundary is instead defined at the edge of the dS gravitational region. Our findings indicate that, during the island phase, the entanglement wedge of the non-gravitational bath includes the entire dS gravitational space. Using the second variation formula, we further show that the existence of a locally minimal surface anchored on the gravitational brane is intrinsically linked to the extrinsic curvature of the brane.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational Cheshire effect refers to the possibility of turning off the gravitational field while still leaving an imprint of the nonminimal coupling of matter to gravity. This allows nontrivial solutions in flat spacetime for which no backreaction is possible. The effect was originally shown to manifest itself for standard nonminimal couplings, such as those allowing conventional conformally invariant scalar fields. Recently, the most general scalar field action yielding a conformally invariant second-order equation was constructed, and entails a more involved nonminimal coupling explicitly breaking the conformal invariance of the action without spoiling it in the equation. We have succeeded in fully describing the spherically symmetric stealth solutions on flat spacetime supporting the Cheshire effect within this general non-Noetherian conformal theory. The allowed configurations are divided into two branches: The first one essentially corresponds to an extension of the solutions already known for the standard Noetherian conformal theory. The second branch is only possible due to the non-Noetherian conformal contribution of the action. The complete characterization of this branch is expressed by a nonlinear first-order partial differential equation. We have found the general solution of this equation using both seemingly new and well-established mathematical tools.</description>

Abstract: Landau Yang theorem is well known for the past several decades. It prohibits the decay of a massive spin 1 particle to two photons. This emerges simply from the representation theory of the Poincare group and Bose Statistics. It does not require any action or Lagrangian. We generalize this theorem to theories with supersymmetry (SUSY) which disallows even decay to two photinos (Majorana fermions) as well as the decay of a zino to a photon and a photino. We will prove that if the photon has a mass, howsoever small, this theorem can be evaded. We also show that the supersymmetric selection rule above can also be evaded through the Stueckelberg mass term. Further interesting implications are also pointed out.</description>

      <title>Particle creation from non-geodesic trajectories in multifield inflation</title>

Abstract: Particle production in de Sitter spacetime arises from the exponential expansion of space, rendering the Bunch-Davies vacuum perceived as a particle-containing state by late-time observers. For states defined as eigenstates of both momentum and the Hamiltonian, the Bunch-Davies vacuum exhibits a constant particle density per physical momentum. We explore particle production beyond this baseline, focusing on deviations from exact de Sitter conditions and non-gravitational interactions, such as slow-roll inflation or interactions arising from the coupling of inflation to other fields. Using Bogoliubov transformations, we calculate the number density of energy/momentum eigenstates. In single-field inflation, this density captures the observed spectral index of the primordial power spectrum, while in two-field models, it reflects the non-gravitational coupling driving background trajectory turning. We present analytical results applicable to various scenarios involving particle production from non-adiabatic processes during inflation.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the population properties of merging black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Third-generation gravitational-wave detectors will observe up to millions of merging binary black holes. With such a vast dataset, stacking events into population analyses will arguably be more important than analyzing single sources. We present the first application of population-level Fisher-matrix forecasts tailored to third-generation gravitational-wave interferometers. We implement the formalism first derived by Gair et al. and explore how future experiments such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will constrain the distributions of black-hole masses, spins, and redshift. Third-generation detectors will be transformative, improving constraints on the population hyperparameters by several orders of magnitude compared to current data. At the same time, we highlight that a single third-generation observatory and a network of detectors will deliver qualitatively similar performances. Obtaining precise measurements of some population features (e.g. peaks in the mass spectrum) will require only a few months of observations while others (e.g. the fraction of binaries with aligned spins) will instead require years if not decades. We argue population forecasts of this kind should be featured in white papers and feasibility studies aimed at developing the science case of future gravitational-wave interferometers.</description>

      <title>Multivariate hypergeometric solutions of cosmological (dS) correlators by $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give the analytic expression for the homogeneous part of solutions of arbitrary tree-level cosmological correlators, including massive propagators and time-derivative interaction cases. The solutions are given in the form of multivariate hypergeometric functions. It is achieved by two steps. Firstly, we indicate the factorization of the homogeneous part of solutions, i.e., the homogeneous part of solutions of multiple vertices is the product of the solutions of the single vertex. Secondly, we give the solution to the $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations of arbitrary single vertex integral family. We also show how to determine the boundary conditions for the differential equations. There are two techniques we developed for the computation. Firstly, we analytically solve $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations via power series expansion. Secondly, we handle degenerate multivariate poles in power series expansion of differential equations by blow-up. They could also be useful in the evaluation of multi-loop Feynman integrals in flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Overlaps in JT Gravity: From Spectral Form Factor to Generating Functions of Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between black hole interior dynamics and quantum chaos provides a crucial framework for probing quantum effects in quantum gravity. In this work, we investigate non-perturbative overlaps in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity to uncover universal signatures of quantum chaos and quantum complexity. Taking advantage of universal spectral correlators from random matrix theory, we compute the overlaps between the thermofield double (TFD) state and two distinct classes of states: fixed-length states, which encode maximal volume slices, and time-shifted TFD states. The squared overlaps naturally define probability distributions that quantify the expectation values of gravitational observables. Central to our results is the introduction of generating functions for quantum complexity measures, such as $\langle e^{-\alpha \ell} \rangle$. The time evolution of these generating functions exhibits the universal slope-ramp-plateau structure, mirroring the behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF). Using generating functions, we further demonstrate that the universal time evolution of complexity for chaotic systems, which is characterized by a linear growth followed by a late-time plateau, arises from the disappearance of the linear ramp as the regularization parameter $\alpha$ decreases. With regard to the time-shifted TFD state, we derive a surprising result: the expectation value of the time shift, which classically grows linearly, vanishes when non-perturbative quantum corrections are incorporated. This cancellation highlights a fundamental distinction between semiclassical and quantum gravitational descriptions of the black hole interior. All our findings establish generating functions as powerful probes of quantum complexity and chaos in gravitational and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Chemistry Knows Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: : In this note, we study an extra dimension effect on the black hole chemistry in the 8-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills-Maxwell theory. The base spacetime contains 4- dimensional compact manifolds and an instanton on top of those. We demonstrate how the extra dimensions affect the phase transition and viable black hole sizes in the 4-dimensional Einstein frame through the black hole chemistry. We focus on asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes for the effective 4-dimensional model obtained by a dimensional reduction. The extra-dimension size determines thermodynamic pressure, and the thermodynamic volume is roughly the horizon size of black holes. Thus, the extra dimension and black hole sizes are related as a conjugate pair of thermodynamic variables. In addition, we discuss the zeroth-order phase transition of the 4-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole.</description>
