      <title>On the Welfare (Ir)Relevance of Two-Stage Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a two-stage model of choice a decision maker first shortlists a given menu and then applies her preferences. We show that a sizeable class of these models run into significant issues in terms of identification of preferences (welfare-relevance) and thus cannot be used for welfare analysis. We classify these models by their revealed preference principles and expose the principle that we deem to be the root of their identification issue. Taking our analysis to an experimental data, we observe that half of the alternatives that are revealed preferred to another under rational choice are left revealed preferred to nothing for any member of this class of models. Furthermore, the welfare-relevance of the specific models established in the literature are much worse. The model with the highest welfare-relevance produces a revealed preference relation with the average density of 2% (1 out of 45 possible comparisons revealed), while rational choice does 63% (28 out of 45 possible comparisons). We argue that the issue is not an inherent feature of two-stage models, and rather lies in the approach with which the first stage is modelled in the literature.</description>

      <title>Orchestrating Organizational Politics: Baron and Ferejohn Meet Tullock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the optimal organizational rules that govern the process of dividing a fixed surplus. The process is modeled as a sequential multilateral bargaining game with costly recognition. The designer sets the voting rule -- i.e., the minimum number of votes required to approve a proposal -- and the mechanism for proposer recognition, which is modeled as a biased generalized lottery contest. We show that for diverse design objectives, the optimum can be achieved by a dictatorial voting rule, which simplifies the game into a standard biased contest model.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Cycle: A "Dynamic" Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nash equilibrium (NE) is fundamental game-theoretic concept for characterizing stability in static strategic form games. However, at times, NE fails to capture outcomes in dynamic settings, where players' actions evolve over time in response to one another. In such cases, game dynamics fail to converge to an NE, instead exhibiting cyclic or oscillatory patterns. To address this, we introduce the concept of an 'equilibrium cycle' (EC). Unlike NE, which defines a fixed point of mutual best responses, an EC is a set-valued solution concept designed to capture the asymptotic or long-term behavior of dynamic interactions, even when a traditional best response does not exist. The EC identifies a minimal rectangular set of action profiles that collectively capture oscillatory game dynamics, effectively generalizing the notion of stability beyond static equilibria. An EC satisfies three important properties: \textit{stability} against external deviations (ensuring robustness), \textit{unrest} with respect to internal deviations (driving oscillation), and \textit{minimality} (defining the solution's tightness). This set-valued outcome generalizes the minimal curb set to discontinuous games, where best responses may not exist. In finite games, the EC also relates to sink strongly connected components (SCCs) of the best response graph.</description>

      <title>Industrial symbiosis: How to apply successfully</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The premise of industrial symbiosis IS is that advancing a circular economy that reuses byproducts as inputs in production is valuable for the environment. We challenge this premise in a simple model. Ceteris paribus, IS is an environmentally friendly approach; however, implementing IS may introduce increased pollution into the market equilibrium. The reason for this is that producers' incentives for recycling can be triggered by the income gained from selling recycled waste in the secondary market, and thereby may not align with environmental protection. That is, producers may boost production and subsequent pollution to sell byproducts without internalizing the pollution emitted in the primary industry or the recycling process. We compare the market solution to the social optimum and identify a key technology parameter - the share of reused byproducts that may have mutual benefits for firms, consumers, and the environment.</description>

      <title>Equitable Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of how auction design affects the division of surplus among buyers. We propose a parsimonious measure for equity and apply it to the family of standard auctions for homogeneous goods. Our surplus-equitable mechanism is efficient, Bayesian-Nash incentive compatible, and achieves surplus parity among winners ex-post. The uniform-price auction is equity-optimal if and only if buyers have a pure common value. Against intuition, the pay-as-bid auction is not always preferred in terms of equity if buyers have pure private values. In auctions with price mixing between pay-as-bid and uniform prices, we provide prior-free bounds on the equity-preferred pricing rule under a common regularity condition on signals.</description>
