      <title>Probabilistic Predictions of Option Prices Using Multiple Sources of Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new modular approximate Bayesian inferential framework is proposed that enables fast calculation of probabilistic predictions of future option prices. We exploit multiple information sources, including daily spot returns, high-frequency spot data and option prices. A benefit of this modular Bayesian approach is that it allows us to work with the theoretical option pricing model, without needing to specify an arbitrary statistical model that links the theoretical prices to their observed counterparts. We show that our approach produces accurate probabilistic predictions of option prices in realistic scenarios and, despite not explicitly modelling pricing errors, the method is shown to be robust to their presence. Predictive accuracy based on the Heston stochastic volatility model, with predictions produced via rapid real-time updates, is illustrated empirically for short-maturity options.</description>

      <title>Alpha Mining and Enhancing via Warm Start Genetic Programming for Quantitative Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional genetic programming (GP) often struggles in stock alpha factor discovery due to its vast search space, overwhelming computational burden, and sporadic effective alphas. We find that GP performs better when focusing on promising regions rather than random searching. This paper proposes a new GP framework with carefully chosen initialization and structural constraints to enhance search performance and improve the interpretability of the alpha factors. This approach is motivated by and mimics the alpha searching practice and aims to boost the efficiency of such a process. Analysis of 2020-2024 Chinese stock market data shows that our method yields superior out-of-sample prediction results and higher portfolio returns than the benchmark.</description>

      <title>Stock Recommendations for Individual Investors: A Temporal Graph Network Approach with Mean-Variance Efficient Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems can be helpful for individuals to make well-informed decisions in complex financial markets. While many studies have focused on predicting stock prices, even advanced models fall short of accurately forecasting them. Additionally, previous studies indicate that individual investors often disregard established investment theories, favoring their personal preferences instead. This presents a challenge for stock recommendation systems, which must not only provide strong investment performance but also respect these individual preferences. To create effective stock recommender systems, three critical elements must be incorporated: 1) individual preferences, 2) portfolio diversification, and 3) the temporal dynamics of the first two. In response, we propose a new model, Portfolio Temporal Graph Network Recommender PfoTGNRec, which can handle time-varying collaborative signals and incorporates diversification-enhancing sampling. On real-world individual trading data, our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including cutting-edge dynamic embedding models and existing stock recommendation models. Indeed, we show that PfoTGNRec is an effective solution that can balance customer preferences with the need to suggest portfolios with high Return-on-Investment. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/youngandbin/PfoTGNRec.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach to Predict the Fall [of Price] of Cryptocurrency Long Before its Actual Fall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modern times, the cryptocurrency market is one of the world's most rapidly rising financial markets. The cryptocurrency market is regarded to be more volatile and illiquid than traditional markets such as equities, foreign exchange, and commodities. The risk of this market creates an uncertain condition among the investors. The purpose of this research is to predict the magnitude of the risk factor of the cryptocurrency market. Risk factor is also called volatility. Our approach will assist people who invest in the cryptocurrency market by overcoming the problems and difficulties they experience. Our approach starts with calculating the risk factor of the cryptocurrency market from the existing parameters. In twenty elements of the cryptocurrency market, the risk factor has been predicted using different machine learning algorithms such as CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU. All of the models have been applied to the calculated risk factor parameter. A new model has been developed to predict better than the existing models. Our proposed model gives the highest RMSE value of 1.3229 and the lowest RMSE value of 0.0089. Following our model, it will be easier for investors to trade in complicated and challenging financial assets like bitcoin, Ethereum, dogecoin, etc. Where the other existing models, the highest RMSE was 14.5092, and the lower was 0.02769. So, the proposed model performs much better than models with proper generalization. Using our approach, it will be easier for investors to trade in complicated and challenging financial assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin.</description>
