      <title>A Hierarchy for Constant Communication Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similarly to the Chomsky hierarchy, we offer a classification of communication complexity measures such that these measures are organized into equivalence classes. Different from previous attempts of this endeavor, we consider two communication complexity measures as equivalent, if, when one is constant, then the other is constant as well, and vice versa. Most previous considerations of similar topics have been using polylogarithmic input length as a defining characteristic of equivalence. In this paper, two measures ${\cal C}_1, {\cal C}_2$ are constant-equivalent, if and only if for all total Boolean (families of) functions $f:\{0, 1\}^n\times\{0, 1\}^n\rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ we have ${\cal C}_1(f)=O(1)$ if and only if ${\cal C}_2(f)=O(1)$. We identify five equivalence classes according to the above equivalence relation. Interestingly, the classification is counter-intuitive in that powerful models of communication are grouped with weak ones, and seemingly weaker models end up on the top of the hierarchy.</description>

      <title>A weak regularity lemma for polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A regularity lemma for polynomials provides a decomposition in terms of a bounded number of approximately independent polynomials. Such regularity lemmas play an important role in numerous results, yet suffer from the familiar shortcoming of having tower-type bounds or worse. In this paper we design a new, weaker regularity lemma with strong bounds. The new regularity lemma in particular provides means to quantitatively study the curves contained in the image of a polynomial map, which is beyond the reach of standard methods.
  Applications include strong bounds for a problem of Karam on generalized rank, as well as a new method to obtain upper bounds for fan-in parameters in arithmetic circuits. For example, we show that if the image of a polynomial map $\mathbf{P} \colon \mathbb{F}^n \to \mathbb{F}^m$ of degree $d$ does not contain a line, then $\mathbf{P}$ can be computed by a depth-$4$ homogeneous formula with bottom fan-in at most $d/2$ and top fan-in at most $(2m)^{C(d)}$ (with $C(d)=2^{(1+o(1))d}$). Such a result was previously known only with at least a tower-type bound on the top fan-in. One implication of our work is a certain ``barrier'' to arithmetic circuit lower bounds, in terms of the smallest degree of a polynomial curve contained in the image of the given polynomial map.</description>

      <title>Limitations on Safe, Trusted, Artificial General Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety, trust and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are aspirational goals in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and there are several informal interpretations of these notions. In this paper, we propose strict, mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification, planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's results.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Classification Of Detecting Dominating Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following generalization of dominating sets: Let $G$ be a host graph and $P$ be a pattern graph $P$. A dominating $P$-pattern in $G$ is a subset $S$ of vertices in $G$ that (1) forms a dominating set in $G$ \emph{and} (2) induces a subgraph isomorphic to $P$. The graph theory literature studies the properties of dominating $P$-patterns for various patterns $P$, including cliques, matchings, independent sets, cycles and paths. Previous work (Kunnemann, Redzic 2024) obtains algorithms and conditional lower bounds for detecting dominating $P$-patterns particularly for $P$ being a $k$-clique, a $k$-independent set and a $k$-matching. Their results give conditionally tight lower bounds if $k$ is sufficiently large (where the bound depends the matrix multiplication exponent $\omega$). We ask: Can we obtain a classification of the fine-grained complexity for \emph{all} patterns $P$?
  Indeed, we define a graph parameter $\rho(P)$ such that if $\omega=2$, then \[ \left(n^{\rho(P)} m^{\frac{|V(P)|-\rho(P)}{2}}\right)^{1\pm o(1)} \] is the optimal running time assuming the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis, for all patterns $P$ except the triangle $K_3$. Here, the host graph $G$ has $n$ vertices and $m=\Theta(n^\alpha)$ edges, where $1\le \alpha \le 2$.
  The parameter $\rho(P)$ is closely related (but sometimes different) to a parameter $\delta(P) = \max_{S\subseteq V(P)} |S|-|N(S)|$ studied in (Alon 1981) to tightly quantify the maximum number of occurrences of induced subgraphs isomorphic to $P$. Our results stand in contrast to the lack of a full fine-grained classification of detecting an arbitrary (not necessarily \emph{dominating}) induced $P$-pattern.</description>

      <title>Random Unitaries in Constant (Quantum) Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random unitaries are a central object of study in quantum information, with applications to quantum computation, quantum many-body physics, and quantum cryptography. Recent work has constructed unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) using $\Theta(\log \log n)$-depth unitary circuits with two-qubit gates.
  In this work, we show that unitary designs and PRUs can be efficiently constructed in several well-studied models of $\textit{constant-time}$ quantum computation (i.e., the time complexity on the quantum computer is independent of the system size). These models are constant-depth circuits augmented with certain nonlocal operations, such as (a) many-qubit TOFFOLI gates, (b) many-qubit FANOUT gates, or (c) mid-circuit measurements with classical feedforward control. Recent advances in quantum computing hardware suggest experimental feasibility of these models in the near future.
  Our results demonstrate that unitary designs and PRUs can be constructed in much weaker circuit models than previously thought. Furthermore, our construction of PRUs in constant-depth with many-qubit TOFFOLI gates shows that, under cryptographic assumptions, there is no polynomial-time learning algorithm for the circuit class $\mathsf{QAC}^0$. Finally, our results suggest a new approach towards proving that PARITY is not computable in $\mathsf{QAC}^0$, a long-standing question in quantum complexity theory.</description>
