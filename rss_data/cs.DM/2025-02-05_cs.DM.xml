      <title>Injectivity of polynomials over finite discrete dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of observable phenomena (for instance, in biology or physics) allows the detection of dynamical behaviors and, conversely, starting from a desired behavior allows the design of objects exhibiting that behavior in engineering. The decomposition of dynamics into simpler subsystems allows us to simplify this analysis (or design). Here we focus on an algebraic approach to decomposition, based on alternative and synchronous execution as the sum and product operations; this gives rise to polynomial equations (with a constant side). In this article we focus on univariate, injective polynomials, giving a characterization in terms of the form of their coefficients and a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the associated equations.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Artificial Intelligence: Transforming Machine Learning Systems Naturally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the machine learning elements which we are interested in together as a machine learning system, consisting of a collection of machine learning elements and a collection of relations between the elements. The relations we concern are algebraic operations, binary relations, and binary relations with composition that can be reasoned categorically. A machine learning system transformation between two systems is a map between the systems, which preserves the relations we concern. The system transformations given by quotient or clustering, representable functor, and Yoneda embedding are highlighted and discussed by machine learning examples. An adjunction between machine learning systems, a special machine learning system transformation loop, provides the optimal way of solving problems. Machine learning system transformations are linked and compared by their maps at 2-cell, natural transformations. New insights and structures can be obtained from universal properties and algebraic structures given by monads, which are generated from adjunctions.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Ordered Ramsey Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ordered Ramsey number of a graph $G^&lt;$ with a linearly ordered vertex set is the smallest positive integer $N$ such that any two-coloring of the edges of the ordered complete graph on $N$ vertices contains a monochromatic copy of $G^&lt;$ in the given ordering. The study of the quantitative behavior of ordered Ramsey numbers is a relatively new theme in Ramsey theory full of interesting and difficult problems.
  In this survey paper, we summarize recent developments in the theory of ordered Ramsey numbers. We point out connections to other areas of combinatorics and some well-known conjectures. We also list several new and challenging open problems and highlight the often strikingly different behavior from the unordered case.</description>

      <title>Revisiting classical results on kernels in digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a digraph, a kernel is a subset of vertices that is both independent and absorbing. Kernels have important applications in combinatorics and outside. Kernels do not always exist and finding sufficient conditions ensuring their existence is a key theoretical challenge. In this work, we revisit and generalize a few classical results of this sort, especially the Sands--Sauer--Woodrow theorem and the Galeana-S\'anchez--Neumann-Lara theorem.</description>

      <title>A Euclidean Distance Matrix Model for Convex Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.04947v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering has been one of the most basic and essential problems in unsupervised learning due to various applications in many critical fields. The recently proposed sum-of-norms (SON) model by Pelckmans et al. (2005), Lindsten et al. (2011) and Hocking et al. (2011) has received a lot of attention. The advantage of the SON model is the theoretical guarantee in terms of perfect recovery, established by Sun et al. (2018). It also provides great opportunities for designing efficient algorithms for solving the SON model. The semismooth Newton based augmented Lagrangian method by Sun et al. (2018) has demonstrated its superior performance over the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the alternating minimization algorithm (AMA). In this paper, we propose a Euclidean distance matrix model based on the SON model. An efficient majorization penalty algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting model. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model and the majorization penalty algorithm.</description>

      <title>Roots in the semiring of finite deterministic dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite discrete-time dynamical systems (FDDS) model phenomena that evolve deterministically in discrete time. It is possible to define sum and product operations on these systems (disjoint union and direct product, respectively) giving a commutative semiring. This algebraic structure led to several works employing polynomial equations to model hypotheses on phenomena modelled using FDDS. To solve these equations, algorithms for performing the division and computing $k$-th roots are needed. In this paper, we propose two polynomial algorithms for these tasks, under the condition that the result is a connected FDDS. This ultimately leads to an efficient solution to equations of the type $AX^k=B$ for connected $X$. These results are some of the important final steps for solving more general polynomial equations on FDDS.</description>

      <title>The Rise of Plurimorphisms: Algebraic Approach to Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the success of the so-called algebraic approach to the study of decision constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), exact optimization of valued CSPs, and most recently promise CSPs, we propose an algebraic framework for valued promise CSPs.
  To every valued promise CSP we associate an algebraic object, its so-called valued minion. Our main result shows that the existence of a homomorphism between the associated valued minions implies a polynomial-time reduction between the original CSPs. We also show that this general reduction theorem includes important inapproximability results, for instance, the inapproximability of almost solvable systems of linear equations beyond the random assignment threshold.</description>

      <title>A subquadratic certification scheme for P5-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In local certification, vertices of a $n$-vertex graph perform a local verification to check if a given property is satisfied by the graph. This verification is performed thanks to certificates, which are pieces of information that are given to the vertices. In this work, we focus on the local certification of $P_5$-freeness, and we prove a $O(n^{3/2})$ upper bound on the size of the certificates, which is (to our knowledge) the first subquadratic upper bound for this property.</description>
