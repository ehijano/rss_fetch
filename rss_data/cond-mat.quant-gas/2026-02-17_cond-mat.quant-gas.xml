      <title>Measuring Spin-Charge Separation by an Off-diagonal Dissipative Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractionalization of symmetry - exemplified by spin-charge separation in the 1D Hubbard model and fractional charges in the fractional quantum Hall effect - is a typical strongly correlated phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Despite the success in measuring velocity differences, however, it is still quite challenging in probing emergent excitations' anomalous dimensions experimentally. We propose a off-diagonal dissipative response protocol, leveraging dissipative response theory (DRT), to directly detect spin-charge separation. By selectively dissipating spin-$\downarrow$ particles and measuring the spin-$\uparrow$ response, we uncover a universal temporal signature: the off-diagonal response exhibits a crossover from cubic-in-time ($t^3$) growth at short times to linear-in-time ($t$) decay at long times. Crucially, the coefficients $\varkappa^s$ (short-time) and $\varkappa^l$ (long-time) encode the distinct anomalous dimensions and velocities of spinons and holons, providing unambiguous evidence of fractionalization. This signal vanishes trivially without spin-charge separation. Our predictions, verified numerically via tDMRG, with microscopic parameters linking with Luttinger parameters by Bethe ansatz, establish off-diagonal dissipative response as a probe of quantum fractionalization in synthetic quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Optical transport of cold atoms to quantum degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient transport of cold atoms is essential for continuous operation, enabling applications ranging from atomic lasers to continuously operated qubits. However, deep potentials required to overcome vibrations, axial trap nonuniformity and insufficient cooling have limited transport of cold atoms near quantum degeneracy. Here we demonstrate rapid optical transport of cold atoms to Bose-Einstein condensation using a moving optical lattice formed by two Bessel beams. A gas of $3 \times 10^5$ ytterbium atoms at a temperature of $340\,$nK is transported over $34\,$cm in $350\,$ms with efficiency over $60\%$. Furthermore, a degenerate gas of $1 \times 10^5$ atoms with a $40\%$ condensate fraction emerges from the phase synchronization process driven by atomic interactions. This demonstration enables the fast preparation of ultracold atomic beams and large-scale atom arrays for quantum sensing, simulation and computing.</description>

      <title>Dirac Spin Liquid Candidate in a Rydberg Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate a frustrated spin-exchange antiferromagnet in a quantum simulator, composed of N = 114 dipolar Rydberg atoms arranged into a kagome array. Motivated by a recent theoretical proposal of a gapless U(1) Dirac spin liquid ground state, we use local addressing to adiabatically prepare low-energy states. We measure the local polarization and spin-spin correlations over this adiabatic protocol, and observe our system move from a staggered product state, through an intermediate magnetic crystal, and finally into a disordered, correlated liquid. We estimate the entropy density of this atomic liquid to be similar to that of frustrated magnetic insulators at liquid nitrogen temperatures. We compare the correlations in our liquid to those of a simple, parameter-free ansatz for the Dirac spin liquid, and find good agreement in the sign structure and spatial decay. Finally, we probe the static susceptibility of our system to a local field perturbation and to a geometrical distortion. Our results establish Rydberg atom arrays as a promising platform for the preparation and microscopic characterization of quantum spin liquid candidates.</description>

      <title>Probing atom-surface interactions from tunneling-time measurements via rotation-transport on an atom chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to measure the interaction between an ultracold gas of neutral atoms and a surface. This solution combines an optical dipole trap reflected by the surface, a magnetic trap formed by current carrying wires embedded below the surface, and a rotation of the surface itself. It allows to adiabatically transport a $^{87}$Rb BEC from few $\mu$m to few hundred nm of the surface. At such distances, atom-surface interaction strongly affects the trapping potential, causing an increase of the tunneling rate towards the surface. In this paper, we show that the measurement of the lifetime of the cloud and its comparison to a tunneling model will allow to extract the Casimir-Polder (CP) force coefficient in the retarded regime ($c_4$). Our model includes noise-induced heating, calibration biases of experimentally controlled parameters and accuracy of the atom lifetime measurement. Using typical trapping parameters and experimental uncertainties, we numerically estimate the relative uncertainty of $c_4$ to be 10%. This method can be implemented with any atomic species that can be magnetically and optically trapped.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Synthetic Hall Torus with a Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first experimental realization of a synthetic Hall torus using a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a ring-shaped trap with in situ imaging. By cyclically coupling three hyperfine spin states via Raman and microwave fields, we impose a periodic boundary condition in the synthetic dimension, which together with a real-space ring trap, realizes a toroidal geometry with a synthetic magnetic flux. This flux induces azimuthal density modulations in the condensate, whose periodicity is uniquely determined by the quantized toroidal magnetic flux-a hallmark of the Hall torus geometry. By varying the relative phase between the couplings across repeated experimental runs, we control the location of the density extrema, emulating the behavior of Thouless charge pump in a toroidal geometry. We further investigate the onset of these modulations as the system transitions from a cylindrical to a toroidal topology. Our results establish a versatile platform for investigating quantum Hall physics and topological phenomena in synthetic curved spaces.</description>

      <title>Ward-Takahashi Identity and Gauge-Invariant Response Theory for Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the Ward-Takahashi identity and establish the gauge-invariant response theory for open quantum systems described by Lindbladians to show that particle-number conservation is not necessary to satisfy gauge invariance. We construct an observable which can be used to test the gauge invariance in the absence of particle-number conservation. We derive the low-energy collective modes that emerge as a consequence of gauge invariance in open quantum systems, and find that two-body loss induces diffusive modes in dissipative Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductivity. Possible experimental situations for testing gauge invariance in open quantum systems are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic matter and hadron-quark crossover from an ultracold atom perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dense matter equation of state is of great interest due to the recent development of astrophysical observations for neutron stars. A rapid increase in pressure indicates a continuous crossover from a hadron phase to a quark phase without any phase transitions, yet its microscopic mechanism remains elusive. Recently, a peak in the speed of sound and a baryon momentum-shell structure, which are predicted from a quarkyonic matter picture, have been regarded as key features of the hadron-quark crossover. In this work, we explore a field-theoretical framework to describe the hadron-quark crossover, drawing an analogy with the Bose-Einstein condensate to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BEC-BCS) crossover established in ultracold atomic experiments. Strikingly, a peak in the speed of sound and the baryon momentum-shell structure can simultaneously be explained by the tripling fluctuation effect arising from a different context of quantum many-body physics. We demonstrate these properties in a simplified model and provide a microscopic derivation of the quarkyonic matter model within our field-theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce dissipative spectroscopy as a framework for extracting spectral information from quantum systems via controlled dissipation. By establishing a general dissipative response theory applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian environments, we develop a protocol to access the dissipative spectrum (DS) through driven oscillation-dissipation resonance. We show that the DS can identify two-particle soft modes near quantum critical points and, on the normal-phase side, predict the emergence of macroscopic order exhibiting power-law growth following a dissipation quench. These distinctive signatures appear in quasiparticle-dominant regimes, previously considered trivial. Furthermore, we introduce extended dissipative susceptibilities that capture leading memory effects and demonstrate their utility in a dissipative fermionic model. Our results indicate that the DS is readily accessible and offers a versatile tool for probing equilibrium properties as well as predicting nonequilibrium dissipative dynamics.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued in-medium potential between heavy impurities in ultracold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate the induced potential in a finite temperature cold atomic medium between two heavy impurities, or polarons, which is shown to be \textit{complex-valued} in general. The imaginary part of the complex-valued potential describes a decoherence effect, and thus, the resulting Schr\"odinger equation for the two polarons acquires a non-Hermitian term. We apply the developed formulation to two representative cases of polarons interacting with medium particles through the $s$-wave contact interaction: (i) the normal phase of single-component (i.e., spin-polarized) fermions using the fermionic field theory, and (ii) a superfluid phase using the superfluid effective field theory, which is valid either for a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of a single-component Bose gas or for the BEC-BCS crossover in two-component fermions at a low-energy regime. Computing the leading-order term, the imaginary part of the potential in both cases is found to show a universal $r^{-2}$ behavior at long distance. We propose three experimental ways to observe the effects of the universal imaginary potential in cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Small-Mass Asymptotics of Massive Point Vortex Dynamics in Bose--Einstein Condensates I: Averaging and Normal Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an asymptotic analysis of massive point-vortex dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensates in the small-mass limit $\varepsilon \to 0$. We define two distinguished manifolds in the phase space of the dynamics. We call the first the kinematic subspace $\mathcal{K}$, whereas the second is an almost-invariant set $\mathcal{S}$ called a ``slow manifold.'' The orthogonal projection of the massive dynamics to $\mathcal{K}$ yields the standard massless vortex dynamics or the Kirchhoff equations -- also the 0th-order approximation to the massive equation as $\varepsilon \to 0$. Our first main result proves that the massive dynamics starting $O(\varepsilon)$-close to $\mathcal{K}$ remains $O(\varepsilon)$-close to the massless dynamics for short times. The second main result is the derivation of a normal form for the system's Hamiltonian for the two-vortex case; it describes the coupling between motion within $\mathcal{S}$ and that transverse to it. Specifically, we use the Lie transformation perturbation method to derive the first few terms in a formal expansion for $\mathcal{S}$ and demonstrate numerically that fast oscillations due to the vortices' mass are suppressed, given initial conditions sufficiently close to $\mathcal{S}$.</description>

      <title>Imaginary gauge potentials in a non-Hermitian spin-orbit coupled quantum gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1996, Hatano and Nelson proposed a non-Hermitian lattice model containing an imaginary Peierls phase [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77 570-573 (1996)], which subsequent analyses revealed to be an instance of a new class of topological systems. Here, we experimentally realize a continuum analog to this model containing an imaginary gauge potential using a homogeneous spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Non-Hermiticity is introduced by adding tunable spin-dependent loss via microwave coupling to a subspace with spontaneous emission. We demonstrate that the resulting Heisenberg equations of motion for position and momentum depend explicitly on the system's phase-space distribution. First, we observe collective nonreciprocal transport in real space, with a "self-acceleration" that decreases with the BEC's spatial extent, consistent with non-Hermitian Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. We then examine localized edge states: the relatively strong interactions in our BEC suppress the formation of topological edge states, yielding instead highly excited states localized by an interplay between self-acceleration and wavefunction spreading. Finally, we confirm that our non-Hermitian description remains valid at all times by comparing to a multi-level master-equation treatment.</description>

      <title>Phase domain walls in coherently driven Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09553v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider coherent states of weakly interacting bosons under the conditions of external resonant excitation, with a focus on a two-dimensional polariton fluid driven by a plane electromagnetic wave near the ground state. The coherent driving breaks the U(1) symmetry explicitly, which prevents the occurrence of quantum vortices in a uniform scalar condensate. Surprisingly, a spinor (two-component) system of the same kind admits topological excitations, such as domain walls of relative phase or confined half-vortex molecules, typical of a freely evolving spinor Bose system. Opposite-phase domains arise from the spontaneous breakdown of the spin symmetry $(\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Domain walls form with time even when the initial state of the system is uniform or completely disordered; they fall into different topological types distinguished by the total phase variation in the transverse direction. One type of domain walls is similar to ``magnetic'' solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates and exhibits nonzero spin polarization whose sign depends on the direction of motion. Domain walls of the second type, by contrast, behave like monopoles with broken spatiotemporal symmetry and tend to move in certain preferred directions. The interaction of vortices and domain walls results in a long-range ordering of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state control is a fundamental tool for quantum technologies. In this work, we propose and analyze the use of quantum optimal control to exploit the dipolar interaction of ultracold atoms on a lattice ring, focusing on the generation of selected states with entangled circulation. This scheme requires time-dependent control over the orientation of the magnetic field, a technique that is feasible in ultracold atom laboratories. The system's evolution is driven by just two independent control functions. We describe the symmetry constraints of this approach and numerically test them using the extended Bose-Hubbard model. We find that the proposed control can engineer entangled current states with perfect fidelity across a wide range of systems, and that in the remaining cases, the theoretical upper bounds for fidelity are reached.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these notes, we elucidate some subtle aspects of coherent-state path integrals, focusing on their application to the equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum many-particle systems. These subtleties emerge when evaluating path integrals in the continuum, either in imaginary time or in Matsubara-frequency space. Our central message is that, when handled with due care, the path integral yields results identical to those obtained from the canonical Hamiltonian approach. We illustrate this through a pedagogical treatment of several paradigmatic systems: the bosonic and fermionic harmonic oscillators, the single-site Bose-Hubbard and Hubbard models, the weakly-interacting Bose gas with finite-range interactions, and the BCS superconductor with finite-range interactions.</description>

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect describes the phenomenon of exponential localization of single-particle eigenstates near the boundary of the system. We consider its generalization to the many-body regime by investigating a general class of interacting fermion lattice models in Markovian open quantum systems. Therein, the elementary excitations from the "vacuum" (steady state) are given by two types of dissipative fermionic modes composed of single-fermion operators, which govern the long-time nonequilibrium dynamics. We perturbatively calculate the self-energy matrix of these bare modes in the presence of interactions, and utilize the non-Bloch band theory to derive an exact integral representation. By imposing complex momentum conservation, we obtain a simplified expression for corrections to Liouvillian spectrum that agrees well with numerical calculations to high precision. We further perform perturbative analysis of Liouvillian eigenstates and identify signatures of interaction-enhanced NHSE at the quasiparticle level, manifested as renormalization of the generalized Brillouin zone. Our results establish a diagrammatic framework for dissipative interacting fermions with non-Hermitian skin effect in a description of full-fledged Lindblad master equations, which resembles Fermi liquid theory in terms of interaction-dressed quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Generalized Loschmidt echo and information scrambling in open systems</title>

Abstract: Quantum information scrambling, typically explored in closed quantum systems, describes the spread of initially localized information throughout a system and can be quantified by measures such as the Loschmidt echo (LE) and out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). In this paper, we explore information scrambling in the presence of dissipation by generalizing the concepts of LE and OTOC to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics. We investigate the universal dynamics of the generalized LE across regimes of weak and strong dissipation. In the weak dissipation regime, we identify a universal structure, while in the strong dissipation regime, we observe a distinctive two-local-minima structure, which we interpret through an analysis of the Lindblad spectrum. Furthermore, we establish connections between the thermal averages of LE and OTOC and prove a general relation between OTOC and R\'enyi entropy in open systems. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol for measuring OTOC in open systems. These findings provide deeper insights into information scrambling under dissipation and pave the way for experimental studies in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A cavity array microscope for parallel single-atom interfacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays and optical cavity QED systems have developed in parallel as central pillars of modern experimental quantum science. While each platform has demonstrated exceptional capabilities-such as high-fidelity quantum logic in atom arrays, and strong light-matter coupling in cavities-their combination holds promise for realizing fast and non-destructive atom measurement, building large-scale quantum networks, and engineering hybrid atom-photon Hamiltonians. However, to date, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited to spatially interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode, a configuration that constrains addressability, parallelism, and scalability. Here we introduce the cavity array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements, and instead uses a new free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micron-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom-cavity coupling, and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including through a fiber array as a proof-of-principle for networking applications. As an outlook, we realize a next-generation iteration of the platform with over 500 cavities and a nearly 10 times improvement in finesse. Our work unlocks the regime of many-cavity QED, and opens an unexplored frontier of large-scale quantum networking with atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Generalized Brillouin Zone Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Brillouin Zone (GBZ) encodes how lattice momentum is complex-deformed due to non-Hermitian skin accumulation, and has proved essential in restoring bulk-boundary correspondences. However, we find that generically, the GBZ is neither unique nor well-defined if more than one skin localization direction or strength exists, even in systems with no asymmetric hoppings. Instead, open boundary condition (OBC) eigenstates become complicated superpositions of multiple competing skin modes from "fragments" of all possible GBZs solutions. We develop a formalism that computes the fragmented GBZ in a scalable manner, with fragmentation extent quantified through our newly-defined composition IPR and spectral relative entropy. GBZ fragmentation is revealed to fundamentally challenge the notion of discontinuous phase transitions, since topological winding contributions from different GBZ fragments can "melt away" at different rates. Phenomenologically, GBZ fragmentation also leads to edge localization in all observables in energetically weighted ensembles such as thermal ensembles. This contrasts with conventional GBZs where the skin localization completely cancels in biorthogonal expectations. Occurring universally in multi-mode non-Hermitian media, as we concretely demonstrate with photonic crystal simulations, GBZ fragmentation points towards a new paradigm that is essential for understanding the band structure and the topological and dynamical properties of diverse generic non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cellular Automata on a Dual-Species Rydberg Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum devices scale to larger and larger sizes, a significant challenge emerges in scaling their coherent controls accordingly. Quantum cellular automata (QCAs) constitute a promising framework that bypasses this control problem: universal dynamics can be achieved using only a static qubit array and global control operations. We realize QCAs on a dual-species Rydberg array of rubidium and cesium atoms, leveraging independent global control of each species to perform a myriad of quantum protocols. With simple pulse sequences, we explore many-body dynamics and generate a variety of entangled states, including GHZ states, 96.7(1.7)%-fidelity Bell states, 17-qubit cluster states, and high-connectivity graph states. The versatility and scalability of QCAs offers compelling routes for scaling quantum information systems with global controls, as well as new perspectives on quantum many-body dynamics.</description>
