      <title>The interference and gravitational redshift effect of long waves passing a binary black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interference of electromagnetic long waves passing a binary black hole based on the approximate binary black hole metric. The interference pattern of long waves demonstrates strong contrast intensity and changes with respect to different wavelengths and incoming angles. A bright semicircular arc emerges from the interference pattern and bridges the two black holes when the binary black hole rotates to certain angle. The angular momentum of the binary black hole causes asymmetric gravitational redshift distribution along the relative position vector of the two black holes. The angular momentum of the binary black hole is measurable based on the interference pattern of long waves and gravitational redshift.</description>

      <title>Inspiral-inherited ringdown tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the late-time relaxation of a perturbed Schwarzschild black hole, driven by a source term representing an infalling particle in generic orbits. We consider quasi-circular and eccentric binaries, dynamical captures and radial infalls, with orbital dynamics driven by an highly accurate analytical radiation reaction. After reviewing the description of the late-time behaviour as an integral over the whole inspiral history, we derive an analytical expression exactly reproducing the slow relaxation observed in our numerical evolutions, obtained with a hyperboloidal compactified grid, for a given particle trajectory. We find this signal to be a superposition of an infinite number of power-laws, the slowest decaying term being Price's law. Next, we use our model to explain the several orders-of-magnitude enhancement of tail terms for binaries in non-circular orbits, shedding light on recent unexpected results obtained in numerical evolutions. In particular, we show the dominant terms controlling the enhancement to be activated when the particle is far from the BH, with small tangential and radial velocities soon before the plunge. As we corroborate with semi-analytical calculations, this implies that for large eccentricities the tail amplitude can be correctly extracted even when starting to evolve only from the last apastron before merger. We discuss the implications of these findings on the extraction of late-time tail terms in non-linear evolutions, and possible observational consequences. We also briefly comment on the scattering scenario, and on the connection with the soft graviton theorem.</description>

      <title>Junction conditions in a general field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known in the modified gravity scene that the calculation of junction conditions in certain complicated theories leads to ambiguities and conflicts between the various formulations. This paper introduces a general framework to compute junction conditions in any reasonable classical field theory and analyzes their properties. We prove that in any variational field theory, it is possible to define unambiguous and mathematically well-defined junction conditions either by interpreting the Euler-Lagrange differential equation as a distribution or as the extremals of a variational functional and these two coincide. We provide an example calculation which highlights why ambiguities in the existing formalisms have arisen, essentially due to incorrect usage of distributions. Relations between junction conditions, the boundary value problem of variational principles and Gibbons--Hawking--York-like surface terms are examined. The methods presented herein relies on the use of coordinates adapted to represent the junction surface as a leaf in a foliation and a technique for reducing the order of Lagrangians to the lowest possible in the foliation parameter. We expect that the reduction theorem can generate independent interest from the rest of the topics considered in the paper.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear electromagnetic generalization of the Kerr-Newman solution with cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the two exact solutions of the Einstein-Nonlinear electrodynamics equations that generalize the Kerr-Newman solution. We determined the generalized electromagnetic potentials using the alignment between the tetrad vectors of the metric and the eigenvectors of the electromagnetic field tensor. It turns out that there are only two possible nonlinear electromagnetic generalizations of the Kerr-Newman geometry, corresponding to different electromagnetic potentials. The new solutions possess horizons and satisfy physical energy conditions such that they can represent black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic charges, characterized by the parameters of mass, angular momentum, charge, and one nonlinear parameter; the nonlinear parameter resembles the effect of a cosmological constant, negative or positive, such that the solutions are asymptotically AdS or dS. The canonical form of the electromagnetic nonlinear energy-momentum tensor is analyzed in relation with the energy conditions; it is shown that the conformal symmetry is broken by the electromagnetic nonlinear matter; the corresponding nonlinear electromagnetic Lagrangian as a function of the coordinates is presented as well.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a Non-canonical $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work comprises a study of the thermodynamic behavior of modified $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity, which had been developed based on a non-canonical theory known as K-essence theory. In this development, we use the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) type of non-standard Lagrangian. We develop a modified first law and generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSLT) within the modified $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity, where we consider the background metric to be the usual Friedmann-Lema$\hat{\text{i}}$tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) type. A graphical analysis of surface gravity has been performed for the modified FLRW metric via the $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ theory, which is different from the usual FLRW gravity through the usual $f(R,T)$ gravity. In the study of the thermodynamic behavior of the cosmos, we use two distinct kinds of scale factors: exponential and power law. Through the investigation of the modified GSLT, we have seen that during the initial phase of the universe, the entropy's rate of change may be either negative or positive, contingent upon the value of the curvature constant. The negativity of the entropy change indicates that the modified GSLT is not feasible in that particular area for a particular curvature constant. These traits suggest that during the inflationary period, entropy might have been either negative or positive. It has also been seen that entropy saturates every curvature value at different time ranges, which indicates the heat death of the universe.</description>

      <title>Charged Wormhole Solutions in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17362v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we construct models of static wormholes within the framework of 4-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4D EGB) gravity an (an)isotropic energy momentum tensor (EMT) and a Maxwell field as supporting matters for the wormhole geometry assuming a constant redshift function. We obtain exact spherically symmetric wormhole solutions in 4D EGB gravity for an isotropic and anisotropic matter sources under the effect of electric charge. The solutions are more generalized in the sense of incorporating the charge contributions. Furthermore, we examine the null, weak and strong energy conditions at the wormhole throat of radius $r=r_{0}$. We demonstrate that at the wormhole throat, the classical energy conditions are violated by arbitrary small amount. Additionally, we analyze the wormhole geometry incorporating semiclassical corrections through embedding diagrams. We discover that the wormhole solutions are in equilibrium as the anisotropic and hydrostatic forces cancel each other.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravitomagnetic interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of linearized quantum gravity, we study the quantum gravitational interaction between two nonpointlike objects induced by fluctuating gravitomagnetic fields in vacuum. We find that, in addition to the quantum gravitational interaction induced by fluctuating gravitoelectric fields previously studied, there exists a quantum gravitomagnetic interaction. This interaction originates from the interaction between the instantaneous localized mass currents in nonpointlike objects induced by the fluctuating gravitomagnetic fields. Using fourth-order perturbation theory, we derive the explicit form of the quantum gravitomagnetic interaction energy, which shows an $r^{-10}$ dependence in the near regime and an $r^{-11}$ dependence in the far regime, where $r$ is the distance between the two objects. This interaction energy is expected to be significant when the gravitomagnetic polarizability of the objects is large.</description>

      <title>Space-time symmetry breaking on non-geodesic leaves and a new form of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the permanent damage caused by the historical breakdown of full diffeomorphism invariance induced by a foliation. We focus on the case where the foliation is allowed to be non-geodesic after the interactions with the foliation switch off. Gravity and other forms of matter recover full diffeomorphism invariance only at the expense of introducing a new matter-like component, carrying the non-vanishing Hamiltonian (and momentum) left over from the violating past interactions. This matter form must be stress-free in the preferred frame, the only way a matter action can mimic the evolution of the leftover Hamiltonian (and momentum) driven by the Dirac hypersurface deformation algebra. If the preferred frame is non-geodesic, then in the preferred frame the equivalent matter component must have energy and a momentum current, but still no spatial stresses: an unusual form of "matter". It is equivalent to a fluid with anisotropic stress in some regimes, reducing to dust in others, or even displaying completely new features in extreme situations. Its stress energy tensor is conserved. We provide two examples based on accelerated frames: Rindler space-time and the canonical Schwarzchild frame.</description>

      <title>GUP corrected black holes with cloud of string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate shadows, deflection angle, quasinormal modes (QNMs), and sparsity of Hawking radiation of the Schwarzschild string cloud black hole's solution after applying quantum corrections required by the Generalised Uncertainty Principle (GUP). First, we explore the shadow's behaviour in the presence of a string cloud using three alternative GUP frameworks: linear quadratic GUP (LQGUP), quadratic GUP (QGUP), and linear GUP. We then used the weak field limit approach to determine the effect of the string cloud and GUP parameters on the light deflection angle, with computation based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Next, to compute the quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild string clouds incorporating quantum correction with GUP, we determine the effective potentials generated by perturbing scalar, electromagnetic and fermionic fields, using the sixth-order WKB approach in conjunction with the appropriate numerical analysis. Our investigation indicates that string and linear GUP parameters have distinct and different effects on QNMs. We find that the greybody factor increases due to the presence of string cloud while the linear GUP parameter shows the opposite. We then examine the radiation spectrum and sparsity in the GUP corrected black hole with the cloud of string framework, which provides additional information about the thermal radiation released by black holes. Finally, our inquiries reveal that the influence of the string parameter and the quadratic GUP parameter on various astrophysical observables is comparable, however the impact of the linear GUP parameter is opposite.</description>

      <title>Circular motion in (anti-)de Sitter spacetime: thermality versus finite size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anti-de Sitter spacetime and the static patch of de Sitter spacetime are arenas for investigating thermal and finite-size effects seen by an accelerated quantum observer. We consider an Unruh-DeWitt detector in uniform circular motion coupled to a conformal scalar field in $(2+1)$-dimensional de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spacetimes in the limit of a small cosmological constant $\Lambda$. In anti-de Sitter spacetime, where $\Lambda$ mimics spatial confinement, we find that the resonance peaks in the detector's response closely match those of a detector in Minkowski space with a cylindrical boundary, but with curvature corrections, more significant when the field has an ambient temperature. In the static patch of de Sitter spacetime, in the Euclidean vacuum, we show that the leading curvature correction to the detector's response is proportional to $\Lambda$, as in zero temperature anti-de Sitter, whilst the temperature corrections decay exponentially as $\Lambda \to 0$.</description>

      <title>Violation of $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brans Class I solution in Brans-Dicke gravity is a staple in the study of gravitational theories beyond General Relativity. Discovered in 1961, it describes the exterior vacuum of a spherical Brans-Dicke star and is characterized by two adjustable parameters. Surprisingly, the relationship between these parameters and the properties of the star has not been rigorously established. In this Proceeding, we bridge this gap by deriving $\textit{the}$ complete exterior solution of Brans Class I, expressed in terms of the total energy and total pressure of the spherisymmetric gravity source. The solution allows for the $\textit{exact}$ derivation of $\textit{all}$ post-Newtonian parameters in Brans-Dicke gravity for far field regions of a spherical source. Particularly for the $\gamma$ parameter, instead of the conventional result $\gamma_{\,\text{PPN}}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,\text{exact}}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\,\Theta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\,\Theta}$ where $\Theta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_{\parallel}^{*}+2P_{\perp}^{*}$ and total energy $E^{*}$ contained within the mass source. Our $\textit{non-perturbative}$ $\gamma$ formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. Consequently, observational constraints on $\gamma$ thus set $\textit{joint}$ bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of the mass source. More broadly, our formula highlights the importance of pressure (when $\varTheta\neq0$) in spherical Brans-Dicke stars, and potentially in stars within other modified theories of gravitation.</description>

      <title>Cosmic twins are likely rare: exploring pathways to hadron-quark stars with the same mass as neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A viable model for the dense matter equation of state above the nuclear saturation density is a hadron-to-quark phase transition at densities relevant to compact objects. In this case, stable hybrid hadron-quark stars can arise. An even more interesting scenario is one where the hadron-to-quark phase transition results in the emergence of a third branch of stable compact objects (in addition to white dwarfs and neutron stars). Inherent to the presence of a third family of compact stars is the existence of twin stars -- hybrid stars with the same mass as the corresponding neutron stars, but with smaller radii. Interestingly, the neutron star-twin star scenario is consistent with GW170817. If twin stars exist in nature, it raises a question about the mechanism that leads to their formation. Here, we explore gravitational collapse as a pathway to the formation of low-mass twin stars. We perform fully general relativistic simulations of the collapse of a stellar iron core, modeled as a cold degenerate gas, to investigate whether the end product is a neutron star or a twin star. Our simulations show that even with unrealistically large perturbations in the initial conditions, the core bounces well below the hadron-to-quark phase transition density, if the initial total rest mass is in the twin star range. Following cooling, these configurations produce neutron stars. We find that twin stars can potentially form due to mass loss, e.g., through winds, from a slightly more massive hybrid star that was initially produced in the collapse of a more massive core or if the maximum NS mass is below the Chandrasekhar mass limit. The challenge in producing twin stars in gravitational collapse, in conjunction with the fine tuning required because of their narrow mass range, suggest the rarity of twin stars in nature.</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the direct detection of stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal compared to a single-mode detector, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>The distribution of the gravitational-wave background from supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations spurred a variety of questions regarding the origin of the signal and the properties of its sources. The amplitude of a GW background produced by inspiralling supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be predicted in a relatively robust manner from the present-day merged remnants, observed as single SMBHs at the centers of galaxies, but falls short of the signal measured by PTAs by a significant amount, requiring equal mass mergers, extremely short delay times, and no accretion in order to achieve a modest consistency. In this work, we revisit NANOGrav's 15-yr data set and reassess the aforementioned discrepancy using the full spectral information captured by PTA data. As previously noted in the literature, the discrete number of point sources contributing to the background may lead to deviations in the observed spectrum relative to the average ($h^2_c \propto f^{-4/3}$) due to Poisson fluctuations, providing additional information about the source population beyond the background amplitude. We derive a simple expression for the characteristic strain distribution given a SMBH model, which is generally applicable regardless of the method used to model the black hole population. We then refit the NANOGrav free spectrum using a minimal model based on the local mass function, showing that the current GW measurement requires roughly $\sim 10$ times more black holes than suggested by local observations and disfavors mass functions dominated by few very heavy sources, with the typical mass that contributes to the background $\lesssim 10^{10}M_{\odot}$. Given the range of SMBH models found to be consistent with the isotropic background, we address what is the typical number sources that would be individually detectable, given the current sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of ultralight bosons around compact objects: in-medium suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixing between ultralight bosons and the Standard Model photon may allow access to the hitherto invisible Universe. In the presence of plasma, photons are dressed with an effective mass which will influence the conversion between the two. We study this phenomenon, known as in-medium suppression, in the context of black hole physics. We consider both axion-photon mixing around charged black holes and dark photon-photon mixing around neutral black holes. We find that the presence of plasma indeed influences the conversion rate, possibly quenching it altogether for large plasma densities, and discuss implications for superradiance and observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Analytic bounds on late-time axion-scalar cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological dynamics of multiple scalar/pseudoscalar fields are difficult to solve, especially when the field-space metric is curved. This presents a challenge in determining whether a given model can support cosmic acceleration, without solving for the on-shell solution. In this work, we present bounds on late-time FLRW-cosmologies in classes of theories that involve arbitrary numbers of scalar and pseudoscalar fields coupled both kinetically (leading to a curved field space metric) and through scalar potentials. Such bounds are proven analytically, independently of initial conditions, with no approximation in the field equations and without referring to explicit solutions. Besides their broad applications to cosmological model building, our bounds can be applied to studying asymptotic cosmologies of certain classes of string compactifications.</description>

      <title>A New Gravitational Wave Probe to the Nature of Dark Energy from the Aging of the Universe: Can Future Detectors Achieve it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most dominant energy budget of the Universe is Dark Energy, which remains enigmatic since the claim of its existence from the observation of late-time cosmic acceleration. We propose a new way of inferring this by measuring the aging of the Universe using only gravitational wave (GW) signals from coalescing binary compact objects of any masses. We show that the aging of the Universe will lead to a change in the observed chirp mass of the GW sources inferred from different stages of its coalesces by monitoring a coherent source from two far-apart GW frequencies for a few years. We show that coordinated GW detectors which can reach a relative uncertainty on chirp mass measurement of about $10^{-9}$, can measure a tiny departure of about $2\%$ from the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0=-1$ and its variation with cosmic time by using stellar origin binary black holes up to redshift $z=5$ in 10 years of observation time without using any external calibrator. If the next generation of GW detectors can achieve this precision, then it can open a new window to discover the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Revisiting evolution of domain walls and their gravitational radiation with CosmoLattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing the publicly available CosmoLattice code, we conduct numerical simulations of a domain wall network and the resulting gravitational waves (GWs) in a radiation-dominated Universe in the $Z_2$-symmetric scalar field model. In particular, the domain wall evolution is investigated in detail both before and after reaching the scaling regime, using the combination of numerical and theoretical methods. We demonstrate that the total area of closed walls is negligible compared to that of a single long wall stretching throughout the simulation box. Therefore, the closed walls are unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall network evolution. This is in contrast with the case of cosmic strings, where formation of loops is crucial for maintaining the system in the scaling regime. To obtain the GW spectrum, we develop a technique that separates physical effects from numerical artefacts arising due to finite box size and non-zero lattice spacing. Our results on the GW spectrum agree well with Refs. [29, 30], which use different codes. Notably, we observe a peak at the Hubble scale, an exponential falloff at scales shorter than the wall width, and a plateau/bump at intermediate scales. We also study sensitivity of obtained results on the choice of initial conditions. We find that different types of initial conditions lead to qualitatively similar domain wall evolution in the scaling regime, but with important variations translating into different intensities of GWs.</description>

      <title>Correlators of Worldline Proper Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical observer can measure elapsed proper time along their worldline. When observers are coupled to a system with internal correlations, measurements of elapsed time may inherit these correlations. We show that derivatives of the on-shell action with respect to worldline mass compute correlation functions of worldline proper length at tree level. We study worldlines coupled to a scalar field. We calculate the length-length two-point function and find it arises from correlated path fluctuations. As an application, we propose that the logarithm of local correlators serves as a generating function of length correlators, which generalizes the on-shell action prescription. Using this proposal, we extract AdS worldline observables from local CFT correlators as computed by Witten diagrams. We briefly discuss extensions to gravity, interferometers, and the holographic encoding of observer time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a classical two-dimensional bi-scalar gravity based on the Kaluza-Klein reduction applied to the four-dimensional Horndeski theory. One of the scalar fields arises from the original four-dimensional theory, while the extra scalar emerges from the reduction process. We also introduce a two-dimensional bi-scalar identity that allows for a more concise and elegant reformulation of the resulting bi-scalar Lagrangian. Additionally, we study the linear perturbations around a static background to demonstrate that the bi-scalar theory may support a single healthy propagating mode. Furthermore, by restricting the scalar fields, we investigate a general single scalar theory that is identical to the two-dimensional Horndeski theory up to a boundary term. Our results provide a framework to map a generic two-dimensional dilaton gravity into four-dimensional Horndeski theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium production of non-minimally coupled self-interacting scalar dark matter during reheating using classical lattice simulations. The outcomes of the classical simulations are in qualitative agreement with the previous results obtained using the quantum 2PI approach in the Hartree truncation. In particular, the novel non-linear resonance found in the 2PI Hartee study is present also in the classical lattice simulations and can dominate the final dark matter yield. For the parameters considered, the difference in final value of the scalar two-point function between the two approaches is a factor of O(1).</description>

Abstract: I consider the classical (i.e., non-relativistic) limit of Teleparallel Gravity, a relativistic theory of gravity that is empirically equivalent to General Relativity and features torsional forces. I show that as the speed of light is allowed to become infinite, Teleparallel Gravity reduces to Newtonian Gravity without torsion. I compare these results to the torsion-free context and discuss their implications on the purported underdetermination between Teleparallel Gravity and General Relativity. I conclude by considering alternative approaches to the classical limit developed in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Computation of spin-resummed observables in post-Minkowskian dynamics typically involve evaluation of Feynman integrals deformed by an exponential factor, where the exponent is a linear sum of the momenta being integrated. Such integrals can be viewed as tensor integral generating functions, which provide alternative approaches to tensor reduction of Feynman integrals. We develop a systematic method to evaluate tensor integral generating functions using conventional multiloop integration techniques. The spin-resummed aligned-spin eikonal at second post-Minkowskian order is considered as a phenomenologically relevant example where evaluation of tensor integral generating functions is necessary.</description>

Abstract: The successful observation of gravitational waves has provided humanity with an additional method to explore the universe, particularly black holes. In this study, we utilize data from LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave observations to test the first law of black hole mechanics, employing two different approaches. We consider the secondary compact object as a perturbation to the primary black hole before the merger, and the remnant black hole as a stationary black hole after the merger. In the pre-merger and post-merger analysis, our results demonstrate consistency with the first law, with an error level of approximate 25% at a 68% credibility level for GW190403 051519. In the full inspiral-merger-ringdown analysis, our results show consistency with the first law of black hole mechanics, with an error level of about 6% at a 68% credibility level and 10% at a 95% credibility level for GW191219 163120. Additionally, we observe that the higher the mass ratio of the gravitational wave source, the more consistent our results are with the first law of black hole mechanics. Overall, our study sheds light on the nature of compact binary coalescence and their implications for black hole mechanics.</description>

      <title>Quantum geodesics reflecting the internal structure of stars composed of shells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general relativity, an external observer cannot distinguish distinct internal structures between two spherically symmetric stars that have the same total mass $M$. However, when quantum corrections are taken into account, the external metrics of the stars will receive quantum corrections depending on their internal structures. In this paper, we obtain the quantum-corrected metrics at linear order in curvature for two spherically symmetric shells characterized by different internal structures: one with an empty interior and the other with $N$ internal shells. The dependence on the internal structures in the corrected metrics tells us that geodesics on these backgrounds would be deformed according to the internal structures. We conduct numerical computations to find out the angle of geodesic precession and show that the presence of internal structures amplifies the precession angle reflecting the discrepancy between the radial and orbital periods within the geodesic orbit. The amount of the precession angle increases monotonically as the number of internal shells increases and it eventually converges to a certain value for $N \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Axion dark matter with not quite black hole domination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of an early cosmological period dominated by primordial 2-2-holes on axion dark matter. The 2-2-holes emerge as a new family of horizonless classical solutions for ultracompact matter distributions in quadratic gravity, a candidate theory of quantum gravity. Thermal 2-2-holes, sourced by relativistic thermal gas, exhibit Hawking-like radiation and fulfill the entropy-area law before they become remnants with almost no radiation. In this paper, we consider the remnant contribution to dark matter (DM) small and adopt the axion DM scenario by the misalignment mechanism. We show that a 2-2-hole domination phase in the evolution of the universe changes the axion mass window obtained from the dark matter abundance constraints. The biggest effect occurs when the remnants have the Planck mass, which is the case for a strongly coupled quantum gravity. The change in abundance constraints for the Planck mass 2-2-hole remnants amounts to that of the primordial black hole (PBH) counterpart. Therefore, since we use the revised constraints from gravitational waves on the initial fraction of 2-2-holes, the results here can also be considered the updated version of the PBH case. As a result, the lower limit on the axion mass is found as $m_a \sim10^{-9}$ eV. Furthermore, the domination scenario itself constrains the remnant mass $ M_{\mathrm{min}}$ considerably. Given that we focus on the pre-BBN domination scenario in order not to interfere with BBN (Big Bang nucleosynthesis) constraints, the remnant mass window becomes $m_{\mathrm{Pl}} \lesssim M_{\mathrm{min}} \lesssim 0.1\;\rm{g}$.</description>

Abstract: Since the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture was proposed, research on this conjecture has been ongoing. This paper explores the conjecture in black holes that are closer to those existing in the real universe (i.e., rotating black holes enveloped by dark matter). We conduct our study by introducing a test particle and a scalar field into the black hole. Our conclusions show that, in extremal case, both a test particle and a scalar field can disrupt the event horizon of the Kerr-like black hole; in near-extremal case, both a test particle and a scalar field can disrupt the event horizon of the Kerr-like black hole. When cold dark matter is not considered, neither a test particle nor a scalar field can cause a Kerr black hole to overspin, whether in extremal or near-extremal case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the behavior of compact stars within the framework of $f(R,L_m,T)$ gravity, focusing on the functional form $f(R,L_m,T) = R + \alpha TL_m$. The modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations are derived and numerically solved for several values of the free parameter $\alpha$ by considering both quark and hadronic matter -- described by realistic equations of state (EoSs). Furthermore, the stellar structure equations are adapted for two different choices of the matter Lagrangian density (namely, $L_m= p$ and $L_m= -\rho$), laying the groundwork for our numerical analysis. As expected, we recover the traditional TOV equations in General Relativity (GR) when $\alpha \rightarrow 0$. Remarkably, we found that the two choices for $L_m$ have appreciably different effects on the mass-radius diagrams. Results showcase the impact of $\alpha$ on compact star properties, while final remarks summarize key findings and discuss implications, including compatibility with observational data from NGC 6397's neutron star. Overall, this research enhances comprehension of $f(R,L_m,T)$ gravity's effects on compact star internal structures, offering insights for future investigations.</description>

Abstract: Time delay interferometry (TDI) is a key technique employed in gravitational wave (GW) space missions to mitigate laser frequency noise by combining multiple laser links and establishing an equivalent equal arm interferometry. The null frequencies will be introduced in noise spectra and GW response when the periodical signal/noise is canceled in synthesized laser links. These frequencies are characteristic frequencies (CFs) of a TDI which related to its geometry of combination. In this work, we implement a second-generation TDI configuration referred to as hybrid Relay to perform noise suppressions and data analysis, whose CFs are only one-quarter that of the fiducial second-generation Michelson observables. We examine the performance of TDI configuration in laser noise cancellation and clock noise suppression and justify its essential capabilities. To assess its robustness for signal extraction, we simulate data containing GW signals from massive black hole binaries and perform parameter inferences with comparisons against the fiducial Michelson TDI configuration. The results demonstrate that the alternative TDI solution could be more robust than Michelson in fulfilling data analysis.</description>

      <title>A novel signal-consistency test for gravitational-wave searches of generic black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel signal-consistency test applicable to a broad search for gravitational waves emitted by generic binary black hole (BBH) systems. The test generalizes the time domain $\xi^2$ signal-consistency test currently utilized by the GstLAL pipeline, which quantifies the discrepancy between the expected signal-to-noise ratio timeseries with the measured one. While the traditional test is restricted to aligned-spin circular orbits and does not account for higher-order modes (HMs), our test does not make any assumption on the nature of the signal. After addressing the mathematical details of the new test, we quantify its advantages in the context of searching for precessing BBHs and/or BBHs with HM content. Our results reveal that for precessing signals, the new test is optimal and has the potential to reduce the values of the $\xi^2$ statistics by up to two orders of magnitude when compared to the standard test. However, in the case of signals with HM content, only a modest enhancement is observed. Recognizing the computational burden associated with the new test, we also derive an approximated signal-consistency test. This approximation maintains the same computational cost as the standard test and can be easily implemented in any matched filtering pipeline with minimal changes, sacrificing only a few percent of accuracy in the low SNR regime. However in the high SNR regime the approximated signal consistency test does not bring any improvement as compared to the "standard" one. By introducing our new test and its approximation and understanding their validity and limitation, this work will benefit any matched-filtering pipeline aimed at searching for BBH signals with strong precession and/or HM content.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), if they exist, may collide with and be captured by neutron stars. We adopt a relativistic point-mass approximation to study this capture, the subsequent confinement of the PBH of mass $m$ inside the neutron star of mass $M_* \gg m$, and the PBH's growth by accretion of stellar material. Building on earlier treatments we systematically study the capture, confinement, and accretion process, characterize the emitted quasiperiodic continuous gravitational-wave signal, track the evolution of the PBH's orbital parameters, and compare the effects of different choices for the prescription of the dissipative forces. Our point-mass treatment here is applicable in the limit of small PBH masses, for which its effects on the neutron star can be ignored.</description>

      <title>Black Hole shadows of $\alpha'$-corrected black holes</title>

Abstract: In this paper we study the qualitative features induces by corrections to GR coming from String Theory, on the shadows of rotating black holes. We deal with the slowly rotating black hole solutions up to order $\mathcal{O}(a^3)$, to first order in $\alpha'$, including also the dilaton. We provide a detailed characterization of the geometry, as well as the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and photon ring, and then we proceed to obtain the black hole images within the relativistic thin-disk model. We characterize the images by computing the diameter, displacement and asymmetry. A comparison with the Kerr case, indicates that all these quantities grow due to the $\alpha'$ correction, and that the departure from GR for different observable is enhanced depending on the angle of view, namely for the diameter the maximum departure is obtained when the system is face-on, while for the displacement and asymmetry the departure from GR is maximized for edge-on point of view.</description>

      <title>Simulations of gravitational collapse in null coordinates: I. Formulation and weak-field tests in generalised Bondi gauges</title>

Abstract: We present a code for numerical simulations of the collapse of regular initial data to a black hole in null coordinates. We restrict to twist-free axisymmetry with scalar field matter. Our coordinates are $(u,x,y,\varphi)$, where the retarded time $u$ labels outgoing null cones emerging from a regular central worldline, the angles $(\theta,\varphi)$ label the null generators of each null cone, and the radial coordinate $x$ labels points along these generators. We focus on a class of generalised Bondi radial coordinates $x$ with the twin properties that $x=0$ is the central world line and that the numerical domain $(u\ge0$, $0\le x\le x_\text{max})$ is a subset of the domain of dependence of the initial data on $(u=0$, $0\le x\le x_\text{max}$). In critical collapse, an appropriate choice of these coordinates can be made to zoom in on the accumulation point of scale echos of the critical solution, without the need for explicit mesh refinement. We introduce a novel numerical scheme that in effect reduces the angular resolution at small radius, such that the time step $\Delta u$ for an explicit numerical scheme is limited by the radial resolution $\Delta x$, rather than $\Delta x(\Delta\theta)^2$. We present convergence tests in the weak-field regime, where we have exact solutions to the linearised scalar and gravitational-wave equations.</description>

      <title>Maximal hypersurfaces and aspects of volume of the Kerr family of black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Schwarzschild spacetime, Reinhart (1973) has shown the hypersurface $r_R = 3M/2$ (the subscript stands for "Reinhart") to be a maximal hypersurface. This Reinhart radius $r_R$ plays a crucial role in evaluating the interior volume of a black hole. In this article, we find such a maximal hypersurface for the Kerr and Kerr-Newaman black holes. We obtain the analytical expression for the Reinhart radius as a function of the polar angle $\theta$ for a small $a/M$ limit for both the Kerr and Kerr-Newman black holes. We obtain the Reinhart radius using two independent methods: a) the vanishing trace of the extrinsic curvature, and b) the variational method. We further use the Reinhart radius to obtain an analytical expression for the interior volume of the Kerr and Kerr-Newman black hole in the small $a/M$ limit and a generic charge $Q$. We define $\mathcal{\dot{V}}$ as the rate of change of the interior volume with respect to the ingoing null coordinate $v$ and then study its behavior under various scenarios, viz., particle accretion, the Penrose process, superradiance, and Hawking radiation. We show that while under the Penrose process and superradiance, the parameter $\mathcal{\dot{V}}$ increases just as the area of a black hole but under particle accretion, $\mathcal{\dot{V}}$ can have variable signs depending on the kinematical properties of the particle. We further probe into the behavior of $\mathcal{\dot{V}}$ under Hawking radiation. These results provide important and very interesting clues toward the possible existence of laws governing the volume of black holes.</description>

      <title>Simulations of gravitational collapse in null coordinates: II. Critical collapse of an axisymmetric scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first numerical simulations in null coordinates of the collapse of nonspherical regular initial data to a black hole. We restrict to twist-free axisymmetry, and re-investigate the critical collapse of a non-spherical massless scalar field. We find that the Choptuik solution governing scalar field critical collapse in spherical symmetry persists when fine-tuning moderately non-spherical initial data to the threshold of black hole formation. The non-sphericity evolves as an almost-linear perturbation until the end of the self-similar phase, and becomes dominant only in the final collapse to a black hole. We compare with numerical results of Choptuik et al, Baumgarte, and Marouda et al, and conclude that they have been able to evolve somewhat more non-spherical solutions. Future work with larger deviations from spherical symmetry, and in particular vacuum collapse, will require a different choice of radial coordinate that allows the null generators to reconverge locally.</description>

      <title>Simulations of gravitational collapse in null coordinates: III. Hyperbolicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness of the characteristic initial-boundary value problem for the Einstein equations in Bondi-like coordinates (including Bondi, double-null and affine). We propose a definition of strong hyperbolicity of a system of partial differential equations of any order, and show that the Einstein equations in Bondi-like coordinates in their second-order form used in numerical relativity do not meet it, in agreement with results of Giannakopoulos et al for specific first-order reductions. In the principal part, frozen coefficient approximation that one uses to examine hyperbolicity, we explicitly construct the general solution to identify the solutions that obstruct strong hyperbolicity. Independently, we present a first-order symmetric hyperbolic formulation of the Einstein equations in Bondi gauge, linearised about Schwarzschild, thus completing work by Frittelli. This establishes an energy norm ($L^2$ in the metric perturbations and selected first and second derivatives), in which the initial-boundary value problem, with initial data on an outgoing null cone and boundary data on a timelike cylinder or an ingoing null cone, is well-posed, thus verifying a conjecture by Giannakopoulos et al. Unfortunately, our method does not extend to the pure initial-value problem on a null cone with regular vertex.</description>

      <title>Using shadow of black hole to examine the energy exchange between axion matter and rotating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that a \textit{slowly} rotating axion-modified black hole resulting from the backreaction of an axion field on a rotating Kerr black hole can have a \textit{D-shaped} shadow as that for a \textit{highly} counter-rotating Kerr black hole. This attributes to the fact that the energy exchange between the axion matter and the black hole influences the rotation of the black hole, so the black hole angular momentum first decreases to zero and then the black hole starts to rotate to the opposite direction. Further increasing the coupling leads to \textit{``human-face-like" shaped} shadows and new lensing due to the chaotic scattering, which are novel and drastically different from Kerr black hole. Our analysis provides the first counterexample to that slowly rotating black hole has nearly circular shadow.</description>

      <title>Distribution of orbital inclinations for tidal disruption events by Kerr black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kerr metric that describes the spacetime of a spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH) is axisymmetric, implying that the nearly parabolic geodesics on which stars approach the SMBH depend on the inclination angle $\iota$ of the orbital angular momentum with respect to the SMBH spin. This inclination affects both the geodesic deviation that determines whether a star is tidally disrupted and whether the tidal debris survives direct capture by the event horizon to produce an observable tidal disruption event (TDE). The steady-state TDE rate is the rate at which stars are scattered into the loss cone determined by these spin- and inclination-dependent effects. As the anisotropy of this loss-cone refilling is highly uncertain, we consider the two extreme limits in which stellar inclination is preserved (IP) or isotropized (ISO). We calculate the inclination distribution in these two limits and find a prograde bias in the IP limit because of the strong retrograde bias for direct capture. However, we find a retrograde bias in the ISO limit for intermediate SMBH masses when the empty loss cone suppresses capture and allows the weaker retrograde bias of geodesic deviation to dominate. Partially empty loss cones lead to steeper distributions of the penetration factor $\beta$ than for a full loss cone, with this effect even more pronounced in the ISO limit. We also calculate the total TDE rates and maximum SMBH mass $M_{\rm \bullet, max}$ for tidal disruption in these two limits. In the IP limit, we find a highly spin-dependent capture cutoff in the TDE rate and $M_{\rm \bullet, max} \approx 10^{8.45} M_\odot$ for maximal SMBH spin. In the ISO limit, we find a strong spin-dependent enhancement in the TDE rate at intermediate SMBH masses, a weakly spin-dependent capture cutoff above $M_\bullet \approx 10^{7.5} M_\odot$, and $M_{\rm \bullet, max} \approx 10^{7.95} M_\odot$ for maximal SMBH spin.</description>

      <title>The second data release from the European Pulsar Timing Array V. Search for continuous gravitational wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16226v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for continuous gravitational wave signals (CGWs) in the second data release (DR2) of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) collaboration. The most significant candidate event from this search has a gravitational wave frequency of 4-5 nHz. Such a signal could be generated by a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) in the local Universe. We present the results of a follow-up analysis of this candidate using both Bayesian and frequentist methods. The Bayesian analysis gives a Bayes factor of 4 in favor of the presence of the CGW over a common uncorrelated noise process, while the frequentist analysis estimates the p-value of the candidate to be 1%, also assuming the presence of common uncorrelated red noise. However, comparing a model that includes both a CGW and a gravitational wave background (GWB) to a GWB only, the Bayes factor in favour of the CGW model is only 0.7. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the origin of the observed feature, but we cannot rule it out as a CGW source. We present results of simulations that demonstrate that data containing a weak gravitational wave background can be misinterpreted as data including a CGW and vice versa, providing two plausible explanations of the EPTA DR2 data. Further investigations combining data from all PTA collaborations will be needed to reveal the true origin of this feature.</description>

Abstract: Three major misconceptions concerning quantized tachyon fields: the energy spectrum unbounded from below, the frame-dependent and unstable vacuum state, and the non-covariant commutation rules, are shown to be a result of misrepresenting the Lorentz group in a too small Hilbert space. By doubling this space we establish an explicitly covariant framework that allows for the proper quantization of the tachyon fields eliminating all of these issues. Our scheme that is derived to maintain the relativistic covariance also singles out the two-state formalism developed by Aharonov et al. [1] as a preferred interpretation of the quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conventional background solution for the evolution of a single canonical inflaton field performs admirably in extreme scenarios such as the slow-roll phase (where the slow-roll parameter is much less than one) and the deep reheating era (where the Hubble parameter is much smaller than the effective mass of the potential and the field oscillates around the minimum of the potential), but fails to accurately depict the dynamics of the Universe around the end of inflation and the initial oscillatory phases. This article proposes a single, unified, model-independent, parametrized analytical solution for such models that bridges the gap between these two extremes, providing a near-accurate comprehensive description of the evolution of the Universe. This novel strategy has the potential to substantially enhance both quantitative and qualitative cosmological observational predictions, and, as a consequence, can further constrain the inflationary models more effectively using future observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a regular bound state of two extremal black holes in type IIB supergravity with opposite charges. The bound state resembles the Schwarzschild black hole from the asymptotics to the photon ring and has the same mass and charges as the Schwarzschild black hole. On the one hand, we show that the bound-state entropy admits a microscopic description in terms of branes and antibranes in string theory. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the entropy approaches half of the Schwarzschild entropy as the mass becomes significantly larger than the Kaluza-Klein scales used to regularize the geometry. This opens up the possibility of a brane/antibrane interpretation of the Schwarzschild entropy in string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines five models derived from the Pacif parametrization scheme of the Hubble parameter ($H$), yielding various linear to quintic forms of the deceleration parameter (DP). Our goal is to explore the impact of these DP variations on late-time evolution and their potential to alleviate cosmological tensions. To enhance model constraints, we introduce non-diagonal elements into the covariance matrix to better capture statistical properties by simulating data point correlations. We also test the sensitivity of $H_{0}$ and $r_{d}$ to the Pacif parametrization scheme, treating the sound horizon $r_{d}$ as a free parameter to avoid imposing a CMB prior. This allows late-time data to constrain $r_{d}$ alongside other cosmological parameters, incorporating recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements and Hubble data from Cosmic Chronometers Methods, Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and Quasars over a redshift range of \(0.106 &lt; z &lt; 2.33\). Our analysis provides optimal fit values for $H_{0}$ and $r_{d}$, showing notable consistency with Planck CMB data. By using the Akaike information criterion, we analyze the models and conclude that all models have good agreement with the most recent observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multifield dark energy model with a nonflat field-space metric, in which one field is dynamical while the others have constant spatial gradients. The model is predictive at the background level, leading to an early dark energy component at high redshifts and a suppressed fraction of late-time anisotropy. Both features have simple expressions in terms of the curvature scale of the field-space, and correspond to stable points in the phase space of possible solutions. Because of the coupling between time and space-dependent scalar fields, vector field perturbations develop tachyonic instabilities at scales below the Hubble radius, thus being potentially observable in the number count of galaxies. Overall, the presence of a nontrivial field-space curvature also leads to the appearance of instabilities on scalar perturbations, which can impact the matter density distribution at large scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coalescing massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) are one of primary sources for space-based gravitational wave (GW) observations. The mergers of these binaries are expected to give rise to detectable electromagnetic (EM) emissions with a narrow time window. The premerger detection of GW signals is vital for follow-up EM observations. The conventional approach for searching GW signals involves high computational costs. In this study, we present a deep learning model to search for GW signals from MBHBs. Our model is able to process 4.7 days of simulated data within 0.01 seconds and detect GW signals several hours to days before the final merger. The model provides the possibility of the coincident GW and EM detection of MBHBs.</description>

Abstract: The recent result of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in combination with other cosmological data shows evidence of the evolving dark energy parameterized by $w_0w_a$CDM model. We interpret this result in terms of a quintessential scalar field and demonstrate that it can explain the DESI result even though it becomes eventually phantom in the past. Relaxing the assumption on the functional form of the equation-of-state parameter $w=w(a)$, we also discuss a more realistic quintessential model. The implications of the DESI result for Swampland conjectures, cosmic birefringence, and the fate of the Universe are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Note on holographic torus stress tensor correlators in $AdS_3$ gravity</title>

Abstract: In the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ framework, the Euclidean BTZ black hole corresponds to the dominant high-temperature phase of its dual field theory. We initially employ perturbative methods to solve the Einstein equations as boundary value problems, providing correlators for the energy-momentum tensor operator at low points. Utilizing operator equations established in our previous work, we further compute arbitrary high-point correlators for the energy-momentum tensor operator in the high-temperature phase and recursive relations for these high-point functions. Concurrently, we employ the Chern-Simons formalism to derive consistent results. Further, using the cut-off AdS/$T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT duality, we calculate the energy-momentum tensor correlators, contributing to the comprehensive understanding of the system's dynamics. Finally, stress tensor correlators enable us to ascertain the corresponding KdV operator correlators at low-temperature.</description>

      <title>New construction of a vacuum doubly rotating black ring by the Ehlers transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Ehlers transformation, we derive an exact solution for a doubly rotating black ring in five-dimensional vacuum Einstein theory. It is well-known that the vacuum Einstein theory with three commuting Killing vector fields can be reduced to a non-linear sigma model with $SL(3,{\mathbb R})$ target space symmetry. As shown previously by Giusto and Saxena, the $SO(2,1)$ subgroup in the $SL(3,{\mathbb R})$ can generate a rotating solution from a static solution while preserving asymptotic flatness. This so-called Ehlers transformation actually transforms the five-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole into the five-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole. However, unlike the case with the black hole, applying this method directly to the static black ring or the Emparan-Reall black ring, does not yield a regular rotating black ring due to the emergence of a Dirac-Misner string singularity. To solve this undesirable issue, we use a singular vacuum solution of a rotating black ring/lens that already possesses a Dirac-Misner string singularity as the seed solution for the Ehlers transformation. The resulting solution is regular, indicating the absence of curvature singularities, conical singularities, orbifold singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and closed timelike curves both on and outside the horizon. We show that this solution obtained by the Ehlers transformation coincides precisely with the Pomeransky-Sen'kov solution. We expect that applying this method to other theories may lead to the finding of new exact solutions, such as solutions for black lenses and capped black holes, as well as black ring configurations.</description>
