      <title>Correlations among physical properties of pervious concrete with different aggregate sizes and mix proportions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permeable pavement material can benefit urban environment. Here in this work, different aggregate sizes and mix proportions were used to manufacture pervious pavement concrete and investigate correlations among its properties. The porosity, permeability, compressive strength, inner structure, thermal conductivity, and abrasion resistance of the specimens were obtained. Results showed lower aggregate-to-cement ratios and higher water-to-cement ratios led to porosity reduction, which decreased the permeability coefficient but increased the compressive strength, thermal conductivity, and abrasion resistance of the pervious concrete. Compared to the mixes, the aggregate sizes affected the physical properties of pervious concrete less. However, the sizes of pores and cement in the pervious concrete were more affected by aggregate sizes than by mixes. Moreover, the porosity, permeability coefficient, and compressive strength of the pervious concrete can be correlated by the power law, whereas the correlation between the porosity and abrasion resistance index can be fitted by a linear law.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometry-induced ferromagnetism in altermagnetic candidate MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of spintronics has seen a surge of interest in altermagnetism due to novel predictions and many possible applications. MnTe is a leading altermagnetic candidate that is of significant interest across spintronics due to its layered antiferromagnetic structure, high Neel temperature (TN ~ 310 K) and semiconducting properties. We present results on molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) grown MnTe/InP(111) films. Here, it is found that the electronic and magnetic properties are driven by the natural stoichiometry of MnTe. Electronic transport and in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy show the films are natively metallic with the Fermi level in the valence band and the band structure is in good agreement with first principles calculations for altermagnetic spin-splitting. Neutron diffraction confirms that the film is antiferromagnetic with planar anisotropy and polarized neutron reflectometry indicates weak ferromagnetism, which is linked to a slight Mn-richness that is intrinsic to the MBE grown samples. When combined with the anomalous Hall effect, this work shows that the electronic response is strongly affected by the ferromagnetic moment. Altogether, this highlights potential mechanisms for controlling altermagnetic ordering for diverse spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Considerations for extracting moir\'e-level strain from dark field intensities in transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bragg interferometry (BI) is an imaging technique based on four-dimensional scanning electron microscopy (4D-STEM) wherein the intensities of select overlapping Bragg disks are fit or more qualitatively analyzed in the context of simple trigonometric equations to determine local stacking order. In 4D-STEM based approaches, the collection of full diffraction patterns at each real-space position of the scanning probe allows the use of precise virtual apertures much smaller and more variable in shape than those used in conventional dark field imaging, such that even buried interfaces marginally twisted from other layers can be targeted. A coarse-grained form of dark field ptychography, BI uses simple physically derived fitting functions to extract the average structure within the illumination region and is therefore viable over large fields of view. BI has shown a particular advantage for selectively investigating the interlayer stacking and associated moir\'e reconstruction of bilayer interfaces within complex multi-layered structures. This has enabled investigation of reconstruction and substrate effects in bilayers through encapsulating hexagonal boron nitride and of select bilayer interfaces within trilayer stacks. However, the technique can be improved to provide a greater spatial resolution and probe a wider range of twisted structures, for which current limitations on acquisition parameters can lead to large illumination regions and the computationally involved post-processing can fail. Here we analyze these limitations and the computational processing in greater depth, presenting a few methods for improvement over previous works, discussing potential areas for further expansion, and illustrating the current capabilities of this approach for extracting moir\'e-scale strain.</description>

      <title>Electric leakage suppression of phase-transforming ferroelectrics with donor impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-transforming ferroelectric materials are widely used in energy harvesting and conversion devices. However, the functionality of these devices is significantly impeded by electrical leakage at high temperatures. In this study, we fundamentally study the mechanism of electrical leakage suppression due to phase transformation in a series of donor-doped ferroelectric oxides,Ba0.955Eu0.03Ti(1-x)ZrxO3 with 0&lt;= x&lt;= 0.15. Our experiments clearly demonstrate that the symmetry-breaking phase transformations result in the reduction in electrical conductivity of the donor-doped ferroelectric oxides. The DFT calculation suggests that the donor energy level undergoes a shallow-to-deep transition at the phase transformation temperature. By analyzing the constitutive model of the leakage current density function, we propose a leakage suppression coefficient that rationalizes the development of ferroelectrics with low electrical leakage at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Dielectric properties of a ferroelectric nematic material: quantitative test of the polarization-capacitance Goldstone mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered ferroelectric nematic (NF) liquid crystals (LC) have been reported to show an extraordinarily large value of the real part of the dielectric constant at low frequencies. However, it was argued by Clark et al in Physical Review Research 6, 013195 (2024) that what was measured was the capacitance of the insulating layer at LC/electrode surface and not that of the liquid crystal. Here we describe the results of dielectric spectroscopy measurements of an NF material in cells with variable thickness of the insulating layers. Our measurements quantitatively verify the model by Clark et al. Additionally, our measurements in cells with bare conducting indium tin oxide surface provide a crude estimate of epsilon perpendicular~100 in the NF phase.</description>

      <title>Iterative composition optimization in Fe$_2$VAl-based thin-film thermoelectrics using single-target sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetron sputtering inherently exhibits the advantage of dislodging particles from the target in a ratio equivalent to the target stoichiometry. Nevertheless, film compositions often deviate due to element-dependent scattering with the working gas, necessitating the adjustment of the sputtering process. In this work, we explore an unconventional approach of addressing this issue, involving the employment of an off-stoichiometric target. The required composition is obtained through an iterative process, which is demonstrated by Fe$_2$VAl and Fe$_2$V$_{0.9}$Ti$_{0.1}$Al films as case studies. Ultimately, the correct stoichiometry is obtained from Fe$_{1.86}$V$_{1.15}$Al$_{0.99}$ and Fe$_{1.88}$V$_{1.02}$Ti$_{0.13}$Al$_{0.97}$ targets, respectively. Despite the thermoelectric properties falling below expectations, mainly due to imperfect film crystallization, the strategy successfully achieved the desired stoichiometry, enabling accurate film synthesis without the need of advanced sputtering setups.</description>

      <title>Defects induce phase transition from dynamic to static rippling in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of graphene's remarkable properties are intrinsically linked to its inherent ripples. Defects, whether naturally present or artificially introduced, are known to have a strong impact on the rippling of graphene. However, how defects alter ripple dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) materials in general, and graphene in particular, remains largely unexplored. Here, using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal a fundamental connection between defect concentration and ripple dynamics in freestanding graphene sheets. Specifically, we find that at a critical concentration of approximately 0.1%, dynamic rippling undergoes a transition from freely propagating to static ripples. This is in quantitative alignment with the experimentally observed turning point in the non-monotonic scaling of the Young's modulus and emphasises the critical interplay between defects and material dynamics. Our work not only unveils the significant impact of defects on rippling dynamics in graphene but also paves the way to design two-dimensional devices with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>The origin of g $\approx$ 4 EPR line in magnetic nanocomposites: Manifestation of double quantum transitions in ferromagnetic granules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Films of metal-insulator nanogranular composites M$_x$D$_{100-x}$ with different compositions and atomic percentage of metal and dielectric phases (M = Fe, Co, Ni, CoFeB; D = Al$_2$O$_3$, SiO$_2$, ZrO$_2$; x $\approx$ 15-60 at.%) are investigated by electron magnetic resonance in a wide range of frequencies (f = 7-37 GHz) and temperatures (T = 4.2-360 K). At concentrations of the metallic ferromagnetic phase below the percolation threshold, the experimental spectra, besides the conventional ferromagnetic resonance signal, demonstrate an additional absorption peak characterized by a double effective g-factor g $\approx$ 4. The appearance of such a peak in the resonance spectra and its unusual properties are explained in the framework of the quantum mechanical "giant spin" model by the excitation of "forbidden" ("double quantum") transitions in magnetic nanogranules with a change of the spin projection $\Delta m = \pm2$.</description>

      <title>Embracing Nonlinearity and Geometry: A dimensional analysis guided design of shock absorbing materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protective applications require energy-absorbing materials that are soft and compressible enough to absorb kinetic energy from impacts, yet stiff enough to bear crushing loads. Achieving this balance requires careful consideration of both mechanical properties and geometric design. Conventional shock-absorbing pads are made of very thick foams that exhibit a plateau of constant stress in their stress-strain response. Contrary to this belief, we report that foams with a nonlinear stress-strain response can be useful to achieve simultaneously thin and lightweight protective pads. We introduce a new framework for the thickness or volume-constrained design of compact and lightweight protective foams while ensuring the desired structural integrity and mechanical performance. Our streamlined dimensional analysis approach provides geometric constraints on the dimensionless thickness and cross-sectional area of a protective foam with a given stress-strain response to limit the acceleration and compressive strain within desired critical limits. We also identify optimal mechanical properties that will result in the most compact and lightest protective foam layer for absorbing a given kinetic energy of impact. Guided by this design framework, we achieve optimal protective properties in hierarchically architected vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) foams, enabling next generation protective applications in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Designing Strain-less Electrode Materials: Computational Analysis of Volume Variations in Li-ion and Na-ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical degradation in electrode materials during successive electrochemical cycling is critical for battery lifetime and aging properties. A common strategy to mitigate electrode mechanical degradation is to suppress the volume variation induced by Li/Na intercalation/deintercalation, thereby designing strain-less electrodes. In this study, we investigate the electrochemically-induced volume variation in layered and spinel compounds used in Li-ion and Na-ion battery electrode materials through density functional theory computations. Specifically, we propose to decompose the volume variation into electronic, ionic, and structural contributions. Based on this analysis, we suggest methods to separately influence or control each contribution through strategies such as chemical substitution, doping, and polymorphism. Altogether, we conclude that volume variations can be controlled by designing either mechanically hard or compact electrode materials.</description>

      <title>Origin of the yield stress anomaly in L12 intermetallics unveiled with physically-informed machine-learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The yield stress anomaly of L12 intermetallics such as Ni3Al or Ni3Ga is controlled by the so-called Kear-Wilsdorf lock (KWL), of which the formation and unlocking are governed by dislocation cross-slip. Despite the importance of L12 intermetallics for strengthening Ni-based superalloys, microscopic understanding of the KWL is limited. Here, molecular dynamics simulations are conducted by employing a dedicated machine-learning interatomic potential derived via physically-informed active-learning. The potential facilitates modelling of the dislocation behavior in Ni3Al with near ab initio accuracy. KWL formation and unlocking are observed and analyzed. The unlocking stress demonstrates a pronounced temperature dependence, contradicting the assumptions of existing analytical models. A phenomenological model is proposed to effectively describe the atomistic unlocking stresses and extrapolate them to the macroscopic scale. The model is general and applicable to other L12 intermetallics. The acquired knowledge of KWLs provides a deeper understanding on the origin of the yield stress anomaly.</description>

      <title>Crystal Structure Prediction and Phase Stability in Highly Anharmonic Silver-Based Chalcohalide Anti-Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silver-based chalcohalide anti-perovskites (CAP), Ag$_{3}$BC (B = S, Se; C = Cl, Br, I), represent an emerging family of energy materials with intriguing optoelectronic, vibrational and ionic transport properties. However, the structural features and phase stability of CAP remain poorly investigated to date, hindering their fundamental understanding and potential integration into technological applications. Here we employ theoretical first-principles methods based on density functional theory to fill this knowledge gap. Through crystal structure prediction techniques, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and quasi-harmonic free energy calculations, we unveil a series of previously overlooked energetically competitive phases and temperature-induced phase transitions for all CAP. Specifically, we identify a new cubic $P2_{1}3$ structure as the stable phase of all CAP containing S both at zero temperature and $T \neq 0$ K conditions. Consequently, our calculations suggest that the cubic $Pm\overline{3}m$ phase identified in room-temperature X-ray diffraction experiments is likely to be metastable. Furthermore, for CAP containing Se, we propose different orthorhombic ($Pca2_{1}$ and $P2_{1}2_{1}2_{1}$) and cubic ($I2_{1}3$) structures as the ground-state phases and reveal several phase transformations induced by temperature. This theoretical investigation not only identifies new candidate ground-state phases and solid-solid phase transformations for all CAP but also provides insights into potential stability issues affecting these highly anharmonic superionic materials.</description>

      <title>Programmable Multi-responsive Nanocellulose-based Hydrogels with Embodied Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable materials are desirable for a variety of functional applications that range from biomedical devices, actuators and soft robots to adaptive surfaces and deployable structures. However, current smart materials are often designed to respond to single stimuli (like temperature, humidity, or light). Here, a novel multi-stimuli-responsive composite is fabricated using direct ink writing (DIW) to enable programmability in both space and time and computation of logic operations. The composite hydrogels consist of double-network matrices of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) or poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and sodium alginate (SA) and are reinforced by a high content of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) (14 wt%) and nanofibers (CNF) (1 wt%). These composites exhibit a simultaneously tunable response to external stimuli, such as temperature, pH, and ion concentration, enabling precise control over their swelling and shrinking behavior, shape, and mechanical properties over time. Bilayer hydrogel actuators are designed to display bidirectional bending in response to various stimuli scenarios. Finally, to leverage the multi-responsiveness and programmability of this new composite, Boolean algebra concepts are used to design and execute NOT, YES, OR, and AND logic gates, paving the way for self-actuating materials with embodied logic.</description>

      <title>Caloric properties of materials near a tricritical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mean-field study of caloric effects driven by primary and secondary fields near tricritical points, which are fields thermodynamically conjugated to the main and secondary order parameters, respectively. General features, such as critical exponents and their crossover from critical to tricritical behaviours, are studied by means of a generic free energy Landau expansion. To deal with specific materials, we propose a model that combines the Blume-Emery-Griffiths prototype to study tricritical points with the Bean-Rodbell approach to include magnetovolume effects. In this model the primary field is the magnetic field, while chemical and mechanical pressures are secondary fields. In spite of the scarcity of experimental data, we have shown that results for the La(Fe$_{x}$Si$_{1-x}$)$_{13}$ and MnSi compounds are in good agreement with our predictions. We expect that our results will motivate and guide new experimental research aiming at optimizing caloric materials.</description>

      <title>Universal Polar Instability In Highly Orthorhombic Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of novel multiferroic ABO$_3$ perovskites is complicated by the presence of necessary magnetic cations and ubiquitous antiferrodistortive modes, both of which suppress polar distortions. Using first-principles simulations, we observe that the existence of quadlinear and trilinear invariants in the free energy, coupling tilts and antipolar motions of the A and B sites to the polar mode, drives an avalanche-like transition to a non-centrosymmetric $Pna2_1$ symmetry in a wide range of magnetic perovskites with small tolerance factors - overcoming the above restrictions. We find that the $Pna2_1$ phase is especially favoured with tensile epitaxial strain, leading to an unexpected but technologically useful out-of-plane polarization. We use this mechanism to predict various novel multiferroics displaying interesting magnetoelectric properties with small polarization switching barriers.</description>

Abstract: Paramagnetic point defects in wide-bandgap semiconductors, characterized by atomic-like in-gap defect states, constitute a unique challenge for ab initio modeling. In this theoretical study, we aim to devise a wave-function only computational protocol, exemplified on the prominent nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which enables the full characterization of future quantum bit candidates implemented in color centers. We propose the application of the second order $n$-electron valence state perturbation theory on top of the complete active space self-consistent field approximation (CASSCF-NEVPT2) to provide a balanced ab initio level description of the correlation effects yielded from the defect orbitals and the embedding nanodiamond. By relaxing the molecular cluster under the compression of the surrounding bulk material, we manage to model both the vertical and relaxed experimental electronic spectra within an average error margin of 0.1 eV. Furthermore, the experimentally observed Jahn-Teller behavior of $^3E$ and $^1E$ states, the measured fine structure of the triplet electronic states, as well as the expected spin-selectivity are quantitatively reproduced by the presented methodology. Our findings showcase that using conventional wave-function-based quantum chemical approaches on carefully crafted cluster models can be a competing alternative for discussing the energetics of point defects in solids.</description>

      <title>Candidate platform for studying flatband-induced spin-triplet superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential for spin-triplet superconductivity in molecular beam epitaxy-grown IV-VI semiconductor superlattices. The findings present compelling evidence for spin-triplet pairing in PbTe/SnTe by the method of soft point-contact spectroscopy and spin-polarised point-contact spectroscopy. The experimental data are understood with the Anderson-Brinkman-Morel model of p-wave electron pairing. It is pointed out that emergent superconductivity can have its origin in topological flat bands obtained due to internal stresses of the sample similar to twisted layer graphene.</description>

      <title>Rheological properties of acid-induced carboxymethylcellulose hydrogels</title>

Abstract: Cellulose ethers represent a class of water-soluble polymers widely utilized across diverse sectors, spanning from healthcare to the construction industry. This experimental study specifically delves into aqueous suspensions of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a polymer that undergoes gel formation in acidic environments due to attractive interactions between hydrophobic patches along its molecular chain. We use rheometry to determine the linear viscoelastic properties of both CMC suspensions and acid-induced gels at various temperatures. Then, applying the time-temperature superposition principle, we construct master curves for the viscoelastic spectra, effectively described by fractional models. The horizontal shift factors exhibit an Arrhenius-like temperature dependence, allowing us to extract activation energies compatible with hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, we show that acid-induced CMC gels are physical gels that display a reversible yielding transition under external shear. In particular, we discuss the influence of pH on the non-linear viscoelastic response under large-amplitude oscillatory shear. Overall, our results offer a comprehensive description of the linear and non-linear rheological properties of a compelling case of physical hydrogel involving hydrophobic interactions.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Optical Control of Rashba Interactions in a TMDC Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spin relaxation dynamics of interlayer excitons in a MoSe2/MoS2 heterostructure induced by the Rashba effect. In such a system, Rashba interactions arise from an out-of-plane electric field due to photo-generated interlayer excitons inducing a phonon-assisted intravalley spin relaxation. We develop a theoretical description based on a microscopic approach to quantify the magnitude of Rashba interactions and test these predictions via time-resolved Kerr rotation measurements. In agreement with the calculations, we find that the Rashba-induced intravalley spin mixing becomes the dominating spin relaxation channel above T = 50 K. Our work identifies a previously unexplored spin-depolarization channel in heterostructures which can be used for ultrafast spin manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the physics of the strong-coupling Hubbard model in a kagome lattice ribbon under mechanical tension and half-filling. It is known that in the absence of strain, the lattice symmetry of the system and strong electronic interactions induce magnetic frustration. As uniaxial strain is applied, the ribbon exhibits various configurations with energy oscillations that depend on the direction of the strain axis. The ground states are obtained by density matrix enormalization group calculations. We find that the system is characterized by strong antiferromagnetic bonds distributed throughout the lattice along directions and patterns that depend on the strain directions and may coexist with easily polarizable sites that are only weakly correlated to their neighbors. We identify frustration and correlation measures that follow the strain and interaction dependence of the system well. These results illustrate that strain-dependent magnetic susceptibility could be explored experimentally to help probe the role of symmetry and interactions in these systems.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmion crystals are traditionally associated with non-centrosymmetric crystal structures; however, it has been demonstrated that skyrmion crystals can be stabilized by competing interactions in centrosymmetric crystals. To understand and optimize the physical responses associated with topologically-nontrivial skyrmion textures, it is important to quantify their magnetic interactions by comparing theoretical predictions with spectroscopic data. Here, we present neutron diffraction and spectroscopy data on the centrosymmetric skyrmion material GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, and show that the key spectroscopic features can be explained by the magnetic interactions calculated using density-functional theory calculations. We further show that the recently-proposed 2-$\mathbf{q}$ "topological spin stripe" structure yields better agreement with our data than a 1-$\mathbf{q}$ helical structure, and identify how the magnetic structure evolves with temperature.</description>

Abstract: We present a charge self-consistent density functional theory combined with the ghost-rotationally-invariant slave-boson (DFT+gRISB) formalism for studying correlated materials. This method is applied to SrVO$_3$ and NiO, representing prototypical correlated metals and charge-transfer insulators. For SrVO$_3$, we demonstrate that DFT+gRISB yields an accurate equilibrium volume and effective mass close to experimentally observed values. Regarding NiO, DFT+gRISB enables the simultaneous description of charge transfer and Mott-Hubbard bands, significantly enhancing the accuracy of the original DFT+RISB approach. Furthermore, the calculated equilibrium volume and spectral function reasonably agree with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>FlowMM: Generating Materials with Riemannian Flow Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystalline materials are a fundamental component in next-generation technologies, yet modeling their distribution presents unique computational challenges. Of the plausible arrangements of atoms in a periodic lattice only a vanishingly small percentage are thermodynamically stable, which is a key indicator of the materials that can be experimentally realized. Two fundamental tasks in this area are to (a) predict the stable crystal structure of a known composition of elements and (b) propose novel compositions along with their stable structures. We present FlowMM, a pair of generative models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on both tasks while being more efficient and more flexible than competing methods. We generalize Riemannian Flow Matching to suit the symmetries inherent to crystals: translation, rotation, permutation, and periodic boundary conditions. Our framework enables the freedom to choose the flow base distributions, drastically simplifying the problem of learning crystal structures compared with diffusion models. In addition to standard benchmarks, we validate FlowMM's generated structures with quantum chemistry calculations, demonstrating that it is about 3x more efficient, in terms of integration steps, at finding stable materials compared to previous open methods.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic field is a powerful tool for the manipulation of material's electronic and optical properties. In the domain of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers, it allows one to unveil the spin, valley, and orbital properties of many-body excitonic complexes. Here we study theoretically the impact of normal-to-plane magnetic field on trions and trion-polaritons. We demonstrate that spin and orbital effects of a magnetic field give comparable contributions to the trion energies. Moreover, as magnetic field redistributes the free electron gas between two valleys in the conductance band, the trion-photon coupling becomes polarization and valley dependent. This results in an effective giant Zeeman splitting of trion-polaritons, in-line with the recent experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Encapsulated void resonators in lossy dielectric van der Waals heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric optical resonators traditionally rely on materials with the combination of high refractive indices and low optical losses. Such materials are scarce for operation in visible spectrum and shorter wavelengths. This limitation can be circumvented by relaxing the requirement of low losses. We demonstrate that highly lossy dielectric materials can be structured to support optical resonances that confine light in air voids. We theoretically design void resonances in the visible spectrum and identify resonant modes supported by void arrays. Experimentally, we fabricate void arrays in tungsten diselenide and characterize the confined resonances using far-field reflectance measurements and scanning near-field optical microscopy. Using van der Waals heterostructure assembly, we encapsulate the voids with hexagonal boron nitride which reduces the void volume causing a large spectral blue shift of the void resonance exceeding 150 nm. Our work demonstrates a versatile optical platform for lossy materials, expanding the range of suitable materials and the spectral range of photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Schwinger Effect in Lead-Halide Perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe strong photoluminescence of a lead-halide perovskite driven by deep sub-gap irradiation. Using the quasi-adiabatic Landau-Dykhne approach, we interpret this observation in terms of the dynamical Schwinger effect -- tunneling ionization in strong fields. Further, the exponential sensitivity of the Schwinger effect to driving fields allows us to measure the local frozen-in fields in a nominally cubic MAPbBr$_3$ single crystal at room temperature. Finally, we demonstrate an AC analogue of biasing in our system -- the cooperation between two time-dependent fields simultaneously driving the sample. Our results (i) establish lead-halide perovskites as an excellent platform for simulating effects of strong fields on Dirac fields, (ii) contribute to the on-going discussion about inversion-breaking in MAPbBr$_3$ single crystal, and (iii) pave the way for a mid-infrared light detection with lead-halide perovskites.</description>

Abstract: Metallic ferromagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides have emerged as important building blocks for scalable magnonics and memory applications. Downscaling such systems to the ultra-thin limit is critical to integrate them into technology. Here, we achieved layer-by-layer control over the transition metal dichalcogenide Cr$_{1.6}$Te$_{2}$ by using pulsed laser deposition, and we uncovered the minimum critical thickness above which room temperature magnetic order is maintained. The electronic and magnetic structure is explored experimentally and theoretically and it is shown that the films exhibit strong in-plane magnetic anisotropy as a consequence of large spin-orbit effects. Our study elucidates both magnetic and electronic properties of Cr$_{1.6}$Te$_{2}$, and corroborates the importance of intercalation to tune the magnetic properties of nanoscale materials architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric field control of magnetic properties offers a broad and promising toolbox for enabling ultra-low power electronics. A key challenge with high technological relevance is to master the interplay between the magnetic anisotropy of a ferromagnet and the exchange coupling to an adjacent antiferromagnet. Here, we demonstrate that magneto-ionic gating can be used to achieve a very stable out-of-plane (OOP) oriented magnetization with strong exchange bias in samples with as-deposited preferred in-plane (IP) magnetization. We show that the perpendicular interfacial anisotropy can be increased by more than a factor 2 in the stack Ta/Pt/PtMn/Co/HfO2 by applying -2.5 V gate voltage over 3 nm HfO2, causing a reorientation of the magnetization from IP to OOP with a strong OOP exchange bias of more than 50 mT. Comparing two thicknesses of PtMn, we identify a notable trade-off: while thicker PtMn yields a significantly larger exchange bias, it also results in a slower response to ionic liquid gating within the accessible gate voltage window. These results pave the way for post-deposition electrical tailoring of magnetic anisotropy and exchange bias in samples requiring significant exchange bias.</description>

Abstract: Although printed transistors have a wide range of applications, the limited resolution of printing techniques (10-30 um) has been a barrier to advancement and scaling, particularly down to submicron dimensions. While previous works have shown creative approaches to realizing submicron channel lengths with printing, reliance on chemical processes unique to specific inks or tedious post-processing limit their applicability. Here, we report the use of capillary flow printing (CFP) to repeatably create fully printed submicron carbon nanotube thin-film transistors (CNT-TFTs) without chemical modification or physical manipulation post-printing. The versatility of this printing technique is demonstrated by printing conducting, semiconducting, and insulating inks on several types of substrates (SiO2, Kapton, and paper) and through the fabrication of various TFT device (contacting/gating) architectures. Notably, CFP of these CNT-TFTs yielded on-currents of 1.12 mA/mm when back gated on Si/SiO2, and 490 uA/mm when side gated through ion gel on Kapton, demonstrating the strong transistor performance achievable with CFP. Mechanical bending and sweep rate resilience of devices printed on Kapton show the wide utility of CFP-fabricated devices for flexible applications. This work highlights the ability of CFP as a viable fabrication method for submicron electronics through cleanroom-free printing techniques.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear transports (NLTs) have garnered broad attention based on their topological origin in quantum geometry. When quantum geometry meets magnetic geometry in magnets, their crossover excites diverse phenomena particularly related to antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, very few material platforms have been predicted and experimentally verified to date, where spin-orbit coupling (SOC) plays an indispensable role in generating NLTs. Therefore, to boost antiferromagnetic spintronics affected by the dual effect of quantum geometry and magnetic geometry, a material database of antiferromagnets (AFMs) with magnetic geometry driven quantum geometry and more significant NLT effects is urgently needed. Here, we integrate the state-of-the-art spin space group theory into the symmetry analysis of NLT tensors. By completely disentangling SOC effects, we find that collinear and coplanar magnetic geometry can only induce NLT driven by Berry curvature dipole, and noncoplanar one may trigger NLT driven by dipoles of Berry curvature, inverse mass, and quantum metric. Remarkably, a materials database of 260 AFMs with SOC-free NLT effects is established. Several prototypical material candidates are presented by first-principle calculations, including collinear AFM VNb$_{3}$S$_{6}$ with NLT driven by Berry curvature dipole, and a room-temperature noncoplanar AFM CrSe with NLTs driven by quantum metric dipole. Our work not only provides a universal theoretical framework for studying various magnetism-driven transport effects, but also predicts broad, experimentally accessible material platforms for antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices formed from twisting trilayers of graphene are an ideal model for studying electronic correlation, and offer several advantages over bilayer analogues, including more robust and tunable superconductivity and a wide range of twist angles associated with flat band formation. Atomic reconstruction, which strongly impacts the electronic structure of twisted graphene structures, has been suggested to play a major role in the relative versatility of superconductivity in trilayers. Here, we exploit an inteferometric 4D-STEM approach to image a wide range of trilayer graphene structures. Our results unveil a considerably different model for moir\'e lattice relaxation in trilayers than that proposed from previous measurements, informing a thorough understanding of how reconstruction modulates the atomic stacking symmetries crucial for establishing superconductivity and other correlated phases in twisted graphene trilayers.</description>

Abstract: The Bi-Te binary system, characterized by the homologous series of the (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n, has always attracted research interest for its layered structures and potential in advanced materials applications. Despite Bi2Te3 has been extensively studied, exploration of other compounds has been constrained by synthesis challenges. This study reports the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of FeTe on Bi2Te3, demonstrating that varying growth conditions can turn the Bi2Te3 layer into different Bi-Te phases and form corresponding FeTe/Bi-Te heterostructures. Our combined analysis using reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD), and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM), indicates that specific growth conditions used for the growth of the FeTe layer can facilitate the extraction of Te from Bi2Te3, leading to the formation of Bi4Te3 and Bi6Te3. Additionally, by lowering the FeTe growth temperature to 230 oC, Te extraction from the Bi2Te3 layer could be avoided, preserving the Bi2Te3 structure. Notably, all the three FeTe/Bi-Te structures exhibit superconductivity with the FeTe/Bi2Te3 heterostructure enjoying the highest superconductivity quality. These findings introduce a novel method for realizing Bi4Te3 and Bi6Te3 through Te extraction by growing FeTe on Bi2Te3, driven by the high reactivity between Fe and Te. This approach holds promise for synthesizing other members of the Bi-Te series, expanding the functional potential of these materials.</description>

      <title>Strength of Kitaev Interaction in Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ and Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$</title>

Abstract: Kitaev spin liquid is proposed to be promisingly realized in low spin-orbit coupling $3d$ systems, represented by Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ and Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$. However, the existence of Kitaev interaction is still debatable among experiments, and obtaining the strength of Kitaev interaction from first-principles calculations is also challenging. Here, we report the state-dependent anisotropy of Kitaev interaction, based on which a convenient method is developed to rapidly determine the strength of Kitaev interaction. Applying such method and density functional theory calculations, it is found that Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ with $3d^7$ configuration exhibits considerable ferromagnetic Kitaev interaction. Moreover, by further applying the symmetry-adapted cluster expansion method, a realistic spin model is determined for Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$ with $3d^8$ configuration. Such model indicates negligible small Kitaev interaction, but it predicts many properties, such as ground states and field effects, which are well consistent with measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the heavy elements, Sb or Bi, located at the hollow sites of honeycomb lattice, do not contribute to emergence of Kitaev interaction through proximity, contradictory to common belief. The presently developed anisotropy method will be beneficial not only for computations but also for measurements.</description>
