      <title>The signature of major mergers on the hydrostatic mass bias of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While galaxy cluster masses are fundamental cosmological observables, estimates based on intra-cluster medium observations rely on hydrostatic equilibrium, introducing a systematic bias. We investigate how mergers drive the time evolution of this hydrostatic mass bias, identifying the dominant physical mechanisms and their dependence on dynamical state and merger history. Using a high-resolution AMR Eulerian+$N$-body cosmological simulation, we analyse a sample of cluster mergers within $1.5 \leq z \leq 0$, comparing true and hydrostatic masses derived from gas density and temperature profiles, and tracing their evolution. At $z=0$, the hydrostatic mass bias shows a mild correlation with dynamical state. During major mergers, the bias follows a characteristic trend: a sharp negative dip around the merger time, a transient positive peak, and a gradual return to pre-merger levels. This behaviour is primarily driven by morphological and dynamical reconfigurations of the gas density within the ICM, while thermodynamical processes play a secondary role. The pattern shows no strong dependence on secondary parameters, such as mass ratio or impact parameter, but it can be fitted to a simple time-dependent functional form. This trend is present at radii $r\le R_{\mathrm{vir}}$, although with reduced amplitude and shorter timescales as the radius decreases. Hydrostatic mass bias is closely linked, albeit in a non-trivial way, with the merging history of galaxy clusters. We find that the bias values are weakly correlated with the dynamical state of clusters. Nevertheless, our results give a robust estimation of the hydrostatic mass bias values in the pre-merger, merging, and post-merger phases. These findings highlight the importance of delving deeper into the observational assessment of cluster assembly state in order to improve mass estimations for cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Jeans Model for the Shapes of Self-interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jeans model is a semi-analytical approach to modeling self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) that works remarkably well to reproduce the spherically-averaged halo profiles from observations and simulations of relaxed galaxies and galaxy clusters. However, SIDM halos are not spherically symmetric in general since they respond to nonspherical baryon distributions and retain nonsphericity from their initial collapse. In this work, we generalize the Jeans model to describe SIDM density profiles and halo shapes beyond spherical symmetry. Observational tests via halo shapes are especially important for testing SIDM in massive galaxies, $M_{\rm 200} \sim 10^{12} - 10^{13} \; \Msun$, where SIDM and collisionless dark matter halos can have indistinguishable spherically-averaged profiles but distinct halo shapes. We validate our model by comparing to cosmological simulations with baryons for both SIDM with $\sigmam = 1 \cmg$ and collisionless cold dark matter. Our approach differs from previous work in this direction, taking into account the fact that multiple scatterings are required to impact the shape of the halo, as well as being computationally inexpensive to implement. The nonspherical Jeans model can be used in conjunction with halo shape observations (e.g., from gravitational lensing or X-ray data) to directly constrain dark matter self-interactions.</description>

      <title>A proposal to construct the dark-matter-only counterpart of the observed Universe combining weak lensing and baryon censuses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryonic effects such as AGN feedback can significantly impact the matter clustering, are harder to model from first principles, and emerge as a severe limiting factor in weak lensing cosmology. To tackle this issue, we propose a generic relation of mapping the observed matter clustering to its counterpart in a dark-matter-only universe. We verify this relation to be accurate at better than $1\%$ level at $k&lt;1\,h/$Mpc and $z\in [0,3]$ in both TNG and Illustris simulations, demonstrating its model-independence to the underlying baryonic physics. Implementing this relation in observations will be made possible by the specifically designed cross-correlation statistics and baryon census (ionized diffuse gas through localized fast radio bursts, stellar mass through galaxy surveys, and neutral hydrogen through 21cm mapping). It is capable of correcting the baryonic effect not only in the matter power spectrum, but also at the field level, as demonstrated by tests on the scattering transform statistics. This approach paves the way for constructing the dark-matter-only counterpart of the observed Universe, establishing an ideal cosmological laboratory for probing the dark universe.</description>

      <title>Galactic foreground residual biases in CMB lensing convergence reconstruction and delensing of B-mode maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffused contamination from Galactic foreground emission is one of the main concern for reconstruction of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing potential for next-generation of CMB polarisation experiments. Using realistic simulations we investigate the impact of Galactic foreground residuals from multi-frequency foreground cleaning method on the lensing reconstruction, delensing CMB B-mode maps and constraints of the tensor-to-scalar ratio for CMB-S4-like experiment. We pay special attention to studies of the errors coming from small angular scale non-Gaussianity of the foreground residuals. We show that component separation is essential for the lensing reconstruction reducing Galactic emission contribution to the lensing reconstruction errors by one order of magnitude. The residual foreground contribution is dominated by terms coming from Gaussian components of the residual maps. Errors coming from non-Gaussian components are around three orders of magnitude smaller than the Gaussian one even for recent and the most complex models of the Galactic emission considered in this work. Although the bias in the reconstruction errors due to Gaussian component of the residuals is small, it is comparable to the cosmic variance limit for the lensing power spectrum. For this reason we correct for this bias in delensing of B-mode maps and constraining the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We show also that for the delensed B-mode maps with a simple quadratic estimator, residuals of the Galactic emission after component separation, errors are two orders of magnitude smaller than uncertainties from leftover of the lensing signal. However, for high-sensitivity CMB experiments and more efficient delensing algorithms that remove up to 90% of the lensing signal, the foreground residuals will become one of the main sources of errors.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the canonical single-field slow-roll inflation model from observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use two methods to constrain the the canonical single-field slow-roll inflation model. The first method exploits the analytic slow-roll-parameter dependence of primordial perturbations, and the second consists of a phenomenological parameterization of the primordial spectra of both scalar and tensor perturbations. We constrain the slow-roll parameters directly by adopting the latest datasets, including Planck satellite data, BICEP2/Keck data and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data. An advantage of this method is that we can work out the predictions of single-field slow-roll inflation model by using these constrained slow-roll parameters. We illustrate the predictions of the parameters characterizing the scalar power spectrum and constrain some inflation models. We find that the inflation model with monomial potential is disfavored, and the inflation models with a concave potential, such as the Starobinsky inflation model, brane inflation model are preferred. From the constraints on the slow-roll parameters, the derived tensor spectral index in the single-field slow-roll inflation model is quite small, namely $|n_t|\lesssim 4.7\times 10^{-3}$ which will be very difficult to be measured by CMB data only in the future, and the absolute value of derived running of tensor spectral index is not larger than $1.56\times 10^{-4}$ at $95\%$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Recalibrating Inflation: Insights from Starobinsky Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses of low-redshift supernova and Cepheid data reveal localized shifts in the distance modulus, often interpreted as calibration anomalies or hints of new physics. We propose that these features may emerge naturally from environment-dependent modifications to gravity. In particular, we examine the Starobinsky \(f(R) = R + \lambda R^2\) model, which introduces a scalar degree of freedom that couples to ambient matter density and alters photon propagation in underdense regions. We derive the corresponding corrections to luminosity distance and show that they can reproduce the observed magnitude shifts without invoking discontinuities or empirical step functions. Statistical comparisons using AIC and BIC favor the Starobinsky framework over phenomenological models, supporting its role as a minimal, geometric explanation for emergent calibration transitions.</description>

      <title>Boost operator approach to the relativistic polarized SZ effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recent boost operator formalism for relativistic Compton scattering calculations to also account for polarization. This allows us to provide general, exact expressions for the polarized Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect sourced both kinematically and from intrinsic anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The results are given in terms of rational operator functions that can be used to generate distortion spectra that describe the general SZ signal, reproducing the classical polarized SZ results in the appropriate limits. Our derivation allows for clear separation of physical effects in the generation of polarized SZ, and beyond the SZ application provides a general description of the Compton collision term in the Doppler-dominated regime. Through direct computation of important example cases we further illustrate the power of this new method.</description>

      <title>Mutated Hilltop Inflation in the Era of Present and Future CMB Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we confront both large-field and small-field sectors of mutated hilltop inflation model with the recent observational results. We begin with confrontation of predictions from mutated hilltop inflation with the joint analysis of Planck-2018 and BICEP/Keck-2018 data. Subsequently, we extend our analysis by incorporating the ACT-DR6 data in combination with Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck-2018, and DESI-Y1 observations. In both cases, the predictions of mutated hilltop inflation show good consistency with the observational constraints. We have also forecasted the constraints on mutated hilltop inflation model from upcoming CMB experiments, LiteBIRD and Simons Observatory along with their combinations. Here also we find that the prediction from mutated hilltop inflation are in tune with those upcoming CMB experiments. The small-field sector of mutated hilltop inflation, in principle, can probe up to $r\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, resulting in a tensor amplitude consistent with current bounds and potentially detectable by next-generation CMB missions. However, accommodating the high observational value of the scalar spectral index may demand relatively higher e-foldings in mutated hilltop inflation. A key appealing feature of the mutated hilltop inflation model turns out to be its ability to remain consistent with a potential non-detection of primordial gravitational waves by LiteBIRD and/or Simons Observatory.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmological Euler equation: viscosity, equivalence principle, and gravity beyond general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the cosmological Euler equation can be tested in the presence of viscous dark matter, violations of the equivalence principle (EP), and modifications of gravity, while relying on minimal theoretical assumptions. Extending the previous analysis, we generalize the observable $E_P$, which quantifies EP violation, to $\tilde{E}_P$, discuss the degeneracy between bulk and shear viscosities and EP-violating effects, and explicitly show that the EP can still be tested in the small-viscosity limit. In addition, we identify a model-independent observable, $C_{\rm vis,0}$, which characterizes the present-day dark matter viscosity and can be measured from relativistic galaxy number counts by cross-correlating two galaxy populations. We perform forecasts for three forthcoming Stage-IV surveys: DESI, Euclid, and SKA Phase 2 (SKA2), and find that $C_{\rm vis,0}$ can be tightly constrained, at the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ or better in all cases. Among these surveys, SKA2 provides the tightest constraint, with a $1\sigma$ uncertainty of $1.08 \times 10^{-7}$ on $C_{\rm vis,0}$.</description>

      <title>Implicit inference of the reionization history with higher-order statistics of the 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Epoch of Reionization (EoR), when the first luminous sources ionised the intergalactic medium, represents a new frontier in cosmology. The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will offer unprecedented insights into this era through observations of the redshifted 21-cm signal, enabling constraints on the Universe's reionization history. We investigate the information content of the average neutral hydrogen fraction ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$) in several Gaussian (spherical and cylindrical power spectra) and non-Gaussian (Betti numbers and bispectrum) summary statistics of the 21-cm signal. Mock 21-cm observations are generated using the AA* configuration of SKAO's low-frequency telescope, incorporating noise levels for 100 and 1000 hours. We employ a state-of-the-art implicit inference framework to learn posterior distributions of $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$ in redshift bins centred at $z=8.0,7.2$ and $6.5$, for each statistic and noise scenario, validating the posteriors through calibration tests. Using the figure of merit to assess constraining power, we find that Betti numbers alone are on average more informative than the power spectra, while the bispectrum provides limited constraints. However, combining higher-order statistics with the cylindrical power spectrum improves the mean figure of merit by $\sim$0.25 dex ($\sim33\%$ reduction in $\sigma(\bar{x}_{\rm HI})$). The relative contribution of each statistic varies with the stage of reionization. With SKAO observations approaching, our results show that combining power spectra with higher-order statistics can significantly increase the information retrieved from the EoR, maximising the scientific return of future 21-cm observations.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the ionization response of argon to nuclear recoils at the keV scale with the ReD experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16404v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the recent years, argon-based experiments looking for Dark Matter in the Universe have explored the non-standard scenario in which Dark Matter is made by low-mass Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, of mass in the range of 1-10 GeV instead of the canonical hundreds of GeV. Detecting such particles is challenging, as their expected signatures are nuclear recoils with energies below 10 keV, observable solely via ionization. This necessitates a precise understanding of the detector response in this energy regime, which remains incomplete for argon. To address this, the ReD experiment was developed within the framework of the DarkSide-20k Collaboration to produce and characterize few-keV nuclear recoils. A compact dual-phase argon Time Projection Chamber (TPC) was irradiated with neutrons from a Cf252 source, to produce Ar recoils in the energy range of interest via (n,n') elastic scattering. A downstream spectrometer composed of 18 plastic scintillators detected the neutrons scattered off Ar nuclei, enabling recoil energy reconstruction via two-body kinematics. The ionization yield Qy of argon, defined as the number of electrons produced per unit energy deposit, was measured in a model-independent way between 2 and 10 keV. These measurements extend direct experimental coverage well below the previous limit of approximately 7 keV. The results are consistent with existing data above 7 keV, while they indicate a higher Qy at lower energies.</description>

      <title>Reaching for the Edge II: Stellar Halos out to Large Radii as a Tracer of Dark Matter Halo Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffuse outskirts of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) encode valuable information about the assembly history and mass of their host dark matter halos. However, the low surface brightness of these stellar halos has historically made them difficult to observe. Recent deep imaging, particularly with Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), has shown that the stellar mass within relatively large projected annuli, such as within $50$ and $100$ kpc, is a promising proxy for halo mass. However, the optimal radial definition of this "outskirt mass" remains uncertain. We construct an HSC-like mock observing pipeline to measure the stellar mass density profiles of BCGs in the IllustrisTNG simulations. Our mock observations closely reproduce HSC profiles across six orders of magnitude in surface density. We then systematically measure stellar masses within different annuli and how tightly they are connected to halo mass. We find that stellar masses measured within simple apertures exhibit considerably more scatter in the stellar mass-halo mass relation than those measured within projected ellipsoidal annuli. We identify an optimal range of definitions, with inner radii between $\sim 70$-$200$ kpc and outer radii between $\sim 125$-$500$ kpc. We also introduce two halo-mass-dependent S\'ersic models for the average stellar halo profiles. We present a S\'ersic-based fitting function that describes the profiles as a function of the halo mass, $M_{\rm vir}$, with a median error of $54\%$. Adding the central stellar mass of the BCG as a second parameter slightly improves the accuracy to a median error of $39\%$. Together, these results provide fitting functions for BCG stellar halos that can be applied to future wide-field surveys to infer halo masses from deep imaging data.</description>

      <title>Keeping It Renormalizable: Minimal Baryogenesis induced Asymmetric Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many asymmetric dark matter scenarios have been proposed to date. Among them, perhaps the most motivated ones are those in which the dark matter asymmetry is induced from the baryon/lepton asymmetries via chemical equilibration without any new sources of CP violation. However, most of the models put forward along these lines have been excluded by now and/or are based on complicated setups. In this letter, we present a new, simple, and viable scenario. It assumes only two new fields: a scalar singlet and an inert scalar doublet, and is based only on renormalizable interactions, that slowly generate the dark matter asymmetry from the Standard Model Higgs asymmetry. The model allows for the direct detection of dark matter in the upcoming generation of experiments, and the inert doublet is predicted to be light enough to be potentially produced and observed at the LHC and future colliders, $m_{H'}&lt;580\,{\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>The Quiescent Merging Nature of the Coma Cluster Revealed by ICM Velocity Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot gas permeating galaxy clusters-the intracluster medium (ICM)-is a key tracer of their assembly history and internal dynamics. Understanding the motion of this gas provides critical insight into processes such as mergers, turbulence, and energy dissipation in the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe. The Coma cluster is a nearby, massive system long suspected to be dynamically disturbed. Previous high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the XRISM mission revealed bulk motions in the cluster core and southern regions. Here we present new XRISM Resolve observations of a northern region in Coma, which reveal a coherent velocity gradient of nearly $530 km/s across the cluster from south to north. We find that the hot gas in this northern region exhibits modest line-of-sight motions and uniform thermodynamic properties, indicating relatively mild local disturbances. The consistent levels of turbulence throughout the cluster suggest that the energy from a past merger has been distributed on large scales. These findings provide compelling evidence for an off-axis merger event and demonstrate how high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy can uncover subtle dynamical signatures in the ICM, offering important constraints for simulations of cluster evolution.</description>

      <title>The impact of supermassive black holes on exoplanet habitability: I. Spanning the natural mass range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the influence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity on habitability has garnered attention, the specific effects of active galactic nuclei (AGN) winds, particularly ultrafast outflows (UFOs), on planetary atmospheres remain largely unexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between SMBH mass at the galactic center and exoplanetary habitability, given that SMBH masses are empirically confirmed to span approximately 5 orders of magnitude in galaxies. Through simplified models, we account for various results involving the relationships between the distance from the planet to the central SMBH and the mass of the SMBH. Specifically, we show that increased SMBH mass leads to higher atmospheric heating and elevated temperatures, greater molecular thermal velocities, and enhanced mass loss, all of which diminish with distance from the galactic center. Energy-driven winds consistently have a stronger impact than momentum-driven ones. Crucially, ozone depletion is shown to rise with SMBH mass and decrease with distance from the galactic center, with nearly complete ozone loss ($\sim100\%$) occurring across galactic scales for SMBHs $\geq 10^8 M_\odot$ in the energy-driven case. This study emphasizes that SMBH growth over cosmic time may have produced markedly different impacts on galactic habitability, depending on both the mass of the central black hole (BH) and the location of planetary systems within their host galaxies.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Main Surveys -- the Mock Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a flagship space mission, designed to carry out a large-area sky survey to explore the nature of dark matter and dark energy in the Universe. The onboard multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic modules will enable us to obtain photometric data for billions of galaxies and stars, as well as hundreds of millions of spectroscopic measurements, advancing various scientific analyses such as galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing. To support the image simulations for the main survey of the CSST mission, we present a mock catalogue of stars and galaxies. For stars, the mock catalogue is generated using either Galaxia or TRILEGAL, both of which provide a range of stellar properties to meet the requirements of CSST image simulations. For galaxies, we built a mock light-cone up to redshift z~3.5 from the cosmological Nbody simulation and populated the mock galaxy catalogue from the dark mater haloes using a semi-analytical galaxy formation model. We then performed a full-sky ray-tracing simulation of weak gravitational lensing to obtain lensing shear at the position of each galaxy in the light-cone. To support both multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic simulations, we computed the spectral energy distribution (SED) for each galaxy based on its star formation history using a supervised deep-learning model and determined the magnitudes in each band using the CSST throughputs. Finally, the properties of our mock galaxies include positions, redshifts, stellar masses, shapes, sizes, SEDs, lensing shears and magnifications. We have validated our mock catalogue against observational data and theoretical models, with results showing good overall agreement. The catalogue provides a flexible dataset for the development of CSST image processing and can support a wide range of cosmological analyses within the CSST mission.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an X-ray bridge between the comma-shaped gas and the main cluster in MCXC J0157.4-0550</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a faint X-ray bridge connecting between the comma-shaped gas and the main cluster in MCXC J0157.4-0550, using {\it XMM-Newton} image. The filamentary structure is found in a model-independent manner in both topological features and Gaussian Gradient Magnitude filtering. The X-ray surface brightness profile perpendicular to the filament is detected at a $5.5\sigma$ level. Weak-lensing (WL) analysis using the Subaru/HSC-SSP Survey archive data strongly supports the two mass components. Given a prior from the stellar masses, we obtain $M_{200}^{\rm main}=2.68_{-0.92}^{+1.11}\times 10^{14}\,h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$ and $M_{200}^{\rm sub}=0.46_{-0.22}^{+0.38}\times 10^{14}\,h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$. The main axis of the projected halo distribution is more likely to align with the direction of the main cluster than to be oriented perpendicularly. Similar X-ray distributions have been identified in the literature on numerical simulations. The filamentary structure forms in the following manner: as the gas is stripped by ram pressure near the pericenter, it gets dragged by tidal rotation. Once free from this rotation, the gas moves inertially in a direction parallel to the tangential velocity at the pericenter. The comma-shaped gas, with tails pointing in the opposite direction to the main cluster, is also formed by the current tidal rotation as it moves away from the main cluster. This warrants us that, although it is sometimes thought based on the X-ray morphology alone that the tail is pointing in the opposite direction to the merger motion, this is not necessarily the case. The information of the X-ray filamentary remnant from the cluster merger, together with the 2D WL shear data, provides constraints on the merger parameters, indicating an infalling velocity of approximately $1000\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}$ and an impact parameter of $0.9$ Mpc.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Capture in a Core-Collapse Supernova Revives Dark Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae serve as powerful probes of light, weakly coupled particles, such as dark photons. The conventional SN1987A cooling bound constrains the dark photon mass-mixing parameter space by requiring that the luminosity from the proto-neutron star core not exceed the observed neutrino emission. In this work, we revisit these limits by including the effect of dark matter (DM) captured inside the progenitor star before collapse. The trapped DM acts as an additional scattering target for dark photons, modifying their free-streaming length and, consequently, the supernova cooling rate. We perform a self-consistent analysis for both annihilating and asymmetric DM scenarios, incorporating light-mediator effects in the capture rate calculation. For annihilating DM, the equilibrium density remains too small to affect the bounds significantly. In contrast, asymmetric DM can accumulate to large densities, leading to the formation of a "dark photosphere" that suppresses the dark-photon luminosity and reopens previously excluded regions of parameter space. Our results emphasise the importance of accounting for astrophysical DM populations when deriving stellar-cooling constraints on dark sectors.</description>

      <title>Radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of Population III star formation during the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations find that pockets of star-forming gas could remain pristine up until the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) due to the inhomogeneous nature of metal mixing and enrichment in the early Universe. Such pristine clouds could have formed Population III stars, which could have distinct properties compared to their very high redshift ($z \geq 20$) counterparts. We investigate how Population III stars form and grow during the EoR, and whether the resulting mass distribution varies with environment or across cosmic time. We perform high-resolution ($7.5\,\rm{au}$) radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of identical primordial clouds exposed to the CMB appropriate for $z=30$ and $z=6$, respectively, as part of the POPSICLE project. We also run a simulation at $z=6$ with a strong external Lyman-Werner (LW) background, to span across radiative environments which could host metal-free clumps during the EoR. In the limit of no external LW radiation, we find that while the evolution of the most massive star ($M_{\star} \approx 70\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) is almost identical between $z=30$ and $z=6$, the latter exhibits less fragmentation, leading to a smaller cluster of stars with a higher median stellar mass. In the limit of high external LW radiation, we see vigorous accretion and high star formation efficiencies, leading to the formation of very massive ($M_{\star} &gt; 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) stars. Our results suggest that Population III IMF could vary with redshift simply due to the CMB, independent of the environment. We find that less massive and more compact Pop III star clusters could form during the EoR as compared to $z \geq 20$, with the formation of very massive and supermassive stars likely in strongly irradiated environments.</description>

      <title>Looking at infrared background radiation anisotropies with Spitzer II. Small scale anisotropies and their implications for new and upcoming space surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spitzer-based cosmic infrared background (CIB) fluctuations at arcminute-to-degree scales indicate the presence of new populations, whereas sub-arcminute power arises from known $z\lesssim 6$ galaxies. We reconstruct the evolution of the near-IR CIB anisotropies on sub-arcminute scales by known galaxy populations. This method is based on, and significantly advanced over, the empirical reconstruction by \cite{Helgason2012} which is combined with the halo model connecting galaxies to their host dark matter (DM) halos. The modeled CIB fluctuations from known galaxies produce the majority of the observed small-scale signal down to statistical uncertainties of $&lt; 10\%$ and we constrain the evolution of the halo mass regime hosting such galaxies. Thus the large-scale CIB fluctuations from new populations are produced by sources with negligible small-scale power. This appears to conflict with the presented Intra-halo light (IHL) models, but is accounted for if the new sources are at high $z$. Our analysis spanning several Spitzer datasets allows us to narrow the estimated contributions of remaining known galaxies to the CIB anisotropies to be probed potentially from surveys by new and upcoming space missions such as Euclid, SPHEREx, and Roman. Of these, the Roman surveys have the best prospects for measuring the source-subtracted CIB and probing the nature of the underlying new populations at $\lambda &lt;2\ \mu$m, followed by Euclid's surveys, while for SPHEREx the source-subtracted CIB signal from them appears significantly overwhelmed by the CIB from remaining known galaxies.</description>

      <title>\textit{Euclid}: From Galaxies to Gravitational Waves -- Forecasting Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background Anisotropies and Their Cross-Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate the amplitude and spatial anisotropy in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) energy density due to compact binary coalescence (CBC) events: binary black holes (BBH), binary neutron stars (BNS), and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers. Our starting point is the Flagship Simulation Galaxy Catalogue developed by the Euclid Consortium. For each galaxy in the Catalogue, we use the simulated mass and starformation to constrain the galaxy's star-formation history, and predict its contribution to the gravitational-wave energy density through CBC mergers. Combining such contributions from all galaxies in the Catalogue results in a prediction for the frequency spectrum and spatial anisotropy of the CBC SGWB. We also compare this prediction to semi-analytical models of SGWB generated by compact binaries. We identify a set of effective parameters that capture the key features of these models, and we apply a Bayesian framework to infer these parameters assuming an ideal scenario of cosmic variance-limited search. This represents the first step toward developing a comprehensive framework that will eventually enable the correlation of SGWB anisotropy and \textit{Euclid} galaxy data, potentially allowing us to extract valuable astrophysical information from this new observable.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Parity-violating Trispectra in Galaxy Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parity-violating interactions are ubiquitous phenomena in particle physics. If they are significant during cosmic inflation, they can leave imprints on primordial perturbations and be observed in correlation functions of galaxy surveys. Importantly, parity-violating signals in the four-point correlation functions (4PCFs) cannot be generated by Einstein gravity in the late universe on large scales, making them unique and powerful probes of high-energy physics during inflation. However, the complex structure of the 4PCF poses challenges in diagnosing the underlying properties of parity-violating interactions from observational data. In this work, we introduce a general framework that provides a streamlined pipeline directly from a particle model in inflation to galaxy 4PCFs in position space. We demonstrate this framework with a series of toy models, effective-field-theory-like models, and full models featuring tree-level exchange-type processes with chemical-potential-induced parity violation. We further showed the detection sensitivity of these models from BOSS data and highlighted potential challenges in data interpretation and model prediction.</description>

      <title>Accurate $N$-body simulations with local Primordial non-Gaussianities: initial conditions and aliasing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New generation galaxy surveys targeting constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) demand $N$-body simulations that accurately reproduce its effects. In this work, we explore various prescriptions for the initial conditions of simulations with PNG, aiming to optimise accuracy and minimise numerical errors, particularly due to aliasing. We have used $186$ runs that vary the starting redshift, LPT order, and non-Gaussianities ($f^{\rm local}_{\rm NL}$ and $g^{\rm local}_{\rm NL}$). Starting with $3$LPT at a redshift as low as $z_{\rm ini}\simeq 11.5$ reproduces to $&lt;1 \%$ the power spectrum, bispectrum and halo mass function of a high-resolution reference simulation. The aliasing induced by the PNG terms in the power spectrum produces a $ \leq 3 \%$ excess small-scale power at the initial conditions, dropping below $0.1\%$ by $z=0$. State-of-the-art initial condition generators show a sub-percent agreement. We show that initial conditions for simulations with PNG should be established at a lower redshift using higher-order LPT schemes. We also show that removing the PNG aliasing signal is unnecessary for current simulations. The methodology proposed here can accelerate the generation of simulations with PNG while enhancing their accuracy.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Spectroscopic Redshift Errors on Cosmological Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectroscopic redshift errors, including redshift uncertainty and catastrophic failures, can bias cosmological measurements from galaxy redshift surveys at sub-percent level. In this work, we investigate their impact on the full-shape analysis using contaminated mock catalogs. We find that redshift uncertainty introduces a scale-dependent damping effect on the power spectrum, which is absorbed by counterterms in clustering model, keeping parameter biases below $5\%$. Catastrophic failures suppress the power spectrum amplitude by an approximately constant factor that scales with the catastrophic rate $f_c$. While this effect is negligible for DESI galaxy populations ($f_c=1\%$), the slitless-like errors, combining redshift uncertainty with $f_c=5\%$ catastrophics, introduce significant biases in cosmological constraints. In this case, we observe $6\%$ to $16\%$ shifts ($\sim1.5\sigma$ level) in estimating the fractional growth rate $df\equiv f/f^{\rm{fid}}$ and the log primordial amplitude $\ln(10^{10} A_{s})$. Applying the correction factor $(1-f_c)^2$ on the galaxy power spectrum mitigates the bias but weakens the parameter constraints due to new degeneracies. Alternatively, fixing $f_c$ to its expected value restores the constraining power with a modest bias of $0.7\sigma$. Our results indicate that for space-based slitless surveys such as \textit{Euclid}, at minimum accurate estimation of $f_c$ and its incorporation into the clustering model are essential to get unbiased cosmological inference. Extending to evolving dark energy and massive neutrino cosmologies, redshift errors do not bias the dark energy properties parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, but can degrade constraints on the summed neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$ by up to 80% in the worst case.</description>

      <title>Probing the Cosmological Principle with CMB lensing and cosmic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model assumes the Cosmological Principle. However, recent observations hint at possible violations of isotropy on large scales, possibly through late-time anisotropic expansion. Here we investigate the potential of cross-correlations between CMB lensing convergence $\kappa$ and galaxy cosmic shear $B$-modes as a novel probe of such late-time anisotropies. Our signal-to-noise forecasts reveal that information from the $\kappa$-$B$ cross-correlation is primarily contained on large angular scales ($\ell \lesssim 200$). We find that this cross-correlation for a Euclid-like galaxy survey is sensitive to anisotropy at the percent level. Making use of tomography yields a modest improvement of $\sim 20\%$ in detection power. Incorporating the galaxy $E$-$B$ cross-correlations would further enhance these constraints.</description>

      <title>Recovering the Coupled Treatment of Redshift-Space Distortions and the Lightcone Effect after Diffuse Foreground Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 21 cm brightness temperature during the Epoch of Reionisation is widely modelled using semi-numeric simulations, used for their computational speed and flexibility in testing astrophysical and cosmological parameters. However, it is common practice to simulate coeval brightness temperature boxes, and then apply post-processing algorithms that treat the lightcone effect and redshift-space distortions separately, assuming they can be added in sequence. We instead model them together, allowing for partial coeval cell contributions, and ensuring that velocity-induced frequency shifts are computed at the correct cosmic time for every position along the line of sight. We show that considering these effects simultaneously creates a difference in the shape of the power spectrum over all Fourier scales, and remains recoverable after semi-blind foreground removal. We show that our lightcones consist of an average of 8% and maximum of 120% of a coeval cell length. These contributions to a 21cm brightness temperature lightcone voxel are shifted from within a +/- 0.5 MHz range of the emitted frequency. The boost in the power spectrum seen over small scales (k&gt;1.5 Mpc) of our robust 21 cm lightcone method compared to basic methods is recoverable after the addition and removal of diffuse radio foregrounds. The largest differences during the Epoch of Reionisation lie in the k-space, where the noise sensitivity for a 1000-hour SKAO-low observation is greater than the signal. However, in the cosmic dawn, we have shown that the major differences lie outside of this noise-dominated region.</description>

      <title>Probing Anisotropic Cosmic Birefringence with Foreground-Marginalised SPT B-mode Likelihoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we construct foreground-marginalised versions of the SPT-3G D1 and SPTpol cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarisation likelihoods. The compression is performed using the CMB-lite framework and we use the resulting data sets to constrain anisotropic cosmic birefringence, parametrised by the amplitude of a scale-invariant anisotropic birefringence spectrum, $A_{\rm CB}$. Using the new SPT-3G data we report a $95\%$ upper limit on $A_{\rm CB}$ of $ 1.2\times 10^{-4}$, which tightens to $0.53\times 10^{-4}$ when imposing a prior on the amplitude of gravitational lensing based on CMB lensing reconstruction analyses. These are the tightest constraints on anisotropic birefringence from BB power spectrum measurements to-date, demonstrating the constraining power of the South Pole Telescope. The likelihoods used in this work are made publicly available at https://github.com/lbalkenhol/candl_data</description>

      <title>Constraints on Cosmic Birefringence from SPIDER, Planck, and ACT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Early Dark Energy (EDE) model has been proposed as a candidate mechanism to generate cosmic birefringence through a Chern-Simons coupling between a dynamical scalar field and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photon. Such birefringence induces a nonzero cross-correlation between the CMB $E$- and $B$-modes, providing a direct observational signature of parity violation. Recent measurements of the $EB$ and $TB$ power spectra, however, cannot yet unambiguously separate instrumental miscalibration ($\alpha$) from a true cosmic-rotation angle ($\beta$). For this reason, we perform a model-independent analysis in terms of the total effective rotation angle $\alpha+\beta$. We analyze the latest $EB$ and $TB$ measurements from the SPIDER, Planck, and ACT experiments and derive constraints on the Chern-Simons coupling constant $gM_{Pl}$ and on the polarization rotation angle $\alpha+\beta$. We find that the coupling $gM_{Pl}$ is not compatible with the SPIDER data, while it provides reasonable fits to the Planck and ACT measurements. The fits for $\alpha+\beta$ prefer a value larger than zero: when combined, Planck+ACT yield a detection significance of approximately 7$\sigma$. We also find that ACT data alone do not provide sufficiently tight constraints on either $gM_{Pl}$ or $\alpha+\beta$, whereas the combination Planck+ACT improves the statistical consistency of ACT's high-$\ell$ results and leads to a better PTE for those measurements.</description>

      <title>Dark Photons in the Radio Sky: I. Resonant Conversions in Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixing between dark photons and visible photons leads to substantial anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background due to resonant conversions of visible photons into dark photons in baryonic matter found in dark matter halos. In this Letter, we forecast the sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to this signal. We find that SKA could be the first experiment to discover dark photons with a mass between $10^{-13}$ and $5\times 10^{-12}$ eV and kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ as small as $\sim 10^{-8}$ by cross-correlating their data with a low-redshift galaxy survey, potentially improving on the sensitivity from a similar analysis using Planck data by a factor of 4 in $\epsilon$. This improvement is largely due to an enhancement of the signal at low frequencies and the unique experimental advantages of radio telescopes such as small beam sizes.</description>

      <title>Dark Photons in the Radio Sky: II. Resonant Conversions in the Intergalactic Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the second part in a pair of papers forecasting the sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to dark photons, a highly motivated, simple extension of the Standard Model. Through a kinetic mixing term, visible photons from the cosmic microwave background can resonantly convert into dark photons, generating new temperature anisotropies in the sky. In this work, we detail the entire analysis pipeline that we use to compute SKA's sensitivity, focusing on resonant conversions that occur in the intergalactic medium. We also discuss the sensitivity of 21-cm experiments to dark photons. Our results show that both SKA in combination with galaxy surveys and 21-cm experiments could discover dark photons with masses between $5\times 10^{-15}$ and $5\times 10^{-12}$ eV, and kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ as low as $10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Perspective on Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The DESI collaboration reports a significant preference for a dynamic dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM) over the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM) when their data are combined with other frontier cosmological probes. We present a direct Bayesian model comparison using nested sampling to compute the Bayesian evidence, revealing a contrasting conclusion: for the key combination of the DESI DR2 BAO and the Planck CMB data, we find the Bayesian evidence modestly favours $\Lambda$CDM (log-Bayes factor $\ln B = -0.57{\scriptstyle\pm0.26}$), in contrast to the collaboration's 3.1$\sigma$ frequentist significance in favoring $w_0w_a$CDM. Extending this analysis to also combine with the DES-Y5 supernova catalogue, our Bayesian analysis reaches a significance of $3.07{\scriptstyle\pm0.10}\,\sigma$ in favour of $w_0w_a$CDM. By performing a comprehensive tension analysis, employing five complementary metrics, we pinpoint the origin: a significant ($\approx 2.95\sigma$), low-dimensional tension between DESI DR2 and DES-Y5 that is present only within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. The $w_0w_a$CDM model is preferred precisely because its additional parameters act to resolve this specific dataset conflict. The convergence of our findings with independent geometric analyses suggests that the preference for dynamic dark energy is primarily driven by the resolution of inter-dataset tensions, warranting a cautious interpretation of its statistical significance.</description>

Abstract: Measurements of differential length oscillations of Fabry-Perot cavities provide a sensitive and promising approach to searching for scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM). The initial demonstration sets direct lower bounds that are one to two orders of magnitude lower for two model ULDM distributions -- a standard galactic halo and a relaxion star bound to Earth -- ranging over a decade of ULDM mass and Compton frequency. The demonstration suggests how a much higher sensitivity to a much larger ULDM mass range can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Multi-Model Framework for Reconstructing Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mitigating data gaps in Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) light curves (LCs) is crucial for cosmological research, enhancing the precision of parameters, assuming perfect satellite conditions for complete LC coverage with no gaps. This analysis improves the applicability of the two-dimensional Dainotti relation, which connects the rest-frame end time of the plateau emission (Ta) and its luminosity (La), derived from the fluxes (Fa). The study expands on a previous 521 GRB sample by incorporating seven models: Deep Gaussian Process (DGP), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Hybrid CNN with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-BiLSTM), Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), Polynomial Curve Fitting, Isotonic Regression, and Quartic Smoothing Spline (QSS). Results indicate that QSS significantly reduces uncertainty across parameters: 43.5% for log Ta, 43.2% for log Fa, and 48.3% for alpha, outperforming the other models where alpha denotes the slope post-plateau based on Willingale 2007 functional form. The Polynomial Curve Fitting model demonstrates moderate uncertainty reduction across parameters, while CNN-BiLSTM has the lowest outlier rate for alpha at 0.77%. These models broaden the application of machine-learning techniques in GRB LC analysis, enhancing uncertainty estimation and parameter recovery, and complement traditional methods like the Attention U-Net and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). These advancements highlight the potential of GRBs as cosmological probes, supporting their role in theoretical model discrimination via LC parameters, serving as standard candles, and facilitating GRB redshift predictions through advanced machine-learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Earth-Scattering Induced Modulation in Low-Threshold Dark Matter Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter particles with sufficiently large interactions with ordinary matter can scatter in the Earth before reaching and scattering in a detector. This induces a modulation in the signal rate with a period of one sidereal day. We calculate this modulation for sub-GeV dark matter particles that interact either with a heavy or an ultralight dark-photon mediator and investigate the resulting signal in low-threshold detectors consisting of silicon, xenon, or argon targets. The scattering in the Earth is dominated by dark matter scatters off nuclei, while the signal in the detector is easiest to observe from dark matter scattering off electrons. We investigate the properties of the modulation signal and provide projections of the sensitivity of future experiments. We find that a search for a modulation signal can probe new regions of parameter space near the energy thresholds of current experiments, where the data are typically dominated by backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Survival of higher overdensity cold gas in a turbulent, multiphase medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold gas clouds embedded in a hot, turbulent medium are expected to be short-lived due to disruptive hydrodynamic instabilities. However, radiative cooling might allow such clouds to survive and grow. We present 3D \texttt{Athena++} simulations of clouds with a density contrast of $\chi = 1000$, exploring turbulent Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}\in (0.25, 0.75)$ and cloud radii chosen to span cooling-to-crushing ratios $\alpha \in [0.001, 10]$. We find a shift in the survival boundary, with cloud survival occurring only when the cooling-to-cloud-crushing ratio ($t_{\text{cool,mix}} / t_{\text{cc}}$) $\lesssim 0.01$, which is lower than the expected boundary of $\sim 1$. This result shows that it is more difficult for higher over-density cold clouds to survive in a turbulent, hot medium, and suggests another `survival criterion'.</description>

Abstract: Neutrino Direct Simulation Monte Carlo ($\nu$DSMC) is a Monte Carlo method for solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation in the early Universe, designed to track the evolution of cosmic neutrinos across a wide range of cosmological scenarios. We develop a complete $\nu$DSMC solver that consistently incorporates the effects of the electron mass, three-flavour neutrino oscillations, and finite-temperature QED corrections to the thermodynamics of the electromagnetic plasma. As a first application, we perform a high-precision calculation of neutrino decoupling in the standard cosmological model and obtain $N_{\text{eff}} = 3.0439 \pm 0.0006$, in excellent agreement with state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Euler-Heisenberg action for fermions coupled to gauge and axial vectors: Hessian diagonalization, sector classification, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the closed-form one-loop Euler--Heisenberg effective actions for Dirac fermions coupled simultaneously to classical electromagnetic vector and massive pseudo-vector backgrounds within a controlled quasi-static approximation. Through complete diagonalization of the functional Hessian, we systematically delineate the parameter space into distinct sectors characterized by stability properties and spectral structure. We identify subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes; strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature, diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis. Additionally, we outline qualitative predictions for Weyl/Dirac semi-metals and briefly discuss potential applications in related phenomena, such as the Strong-CP problem.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Limit of Growing Gravitational Wave Memory from Sources in the Early Universe and Astrophysical Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the stochastic background of gravitational wave memory of growing type leads to a fractional Brownian motion increasing at the order of $t^{H}$ for large $t$ where $\frac{1}{2} &lt; H &lt;1$. This beats the scaling law of Brownian motion. In this article we investigate sources of gravitational waves in the early universe as well as in astrophysical settings. Cosmological sources may include primordial black holes or other sources immediately after the Big Bang when there were pockets of hot material, and large density fluctuations. Gravitational waves from mergers of primordial black holes produce memory. We show that due to the conditions in which these are taking place the gravitational wave memory will be increasing in time following a certain power law. Corresponding results hold for any gravitational wave memory from a cosmological source where the surrounding conditions are similar. The stochastic limit of these memories is a stochastic process growing in time faster than the $\sqrt{t}$ scaling law of Brownian motion. The latter is also typical for noise and for the limit of memory events as they have been mostly considered in the literature. In an expanding universe, the memory is enhanced by the expansion itself. Our results provide a tool to extract gravitational wave sources of this type from data using this memory signature. This would be particularly useful for the PTA data that has been already observed, answering the long-standing question on how to extract memory signals from the data. Further, the new results open up a new door to explore the conditions right after the Big Bang using the long-range dependence and further probability analysis.</description>

Abstract: We derive the Tully-Fisher (TFR, $M_\ast-V_{\rm circ, f}$) and Fall (FR, $j_\ast-M_\ast$) relations at redshift $z = 0.9$ using a sample of 43 main-sequence disc galaxies with H$\alpha$ IFU data and JWST/HST imaging. The strength of our analysis lies in the use of state-of-the-art 3D kinematic models to infer galaxy rotation curves, the inclusion and morphological modelling of NIR bands, and the use of SED modelling applied to our photometry measurements to estimate stellar masses. After correcting the inferred H$\alpha$ velocities for asymmetric drift, we find a TFR of the form $\log(M_\ast / M_\odot) = a \log(V_{\rm circ,f} / 150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}) + b$, with $a=3.82^{+0.55}_{-0.40}$ and $b=10.27^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, as well as a FR of the form $\log(j_\ast / \mathrm{kpc\,km\,s^{-1}}) = a \log(M_\ast / 10^{10.5} M_\odot) + b$, with $a=0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ and $b=2.86^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$.
  When compared to their $z=0$ counterparts, we find moderate evolution in the TFR and strong evolution in the FR over the past $8$ Gyr. We interpret our findings in the context of the galaxy-to-halo scaling parameters $f_{\rm M}=M_\ast/M_{\rm vir}$ and $f_{\rm j}=j_\ast/j_{\rm vir}$. We infer that at $z=0.9$ both $f_{\rm M}$ and $f_{\rm j}$ are higher and less mass-dependent than at $z=0$. We speculate that the evolution of $f_{\rm j}$ can be driven by more efficient and centrally concentrated stellar feedback at $z=0.9$, or by an appreciable dry merger history. We also show that assuming the galaxies populating our $z=0.9$ relations evolve into those populating the $z=0$ relations leads to an apparent discrepancy with the hierarchical growth of dark matter halos. To solve this issue, one needs to evoke a progenitor bias scenario, unknown systematics affecting our and previous measurements, or consider the possibility that H$\alpha$ kinematics is not a reliable dynamical tracer.</description>

      <title>Flexible Simulation Based Inference for Galaxy Photometric Fitting with Synthesizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Synference, a new, flexible Python framework for galaxy SED fitting using simulation-based inference (SBI). Synference leverages the Synthesizer package for flexible forward-modelling of galaxy SEDs and integrates the LtU-ILI package to ensure best practices in model training and validation. In this work we demonstrate Synference by training a neural posterior estimator on $10^6$ simulated galaxies, based on a flexible 8-parameter physical model, to infer galaxy properties from 14-band HST and JWST photometry. We validate this model, demonstrating excellent parameter recovery (e.g. R$^2&gt;$0.99 for M$_\star$) and accurate posterior calibration against nested sampling results. We apply our trained model to 3,088 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in the JADES GOODS-South field. The amortized inference is exceptionally fast, having nearly fixed cost per posterior evaluation and processing the entire sample in $\sim$3 minutes on a single CPU (18 galaxies/CPU/sec), a $\sim$1700$\times$ speedup over traditional nested sampling or MCMC techniques. We demonstrate Synference's ability to simultaneously infer photometric redshifts and physical parameters, and highlight its utility for rapid Bayesian model comparison by demonstrating systematic stellar mass differences between two commonly used stellar population synthesis models. Synference is a powerful, scalable tool poised to maximise the scientific return of next-generation galaxy surveys.</description>
