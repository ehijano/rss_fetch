      <title>Analysis of Niobium Electropolishing Using a Generalized Distribution of Relaxation Times Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we have devised a method of sensing the microscopic surface conditions on the surface of niobium as it is undergoing an electrochemical polishing (EP) treatment. The method uses electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to gather information on the surface state of the electrode without disrupting the polishing reaction. The EIS data is analyzed using a so-called distribution of relaxation times (DRT) method. Using DRT, the EIS data can be deconvolved into discrete relaxation time peaks without any a priori knowledge of the electrode dynamics. By analyzing the relaxation time peaks, we are able to distinguish two distinct modes of the EP reaction. As the polishing voltage is increased, the electrode transitions from the low voltage EP mode, characterized by a single relaxation time peaks, to the high voltage EP mode, characterized by two relaxation time peaks. We theorize that this second peak is caused by the formation of an oxide layer on the electrode. We also find that this oxide induced peak transitions from to a negative relaxation time, which is indicative of a blocking electrode process. By analyzing EPed samples, we show that samples polished in the low voltage mode have significantly higher surface roughness due to grain etching and faceting. We find that the surface roughness of the samples only improves when the oxide film peak is present and in the negative relaxation time region. This shows that EIS combined with DRT analysis can be used to predict etching on EPed Nb. This method can also be performed before or during the EP, which could allow for adjustment of polishing parameters to guarantee a smooth cavity surface finish.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Enhanced Superconducting Properties in Niobium Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.10601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) niobium cavities are critical for modern particle accelerators, as well as for advancing superconducting quantum systems and enabling ultra-sensitive searches for new physics. In this work, we report a systematic observation of an anomalous frequency dip in Nb cavities, which occurs at temperatures just below the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$), indicative of enhanced superconducting properties at $T \ll T_c$. The magnitude of this dip is strongly correlated with the RF surface resistance, impurity distribution near the surface, and $T_\mathrm{c}$. We also present the first demonstration of the coherence peak in the AC conductivity of Nb SRF cavities. By comparing recent theories developed to model this experimental data, we show that the frequency dip feature, larger coherence peak height, and reduction in the temperature-dependent surface resistance with RF current occur at minimal but finite levels of disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a preliminary analytical procedure in 4 steps (based on an improved fully relativistic plane hydrodynamic model) to tailor the initial density of a cold diluted plasma to the laser pulse profile so as to control wave-breaking (WB) of the plasma wave and maximize the acceleration of small bunches of electrons self-injected by the first WB at the density down-ramp.</description>
