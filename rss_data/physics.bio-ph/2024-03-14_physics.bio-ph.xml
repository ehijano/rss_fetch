      <title>Morphological instability at topological defects in a three-dimensional vertex model for spherical epithelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epithelial monolayers are a central building block of complex organisms. Topological defects have emerged as important elements for single cell behavior in flat epithelia. Here we theoretically study such defects in a three-dimensional vertex model for spherical epithelia like cysts or intestinal organoids. We find that they lead to the same generic morphological instability to an icosahedral shape as it is known from spherical elastic shells like virus capsids, polymerized vesicles or buckyballs. We derive analytical expressions for the effective stretching and bending moduli as a function of the parameters of the vertex model, in excellent agreement with computer simulations. These equations accurately predict both the buckling of a flat epithelial monolayer under uniaxial compression and the faceting transition around the topological defects in spherical epithelia. We further show that localized apico-basal tension asymmetries allow them to reduce the transition threshold to small system sizes.</description>

      <title>Hyperelasticity of Blood Clots: Bridging the Gap between Microscopic and Continuum Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The biomechanical properties of blood clots, which are dictated by their compositions and micro-structures, play a critical role in determining their fates, occlusion, persistency, or embolization in the human circulatory system. While numerous constitutive models have emerged to describe the biomechanics of blood clots, the majority of these models have primarily focused on the macroscopic deformation of the clots and the resultant strain-stress correlations without depicting the microscopic contributions from their structural components, such as fibrin fibers, fibrin network and red blood cells. This work addresses the gap in current scientific understanding by quantifying how changes in the microstructure of blood clots affect its mechanical responses under different external stresses. We leverage our previous published work to develop a hyperelastic potential model for blood clots, which incorporates six distinct strain-energy components to describe the alignment of fibers, the entropic and enthalpic stretching of fibrin fibers, the buckling of these fibers, clot densification, and clot jamming.These strain-energy components are represented by a combination of simple harmonic oscillators, one-sided harmonic potentials, and a Gaussian potential. The proposed model, which is C0, C1, and C2 continuous with a total of 13 parameters, has been validated against three data sets: fibrin clot in tension, blood clot in compression, and blood clots in shear, demonstrating its robustness. Subsequent simulations of a microscopic blood clot model are performed to uncover mechanistic correlations for a majority of the hyperelastic potential's stiffness/strain parameters. Our results show that only one proposed term concerning fiber buckling needs further refinement, while the remaining five strain-energy terms appear to describe precisely what they were intended to.</description>

      <title>Self-enhanced mobility enables vortex pattern formation in living matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergence of regular spatial patterns is a hallmark in living matter ranging from subcellular organelles to developing embryos and to ecosystems. Mechanisms for the formation of ordered spatial patterns in biology often require chemical signaling that coordinates cellular behavior and differentiation. Here we discovered a novel route to large-scale regular pattern formation in living matter mediated by purely physical interactions. We found that dense bacterial living matter spontaneously developed an ordered lattice of mesoscale, fast-spinning vortices each consisting of ~10^4-10^5 motile cells; these mesoscale vortices were arranged in space over centimeter scale with apparent hexagonal order, while individual cells in the vortices moved in coordinated directions with strong polar and vortical order. Single-cell tracking and numerical simulations suggest that the phenomenon is enabled by self-enhanced mobility of individual cells in the system. Our findings demonstrate a simple physical mechanism for self-organized pattern formation in living systems and more generally, in other active matter systems near the boundary of fluidlike and solidlike behaviors.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on physics-based one-dimensional modeling of lung physiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need to understand how infection spreads to the deep lung was acutely realized during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. The challenge of modeling virus laden aerosol transport and deposition in the airways, coupled with mucus clearance, and infection kinetics, became evident. This perspective provides a consolidated view of coupled one-dimensional physics-based mathematical models to probe multifaceted aspects of lung physiology. Successes of 1D trumpet models in providing mechanistic insights into lung function and optimalities are reviewed while identifying limitations and future directions. Key non-dimensional numbers defining lung function are reported. The need to quantitatively map various pathologies on a physics-based parameter space of non-dimensional numbers (a virtual disease landscape) is noted with an eye on translating modeling to clinical practice. This could aid in disease diagnosis, get mechanistic insights into pathologies, and determine patient specific treatment plan. 1D modeling could be an important tool in developing novel measurement and analysis platforms that could be deployed at point-of-care.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Communication in Bacterial Biofilms: A Study on Potassium Stimulation and Signal Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrochemical communication is a mechanism that enables intercellular interaction among bacteria within communities. Bacteria achieves synchronization and coordinates collective actions at the population level through the utilization of electrochemical signals. In this work, we investigate the response of bacterial biofilms to artificial potassium concentration stimulation. We introduce signal inputs at a specific location within the biofilm and observe their transmission to other regions, facilitated by intermediary cells that amplify and relay the signal. We analyze the output signals when biofilm regions are subjected to different input signal types and explore their impact on biofilm growth. Furthermore, we investigate how the temporal gap between input pulses influences output signal characteristics, demonstrating that an appropriate gap yields distinct and well-defined output signals. Our research sheds light on the potential of bacterial biofilms as communication nodes in electrochemical communication networks.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interplay of Intrinsic Fluctuation and Complexity in Intracellular Calcium Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concentration of intracellular calcium ion (Ca$^{2+}$) exhibits complex oscillations, including bursting and chaos, as observed experimentally. These dynamics are influenced by inherent fluctuations within cells, which serve as crucial determinants in cellular decision-making processes and fate determination. In this study, we systematically explore the interplay between intrinsic fluctuation and the complexity of intracellular cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics using complexity measures such as permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity (SC). Using the chemical Langevin equation, we simulate the stochastic dynamics of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$. Our findings reveal that PE and SC effectively characterize the diverse, dynamic states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ and illustrate their interactions with intrinsic fluctuation. PE analysis elucidates that the chaotic state is more sensitive to intrinsic fluctuation than the other periodic states. Furthermore, we identify distinct states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ occupying specific locations within the theoretical bounds of the complexity-entropy causality plane. These locations indicate varying complexity and information content as intrinsic fluctuation varies. When adjusting the permutation order, the SC for the different states exhibits peaks in an intermediate range of intrinsic fluctuation values. Additionally, we identify scale-free or self-similar patterns in this intermediate range, which are further corroborated by multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. These high-complexity states likely correspond to optimal Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics with biological significance, revealing rich and complex dynamics shaped by the interplay of intrinsic fluctuation and complexity. Our investigation enhances our understanding of how intrinsic fluctuation modulates the complexity of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics that play crucial roles in biological cells.</description>

      <title>Vortex pattern stabilization in thin films resulting from shear thickening of active suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need for structuring on micrometer scales is abundant, for example, in view of phononic applications. We here outline a novel approach based on the phenomenon of active turbulence on the mesoscale. As we demonstrate, a shear-thickening carrier fluid of active microswimmers intrinsically stabilizes regular vortex patterns of otherwise turbulent active suspensions. The fluid self-organizes into a periodically structured nonequilibrium state. Introducing additional passive particles of intermediate size leads to regular spatial organization of these objects. Our approach opens a new path towards functionalization through patterning of thin films and membranes.</description>
