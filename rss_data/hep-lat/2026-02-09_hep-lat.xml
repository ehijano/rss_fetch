      <title>U(1) lattice gauge theory and string roughening on a triangular Rydberg array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe fundamental interactions in particle physics. A central phenomenon in these theories is confinement, which binds quarks and antiquarks into hadrons through the formation of string-like flux tubes of gauge fields. Simulating confinement dynamics is a challenging task, but recent advances in quantum simulation are enabling the exploration of LGTs in regimes beyond the reach of classical computation. For analog devices, a major difficulty is the realization of strong plaquette interactions, which generate string fluctuations that can drive a roughening transition. Understanding string roughening -- where strong transversal functions lead to an effective restoration of translational symmetry at long distances -- is of central importance in the study of confinement. In this work, we show that string roughening emerges naturally in an analog Rydberg quantum simulator. We first map a triangular Rydberg array onto a (2+1)D U(1) LGT where plaquette terms appear as first-order processes. We study flux strings connecting static charges and demonstrate that, near a deconfined quantum critical point, the string exhibits logarithmic growth of its transverse width as the separation between charges increases, along with the universal L\"uscher correction to the confining potential -- both signatures of string roughening. Finally, we investigate the real-time dynamics of an initially rigid string, observing large fluctuations after quenching into the roughening regime, as well as string breaking via particle-pair creation. Our results indicate that rough strings can be realized in experimentally accessible quantum simulators, opening the door to detailed studies of how strong fluctuations influence string-breaking dynamics.</description>

      <title>Study of $B \to K_0^*(1430)\,\ell^+ \ell^-$ Decay in the Standard Model and Scalar Leptoquark Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the rare decay $B \to K_0^*(1430)\,\ell^+ \ell^-$ as a possible probe for new physics beyond the standard model (SM). We first analyze this channel within the SM and then include scalar leptoquark (LQ) contributions. We provide predictions for key observables, like differential decay rate, branching ratio, ratio of branching fractions at different channels, forward-backward asymmetry and different lepton polarizations, and assess their sensitivity to leptoquark scenarios, highlighting $q^2$ regions less affected by the long-distance charmonium effects. The results can be useful for future Belle II and LHCb measurements.</description>

Abstract: We review lattice results related to pion, kaon, $D$-meson, $B$-meson, and nucleon physics with the aim of making them easily accessible to the nuclear and particle physics communities. More specifically, we report on the determination of the light-quark masses, the form factor $f_+(0)$ arising in the semileptonic $K \to \pi$ transition at zero momentum transfer, as well as the decay-constant ratio $f_K/f_\pi$ and its consequences for the CKM matrix elements $V_{us}$ and $V_{ud}$. We review the determination of the $B_K$ parameter of neutral kaon mixing as well as the additional four $B$ parameters that arise in theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. For the heavy-quark sector, we provide results for $m_c$ and $m_b$ as well as those for the decay constants, form factors, and mixing parameters of charmed and bottom mesons and baryons. These are the heavy-quark quantities most relevant for the determination of CKM matrix elements and the global CKM unitarity-triangle fit. We review the status of lattice determinations of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. We review the determinations of nucleon charges from the matrix elements of both isovector and flavour-diagonal axial, scalar and tensor local quark bilinears, and momentum fraction, helicity moment and the transversity moment from one-link quark bilinears. We also review determinations of scale-setting quantities. Finally, in this review we have added a new section on the general definition of the low-energy limit of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Dilaton Effective Field Theory across the Conformal Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) can be employed to analyze lattice data in gauge theories that lie in close proximity of the lower edge of the conformal window. Under special conditions, we show that it can be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish near-conformal, yet confining, theories from infrared conformal ones. We demonstrate this efficacy by analyzing two sets of lattice measurements taken from the literature. For the $SU(3)$ theory coupled to $N_f=8$ Dirac fermions transforming in the fundamental representation, our analysis favors confinement. For the $SU(2)$ theory with $N_f=1$ adjoint fermion, our fits favor infrared conformal behavior. We discuss future lattice measurements, and analysis refinements, that can further test this framework.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar meson dominance, the pion-nucleon coupling constant and the Goldberger-Treiman discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the matrix elements of the pseudoscalar density with pion-quantum numbers $I^G J^{PC}= 1^- 0^{-+}$ in the nucleon in terms of dispersion relations, PCAC and pQCD asymptotic sum rules for the pseudoscalar form factor. We show that the corresponding spectral density must have at least one zero. A model based on ChPT at low energies, resonances at intermediate energies, Regge power-like behaviour at high energies and pQCD at asymptotically high energies, allows to deduce the pion-nucleon coupling constant and the Goldberger-Treiman discrepancy $\Delta_{\rm GT} = 1 -\frac{m_N g_A}{F_{\pi}g_{\pi NN}}$, yielding the results for the charged channel \[g_{\pi^+ pn} = 13.14(^{+6}_{-4})(7)_{\rm IB}, \quad \Delta_{\rm GT} = 1.26(^{+51}_{-34})(50)_{\rm IB}\ , \] to be compared with the most precise determinations, $g_{\pi^+ np} = 13.25(5)$ (and hence $\Delta_{\rm GT}=2.1(4) \%$), from $np, pp$ scattering analysis of the Granada-2013 database and $g_{\pi^+pn}=13.11(10)$, $\Delta_{\rm GT}=1.0(7)\%$ from the GMO sum rule. Our work supports the concept of pseudoscalar dominance in the nucleon structure suggested by Dominguez long ago. The minimal resonance saturation of the pseudoscalar form factor of the nucleon with the lowest isovector-pseudoscalar mesons compatible with analyticity, pQCD short distance constraints and chiral symmetry leads to an extended PCAC in the large-$N_c$ limit, and effectively depends on the $\pi(1300)$ excited pion state. Our results are compatible, though more accurate, than recent lattice QCD studies and are consistent with almost flat strong pion-nucleon-nucleon vertices.</description>

      <title>Four loop renormalization of 3-quark operators in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We renormalize generalized 3-quark operators that relate to baryon states using the method devised by Kr\"{a}nkl and Manashov at four loops in the MSbar scheme. The anomalous dimensions of the four core operators used to compute nucleon matrix elements are determined and their associated critical exponents are studied in the conformal window using the Banks-Zaks expansion.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic geometry in hadron resonance gas model at real and imaginary baryon chemical potential and a simple sufficient condition for quark deconfinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic geometry of the hadron resonance gas model with (without) excluded volume effects (EVE) of baryons is investigated. The case with imaginary mu, where mu is the baryon chemical potential, is investigated as well as the one with real mu. We calculate the scalar curvature R and use the R=0 criterion to investigate the phase structure in the mu^2-T plane where T is the temperature. The curve on which R=0 continues analytically from the imaginary mu region, where the lattice QCD is feasible, to the real mu one. In the presence of EVE, there are rich phase structures in the large real mu region as well as the Roberge-Weiss like region where mu is imaginary and a singularity appears, while there is no phase structure in the large real $\mu$ region in the absence of EVE. The limitation temperature of the baryon gas is also obtained by using the baryon number fluctuation. The LQCD predicted critical point locates almost on the curve of the limitation temperature we determined. A simple sufficient condition, n_B&gt;1/(2v_B)$, is obtained for the quark deconfinement in the large real mu region, where n_B and v_B are the net baryon number density and the volume of a baryon, respectively.</description>
