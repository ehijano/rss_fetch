      <title>Rapid and Robust construction of an ML-ready peak feature table from X-ray diffraction data using Bayesian peak-top fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To advance the development of materials through data-driven scientific methods, appropriate methods for building machine learning (ML)-ready feature tables from measured and computed data must be established. In materials development, X-ray diffraction (XRD) is an effective technique for analysing crystal structures and other microstructural features that have information that can explain material properties. Therefore, the fully automated extraction of peak features from XRD data without the bias of an analyst is a significant challenge. This study aimed to establish an efficient and robust approach for constructing peak feature tables that follow ML standards (ML-ready) from XRD data. We challenge peak feature extraction in the situation where only the peak function profile is known a priori, without knowledge of the measurement material or crystal structure factor. We utilized Bayesian estimation to extract peak features from XRD data and subsequently performed Bayesian regression analysis with feature selection to predict the material property. The proposed method focused only on the tops of peaks within localized regions of interest (ROIs) and extracted peak features quickly and accurately. This process facilitated the rapid extracting of major peak features from the XRD data and the construction of an ML-ready feature table. We then applied Bayesian linear regression to the maximum energy product $(BH)_{max}$, using the extracted peak features as the explanatory variable. The outcomes yielded reasonable and robust regression results. Thus, the findings of this study indicated that \textit{004} peak height and area were important features for predicting $(BH)_{max}$.</description>

      <title>Extended defects as a source of phonon confinement in polycrystalline Si and Ge films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Raman spectroscopy of the polycrystalline Si and Ge films deposited by molecular beam deposition on a dielectric substrate. The Raman study has been made using lasers with different wavelengths. Structural properties of the poly-films have been studied by XRD and TEM. The Raman spectra are characterized by appearance of the additional wide peaks around 500 cm$^{-1}$ and 290 cm$^{-1}$ in the main vibrational bands of TO(c-Si) and TO(c-Ge) phonons, respectively. It is shown that these peaks correspond to scattering in grain boundary area. For the poly-Si films, both a downward shift and an asymmetrical broadening of the vibrational band of TO(c-Si) near 520 cm$^{-1}$ are observed, whereas there is only a symmetric broadening in the spectra of poly-Ge. The Raman line shape has been modeled within the framework of the phonon confinement theory taking into account the sizes of coherent scattering domains obtained using XRD. The model includes a symmetrical band broadening observed in polycrystalline films. It is shown that confinement of phonon propagation might be in the poly-Si films. The phonon dispersion and the density of phonon states have been simulated using density functional theory. It has been found that phonon confinement relates to grain boundaries rather than other extended defects such as twins (multiple twins, twin boundaries), the appearance of which does not lead to significant changes in phonon dispersion and density of phonon states.</description>

      <title>Thermal oscillations and resonance in electron-phonon interaction process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal resonance, in which the temperature amplitude attains a maximum value (peak) in response to an external exciting frequency source, is a phenomenon pertinent to the presence of underdamped thermal oscillations and explicit finite-speed for the thermal wave propagation. The present work investigates the occurrence condition for thermal resonance phenomenon during the electron-phonon interaction process in metals based on the hyperbolic two-temperature model. First, a sufficient condition for underdamped electron and lattice temperature oscillations is discussed by deriving a critical frequency (a material characteristic). It is shown that the critical frequency of thermal waves near room temperature, during electron-phonon interactions, may be on the order of terahertz ($10-20$ THz for Cu and Au, i.e., lying within the terahertz gap). It is found that whenever the natural frequency of metal temperature exceeds this frequency threshold, the temperature oscillations are of underdamped type. However, this condition is not necessary, since there is a small frequency domain, below this threshold, in which the underdamped thermal wave solution is available but not effective. Otherwise, the critical damping and the overdamping conditions of the temperature waves are determined numerically for a sample of pure metals. The thermal resonance conditions in both electron and lattice temperatures are investigated. The occurrence of resonance in both electron and lattice temperature is conditional on violating two distinct critical values of frequencies. When the natural frequency of the system becomes larger than these two critical values, an applied frequency equal to such a natural frequency can drive both electron and lattice temperatures to resonate together with different amplitudes and behaviors. However, the electron temperature resonates earlier than the lattice temperature.</description>

      <title>A space-time gauge theory for modeling ductile damage and its NOSB peridynamic implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local translational and scaling symmetries in space-time is exploited for modelling ductile damage in metals and alloys over wide ranges of strain rate and temperature. The invariant energy density corresponding to the ductile deformation is constructed through the gauge invariant curvature tensor by imposing the Weyl like condition. The energetics of the plastic deformation is brought in through the gauge compensating field emerged due to local translation. Invariance of the energy density under the local action of translation and scaling is preserved through minimally replaced space-time gauge covariant operators. Minimal replacement introduces two non-trivial gauge compensating fields pertaining to local translation and scaling. These are used to describe ductile damage, including plastic flow and micro-crack evolution in the material. A space-time pseudo-Riemannian metric is used to lay out the kinematics in a finite-deformation setting. Recognizing the available insights in classical theories of viscoplasticity, we also establish a correspondence of the gauge compensating field due to spatial translation with Kr\"{o}ner's multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. Thermodynamically consistent coupling between viscoplasticity and ductile damage is ensured through an appropriate degradation function. Non-ordinary state-based (NOSB) peridynamics (PD) discretization of the model is used for numerical implementation. The model's viability is tested in reproducing a few experimentally known facts, viz., strain rate locking in the stress-strain response, whose origin is traced to a nonlinear microscopic inertia term arising out of the space-time translation symmetry. Finally, we solved 2D and axisymmetric deformation problems for qualitatively validating the model's viability. NOSB peridynamics axisymmetric formulation in finite deformation setup is also presented.</description>

      <title>Adapting OC20-trained EquiformerV2 Models for High-Entropy Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational high-throughput studies, especially in research on high-entropy materials and catalysts, are hampered by high-dimensional composition spaces and myriad structural microstates. They present bottlenecks to the conventional use of density functional theory calculations, and consequently, the use of machine-learned potentials is becoming increasingly prevalent in atomic structure simulations. In this communication, we show the results of adjusting and fine-tuning the pretrained EquiformerV2 model from the Open Catalyst Project to infer adsorption energies of *OH and *O on the out-of-domain high-entropy alloy Ag-Ir-Pd-Pt-Ru. By applying an energy filter based on the local environment of the binding site the zero-shot inference is markedly improved and through few-shot fine-tuning the model yields state-of-the-art accuracy. It is also found that EquiformerV2, assuming the role of general machine learning potential, is able to inform a smaller, more focused direct inference model. This knowledge distillation setup boosts performance on complex binding sites. Collectively, this shows that foundational knowledge learned from ordered intermetallic structures, can be extrapolated to the highly disordered structures of solid-solutions. With the vastly accelerated computational throughput of these models, hitherto infeasible research in the high-entropy material space is now readily accessible.</description>

      <title>Electronic Properties of Interfaces between N-Heterotriangulene Donors and Strong Tetracyanoquinodimethane Acceptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: N-heterotriangulenes (N-HTAs) represent a class of functional molecules with high potential for optoelectronic materials, for example as electron donating compounds in donor/acceptor (D/A) systems. The capability of two different N-HTAs, N-HTA 550 and N-HTA 557, the latter containing an additional 7-membered ring, to act as electron donors at interfaces with strong tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ and F4TCNQ) acceptors is studied using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy in combination with state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations. For TCNQ/N-HTA bilayer systems adsorbed on Au(111) Low-energy (&lt; 2.5 eV) electronic transitions which are attributed to charge transfer (CT) states for all four D/A combinations are identified. Based on substantial quantum chemical calculations a generation of ground state CT complexes is excluded. Instead, CT in the excited state, in which an electron-stimulated CT from the N-HTAs to TCNQs is the underlying process, is proposed. The energies of the CT states are determined by the values of the ionization potential and electron affinity of the involved donor and acceptor.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of above-room-temperature van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$, a recently discovered van der Waals ferromagnet, demonstrates intrinsic ferromagnetism above room temperature, necessitating a comprehensive investigation of the microscopic origins of its high Curie temperature ($\textit{T}$$_C$). In this study, we reveal the electronic structure of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ in its ferromagnetic ground state using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Our results establish a consistent correspondence between the measured band structure and theoretical calculations, underscoring the significant contributions of the Heisenberg exchange interaction ($\textit{J}$$_{ex}$) and magnetic anisotropy energy to the development of the high-$\textit{T}$$_C$ ferromagnetic ordering in Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$. Intriguingly, we observe substantial modifications to these crucial driving factors through doping, which we attribute to alterations in multiple spin-splitting bands near the Fermi level. These findings provide valuable insights into the underlying electronic structure and its correlation with the emergence of high-$\textit{T}$$_C$ ferromagnetic ordering in Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Determination of Energetic Positions of Electronic States and the Exciton Dynamics in a pi-Expanded N-Heterotriangulene Derivative Adsorbed on Au(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bridged triarylamines, so-called N-heterotriangulenes (N-HTAs) are promising organic semiconductors for applications in optoelectronic devices. Thereby the electronic structure at organic/metal interfaces and within thin films as well as the electronically excited states dynamics after optical excitation is essential for the performance of organic-molecule-based devices. Here, we investigated the energy level alignment and the excited state dynamics of a N-HTA derivative adsorbed on Au(111) by means of energy- and time-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy. We quantitatively determined the energetic positions of several occupied and unoccupied molecular (transport levels) and excitonic states (optical gap) in detail. A transport gap of 3.20 eV and an optical gap of 2.58 eV is determined, resulting in an exciton binding energy of 0.62 eV. With the first time-resolved investigation on a N-HTA compound we gained insights into the exciton dynamics and resolved processes on the femtosecond to picosecond timescale.</description>

      <title>The Role of Interfacial Morphology in Cu2O/TiO2 and Band Bending: Insights from Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photocatalysis, a promising solution for environmental challenges, relies on the generation and utilization of photogenerated charge carriers within photocatalysts. However, recombination of these carriers often limits efficiency. Heterostructures, especially Cu2O/TiO2, have emerged as effective solutions to enhance charge separation. This study systematically explores the effect of interfacial morphologies on the band bending within Cu2O/TiO2 anatase heterostructures, employing density functional theory (DFT). Through this study, eight distinct interfaces are identified and analyzed, revealing a consistent staggered-type band alignment. Despite variations in band edge positions, a systematic charge transfer from Cu2O to TiO2 is observed across all interfaces. The proposed band bending configurations would suggest enhanced charge separation and photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet illumination due to a Z-scheme configuration. This theoretical investigation provides valuable insights into the interplay between interfacial morphology, band bending, and charge transfer, for advancing the understanding of fundamental electronic mechanisms in heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Thermal relaxation of strain and twist in ferroelectric hexagonal boron nitride moir\'e interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New properties can arise at van der Waals (vdW) interfaces hosting a moir\'e pattern generated by interlayer twist and strain. However, achieving precise control of interlayer twist/strain remains an ongoing challenge in vdW heterostructure assembly, and even subtle variation in these structural parameters can create significant changes in the moir\'e period and emergent properties. Characterizing the rate of interlayer twist/strain relaxation during thermal annealing is critical to establish a thermal budget for vdW heterostructure construction and may provide a route to improve the homogeneity of the interface or to control its final state. Here, we characterize the spatial and temporal dependence of interfacial twist and strain relaxation in marginally-twisted hBN/hBN interfaces heated under conditions relevant to vdW heterostructure assembly and typical sample annealing. We find that the ferroelectric hBN/hBN moir\'e relaxes minimally during annealing in air at typical assembly temperatures of 170{\deg}C. However, at 400{\deg}C, twist angle relaxes significantly, accompanied by a decrease in spatial uniformity. Uniaxial heterostrain initially increases and then decreases over time, becoming increasingly non-uniform in direction. Structural irregularities such as step edges, contamination bubbles, or contact with the underlying substrate result in local inhomogeneity in the rate of relaxation.</description>

      <title>Berry curvature derived negative magnetoconductivity observed in type-II magnetic Weyl semimetal films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we study nonmonotonic features which appear both in magnetoresistivity and anomalous Hall resistivity during the simple magnetization process, by systematically measuring type-II magnetic Weyl semimetal EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$ films over a wide carrier density range. We find that a positive magnetoresistivity hump can be explained as manifestation of a field-linear term in the generalized magnetoconductivity formula including the Berry curvature. As also confirmed by model calculation, the term can be negative and pronounced near the Weyl point energy in the case that the Weyl cones are heavily tilted. Our findings demonstrate extensive effects of the Berry curvature on various magnetotransport in magnetic Weyl semimetals beyond the anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Raman Response in 2D Magnetic FeTe under Uniaxial Strain: Tetragonal and Hexagonal Polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Fe-chalcogenides have emerged with rich structures, magnetisms and superconductivities, which sparked the growing research interests in the torturous transition mechanism and tunable properties for their potential applications in nanoelectronics. Uniaxial strain can produce a lattice distortion to study symmetry breaking induced exotic properties in 2D magnets. Herein, the anomalous Raman spectrum of 2D tetragonal (t-) and hexagonal (h-) FeTe were systematically investigated via uniaxial strain engineering strategy. We found that both t- and h-FeTe keep the structural stability under different uniaxial tensile or compressive strain up to +/- 0.4%. Intriguingly, the lattice vibrations along both in-plane and out-of-plane directions exceptionally hardened (softened) under tensile (compressive) strain, distinguished from the behaviors of many conventional 2D systems. Furthermore, the difference in thickness-dependent strain effect can be well explained by their structural discrepancy between two polymorphs of FeTe. Our results could provide a unique platform to elaborate the vibrational properties of many novel 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Giant Spin Splitting and its Origin in Methylhydrazinium Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin splitting, or removal of spin degeneracy in the electronic energy band/level is often a measure of spin-orbit coupling strength and a way to manipulate spin degrees of freedom. We use first-principles simulations to predict giant spin splitting in methylhydrazinium lead halide (MHyPbX$_3$, MHy = CH$_3$NH$_2$NH$_2$, X = Br and Cl) hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. The values can reach up to 408.0~meV at zero Kelvin and 281.6~meV at room temperature. The origin of the effect is traced to the large distortion of PbX$_3$ framework, driven primarily by Pb ions in the ferroelectric $\Gamma^{3-}$ mode. The Pb displacements consist of combination of polar and antipolar arrangements and result in up to 39.2~meV/atom enhancement of the spin-orbit coupling energy in the polar phase of the materials. The spin-orbit coupling gives origin to highly persistent spin textures in MHyPbX$_3$, which are desirable for applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Our findings reveal an additional functionality for hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite and open a way for the design of more materials with giant spin splitting.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Data-Efficient Micro-XRD Phase Identification Using Multi-Task Learning: Application to Hydrothermal Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional analysis of highly distorted micro-X-ray diffraction ({\mu}-XRD) patterns from hydrothermal fluid environments is a time-consuming process, often requiring substantial data preprocessing and labeled experimental data. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning with a multitask learning (MTL) architecture to overcome these limitations. We trained MTL models to identify phase information in {\mu}-XRD patterns, minimizing the need for labeled experimental data and masking preprocessing steps. Notably, MTL models showed superior accuracy compared to binary classification CNNs. Additionally, introducing a tailored cross-entropy loss function improved MTL model performance. Most significantly, MTL models tuned to analyze raw and unmasked XRD patterns achieved close performance to models analyzing preprocessed data, with minimal accuracy differences. This work indicates that advanced deep learning architectures like MTL can automate arduous data handling tasks, streamline the analysis of distorted XRD patterns, and reduce the reliance on labor-intensive experimental datasets.</description>

      <title>Suppression of shear ionic motions in bismuth by coupling with large-amplitude internal displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth, with its rhombohedral crystalline structure and two Raman active phonon modes corresponding to the internal displacement ($A_{1g}$) and shear ($E_{g}$) ionic motions, offers an ideal target for the investigation of the phonon-phonon and electron-phonon couplings under photoexcitation. We perform transient reflectivity measurements of bismuth single crystal at 11 K over wide range of absorbed laser fluence up to $F_\text{abs}=9$ mJ/cm$^2$, at which a sign of an irreversible surface damage is observed. At the minimum fluence examined (0.1 mJ/cm$^2$) the coherent $A_{1g}$ and $E_g$ oscillations are a cosine and a sine functions of time, as are consistent with their generations in the displacive and impulsive limits, respectively. With increasing fluence the initial phases of the both modes deviate from their low-fluence values, indicating a finite time required for the transition from the ground-state potential energy surface (PES) to the excited-state one. Surprisingly, the $E_g$ amplitude increases with increasing fluence up to 3 mJ/cm$^2$ and then turns to an apparent decrease, in contrast to the monotonic increase of the $A_{1g}$ amplitude up to 6 mJ/cm$^2$. The contrasted behaviors can be understood by considering a two-dimensional PES, where the strongly driven $A_{1g}$ oscillation leads to a temporal fluctuation of the PES along the $E_g$ coordinate and thereby to a loss in the $E_g$ oscillation coherence at high fluences.</description>

      <title>Optical read-out and control of antiferromagnetic Neel vector in altermagnets and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding methods for the most efficient and fastest detection and control of magnetic domains in antiferromagnets is presently among the main challenges of magnetic research at large. We analyse the problem of optical read-out and control of the antiferromagnetic Neel vector using symmetry analysis and the principles of equilibrium thermodynamics. Following the pioneering approach of Dzyaloshinksii, we divide all antiferromagnets in three classes. It is shown that, using the magneto-optical Faraday effect or other effects which scale linearly with the antiferromagnetic Neel vector, it is possible to distinguish antiferromagnetic domains with mutually opposite N\'eel vectors in two of the three classes. Symmetry properties of one of these two classes are similar to those of altermagnets. The analysis also reveals multiple mechanisms to directly excite spins with light for practically every type of antiferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Structure-property relations of silicon oxycarbides studied using a machine learning interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon oxycarbides show outstanding versatility due to their highly tunable composition and microstructure. Consequently, a key challenge is a thorough knowledge of structure-property relations in the system. In this work, we fit an atomic cluster expansion potential to a set of actively learned DFT training data spanning a wide configurational space. We demonstrate the ability of the potential to produce realistic amorphous structures and rationalize the formation of different morphologies of the turbostratic free carbon phase. Finally, we relate the materials stiffness to its composition and microstructure, finding a delicate dependence on Si-C bonds that contradicts commonly assumed relations to the free carbon phase.</description>

      <title>Half-metallic transport and spin-polarized tunneling through the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe${_4}$GeTe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent emergence of van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets has opened new opportunities for designing spintronic devices. We theoretically investigate the coherent spin-dependent transport properties of the vdW ferromagnet Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, by using density functional theory combined with the non-equilibrium Green's functions method. We find that the conductance in the direction perpendicular to the layers is half-metallic, namely it is entirely spin-polarized, as a result of the material's electronic structure. This characteristic persists from bulk to single layer, even under significant bias voltages, and it is little affected by spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation. Motivated by this observation, we then investigate the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect in an magnetic tunnel junction, which comprises two Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ layers separated by the vdW gap acting as insulating barrier. We predict a TMR ratio of almost 500\%, which can be further boosted by increasing the number of Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ layers in the junction.</description>

      <title>A universal crack tip correction algorithm discovered by physical deep symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital image correlation is a widely used technique in the field of experimental mechanics. In fracture mechanics, determining the precise location of the crack tip is crucial. In this paper, we introduce a universal crack tip detection algorithm based on displacement and strain fields obtained by digital image correlation. Iterative crack tip correction formulas are discovered by applying deep symbolic regression guided by physical unit constraints to a dataset of simulated cracks under mode I, II and mixed-mode conditions with variable T-stress. For the training dataset, we fit the Williams series expansion with super-singular terms to the simulated displacement fields at randomly chosen origins around the actual crack tip. We analyse the discovered formulas and apply the most promising one to digital image correlation data obtained from uniaxial and biaxial fatigue crack growth experiments of AA2024-T3 sheet material. Throughout the experiments, the crack tip positions are reliably detected leading to improved stability of the crack propagation curves.</description>

      <title>Efficient All-electron Hybrid Density Functionals for Atomistic Simulations Beyond 10,000 Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid density functional approximations (DFAs) offer compelling accuracy for ab initio electronic-structure simulations of molecules, nanosystems, and bulk materials, addressing some deficiencies of computationally cheaper, frequently used semilocal DFAs. However, the computational bottleneck of hybrid DFAs is the evaluation of the non-local exact exchange contribution, which is the limiting factor for the application of the method for large-scale simulations. In this work, we present a drastically optimized resolution-of-identity-based real-space implementation of the exact exchange evaluation for both non-periodic and periodic boundary conditions in the all-electron code FHI-aims, targeting high-performance CPU compute clusters. The introduction of several new refined Message Passing Interface (MPI) parallelization layers and shared memory arrays according to the MPI-3 standard were the key components of the optimization. We demonstrate significant improvements of memory and performance efficiency, scalability, and workload distribution, extending the reach of hybrid DFAs to simulation sizes beyond ten thousand atoms. As a necessary byproduct of this work, other code parts in FHI-aims have been optimized as well, e.g., the computation of the Hartree potential and the evaluation of the force and stress components. We benchmark the performance and scaling of the hybrid DFA based simulations for a broad range of chemical systems, including hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, organic crystals and ice crystals with up to 30,576 atoms (101,920 electrons described by 244,608 basis functions).</description>

      <title>Beyond structural stabilization of highly-textured AlN thin film: the role of chemical effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystalline quality and degree of c-axis orientation of hexagonal AlN thin films correlate directly with their functional properties. Therefore, achieving AlN thin films of high crystalline quality and texture is of extraordinary importance for many applications, but in particular in electronic devices. Here, we present a systematic study revealing that the growth of c-axis orientated AlN thin films can be governed by a chemical stabilization effect in addition to the conventionally known structural, i.e. strain-induced, stabilization mechanism. The promotion of in-plane growth of AlN grains with c-axis out-of-plane orientation is demonstrated on Y, W or Al seed layers with different thicknesses and crystallinity preliminary exposed to N2 at room temperature. We establish that the stabilization mechanism is chemical in nature: the formation of an N-rich surface layer on the metal seed layers upon exposure to N2 pre-determines the polarity of AlN islands at initial stages of thin film growth while the low energy barrier for the subsequent coalescence of islands of the same polarity contributes to grain growth. These results suggest that the growth of c-axis oriented AlN thin films can be optimized and controlled chemically thus opening more pathways for energy-efficient and controllable AlN thin-film growth processes.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric phases and phase transitions in CsGeBr$_3$ induced by mechanical load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles-based atomistic simulations are used to reveal ferroelectric phases and phase transitions induced in a semiconductor ferroelectric, CsGeBr$_3$, by external loads: hydrostatic pressure, uniaxial and biaxial stresses, and misfit strain. Hydrostatic pressure was found to suppress the Curie point at the rate -0.45$T_C(0)$ K/GPa, where $T_C(0)$ is the zero pressure Curie temperature. Stresses and misfit strains were found to induce additional ferroelectric phase transitions and phases not available under normal conditions. We find that tensile load significantly enhances both the Curie temperature and spontaneous polarization, while compressive load has the opposite effect but with the difference that the Curie temperature is only slightly suppressed. The isothermal dependencies of polarization on pressure and stresses are highly nonlinear, which could result in large nonlinear piezoelectric responses. The phase diagrams reveal the diversity of the phases accessible through mechanical load, which include tetragonal, orthorhombic and monoclinic symmetries in addition to the rhombohedral and cubic ones realizable under normal conditions. We believe that this work reveals the potential of Ge-based halide perovskites for applications in energy converting devices, which is especially significant in the current pursuit of environmental friendly lead-free technologies.</description>

      <title>Defect design in ferroelectrics -- new insights on agglomeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional properties of ferroelectrics and their change with time depend crucially on the defect structure. In particular, point defects and bias fields induced by defect dipoles modify the field hysteresis and play an important role in fatigue and aging. However, a full understanding on how order, agglomeration and strength of defect dipoles affect phase stability and functional properties is still lacking. To close these gaps in knowledge, we screen these parameters by \textit{ab\ initio} based molecular dynamics simulations with the effective Hamiltonian method for the prototypical ferroelectric material (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. Our findings suggest that the {\it{active surface area}} of the defects, rather than the defect concentration is the decisive factor. For a fixed defect concentration, clustering reduces the {\it{active surface area}} and thus the defect-induced changes of phase stability and field hysteresis. Particularly planar agglomerates of defects appear as promising route for the material design as their impact on the field hysteresis can be controlled by the field direction and their impact on the phase stability shows a cross-over with the strength of the defect dipoles. For this agglomeration, we furthermore find that pinched field hysteresis, which is beneficial, e.g. for energy storage, can be achieved for a wide range of defect dipole strengths and thus is not too sensitive to the choice of dopants.</description>

Abstract: Computational materials science produces large quantities of data, both in terms of high-throughput calculations and individual studies. Extracting knowledge from this large and heterogeneous pool of data is challenging due to the wide variety of computational methods and approximations, resulting in significant veracity in the sheer amount of available data. Here, we present MADAS, a Python framework for computing similarity relations between material properties. It can be used to automate the download of data from various sources, compute descriptors and similarities between materials, analyze the relationship between materials through their properties, and can incorporate a variety of existing machine learning methods. We explain the design of the package and demonstrate its power with representative examples.</description>

      <title>Phonon Linewidths in Twisted Bilayer Graphene near Magic Angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computational study of the phonon linewidths in twisted bilayer graphene arising from electron-phonon interactions and anharmonic effects. The electronic structure is calculated using distance-dependent transfer integrals based on the atomistic Slater-Koster tight-binding formalism. Furthermore, electron-electron interactions are treated at the Hartree level. The force constants for the phonon calculations are generated from classical force fields. These ingredients are used to calculate the phonon linewidths arising from electron-phonon interactions. Additionally, we account for the effects of phonon-phonon interactions on the linewidths by computing the mode-projected velocity autocorrelation function from classical molecular dynamics. Our findings show that both electron-phonon and anharmonic effects have a significant impact on the linewidth of the Raman active G mode near the magic angle. We predict a moir\'e potential induced splitting of this mode, which arises due to contributions from high symmetry stacking regions.</description>

      <title>Solving deep-learning density functional theory via variational autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning models, chiefly deep neural networks, have revealed suited to learn accurate energy-density functionals from data. However, problematic instabilities have been shown to occur in the search of ground-state density profiles via energy minimization. Indeed, any small noise can lead astray from realistic profiles, causing the failure of the learned functional and, hence, strong violations of the variational property. In this article, we employ variational autoencoders to build a compressed, flexible, and regular representation of the ground-state density profiles of various quantum models. Performing energy minimization in this compressed space allows us to avoid both numerical instabilities and variational biases due to excessive constraints. Our tests are performed on one-dimensional single-particle models from the literature in the field and, notably, on a three-dimensional disordered potential. In all cases, the ground-state energies are estimated with errors below the chemical accuracy and the density profiles are accurately reproduced without numerical artifacts.</description>

      <title>Layer buckling and absence of superconductivity in LaNiO2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of unconventional superconductivity in thin films of LaNiO2 (critical temperature, Tc~10 K) and in bulk single crystals of La3Ni2O7 (327) under pressure (Tc~80 K), has brought to light a long sought-after class of superconducting nickelates. Through structural measurements in the 327-system, it was shown that the absence of superconductivity is related to bending of the O-Ni-O bonds. Similarly, the bond bending may be linked to the absence of superconductivity in bulk LaNiO2. Neutron diffraction was used on bulk non-superconducting La(1-x)Sr(x)NiO(2) samples to show that the layers are naturally buckled, creating a Ni-O-Ni bond angle of 177 at 2 K and ambient pressure. The buckling angle increases to 170 on warming to room temperature. Furthermore, a broad paramagnetic continuum is observed that decreases in intensity on cooling from room temperature signaling a possible transition to a coherent state. However, no antiferromagnetic (AFM) peaks are detected, although enhancement of ferromagnetic (FM) correlations cannot be excluded.</description>

      <title>Kitaev physics in the two-dimensional magnet NiPSe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kitaev interaction, found in candidate materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, occurs through the metal ($M$)-ligand ($X$)-metal ($M$) paths of the edge-sharing octahedra because the large spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the metal atoms activates directional spin interactions. Here, we show that even in $3d$ transition-metal compounds, where the SOC of the metal atom is negligible, heavy ligands can induce bond-dependent Kitaev interactions. In this work, we take as an example the $3d$ transition-metal chalcogenophosphate NiPSe$_3$ and show that the key is found in the presence of a sizable SOC on the Se $p$ orbital, one which mediates the super-exchange between the nearest-neighbor Ni sites. Our study provides a pathway for engineering enhanced Kitaev interactions through the interplay of SOC strength, lattice distortions, and chemical substitutions.</description>

      <title>Electron screening and strength of long-range Coulomb interactions in phosphorene: From bulk to nanoribbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental observations of anisotropic tightly bound excitons in black phosphorene, and correlated phenomena such as room temperature magnetically active edges in phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs), sparked discussions on the controversial screening of the Coulomb interaction in phosphorene-based materials. In this way, we investigate the first-principles electronic screening of the long-range Coulomb interaction in phosphorene from bulk to nanoribbon by employing ab initio calculations in conjunction with the constrained random-phase approximation. The bands near Fermi energy (E_F) are predominantly pz orbital characters, and due to the puckering, they are not well separated from the other bands with s, px, and specially py characters. This proximity in energy levels increases the contribution of px/py $\rightarrow$ pz transitions to the polarization function and significantly alters the Coulomb parameters. In semiconducting systems, the on-site Coulomb interaction values (Hubbard U) range from 4.1 to 6.5 eV and depend on the correlated subspace, electronic structure, nanoribbon's width, and edge passivation. Our long-range interaction has revealed a non-conventional screening in semiconducting nanoribbons. We have discovered that screening actually enhances the electron-hole interaction for separations larger than a critical distance r_c, which is contrary to what was previously seen in conventional semiconductors. In unpassivated zigzag nanoribbons, due to a metallic screening channel stemming from quasi-flat edge bands at E_F, we find U/W_b &gt; 1 (the bandwidth W_b) and large gradient of inter-site Coulomb interactions, making them correlated materials. We have investigated the instability of the paramagnetic state of bare ZPNRs toward ferromagnetism using a Stoner model based on the calculated Hubbard U parameters.</description>

      <title>Polarized Charge Dynamics of a Novel Charge Density Wave in Kagome FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the charge dynamics of kagome FeGe, an antiferromagnet with a charge density wave (CDW) transition at $T_{\mathrm{CDW}} \simeq 105$ K, using polarized infrared spectroscopy and band structure calculations. We reveal a pronounced optical anisotropy, various excitations associated with flat bands and van Hove singularities (VHSs), and a moderate level of electronic correlations. Notably, there are two types of remarkable spectral weight (SW) redistributions for above and below $T_{\mathrm{CDW}}$. The former involves a transfer between incoherent and coherent excitations driven by the magnetic splitting-induced elevation of flat bands. The latter manifests itself as a sudden change of SW from low to high energies for both $a$ and $c$ directions, suggesting a first-order transition and the three-dimensional nature of CDW. These anomalies in SW significantly differ from those observed in other kagome metals like CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, where the nesting of VHSs results in a pronounced CDW gap feature. Instead, our findings can be accounted for by the jump of VHSs relative to the Fermi energy via a first-order structural transition involving large partial Ge1-dimerization. Our study thus unveils a complex interplay among structure, magnetism, electronic correlations, and charge order in FeGe, offering valuable insights for a comprehensive understanding of CDW order in kagome systems.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous spin chirality reversal and competing phases in the topological magnet EuAl$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the spontaneous reversal of spin chirality in a single crystal sample of the intermetallic magnet EuAl$_4$. We solve the nanoscopic nature of each of the four magnetically phases of EuAl$_4$ using resonant magnetic x-ray scattering, and demonstrate all four phases order with single-k incommensurate magnetic modulation vectors. Below 15.4 K the system forms a spin density modulated spin structure where the spins are orientated in the ab plane perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetic propagation vector. Below 13.2 K a second spin density wave orders with moments aligned parallel to the c-axis, such that the two spin density wave orders coexist. Below 12.2 K a magnetic helix of a single chirality is stabilised across the entire sample. Below 10 K the chirality of the magnetic helix reverses, and the sample remains a single chiral domain. Concomitant with the establishment of the helical magnetic ordering is the lowering of the crystal symmetry to monoclinic, as evidenced the formation of uniaxial charge and spin strip domains. A group theoretical analysis demonstrates that below 12.2 K the symmetry lowers to polar monoclinic, which is necessary to explain the observed asymmetry in the chiral states of the magnetic helix and the spin chiral reversal. We find that in every magnetically ordered phase of EuAl4 the in-plane moment is perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetic propagation vector, which we demonstrate is favoured by magnetic dipolar interactions.</description>

      <title>Spin and Orbital Magnetism by Light in Rutile Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the understanding of altermagnetism is still at a very early stage, it is expected to play a role in various fields of condensed matter research, for example spintronics, caloritronics and superconductivity. In the field of optical magnetism, it is still unclear to which extent altermagnets as a class can exhibit a distinct behavior. Here we choose RuO$_2$, a prototype metallic altermagnet with a giant spin splitting, and CoF$_2$, an experimentally known insulating altermagnet, to study the light-induced magnetism in rutile altermagnets from first-principles. We demonstrate that in the non-relativisic limit the allowed sublattice-resolved orbital response exhibits symmetries, imposed by altermagnetism, which lead to a drastic canting of light-induced moments. On the other hand, we find that inclusion of spin-orbit interaction enhances the overall effect drastically, introduces a significant anisotropy with respect to the light polarization and strongly suppresses the canting of induced moments. Remarkably, we observe that the moments induced by linearly-polarized laser pulses in light altermagnets can even exceed in magnitude those predicted for heavy ferromagnets exposed to circularly polarized light. By resorting to microscopic tools we interpret our results in terms of the altermagnetic spin splittings and of their reciprocal space distribution. Based on our findings, we speculate that optical excitations may provide a unique tool to switch and probe the magnetic state of rutile altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magnetic Skyrmion Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a variational wave function to represent quantum skyrmions as bosonic operators. The operator faithfully reproduces two fundamental features of quantum skyrmions: their classical magnetic order and a "quantum cloud" of local spin-flip excitations. Using exact numerical simulations of the ground states of a 2D chiral magnetic model, we find two regions in the single-skyrmion state diagram distinguished by their leading quantum corrections. We use matrix product state simulations of the adiabatic braiding of two skyrmions to verify that the operator representation of skyrmions is valid at large inter-skyrmion distances. Our work demonstrates that skyrmions can be approximately coarse-grained and represented by bosonic quasiparticles, which paves the way toward a field theory of many-skyrmion quantum phases which, unlike other approaches, incorporates the microscopic quantum fluctuations of individual skyrmions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond is an increasingly popular quantum sensor for microscopy of electrical current, magnetization, and spins. However, efficient NV-sample integration with a robust, high-quality interface remains an outstanding challenge to realize scalable, high-throughput microscopy. In this work, we characterize a diamond micro-chip (DMC) containing a (111)-oriented NV ensemble; and demonstrate its utility for high-resolution quantum microscopy. We perform strain imaging of the DMC and find minimal detrimental strain variation across a field-of-view of tens of micrometer. We find good ensemble NV spin coherence and optical properties in the DMC, suitable for sensitive magnetometry. We then use the DMC to demonstrate wide-field microscopy of electrical current, and show that diffraction-limited quantum microscopy can be achieved. We also demonstrate the deterministic transfer of DMCs with multiple materials of interest for next-generation electronics and spintronics. Lastly, we develop a polymer-based technique for DMC placement. This work establishes the DMC's potential to expand the application of NV quantum microscopy in materials, device, geological, biomedical, and chemical sciences.</description>

      <title>Optical control of 4f orbital state in rare-earth metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.09999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A change of orbital state alters the coupling between ions and their surroundings drastically. Orbital excitations are hence key to understand and control interaction of ions. Rare-earth (RE) elements with strong magneto-crystalline anisotropy (MCA) are important ingredients for magnetic devices. Thus, control of their localized 4f magnetic moments and anisotropy is one major challenge in ultrafast spin physics. With time-resolved X-ray absorption and resonant inelastic scattering experiments, we show for Tb metal that 4f-electronic excitations out of the ground state multiplet occur after optical pumping. These excitations are driven by inelastic 5d-4f-electron scattering, alter the 4f-orbital state and consequently the MCA with important implications for magnetization dynamics in 4f-metals, and more general for the excitation of localized electronic states in correlated materials.</description>

Abstract: Thermal conductivity is a fundamental material property that plays an essential role in technology, but its accurate evaluation presents a challenge for theory. In this work, we demonstrate the application of $E(3)$-equivariant neutral network interatomic potentials within Green-Kubo formalism to determine the lattice thermal conductivity in amorphous and crystalline materials. We apply this method to study the thermal conductivity of germanium telluride (GeTe) as a prototypical phase change material. A single deep learning interatomic potential is able to describe the phase transitions between the amorphous, rhombohedral and cubic phases, with critical temperatures in good agreement with experiments. Furthermore, this approach accurately captures the pronounced anharmonicity that is present in GeTe, enabling precise calculations of the thermal conductivity. In contrast, the Boltzmann transport equation including only three-phonon processes tends to overestimate the thermal conductivity by approximately a factor of 2 in the crystalline phases.</description>

      <title>Gap and magnetic engineering via doping and pressure in tuning the colossal magnetoresistance in (Mn$_{1-x}$Mg$_x$)$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ keeps the records of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and angular magnetoresistance (AMR). Here we report tuning the electronic transport properties via doping and pressure in (Mn$_{1-x}$Mg$_x$)$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. As the substitution of nonmagnetic Mg$^{2+}$ for magnetic Mn$^{2+}$, ferrimagnetic transition temperature $T_C$ gradually decreases, while the resistivity increases significantly. At the same time, the CMR and AMR are both enhanced for the low-doping compositions (e.g., $x = 0.1$ and 0.2), which can be attributed to doping-induced broadening of the band gap and a larger variation range of the resistivity when undergoing a metal-insulator transition by applying a magnetic field along the $c$ axis. On the contrary, $T_C$ rises with increasing pressure due to the enhancement of the magnetic exchange interactions until a structural transition occurs at $\sim$13 GPa. Meanwhile, the activation gap is lowered under pressure and the magnetoresistance is decreased dramatically above 6 GPa where the gap is closed. At 20 and 26 GPa, evidences for a superconducting transition at $\sim$5 K are observed. The results reveal that doping and pressure are effective methods to tune the activation gap, and correspondingly, the CMR and AMR in nodal-line semiconductors, providing an approach to investigate the magnetoresistance materials for novel spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Ultrathin bismuth exhibits rich physics including strong spin-orbit coupling, ferroelectricity, nontrivial topology, and light-induced structural dynamics. We use \textit{ab initio} calculations to show that light can induce structural transitions to four transient phases in bismuth monolayers. These light-induced phases exhibit nontrivial topological character, which we illustrate using the recently introduced concept of spin bands and spin-resolved Wilson loops. Specifically, we find that the topology changes via the closing of the electron and spin band gaps during photo-induced structural phase transitions, leading to distinct edge states. Our study provides strategies to tailor electronic and spin topology via ultrafast control of photo-excited carriers and associated structural dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Here we report on Landau level spectroscopy of an epitaxially grown thin film of the topological insulator Sb2Te3, complemented by ellipsometry and magneto-transport measurements. The observed response suggests that Sb2Te3 is a direct-gap semiconductor with the fundamental band gap located at the \Gamma point, or along the trigonal axis, and its width reaches Eg = 190 meV at low temperatures. Our data also indicate the presence of other low-energy extrema with a higher multiplicity in both the conduction and valence bands. The conclusions based on our experimental data are confronted with and to a great extent corroborated by the electronic band structure calculated using the GW method.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field-Induced Domain Walls in Wurtzite Ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wurtzite ferroelectrics possess transformative potential for next-generation microelectronics. A comprehensive understanding of their ferroelectric properties and domain energetics is crucial for tailoring their ferroelectric characteristics and exploiting their functional properties in practical devices. Despite burgeoning interest, the exact configurations, and electronic structures of the domain walls in wurtzite ferroelectrics remain elusive. In this work, we elucidate the atomic configurations and electronic properties of electric-field-induced domain walls in ferroelectric ScGaN. By combining transmission electron microscopy and theoretical calculations, a novel charged domain wall with a buckled two-dimensional hexagonal phase is revealed. The dangling bonds associated with these domain walls give rise to unprecedented metallic-like mid-gap states within the forbidden band. Quantitative analysis further unveils a universal charge-compensation mechanism stabilizing antipolar domain walls in ferroelectric materials, wherein the polarization discontinuity at the 180{\deg} domain wall is compensated by the dangling bond electrons. Furthermore, the reconfigurable conductivity of these domain walls is experimentally demonstrated, showcasing their potential for ultra-scaled device applications. Our findings represent a pivotal advancement in understanding the structural and electronic properties of wurtzite ferroelectric domain walls and lay the groundwork for fundamental physics studies and device applications.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous gap opening and potential excitonic states in an ideal Dirac semimetal Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The opening of an energy gap in the electronic structure generally indicates the presence of interactions. In materials with low carrier density and short screening length, long-range Coulomb interaction favors the spontaneous formation of electron-hole pairs, so-called excitons, opening an excitonic gap at the Fermi level. Excitonic materials host unique phenomenons associated with pair excitations. However, there is still no generally recognized single-crystal material with excitonic order, which is, therefore, awaited in condensed matter physics. Here, we show that excitonic states may exist in the quasi-one-dimensional material Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$, which has an almost ideal Dirac-like band structure, with Dirac point located exactly at Fermi level. We find that an energy gap appears at 350 K, and it grows with decreasing temperature. The spontaneous gap opening is absent in a similar material Ta$_2$Ni$_3$Te$_5$. Intriguingly, the gap is destroyed by the potassium deposition on the crystal, likely due to extra-doped carriers. Furthermore, we observe a pair of in-gap flat bands, which is an analog of the impurity states in a superconducting gap. All these observations can be properly explained by an excitonic order, providing Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ as a new and promising candidate realizing excitonic states.</description>

      <title>From anti-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior in a dislocation-obstacle bypass: Atomistic Simulations and Theoretical Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dislocations are the primary carriers of plasticity in metallic material. Understanding the basic mechanisms for dislocation movement is paramount to predicting the material mechanical response. Relying on atomistic simulations, we observe a transition from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior in the rate for an edge dislocation to overcome the elastic interaction with a prismatic loop in tungsten. Beyond the critical resolved shear stress, the process shows a non-Arrhenius behavior at low temperatures. However, as the temperature increases, the activation entropy starts to dominate, leading to a traditional Arrhenius behavior. We have computed the activation entropy analytically along the minimum energy path following Schoeck's methods [1], which capture the cross-over between anti-Arrhenius and Arrhenius domains. Also, the Projected Average Force Integrator (PAFI) [2], another simulation method to compute free energies along an initial transition path, exhibits considerable concurrence with Schoeck's formalism. We conclude that entropic effects need to be considered to understand processes involving dislocations bypassing elastic barriers close to the critical resolved shear stress. More work needs to be performed to fully understand the discrepancies between Schoeck's and PAFI results compared to molecular dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys are under consideration for applications where materials are subjected to high temperatures and levels of radiation, such as in the fusion power sector. However, at present, their scope is limited because they are highly brittle at room temperature. One suggested route to mitigate this issue is by alloying with Ti. In this theoretical study, using a computationally efficient linear-response theory based on density functional theory calculations of the electronic structure of the disordered alloys, we study the nature of atomic short-range order in these multi-component materials, as well as assessing their overall phase stability. Our analysis enables direct inference of phase transitions in addition to the extraction of an atomistic, pairwise model of the internal energy of an alloy suitable for study via, e.g. Monte Carlo simulations. Once Ti is added into either the NbMoTaW or VNbMoTaW system, we find that there is competition between chemical phase ordering and segregation. These results shed light on observed chemical inhomogeneity in experimental samples, as well as providing fundamental insight into the physics of these complex systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis of Pentlandite due to the Increases in Coordination Number and Sulfur Vacancy during Cubic-Hexagonal Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13348v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for new phases is an important direction in materials science. The phase transition of sulfides results in significant changes in catalytic performance, such as MoS2 and WS2. Cubic pentlandite [cPn, (Fe, Ni)9S8] can be a functional material in batteries, solar cells, and catalytic fields. However, no report about the material properties of other phases of pentlandite exists. In this study, the unit-cell parameters of a new phase of pentlandite, sulfur-vacancy enriched hexagonal pentlandite (hPn), and the phase boundary between cPn and hPn were determined for the first time. Compared to cPn, the hPn shows a high coordination number, more sulfur vacancies, and high conductivity, which result in significantly higher hydrogen evolution performance of hPn than that of cPn and make the non-nano rock catalyst hPn superior to other most known nanosulfide catalysts. The increase of sulfur vacancies during phase transition provides a new approach to designing functional materials.</description>

      <title>Towards reliable synthesis of superconducting infinite layer nickelate thin films by topochemical reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infinite layer nickelates provide a new route beyond copper oxides to address outstanding questions in the field of unconventional superconductivity. However, their synthesis poses considerable challenges, largely hindering experimental research on this new class of oxide superconductors. That synthesis is achieved in a two-step process that yields the most thermodynamically stable perovskite phase first, then the infinite-layer phase by topotactic reduction, the quality of the starting phase playing a crucial role. Here, we report on reliable synthesis of superconducting infinite-layer nickelate films after successive topochemical reductions of a parent perovskite phase with nearly optimal stoichiometry. Careful analysis of the transport properties of the incompletely reduced films reveals an improvement of the strange metal behaviour of their normal state resistivity over subsequent topochemical reductions, offering insight into the reduction process.</description>

      <title>Minimal Models for Altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets feature vanishing net magnetization, like antiferromagnets, but exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking and momentum-dependent spin-split band structures. Motivated by the prevalence of altermagnetic materials with non-symmorphic symmetry-dictated band degeneracies, we provide realistic minimal models for altermagnetism by constructing tight-binding models for nonsymmorphic space groups with a sublattice defined by two magnetic atoms. These models can be applied to monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, rhombohedral, hexagonal, and cubic materials and can describe d-wave, g-wave, and i-wave altermagnetism. By examining the altermagnetic susceptibility and mean field instabilities within a Hubbard model we reveal that these models have altermagnetic ground states and yield a Berry curvature that is linear in the spin-orbit coupling. We apply our models to RuO$_2$, MnF$_2$, FeSb$_2$, $\kappa$-Cl, CrSb, and MnTe.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved random telegraph fluctuations of a single trap at the Si/SiO2 interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use electrostatic force microscopy to spatially resolve random telegraph noise at the Si/SiO$_2$ interface. Our measurements demonstrate that two-state fluctuations are localized at interfacial traps, with bias-dependent rates and amplitudes. These two-level systems lead to correlated carrier number and mobility fluctuations with a range of characteristic timescales; taken together as an ensemble, they give rise to a $1/f$ power spectral trend. Such individual defect fluctuations at the Si/SiO$_2$ interface impair the performance and reliability of nanoscale semiconductor devices, and will be a significant source of noise in semiconductor-based quantum sensors and computers. The fluctuations measured here are associated with a four-fold competition of rates, including slow two-state switching on the order of seconds and, in one state, fast switching on the order of nanoseconds which is associated with energy loss.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic critical slowing down in complex systems: from statics to dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider second-order phase transitions in which the order parameter is a replicated overlap matrix. We focus on a tricritical point that occurs in a variety of mean-field models and that, more generically, describes higher order liquid-liquid or liquid-glass transitions. We show that the static replicated theory implies slowing down with a logarithmic decay in time. The dynamical equations turn out to be those predicted by schematic Mode Coupling Theory for supercooled viscous liquids at a $A_3$ singularity, where the parameter exponent is $\lambda=1$. We obtain a quantitative expression for the parameter $\mu$ of the logarithmic decay in terms of cumulants of the overlap, which are physically observable in experiments or numerical simulations.</description>
