      <title>A One Dimensional (1D) Computational Fluid Dynamics Study of Fontan-Associated Liver Disease (FALD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fontan-Associated Liver Disease (FALD) is a disorder arising from hemodynamic changes and venous congestion in the liver. This disease is prominent in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Although HLHS patients typically survive into adulthood, they have reduced cardiac output due to their univentricular physiology (i.e., a Fontan circuit). As a result, they have insufficient blood delivery to the liver. In comparison, patients with double outlet right ventricle (DORV), also having a univentricular circuit, have lower incidence of FALD. In this study, we use a patient-specific, one-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (1D-CFD) model to predict hemodynamics in the liver of an HLHS patient and compare predictions with an age- and size-matched DORV control patient. Additionally, we simulate FALD conditions in the HLHS patient to predict hemodynamic changes across various stages of disease progression. Our results show that the HLHS patient has a higher portal venous pressure compared to the DORV patient. This difference is exacerbated as FALD conditions progress. The wall shear stress (WSS) is also higher than normal for the HLHS patient, suggesting vascular remodeling. WSS decreases slightly under FALD conditions, consistent with the development of portal hypertension. Perfusion analysis gives insight into regions of liver tissue at risk for fibrosis development, showing increasing pressures and reduced flow throughout the liver tissue fed by the portal vein under FALD conditions. Our results provide insight into the specific hemodynamic changes in Fontan circulation that can cause FALD.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of patient activation and dosimetry after Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a form of radiotherapy based on the irradiation of the tumour with a low energy neutron beam, after the administration of a selective drug enriched in boron-10. The therapy exploits the high cross section of thermal neutron capture in boron, generating two low-range charged particles. The availability of accelerators able to generate high-intensity neutron beams via proton nuclear interaction is boosting the construction of new clinical centres. One of these is under development in Italy, using a 5 MeV, 30 mA proton radiofrequency accelerator coupled to a beryllium target, funded by the Complementary Plan to the Recovery and Resilience National Plan, under the project ANTHEM. The present study focuses on radiation protection aspects of patients undergoing BNCT, specifically on the activation of their organs and tissues. A criterion to establish the relevance of such activation after BNCT has been proposed. Based on the current Italian regulatory framework, the level of patient activation following BNCT treatment does not pose a significant radiological concern, even shortly after irradiation. Another aspect is the activation of patient's excretions, which can impact on the design of the building and requires a process for the discharge. The described study contributes to the radiation protection study for the ANTHEM BNCT centre in Italy.</description>

      <title>Analyzer-less X-ray Interferometry with Super-Resolution Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of super-resolution methods for X-ray grating interferometry without an analyzer with detectors that fail to meet the Nyquist sampling rate needed for traditional image recovery algorithms. This method enables Talbot-Lau interferometry without the X-ray absorbing analyzer and allows for higher autocorrelation lengths for the analyzer-less Modulated Phase Grating Interferometer. This will allow for reduced X-ray dose and higher autocorrelation lengths than previously accessible. We demonstrate the use of super-resolution methods to iteratively reconstruct attenuation, differential-phase, and dark-field images using simulations of a one-dimensional lung phantom with tumors. For a fringe period of pD = 22 {\mu}m, we compare the simulated imaging performance of interferometers with a 30 {\mu}m and 50 {\mu}m detector for various signal-to-noise ratios. We show that our super-resolution iterative reconstruction methods are highly robust and can be used to improve grating interferometry for cases where traditional algorithms cannot be used.</description>

      <title>Efficient treatment of heterogeneous malignant cell populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When confronted with an undesired cell population, such as bacterial infections or tumors, we seek the most effective treatment, designed to eliminate the population as rapidly as possible. A common practice is to monitor the cells short-term response to the treatment, and from that, extrapolate the eventual treatment outcome, i.e. will it eradicate the cells, and if yes at what timescales. Underlying this approach is the assumption that the cells exhibit a homogeneous response to the treatment, and hence the early response patterns can be naturally extended to later times. Recent experiments on cancer cell populations, however, indicate a significant level of cellular heterogeneity, undermining this classic assessment protocol of treatment efficacy. We, therefore, develop here a stochastic framework, to analytically predict the temporal dynamics of a heterogeneous cell population. Quite often, we find, the average cellular parameters, governing the short-term response, fail to predict the actual treatment outcome. In contrast, our analysis, which also incorporates the populations variability, helps identify the relevant statistical parameters, which in turn, enable us to predict the full trajectory of the cell population, and specifically - the likelihood and typical timescales for remission.</description>

      <title>A double multi-turn injection scheme for generating mixed helium and carbon ion beams at medical synchrotron facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The almost identical charge-to-mass ratios of fully ionized helium-4 and carbon-12 ions enable simultaneous acceleration in hadron therapy synchrotrons. At the same energy per mass, helium ions exhibit a stopping range approximately three times greater than carbon ions. They can therefore be exploited for online range verification downstream of the patient during carbon ion beam irradiation. One possibility for creating this mixed beam is accelerating the two ion species sequentially through the LINAC and subsequently "mixing" them at injection energy in the synchrotron with a double injection scheme. This work reports the first successful generation, acceleration, and extraction of a mixed helium and carbon ion beam using this double multi-turn injection scheme, which was achieved at the MedAustron therapy accelerator in Austria. A description of the double multi-turn injection scheme, particle tracking simulations, and details on the implementation at the MedAustron accelerator facility are presented and discussed. Finally, measurements of the mixed beam at delivery in the irradiation room using a radiochromic film and a low-gain avalanche diode (LGAD) detector are presented.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Deep Learning-based Scatter Correction on a Long-axial Field-of-view PET scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Long-axial field-of-view (LAFOV) positron emission tomography (PET) systems allow higher sensitivity, with an increased number of detected lines of response induced by a larger angle of acceptance. However this extend angle increase the number of multiple scatters and the scatter contribution within oblique planes. As scattering affects both quality and quantification of the reconstructed image, it is crucial to correct this effect with more accurate methods than the state-of-the-art single scatter simulation (SSS) that can reach its limits with such an extended field-of-view (FOV). In this work, which is an extension of our previous assessment of deep learning-based scatter estimation (DLSE) carried out on a conventional PET system, we aim to evaluate the DLSE method performance on LAFOV total-body PET.
  Approach: The proposed DLSE method based on an convolutional neural network (CNN) U-Net architecture uses emission and attenuation sinograms to estimate scatter sinogram. The network was trained from Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations of XCAT phantoms [18F]-FDG PET acquisitions using a Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra scanner model, with multiple morphologies and dose distributions. We firstly evaluated the method performance on simulated data in both sinogram and image domain by comparing it to the MC ground truth and SSS scatter sinograms. We then tested the method on 7 [18F]-FDG and 7 [18F]-PSMA clinical datasets, and compare it to SSS estimations.
  Results: DLSE showed superior accuracy on phantom data, greater robustness to patient size and dose variations compared to SSS, and better lesion contrast recovery. It also yielded promising clinical results, improving lesion contrasts in [18 F]-FDG datasets and performing consistently with [18F]-PSMA datasets despite no training with [18F]-PSMA.</description>

      <title>MD-Dose: A diffusion model based on the Mamba for radiation dose prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation therapy is crucial in cancer treatment. Experienced experts typically iteratively generate high-quality dose distribution maps, forming the basis for excellent radiation therapy plans. Therefore, automated prediction of dose distribution maps is significant in expediting the treatment process and providing a better starting point for developing radiation therapy plans. With the remarkable results of diffusion models in predicting high-frequency regions of dose distribution maps, dose prediction methods based on diffusion models have been extensively studied. However, existing methods mainly utilize CNNs or Transformers as denoising networks. CNNs lack the capture of global receptive fields, resulting in suboptimal prediction performance. Transformers excel in global modeling but face quadratic complexity with image size, resulting in significant computational overhead. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel diffusion model, MD-Dose, based on the Mamba architecture for predicting radiation therapy dose distribution in thoracic cancer patients. In the forward process, MD-Dose adds Gaussian noise to dose distribution maps to obtain pure noise images. In the backward process, MD-Dose utilizes a noise predictor based on the Mamba to predict the noise, ultimately outputting the dose distribution maps. Furthermore, We develop a Mamba encoder to extract structural information and integrate it into the noise predictor for localizing dose regions in the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs). Through extensive experiments on a dataset of 300 thoracic tumor patients, we showcase the superiority of MD-Dose in various metrics and time consumption.</description>
