      <title>Singular knee identification to support emergence recognition in physical swarm and cellular automata trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After decades of attention, emergence continues to lack a centralized mathematical definition that leads to a rigorous emergence test applicable to physical flocks and swarms, particularly those containing both deterministic elements (eg, interactions) and stochastic perturbations like measurement noise. This study develops a heuristic test based on singular value curve analysis of data matrices containing deterministic and Gaussian noise signals. The minimum detection criteria are identified, and statistical and matrix space analysis developed to determine upper and lower bounds. This study applies the analysis to representative examples by using recorded trajectories of mixed deterministic and stochastic trajectories for multi-agent, cellular automata, and biological video. Examples include Cucker Smale and Vicsek flocking, Gaussian noise and its integration, recorded observations of bird flocking, and 1D cellular automata. Ensemble simulations including measurement noise are performed to compute statistical variation and discussed relative to random matrix theory noise bounds. The results indicate singular knee analysis of recorded trajectories can detect gradated levels on a continuum of structure and noise. Across the eight singular value decay metrics considered, the angle subtended at the singular value knee emerges with the most potential for supporting cross-embodiment emergence detection, the size of noise bounds is used as an indication of required sample size, and the presence of a large fraction of singular values inside noise bounds as an indication of noise.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation with Karma Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monetary markets serve as established resource allocation mechanisms, typically achieving efficient solutions with limited information. However, they are susceptible to market failures, particularly under the presence of public goods, externalities, or inequality of economic power. Moreover, in many resource allocating contexts, money faces social, ethical, and legal constraints. Consequently, research increasingly explores artificial currencies and non-monetary markets, with Karma emerging as a notable concept. Karma, a non-tradeable, resource-inherent currency for prosumer resources, operates on the principles of contribution and consumption of specific resources. It embodies fairness, near incentive compatibility, Pareto-efficiency, robustness to population heterogeneity, and can incentivize a reduction in resource scarcity. The literature on Karma is scattered across disciplines, varies in scope, and lacks of conceptual clarity and coherence. Thus, this study undertakes a comprehensive review of the Karma mechanism, systematically comparing its resource allocation applications and elucidating overlooked mechanism design elements. Through a systematic mapping study, this review situates Karma within its literature context, offers a structured design parameter framework, and develops a road-map for future research directions.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Decision Making for Air Taxi Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future urban air mobility systems are expected to be operated by rideshare companies as fleets, which will require fully autonomous air traffic control systems and an order of magnitude increase in airspace capacity. Such a system must not only be safe, but also highly responsive to customer demand. This paper proposes the air traffic network problem (ATNP), which models the optimization problem of future cooperative air taxi networks. We propose a three-phase decision making model that efficiently assigns vehicles to passengers, determines flight levels to reduce collision risk, and resolves aircraft conflicts by selectively applying Monte Carlo tree search. We develop a simulator for the ATNP and show that our approach has increased safety and reduced passenger waiting time compared to greedy and first-dispatch protocols over potential vertiport layouts across the Bay Area and New York City.</description>

      <title>Effects of non-uniform number of actions by Hawkes process on spatial cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of cooperative behavior, despite natural selection favoring rational self-interest, presents a significant evolutionary puzzle. Evolutionary game theory elucidates why cooperative behavior can be advantageous for survival. However, the impact of non-uniformity in the frequency of actions, particularly when actions are altered in the short term, has received little scholarly attention. To demonstrate the relationship between the non-uniformity in the frequency of actions and the evolution of cooperation, we conducted multi-agent simulations of evolutionary games. In our model, each agent performs actions in a chain-reaction, resulting in a non-uniform distribution of the number of actions. To achieve a variety of non-uniform action frequency, we introduced two types of chain-reaction rules: one where an agent's actions trigger subsequent actions, and another where an agent's actions depend on the actions of others. Our results revealed that cooperation evolves more effectively in scenarios with even slight non-uniformity in action frequency compared to completely uniform cases. In addition, scenarios where agents' actions are primarily triggered by their own previous actions more effectively support cooperation, whereas those triggered by others' actions are less effective. This implies that a few highly active individuals contribute positively to cooperation, while the tendency to follow others' actions can hinder it.</description>

      <title>Towards General Negotiation Strategies with End-to-End Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research field of automated negotiation has a long history of designing agents that can negotiate with other agents. Such negotiation strategies are traditionally based on manual design and heuristics. More recently, reinforcement learning approaches have also been used to train agents to negotiate. However, negotiation problems are diverse, causing observation and action dimensions to change, which cannot be handled by default linear policy networks. Previous work on this topic has circumvented this issue either by fixing the negotiation problem, causing policies to be non-transferable between negotiation problems or by abstracting the observations and actions into fixed-size representations, causing loss of information and expressiveness due to feature design. We developed an end-to-end reinforcement learning method for diverse negotiation problems by representing observations and actions as a graph and applying graph neural networks in the policy. With empirical evaluations, we show that our method is effective and that we can learn to negotiate with other agents on never-before-seen negotiation problems. Our result opens up new opportunities for reinforcement learning in negotiation agents.</description>

      <title>Generating geographically and economically realistic large-scale synthetic contact networks: A general method using publicly available data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic contact networks are useful for modeling epidemic spread and social transmission, but data to infer realistic contact patterns that take account of assortative connections at the geographic and economic levels is limited. We developed a method to generate synthetic contact networks for any region of the United States based on publicly available data. First, we generate a synthetic population of individuals within households from US census data using combinatorial optimization. Then, individuals are assigned to workplaces and schools using commute data, employment statistics, and school enrollment data. The resulting population is then connected into a realistic contact network using graph generation algorithms. We test the method on two census regions and show that the synthetic populations accurately reflect the source data. We further show that the contact networks have distinct properties compared to networks generated without a synthetic population, and that those differences affect the rate of disease transmission in an epidemiological simulation. We provide open-source software to generate a synthetic population and contact network for any area within the US.</description>

      <title>MultiAgent Collaboration Attack: Investigating Adversarial Attacks in Large Language Model Collaborations via Debate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional results on current benchmarks when working individually. The advancement in their capabilities, along with a reduction in parameter size and inference times, has facilitated the use of these models as agents, enabling interactions among multiple models to execute complex tasks. Such collaborations offer several advantages, including the use of specialized models (e.g. coding), improved confidence through multiple computations, and enhanced divergent thinking, leading to more diverse outputs. Thus, the collaborative use of language models is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. In this work, we evaluate the behavior of a network of models collaborating through debate under the influence of an adversary. We introduce pertinent metrics to assess the adversary's effectiveness, focusing on system accuracy and model agreement. Our findings highlight the importance of a model's persuasive ability in influencing others. Additionally, we explore inference-time methods to generate more compelling arguments and evaluate the potential of prompt-based mitigation as a defensive strategy.</description>

      <title>Cooperative bots exhibit nuanced effects on cooperation across strategic frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The positive impact of cooperative bots on cooperation within evolutionary game theory is well documented; however, existing studies have predominantly used discrete strategic frameworks, focusing on deterministic actions with a fixed probability of one. This paper extends the investigation to continuous and mixed strategic approaches. Continuous strategies employ intermediate probabilities to convey varying degrees of cooperation and focus on expected payoffs. In contrast, mixed strategies calculate immediate payoffs from actions chosen at a given moment within these probabilities. Using the prisoner's dilemma game, this study examines the effects of cooperative bots on human cooperation within hybrid populations of human players and simple bots, across both well-mixed and structured populations. Our findings reveal that cooperative bots significantly enhance cooperation in both population types across these strategic approaches under weak imitation scenarios, where players are less concerned with material gains. However, under strong imitation scenarios, while cooperative bots do not alter the defective equilibrium in well-mixed populations, they have varied impacts in structured populations across these strategic approaches. Specifically, they disrupt cooperation under discrete and continuous strategies but facilitate it under mixed strategies. These results highlight the nuanced effects of cooperative bots within different strategic frameworks and underscore the need for careful deployment, as their effectiveness is highly sensitive to how humans update their actions and their chosen strategic approach.</description>

      <title>Social learning with complex contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical model that combines the concepts of complex contagion with payoff-biased imitation, to describe how social behaviors spread through a population. Traditional models of social learning by imitation are based on simple contagion -- where an individual may imitate a more successful neighbor following a single interaction. Our framework generalizes this process to incorporate complex contagion, which requires multiple exposures before an individual considers adopting a different behavior. We formulate this as a discrete time and state stochastic process in a finite population, and we derive its continuum limit as an ordinary differential equation that generalizes the replicator equation, the most widely used dynamical model in evolutionary game theory. When applied to linear frequency-dependent games, our social learning with complex contagion produces qualitatively different outcomes than traditional imitation dynamics: it can shift the Prisoner's Dilemma from a unique all-defector equilibrium to either a stable mixture of cooperators and defectors in the population, or a bistable system; it changes the Snowdrift game from a single to a bistable equilibrium; and it can alter the Coordination game from bistability at the boundaries to two internal equilibria. The long-term outcome depends on the balance between the complexity of the contagion process and the strength of selection that biases imitation towards more successful types. Our analysis intercalates the fields of evolutionary game theory with complex contagions, and it provides a synthetic framework that describes more realistic forms of behavioral change in social systems.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Agents for Collaborative Task under Information Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have achieved great progress in solving complex tasks. It performs communication among agents within the system to collaboratively solve tasks, under the premise of shared information. However, when agents' communication is leveraged to enhance human cooperation, a new challenge arises due to information asymmetry, since each agent can only access the information of its human user. Previous MAS struggle to complete tasks under this condition. To address this, we propose a new MAS paradigm termed iAgents, which denotes Informative Multi-Agent Systems. In iAgents, the human social network is mirrored in the agent network, where agents proactively exchange human information necessary for task resolution, thereby overcoming information asymmetry. iAgents employs a novel agent reasoning mechanism, InfoNav, to navigate agents' communication towards effective information exchange. Together with InfoNav, iAgents organizes human information in a mixed memory to provide agents with accurate and comprehensive information for exchange. Additionally, we introduce InformativeBench, the first benchmark tailored for evaluating LLM agents' task-solving ability under information asymmetry. Experimental results show that iAgents can collaborate within a social network of 140 individuals and 588 relationships, autonomously communicate over 30 turns, and retrieve information from nearly 70,000 messages to complete tasks within 3 minutes.</description>

      <title>Phase-Bounded Broadcast Networks over Topologies of Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study networks of processes that all execute the same finite state protocol and that communicate through broadcasts. The processes are organized in a graph (a topology) and only the neighbors of a process in this graph can receive its broadcasts. The coverability problem asks, given a protocol and a state of the protocol, whether there is a topology for the processes such that one of them (at least) reaches the given state. This problem is undecidable. We study here an under-approximation of the problem where processes alternate a bounded number of times $k$ between phases of broadcasting and phases of receiving messages. We show that, if the problem remains undecidable when $k$ is greater than 6, it becomes decidable for $k=2$, and EXPSPACE-complete for $k=1$. Furthermore, we show that if we restrict ourselves to line topologies, the problem is in $P$ for $k=1$ and $k=2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional manufacturing faces challenges adapting to dynamic environments and quickly responding to manufacturing changes. The use of multi-agent systems has improved adaptability and coordination but requires further advancements in rapid human instruction comprehension, operational adaptability, and coordination through natural language integration. Large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 enhance multi-agent manufacturing systems by enabling agents to communicate in natural language and interpret human instructions for decision-making. This research introduces a novel framework where large language models enhance the capabilities of agents in manufacturing, making them more adaptable, and capable of processing context-specific instructions. A case study demonstrates the practical application of this framework, showing how agents can effectively communicate, understand tasks, and execute manufacturing processes, including precise G-code allocation among agents. The findings highlight the importance of continuous large language model integration into multi-agent manufacturing systems and the development of sophisticated agent communication protocols for a more flexible manufacturing system.</description>

      <title>ArgMed-Agents: Explainable Clinical Decision Reasoning with LLM Disscusion via Argumentation Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are two main barriers to using large language models (LLMs) in clinical reasoning. Firstly, while LLMs exhibit significant promise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their performance in complex reasoning and planning falls short of expectations. Secondly, LLMs use uninterpretable methods to make clinical decisions that are fundamentally different from the clinician's cognitive processes. This leads to user distrust. In this paper, we present a multi-agent framework called ArgMed-Agents, which aims to enable LLM-based agents to make explainable clinical decision reasoning through interaction. ArgMed-Agents performs self-argumentation iterations via Argumentation Scheme for Clinical Discussion (a reasoning mechanism for modeling cognitive processes in clinical reasoning), and then constructs the argumentation process as a directed graph representing conflicting relationships. Ultimately, use symbolic solver to identify a series of rational and coherent arguments to support decision. We construct a formal model of ArgMed-Agents and present conjectures for theoretical guarantees. ArgMed-Agents enables LLMs to mimic the process of clinical argumentative reasoning by generating explanations of reasoning in a self-directed manner. The setup experiments show that ArgMed-Agents not only improves accuracy in complex clinical decision reasoning problems compared to other prompt methods, but more importantly, it provides users with decision explanations that increase their confidence.</description>

      <title>Fusion-PSRO: Nash Policy Fusion for Policy Space Response Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21027v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A popular approach for solving zero-sum games is to maintain populations of policies to approximate the Nash Equilibrium (NE). Previous studies have shown that Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO) algorithm is an effective multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for solving such games. However, repeatedly training new policies from scratch to approximate Best Response (BR) to opponents' mixed policies at each iteration is both inefficient and costly. While some PSRO variants initialize a new policy by inheriting from past BR policies, this approach limits the exploration of new policies, especially against challenging opponents. To address this issue, we propose Fusion-PSRO, which employs policy fusion to initialize policies for better approximation to BR. By selecting high-quality base policies from meta-NE, policy fusion fuses the base policies into a new policy through model averaging. This approach allows the initialized policies to incorporate multiple expert policies, making it easier to handle difficult opponents compared to inheriting from past BR policies or initializing from scratch. Moreover, our method only modifies the policy initialization phase, allowing its application to nearly all PSRO variants without additional training overhead. Our experiments on non-transitive matrix games, Leduc Poker, and the more complex Liars Dice demonstrate that Fusion-PSRO enhances the performance of nearly all PSRO variants, achieving lower exploitability.</description>
