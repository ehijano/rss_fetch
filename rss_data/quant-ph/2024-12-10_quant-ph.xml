      <title>The quantum magic of fermionic Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method to quantify nonstabilizerness in fermionic Gaussian states, overcoming the long-standing challenge posed by their extensive entanglement. Using a perfect sampling scheme based on an underlying determinantal point process, we compute the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies (SREs) for systems with hundreds of qubits. Benchmarking on random Gaussian states with and without particle conservation, we reveal an extensive leading behavior equal to that of Haar random states, with logarithmic subleading corrections. We support these findings with analytical calculations for a set of related quantities, the participation entropies in the computational (or Fock) basis, for which we derive an exact formula. Applying the sampling algorithm to a two-dimensional free-fermionic topological model, we uncover a sharp transition in magic at the topological phase boundary, highlighting the power of our approach in exploring different phases of quantum many-body systems, even in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Spectrally-Pure Optical Serrodyne Modulation for Continuously-Tunable Laser Offset Locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The comb-like spectrum added to laser light by an electro-optic modulator (EOM) finds use in a wide range of applications including coherent optical communication, laser frequency and phase stabilization, and atomic spectroscopy. In some cases a sideband-free optical frequency shift is preferred, such as in laser-offset locking using an optical cavity, single-photon frequency shifting, and laser range finding. Approaches to obtaining an optical frequency offset (OFO) involve trade-offs between shift range, conversion gain, and suppression of spurious sidebands. Here we demonstrate an OFO of continuous-wave laser light by serrodyne modulation using a fiber EOM and radio-frequency (RF) tones from a commodity RF system on a chip (RFSoC) to achieve shifts of 40 to 800 MHz with &gt; 15 dB suppression of spurious sidebands and &lt; 1.5 dB conversion loss. We also observe smoothly-varying conversion gain. The utility of this tool is demonstrated by continuously shifting the offset of a cavity-locked laser from 50 to 1600 MHz, a capability useful in spectroscopy of unknown optical transitions.</description>

      <title>A Localized Reality Appears To Underpin Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although entangled state vectors cannot be described in terms of classically realistic variables, localized in space and time, any given entanglement experiment can be built from basic quantum circuit components with well-defined locations. By analyzing the (local) weak values for any given run of a quantum circuit, we present evidence for a localized account of any circuit's behavior. Specifically, even if the state is massively entangled, the weak values are found to evolve only when they pass through a local circuit element. They otherwise remain constant and do not evolve when other qubits pass through their circuit elements. A further surprise is found when two qubits are brought together in an exchange interaction, as their weak values then evolve according to a simple classical equation. The weak values are subject to both past and future constraints, so they can only be determined by considering the entire circuit "all-at-once", as in action principles. In the context of a few basic quantum gates, we show how an all-at-once model of a complete circuit could generate weak values without using state vectors as an intermediate step. Since these gates comprise a universal quantum gate set, this lends support to the claim that any quantum circuit can plausibly be underpinned by localized variables, providing a realistic, lower-level account of generic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Storage of Multidimensional Telecom Photons in a Solid-State Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient storage of telecom-band quantum optical information represents a crucial milestone for establishing distributed quantum optical networks. Erbium ions in crystalline hosts provide a promising platform for telecom quantum memories; however, their practical applications have been hindered by demanding operational conditions, such as ultra-high magnetic fields and ultra-low temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate the storage of telecom photonic qubits encoded in polarization, frequency, and time-bin bases. Using the atomic frequency comb protocol in an Er$^{3+}$-doped crystal, we developed a memory initialization scheme that improves storage efficiency by over an order of magnitude under practical experimental conditions. Quantum process tomography further confirms the memory's performance, achieving a fidelity exceeding 92%.</description>

      <title>Loss tangent fluctuations due to two-level systems in superconducting microwave resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting microwave resonators are critical to quantum computing and sensing technologies. Additionally, they are common proxies for superconducting qubits when determining the effects of performance-limiting loss mechanisms such as from two-level systems (TLS). The extraction of these loss mechanisms is often performed by measuring the internal quality factor $Q_i$ as a function of power or temperature. In this work, we investigate large temporal fluctuations of $Q_i$ at low powers over periods of 12 to 16 hours (relative standard deviation $\sigma_{Qi}/Q_i = 13\%$). These fluctuations are ubiquitous across multiple resonators, chips and cooldowns. We are able to attribute these fluctuations to variations in the TLS loss tangent due to two main indicators. First, measured fluctuations decrease as power and temperature increase. Second, for interleaved measurements, we observe correlations between low- and medium-power $Q_i$ fluctuations and an absence of correlations with high-power fluctuations. Agreement with the TLS loss tangent mean is obtained by performing measurements over a time span of a few hours. We hypothesize that, in addition to decoherence due to coupling to individual near-resonant TLS, superconducting qubits are affected by these observed TLS loss tangent fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Topological entanglement entropy meets holographic entropy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological entanglement entropy (TEE) is an efficient way to detect topological order in the ground state of gapped Hamiltonians. The seminal work of Kitaev and Preskill~\cite{preskill-kitaev-tee} and simultaneously by Levin and Wen~\cite{levin-wen-tee} proposed information quantities that can probe the TEE. In the present work, we explain why the subtraction schemes in the proposed information quantities~\cite{levin-wen-tee,preskill-kitaev-tee} work for the computation of TEE and generalize them for arbitrary number of subregions by explicitly noting the necessary conditions for an information quantity to capture TEE. Our conditions differentiate the probes defined by Kitaev-Preskill and Levin-Wen into separate classes. While there are infinitely many possible probes of TEE, we focus particularly on the cyclic quantities $Q_{2n+1}$ and multi-information $I_n$. We also show that the holographic entropy inequalities are satisfied by the quantum entanglement entropy of the non-degenerate ground state of a topologically ordered two-dimensional medium with a mass gap.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Charging Performance of Many-Body Quantum Batteries through Landau-Zener Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the charging advantages of a many-body quantum battery driven by a Landau-Zener field. Such a system may be modeled as a Heisenberg XY spin chain with $\textit{N}$ interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles under an external magnetic field. Here we consider both nearest-neighbor and long-range spin interactions. The charging performance of this many-body quantum battery is evaluated by comparing Landau-Zener and periodic driving protocols within these interaction regimes. Our findings show that the Landau-Zener driving can offer superior energy deposition and storage efficiency compared to periodic driving. Notably, the Landau-Zener protocol may deliver optimal performance when combined with long-range interactions. The efficiency of a Landau-Zener quantum battery can be significantly enhanced by optimizing key parameters, such as XY anisotropy, the magnitude of the driving field, and interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal correlations in quantum energy teleportation: perspectives from their Majorana representations and information thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by anomalous nonlocal correlation in the Kitaev spin liquids, we propose a quantum energy teleportation protocol between remote partners Alice and Bob on a quantum spin model, and examine how its performance is characterized by Majorana fermions that clearly depict nonlocal correlations inherent in the model. In our model, Bob's energy extraction is activated by local energy injection by Alice's projective measurement and subsequent classical communication of the measurement result. We derive two formulae: one for the maximally extracted energy by the protocol and the other for the maximum of energy reduction at Bob's local site. We find that the extracted energy becomes positive when a nonlocal correlator defined by Majorana fermions at Alice's and Bob's sites is finite. We also find that the amount of the energy reduction becomes positive when another nonlocal Majorana correlator is finite. In both formulae, the correlators appear as a result of Bob's feedback unitary operation. We discuss effective information-thermodynamical aspects behind the protocol at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing and Tensor Networks: a Powerful Combination to Solve Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has long promised to revolutionize the way we solve complex problems. At the same time, tensor networks are widely used across various fields due to their computational efficiency and capacity to represent intricate systems. While both technologies can address similar problems, the primary aim of this thesis is not to compare them. Such comparison would be unfair, as quantum devices are still in an early stage, whereas tensor network algorithms represent the state-of-the-art in quantum simulation. Instead, we explore a potential synergy between these technologies, focusing on how two flagship algorithms from each paradigm, the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and quantum annealing, might collaborate in the future. Furthermore, a significant challenge in the DMRG algorithm is identifying an appropriate tensor network representation for the quantum system under study. The representation commonly used is called Matrix Product Operator (MPO), and it is notoriously difficult to obtain for certain systems. This thesis outlines an approach to this problem using finite automata, which we apply to construct the MPO for our case study. Finally, we present a practical application of this framework through the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). Despite its apparent simplicity, the QKP is a fundamental problem in computer science with numerous practical applications. In addition to quantum annealing and the DMRG algorithm, we implement a dynamic programming approach to evaluate the quality of our results. Our results highlight the power of tensor networks and the potential of quantum annealing for solving optimization problems. Moreover, this thesis is designed to be self-explanatory, ensuring that readers with a solid mathematical background can fully understand the content without prior knowledge of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hybrid Quantum-Classical Methods for Practical Time-Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting is essential for strategic planning and resource allocation. In this work, we explore two quantum-based approaches for time-series forecasting. The first approach utilizes a Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) model. The second approach employs Variational Quantum Linear Regression (VQLS), enabling time-series forecasting by encoding the problem as a system of linear equations, which is then solved using quantum optimization techniques. We compare the results of these two methods to evaluate their effectiveness and potential advantages for practical forecasting applications.</description>

      <title>Local fermion-to-qudit mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust quantum control can achieve noise-resilience of quantum systems and quantum technological devices. While the need for noise-resilience grows with the number of fluctuating quantities, and thus typically with the number of qubits, most numerically exact optimal control techniques are limited to systems of few interacting qubits. This paper exploits quantum control that avoids explicit reference to quantum states in exponentially large Hilbert space. Exemplary control protocols for spin chains are discussed in terms of noise-resilient preparation of highly entangled states.</description>

      <title>No-Free-Lunch Theories for Tensor-Network Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network machine learning models have shown remarkable versatility in tackling complex data-driven tasks, ranging from quantum many-body problems to classical pattern recognitions. Despite their promising performance, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying assumptions and limitations of these models is still lacking. In this work, we focus on the rigorous formulation of their no-free-lunch theorem -- essential yet notoriously challenging to formalize for specific tensor network machine learning models. In particular, we rigorously analyze the generalization risks of learning target output functions from input data encoded in tensor network states. We first prove a no-free-lunch theorem for machine learning models based on matrix product states, i.e., the one-dimensional tensor network states. Furthermore, we circumvent the challenging issue of calculating the partition function for two-dimensional Ising model, and prove the no-free-lunch theorem for the case of two-dimensional projected entangled-pair state, by introducing the combinatorial method associated to the "puzzle of polyominoes". Our findings reveal the intrinsic limitations of tensor network-based learning models in a rigorous fashion, and open up an avenue for future analytical exploration of both the strengths and limitations of quantum-inspired machine learning frameworks.</description>

      <title>Quantum network tomography of Rydberg arrays by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Configurable arrays of optically trapped Rydberg atoms are a versatile platform for quantum computation and quantum simulation, also allowing controllable decoherence. We demonstrate theoretically, that they also enable proof-of-principle demonstrations for a technique to build models for open quantum dynamics by machine learning with artificial neural networks, recently proposed in [Mukherjee et al. [arXiv:2409.18822] (2024)]. Using the outcome of quantum transport through a network of sites that correspond to excited Rydberg atoms, the multi-stage neural network algorithm successfully identifies the number of atoms (or nodes in the network), and subsequently their location. It further extracts an effective interaction Hamiltonian and decoherence operators induced by the environment. To probe the Rydberg array, one initiates dynamics repeatedly from the same initial state and then measures the transport probability to an output atom. Large datasets are generated by varying the position of the latter. Measurements are required in only one single basis, making the approach complementary to e.g. quantum process tomography. The cold atom platform discussed in this article can be used to explore the performance of the proposed protocol when training the neural network with simulation data, but then applying it to construct models based on experimental data.</description>

Abstract: Whether a photon exhibits wavelike or particlelike behaviour depends on the observation method, as clearly demonstrated by Wheeler's delayed choice (DC) experiments. A key aspect of such experiments is the random determination of the observation device's status, typically controlled by a random number generator or a quantum-controlling apparatus. Here, we propose a novel version of the quantum delayed choice (QDC) experiment by tailoring the quantum state of the single photon into an arbitrary polarization superposition. In this experiment, the "choice" can be considered as being made by the photon's state itself at the moment of observation, thereby violating classical causality. Additionally, we observe the morphing behaviour of the single photon between wavelike and particlelike characteristics, which challenges the classical picture of waves and particles. Utilizing the quantum state of the photon rather than the quantum-controlling devices not only facilitates the implementation of the QDC experiment but also helps deepen the understanding of Bohr's complementarity principle.</description>

      <title>Development of Neural Network-Based Optimal Control Pulse Generator for Quantum Logic Gates Using the GRAPE Algorithm in NMR Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a neural network to generate the optimal control pulses for general single-qubit quantum logic gates, within a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) quantum computer. By utilizing a neural network, we can efficiently implement any single-qubit quantum logic gates within a reasonable time scale. The network is trained by control pulses generated by the GRAPE algorithm, all starting from the same initial point. After implementing the network, we tested it using numerical simulations. Also, we present the results of applying Neural Network-generated pulses to a three-qubit benchtop NMR system and compare them with simulation outcomes. These numerical and experimental results showcase the precision of the Neural Network-generated pulses in executing the desired dynamics. Ultimately, by developing the neural network using the GRAPE algorithm, we discover the function that maps any single-qubit gate to its corresponding pulse shape. This model enables the real-time generation of arbitrary single-qubit pulses. When combined with the GRAPE-generated pulse for the CNOT gate, it creates a comprehensive and effective set of universal gates. This set can efficiently implement any algorithm in noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ era), thereby enhancing the capabilities of quantum optimal control in this domain. Additionally, this approach can be extended to other quantum computer platforms with similar Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography of a third-order exceptional point in a dissipative trapped ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The requirement for Hermiticity in quantum mechanics ensures the reality of energies, while the parity-time symmetry offers an alternative route to achieve this goal. Interestingly, in a three-level system, the parity-time symmetry-breaking can lead to a third-order exceptional point with distinctive topological properties and enhanced sensitivity. To experimentally implement this in open quantum systems, it is essential to introduce two well-controlled loss channels. However, the requirement for these two loss channels presents a challenge in experimental implementation due to the lack of methods to realize the dynamics governed by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Here we address the challenge by employing two approaches to eliminate the effects of quantum jump terms so that the dynamics is governed by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in a dissipative trapped ion with two loss channels. Based on this, we experimentally observe the parity-time symmetry-breaking-induced third-order exceptional point through non-Hermitian absorption spectroscopy. In particular, we perform quantum state tomography to directly demonstrate the coalescence of three eigenstates into a single eigenstate at the exceptional point. Finally, we identify an intrinsic third order Liouvillian exceptional point associated with a parity-time symmetry breaking via quench dynamics. Our experiments can be extended to observe other non-Hermitian phenomena involving more than two levels and potentially find applications in quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced quantum-circuit refrigeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a transmon qubit and its dispersively coupled readout resonator to measure the Fock state populations of another microwave resonator, to which we have attached a quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR). First, we apply noise generated at room temperature to the resonator and show that such noise drive leads to a thermal distribution of the resonator Fock states. Subsequently, we detune the noise frequency band far away from the resonance condition and vary the power of the noise applied on the QCR. We observe that such artificial thermal noise may lead to major damping of a coherent state of the resonator. Importantly, we also demonstrate that the effective temperature of a thermal resonator state can be reduced from roughly 300 mK to 130 mK by the introduction of the artificial thermal noise. These observations pave the way for a purely thermally powered quantum-circuit refrigerator which may unlock the use of waste heat in resetting superconducting qubits in a quantum processor and in building autonomous quantum heat engines.</description>

      <title>Consciousness-Centered Ontology of Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD), a paradigm that re-envisions quantum theory and its interplay with spacetime, observers, and consciousness. Abandoning the notion of a preexisting universe or fixed manifold, RQD posits that observers, observed systems, and geometric structures emerge together as stable relational patterns in an underlying quantum substrate. Spacetime is thus recast as an effective, large-scale feature of entanglement and information flows rather than a fundamental stage. By eliminating pre-given observers and absolute properties, RQD unifies relational quantum mechanics, insights from holography and tensor networks, and non-dual philosophical traditions into a single idealist framework. Here, universal awareness is not an added element but the ontological ground, ensuring that subjective experience and physical reality co-derive from the same relational field. This approach not only demystifies the "hard problem" of consciousness, making it intrinsic rather than emergent but also resolves longstanding quantum puzzles, such as Wigner's friend and Frauchiger-Renner scenarios, by showing that no absolute vantage point or objective collapse is required. In harmonizing quantum theory, emergent geometry, and a fundamental awareness-based ontology, RQD reveals that quantum mechanics, gravity, and consciousness are facets of a single, integrated reality.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal coherent states in an infinite array of boson sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A regular coherent state (CS) is a special type of quantum state for boson particles placed in a single site. The defining feature of the CS is that it is an eigenmode of the annihilation operator. The construction easily generalizes to the case of a finite number of sites. However, the challenge is altogether different when one considers an infinite array of sites. In this work we demonstrate a mathematically rigorous construction that resolves the latter case. The resulting nonlocal coherent states (NCS) are simultaneous eigenmodes for all of the infinitely many annihilation operators acting in the infinite array's Fock space. Our construction fundamentally relies on Dirichlet series-based analysis and number theoretic arguments.</description>

      <title>Doubly Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the expectation that relativistic symmetries might acquire quantum features in Quantum Gravity, we take the first steps towards a theory of ''Doubly'' Quantum Mechanics, a modification of Quantum Mechanics in which the geometrical configurations of physical systems, measurement apparata, and reference frame transformations are themselves quantized and described by ''geometry'' states in a Hilbert space. We develop the formalism for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ measurements by promoting the group of spatial rotations $SU(2)$ to the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ and generalizing the axioms of Quantum Theory in a covariant way. As a consequence of our axioms, the notion of probability becomes a self-adjoint operator acting on the Hilbert space of geometry states, hence acquiring novel non-classical features. After introducing a suitable class of semi-classical geometry states, which describe near-to-classical geometrical configurations of physical systems, we find that probability measurements are affected, in these configurations, by intrinsic uncertainties stemming from the quantum properties of $SU_q(2)$. This feature translates into an unavoidable fuzziness for observers attempting to align their reference frames by exchanging qubits, even when the number of exchanged qubits approaches infinity, contrary to the standard $SU(2)$ case.</description>

      <title>Feasibility study of frequency-encoded photonic qubits over a free-space channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-bin quantum encoding shows great promise for quantum communication given its high-dimensional scaling, compatibility with photonic integrated circuits and synergy with classical optical communication technology. However, to date all demonstrations have been performed over single-mode and static channels, while the transmission over fluctuating and turbulent channels has not been addressed. We propose and demonstrate a novel approach that leverages field-widened interferometers to decode frequency-bins transmitted over free-space channels without any adaptive optics or modal filtering. Moreover, we investigate the phase stability requirements so that frequency-bin encoding could be feasible for satellite to ground quantum links. Our passive approach expands the versatility of frequency-bin encoding, paving the way towards long-range and fluctuating channels.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Qubit Mapping with Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes and Quaternion Orthogonal Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the qubit mapping through the integration of Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes (QOSTBCs) with Quaternion Orthogonal Designs (QODs) in quantum error correction (QEC) frameworks. QOSTBCs have gained prominence for enhancing performance and reliability in quantum computing and communication systems. These codes draw on stabilizer group formalism and QODs to boost error correction, with QOSTBCs mapping logical qubits to physical ones, refines error handling in complex channels environments. Simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by comparing the percentage improvement under various detected and corrected error conditions for four different cases, \textbf{$Z_1$} up to \textbf{$Z_4$}. The obtained simulations and implemental results show that QOSTBCs consistently achieve a higher correction improvement percentage than stabilizer Group for \textbf{$Z_1$}, \textbf{$Z_2$}, and \textbf{$Z_4$}; QOSTBCs can correct more errors than those detected, achieving over 100\% correction rates for first two cases, which indicates their enhanced resilience and redundancy in high-error environments. While for \textbf{$Z_3$}, stabilizer consistently remains above that of QOSTBCs, reflecting its slightly better performance. These outcomes indicate that QOSTBCs are reliable in making better logarithmic efficiency and error resilience, making them a valuable asset for quantum information processing and advanced wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Quantum Discrete Adiabatic Linear Solver based on Block Encoding and Eigenvalue Separator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear system solvers are widely used in scientific computing, with the primary goal of solving linear system problems. Classical iterative algorithms typically rely on the conjugate gradient method. The rise of quantum computing has spurred interest in quantum linear system problems (QLSP), particularly following the introduction of the HHL algorithm by Harrow et al. in 2009, which demonstrated the potential for exponential speedup compared to classical algorithms. However, the performance of the HHL algorithm is constrained by its dependence on the square of the condition number. To address this limitation, alternative approaches based on adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) have been proposed, which exhibit complexity scaling linearly with the condition number. AQC solves QLSP by smoothly varying the parameters of the Hamiltonian. However, this method suffers from high Hamiltonian simulation complexity. In response, this work designs new Hamiltonians and proposes a quantum discrete adiabatic linear solver based on block encoding and eigenvalue separation techniques (BEES-QDALS). This approach bypasses Hamiltonian simulation through a first-order approximation and leverages block encoding to achieve equivalent non-unitary operations on qubits. By comparing the fidelity of the original algorithm and BEES-QDALS when solving QLSP with a fixed number of steps, and the number of steps required to reach a target fidelity, it is found that BEES-QDALS significantly outperforms the original algorithm. Specifically, BEES-QDALS achieves higher fidelity with the same number of steps and requires fewer steps to reach the same target fidelity.</description>

      <title>Quantum recharging by shortcut to adiabaticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum battery concerns about population redistribution and energy dispatch over controllable quantum systems. Under unitary transformation, ergotropy rather than energy plays an essential role in describing the accumulated useful work. Thus, the charging and recharging of quantum batteries are distinct from the electric-energy input and reuse of classical batteries. In this work, we focus on recharging a three-level quantum battery that has been exhausted under self-discharging and work extraction. We find that the quantum battery cannot be fully refreshed with the maximum ergotropy only by the driving pulses for unitary charging. For an efficient refreshment of the quantum battery, we propose a fast and stable recharging protocol based on postselection and shortcut to adiabaticity. More than accelerating the adiabatic passage for charging, the protocol can eliminate unextractable energy and is robust against driving errors and environmental decoherence. Our protocol is energy-saving and experimental-feasible, even in systems with the forbidden transition.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots offer a promising platform for controlling spin qubits and realizing quantum logic gates, essential for scalable quantum computing. In this work, we utilize a variational quantum compiling algorithm to design efficient three-qubit gates using a time-independent Hamiltonian composed of only physical interaction terms. The resulting gates, including the Toffoli and Fredkin gates, demonstrate high fidelity and robustness against both coherent and incoherent noise sources, including charge and nuclear spin noise. This method is applicable to a wide range of physical systems, such as superconducting qubits and trapped ions, paving the way for more resilient and universal quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Tight upper bound of the maximal quantum violation of Gisin's elegant Bell inequality and its application in randomness certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The violation of a Bell inequality implies the existence of nonlocality, making device-independent randomness certification possible. This paper derives a tight upper bound for the maximal quantum violation of Gisin's elegant Bell inequality (EBI) for arbitrary two-qubit states, along with the constraints required to achieve this bound. This method provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for violating the EBI for several quantum states, including pure two-qubit states and the Werner states. The lower bound of certifiable global randomness is analyzed based on the tight upper bound of the EBI for pure two-qubit states, with a comparison to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. The relationship between the noise level and the lower bound of certifiable global randomness with respect to the Werner states is also explored, and the comparisons with both the CHSH inequality and the chained inequality are given. The results indicate that when the state approaches a maximally entangled state within specific quantified ranges, the EBI demonstrates advantages over both the CHSH inequality and the chained inequality, potentially enhancing practical device-independent randomness generation rates.</description>

      <title>Magnomechanically induced transparency in the ferrimagnetic bridge crystal of atom opto-magnomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the absorption and transmission properties of a weak probe field in an atom opto-magnomechanics system. The system comprises an assembly of two-level atoms and a magnon mode within a ferrimagnetic crystal, which directly interacts with an optical cavity mode through the crystal's deformation displacement. We observe optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) via radiation pressure and a magnomechanically induced transparency (MMIT) due to the nonlinear magnon-phonon interaction. In addition, due to the coupling of the atom to the detected and signal light, the system's width transparency window is divided into two narrow windows. Additionally, we demonstrate that the group delay is contingent upon the tunability of the magnon-phonon coupling strength. Our solution possesses significant in the field of quantum precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Fermionic 2-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the fermionic satisfiability problem, Fermionic $k$-SAT: this is the problem of deciding whether there is a fermionic state in the null-space of a collection of fermionic, parity-conserving, projectors on $n$ fermionic modes, where each fermionic projector involves at most $k$ fermionic modes. We prove that this problem can be solved efficiently classically. In addition, we show that deciding whether there exists a satisfying assignment for a given fixed particle number parity can also be solved efficiently classically: this problem is a quantum-fermionic extension of asking whether a classical 2-SAT problem has a solution with a given Hamming weight parity. We also prove that deciding whether there exists a satisfying assignment for particle-number-conserving Fermionic 2-SAT for some given particle number is NP-complete. Complementary to this, we show that Fermionic $9$-SAT is QMA$_1$-hard.</description>

      <title>Influence of momentum confinement in the phase-space dynamics of the Kramers-Henneberger atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase-space dynamics of the Kramers Henneberger (KH) atom solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for reduced-dimensionality models and using Wigner quasiprobability distributions. We find that, for the time-averaged KH potential, coherent superpositions of eigenstates perform a cyclic motion confined in momentum space, whose frequency is proportional to the energy difference between the two KH eigenstates. This cyclic motion is also present if the full time dependent dynamics are taken into consideration. However, there are time delays regarding the time-averaged potential, and some tail-shaped spilling of the quasiprobability flow towards higher momentum regions. These tails are signatures of ionization, indicating that vanishingly small drift momentum is instrumental for stabilization. A comparison of the quasiprobability flow with classical phase-space constraints shows that, for the KH atom, confinement occurs in momentum space. This is a major difference from a molecule, for which the quasiprobability flow is confined in position space for small internuclear separation. Furthermore, we assess the stability of different propagation strategies and find that the most stable scenario for the full dynamics is obtained if the system is initially prepared in the KH ground state.</description>

Abstract: We present an introduction to the theory of open extended quantum systems. We begin with a microscopic derivation of the so-called Lindblad equation followed by a more abstract approach. Next, we introduce collision models, a versatile framework that offers a possible unraveling of the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. We finally discuss concrete situations involving quantum transport phenomena, the generation and replication of entanglement or even the non-thermal relaxation of cold atomic gases confined in optical traps.</description>

      <title>The Dilemma of Random Parameter Initialization and Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an easy-to-implement approach to mitigate the challenges posed by barren plateaus (BPs) in randomly initialized parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) within variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). Recent state-of-the-art research is flooded with a plethora of specialized strategies to overcome BPs, however, our rigorous analysis reveals that these challenging and resource heavy techniques to tackle BPs may not be required. Instead, a careful selection of distribution \emph{range} to initialize the parameters of PQCs can effectively address this issue without complex modifications. We systematically investigate how different ranges of randomly generated parameters influence the occurrence of BPs in VQAs, providing a straightforward yet effective strategy to significantly mitigate BPs and eventually improve the efficiency and feasibility of VQAs. This method simplifies the implementation process and considerably reduces the computational overhead associated with more complex initialization schemes. Our comprehensive empirical validation demonstrates the viability of this approach, highlighting its potential to make VQAs more accessible and practical for a broader range of quantum computing applications. Additionally, our work provides a clear path forward for quantum algorithm developers seeking to mitigate BPs and unlock the full potential of VQAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the geometry of the Hilbert space bundle of a quantum system, focusing on properties related to the parameter-induced dimension. Instead of relying on hints from the Hamiltonian eigenvalues, the behavior of the fiber metric and the evolution of quantum states are analyzed directly. The results reveal that the Hilbert space bundle around an exceptional point is non-orientable. Beyond demonstrating a direct method for determining the geometry of the Hilbert space bundle, this study also offers a potential framework for constructing qubits.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum sensitivity and coherence of symmetric magnetic clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for highly coherent degrees of freedom in noisy solid-state environments is a major challenge in condensed matter. In disordered dipolar systems, such as magnetically doped insulators, compact clusters of two-level systems (TLS) have recently been shown to have significantly longer coherence times than typical single TLS. Coupling weakly to their environment, they sense and probe its many-body dynamics through the induced dephasing. However, it has remained an open question whether further mechanisms exist that protect the coherence of such solid-state qubits. Here we show that symmetric clusters of few TLS couple even more weakly to their surroundings, making them highly sensitive quantum sensors of slow many-body dynamics. Furthermore, we explore their use as qubits for quantum information storage, detailing the techniques required for their preparation and manipulation. Our findings elucidate the role of symmetry in enhancing quantum coherence in disordered and noisy systems, opening a route toward a sensitive experimental probe of many-body quasi-localization dynamics as well as the development of quantum technologies in solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Purcell enhancement and optical coherence of Eu$^{\text{3+}}$ ions in a single nanoparticle coupled to a microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Europium-doped nanocrystals constitute a promising material for a scalable future quantum computing platform. Long-lived nuclear spin states could serve as qubits addressed via coherent optical transitions. In order to realize an efficient spin-photon interface, we couple the emission from a single nanoparticle to a fiber-based microcavity under cryogenic conditions. The spatial and spectral tunability of the cavity permits us to place individual nanoparticles in the cavity, to measure the inhomogeneous linewidth of the ions, and to show a multi-modal Purcell-enhancement of two transition in Eu$^{\text{3+}}$. A halving of the free-space lifetime to 1.0 ms is observed, corresponding to a 140-fold enhancement of the respective transition. Furthermore, we observe a narrow optical linewidth of 3.3 MHz for a few-ion ensemble in the center of the inhomogeneous line. The results represent an important step towards the efficient readout of single Eu$^{\text{3+}}$ ions, a key requirement for the realization of single-ion-level quantum processing nodes in the solid state.</description>

      <title>Using optimal control to guide neural-network interpolation of continuously-parameterized gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control synthesis for continuously-parameterized families of quantum gates can enable critical advantages for mid-sized quantum computing applications in advance of fault-tolerance. We combine quantum optimal control with physics-informed machine learning to efficiently synthesize control surfaces that interpolate among continuously-parameterized gate families. Using optimal control as an active learning strategy to guide pretraining, we bootstrap a physics-informed neural network to achieve rapid convergence to nonlinear control surfaces sufficient for our desired gates. We find our approach is critical for enabling an expressiveness beyond linear interpolation, which is important in cases of hard quantum control. We show in simulation that by adapting our pretraining to use a few reference pulse calibrations, we can apply transfer learning to quickly calibrate our learned control surfaces when devices fluctuate over time.
  We demonstrate synthesis for one and two qubit gates with one or two parameters, focusing on gate families for variational quantum algorithm (VQA) ansatz. By avoiding the inefficient decomposition of VQA ansatz into basis gate sets, continuous gate families are a potential method to improve the noise robustness of VQAs in the near term. Our framework shows how accessible optimal control tools can be combined with simple machine learning to enable practitioners to achieve 3x speedups for their algorithms by going beyond the standard gate sets.</description>

      <title>Recurrent convolutional neural networks for non-adiabatic dynamics of quantum-classical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have recently been extensively applied to model the time-evolution in fluid dynamics, weather predictions, and even chaotic systems thanks to their ability to capture temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in data. Here we present a RNN model based on convolutional neural networks for modeling the nonlinear non-adiabatic dynamics of hybrid quantum-classical systems. The dynamical evolution of the hybrid systems is governed by equations of motion for classical degrees of freedom and von Neumann equation for electrons. The physics-aware recurrent convolutional (PARC) neural network structure incorporates a differentiator-integrator architecture that inductively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of generic physical systems. Validation studies show that the trained PARC model could reproduce the space-time evolution of a one-dimensional semi-classical Holstein model {with comparable accuracy to direct numerical simulations}. We also investigate the scaling of prediction errors with size of training dataset, prediction window, step-size, and model size.</description>

      <title>Frequency entangled W states and quantum frequency translation protocols via forward Brillouin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex quantum states of light are not only central to advancing our understanding of quantum mechanics, but are also necessary for a variety of quantum protocols. High-dimensional, or multipartite, quantum states are of specific interest, as they can exhibit unique properties both fundamentally and in application. The synthesis of high-dimensional, entangled photonic states can take the form of various schemes, which result in varying forms of entanglement. Frequency-entanglement is specifically attractive due to compatibility with integrated systems and resistance to decoherence in fiber transportation; however, increasing the dimension of frequency-entangled states requires a system that offers quantum interactions between a large set of distinct frequencies. Here, we show how the phonon-photon interactions of forward Brillouin scattering, which offer access to a ladder of optical resonances permitted by a single mechanical mode, can be used for fast-synthesis of frequency-entangled, single-photon W states. In our proposed system, simultaneous laser pulses of different frequencies dynamically evolve either an injected single photon or a heralded single phonon, generating W states of selected dimension and output frequency. This method enables the synthesis of `perfect' W states by adjusting the pulse amplitudes. In addition, we show how this system can be used for quantum frequency translation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the single photon purity of a resonantly driven single-photon source in the realistic scenario where the excitation laser can leak into the detection path. We find that the duration of the excitation pulse strongly influences the quality of the single-photon source. We calculate the influence of this on the effective parameters describing the most relevant properties, including the two-photon component and Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) visibility. Furthermore, we analyze how these properties can be strongly affected by frequency filtering of the outgoing field. Our results highlight that the relation between the two-photon component of the emission and the HOM visibility is more complicated than typically assumed in the literature, and depends on the specific details of the source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superpositions of handed molecular states give rise to achiral eigenstates, delocalized across a double-well potential via tunneling. A coherent superposition of these energy eigenstates could dynamically relocalize the molecules into chiral states, which has only been addressed theoretically. Here, we present a microwave six-wave mixing pump-probe study to create and probe coherent chiral tunneling dynamics in a rotational state. Through a time-resolved scheme, we uncover the periodic time evolution of the induced chiral wavepacket under field-free conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate precise phase control of this coherence via phase modulation during pump excitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction codes protect information from realistic noisy channels and lie at the heart of quantum computation and communication tasks. Understanding the optimal performance and other information-theoretic properties, such as the achievable rates, of a given code is crucial, as these factors determine the fundamental limits imposed by the encoding in conjunction with the noise channel. Here, we use the transpose channel to analytically obtain the near-optimal performance of any Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code under pure loss and pure amplification. We present rigorous connections between GKP code's near-optimal performance and its dual lattice geometry and average input energy. With no energy constraint, we show that when $\vert\frac{\tau}{1 - \tau}\vert$ is an integer, specific families of GKP codes simultaneously achieve the loss and amplification capacity. $\tau$ is the transmissivity (gain) for loss (amplification). Our results establish GKP code as the first structured bosonic code family that achieves the capacity of loss and amplification.</description>

      <title>Universal chain rules from entropic triangle inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The von Neumann entropy of an $n$-partite system $A_1^n$ given a system $B$ can be written as the sum of the von Neumann entropies of the individual subsystems $A_k$ given $A_1^{k-1}$ and $B$. While it is known that such a chain rule does not hold for the smooth min-entropy, we prove a counterpart of this for a variant of the smooth min-entropy, which is equal to the conventional smooth min-entropy up to a constant. This enables us to lower bound the smooth min-entropy of an $n$-partite system in terms of, roughly speaking, equally strong entropies of the individual subsystems. We call this a universal chain rule for the smooth min-entropy, since it is applicable for all values of $n$. Using duality, we also derive a similar relation for the smooth max-entropy. Our proof utilises the entropic triangle inequalities for analysing approximation chains. Additionally, we also prove an approximate version of the entropy accumulation theorem, which significantly relaxes the conditions required on the state to bound its smooth min-entropy. In particular, it does not require the state to be produced through a sequential process like previous entropy accumulation type bounds. In our upcoming companion paper, we use it to prove the security of parallel device independent quantum key distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lacking quantum error correction (QEC) schemes for Hamiltonian-based quantum computations due to their continuous-time nature, energetically penalizing the errors is an effective error suppression technique. In this work, we construct families of distance-$2$ quantum error detection codes (QEDCs) using Bravyi's $A$ matrix framework, tailored for penalty-protection schemes. We identify a family of codes achieving the maximum code rate and, by slightly relaxing this constraint, uncover a broader spectrum of codes with enhanced physical locality, increasing their practical applicability. Additionally, we propose an algorithm to map the required connectivity into more hardware-feasible configurations, offering insights for quantum hardware design. Finally, we provide a systematic framework to evaluate the performance of these codes in terms of code rate, physical locality, graph properties, and penalty gap, enabling informed selection of codes for specific quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Quantum Reservoir Computing for Molecular Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has been increasingly utilized in the field of biomedical research to accelerate the drug discovery process. In recent years, the emergence of quantum computing has been followed by extensive exploration of quantum machine learning algorithms. Quantum variational machine learning algorithms are currently the most prevalent but face issues with trainability due to vanishing gradients. An emerging alternative is the quantum reservoir computing (QRC) approach, in which the quantum algorithm does not require gradient evaluation on quantum hardware. Motivated by the potential advantages of the QRC method, we apply it to predict the biological activity of potential drug molecules based on molecular descriptors. We observe more robust QRC performance as the size of the dataset decreases, compared to standard classical models, a quality of potential interest for pharmaceutical datasets of limited size. In addition, we leverage the uniform manifold approximation and projection technique to analyze structural changes as classical features are transformed through quantum dynamics and find that quantum reservoir embeddings appear to be more interpretable in lower dimensions.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of the Schwinger model via gauge-invariant VUMPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the lattice Schwinger model by combining the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm with a gauge-invariant matrix product ansatz that locally enforces the Gauss law constraint. Both the continuum and lattice versions of the Schwinger model with $\theta=\pi$ are known to exhibit first-order phase transitions for the values of the fermion mass above a critical value, where a second-order phase transition occurs. Our algorithm enables a precise determination of the critical endpoint in the continuum theory. We further analyze the scaling in the simultaneous critical and continuum limits and confirm that the data collapse aligns with the Ising universality class to remarkable precision.</description>

      <title>Large enhancement of nonlinear optical response of graphene nanoribbon heterojunctions with multiple topological interface states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear optical response of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) heterojunctions both without and with one or multiple topological interface states. By implementing a distant-neighbor quantum-mechanical (DNQM) method, we demonstrate a pronounced enhancement of the nonlinear optical response of GNR heterojunctions as the number of topological states at their interfaces increases. Specifically, we find that GNR heterojunctions with multiple topological interface states exhibit a notably stronger third-order nonlinear optical response in comparison with the similarly sized counterparts with a single topological interface state or without such states. Furthermore, we observe that the presence of topological interface states in GNR heterojunctions can induce a significant red-shift in their quantum plasmon frequency. Our results reveal the potential to enhance the nonlinear optical response at the nanoscale by increasing the number of topological interface states in graphene nanostructures or other topological systems.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram and crystal melting of helium-4 in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the zero-temperature phase diagram of two-dimensional helium-4 using neural quantum states. Our variational description allows us to address liquid and solid phases using the same functional form as well as exploring possible melting scenarios, for instance via an intermediate hexatic phase. Notably, this is achieved by performing fixed pressure variational Monte Carlo calculations. Within the isobaric ensemble framework, we are able to clearly identify the first-order liquid-solid phase transition. However, in an intermediate region of nearly constant pressure, we find that simulations of $N=30$ atoms continuously transition from liquid to solid, with signatures of a hexatic order coexisting with a small condensate fraction. Calculations for larger systems follow the metastable liquid and solid branches in this transient region. We additionally compute the R\'enyi-2 entanglement entropy across the liquid-solid phase transition and find a sharp decrease upon freezing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first demonstration of a nanofabricated photonic crystal made from the magnetic material yttrium iron garnet (YIG). YIG is a compelling material for quantum technologies due to its unique magnetic and optical properties; however, experiments involving YIG have primarily been limited to millimeter-scale spheres. The successful nanofabrication of YIG structures opens new avenues for advancing quantum technology applications. Notably, the ability to co-localize magnons, phonons, and optical photons within a nanostructured environment paves the way for novel approaches in quantum information processing, including quantum wavelength transduction and enhanced magnon-photon interactions. This work marks a significant step toward integrating YIG-based devices into scalable quantum platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate long-distance ranging is crucial for diverse applications, including satellite formation flying, very-long-baseline interferometry, gravitational-wave observatory, geographical research, etc. The integration of the time-of-flight mesurement with phase interference in dual-comb method enables high-precision ranging with a rapid update rate and an extended ambiguity range. Pioneering experiments have demonstrated unprecedented precision in ranging, achieving 5 nm @ 60 ms for 1.1 m and 200 nm @ 0.5 s for 25 m. However, long-distance ranging remains technically challenging due to high transmission loss and noise. In this letter, we propose a two-way dual-comb ranging (TWDCR) approach that enables successful ranging over a distance of 113 kilometers. We employ air dispersion analysis and synthetic repetition rate technique to extend the ambiguity range of the inherently noisy channel beyond 100 km. The achieved ranging precision is 11.5 $\mu$m @ 1.3 ms, 681 nm @ 1 s, and 82 nm @ 21 s, as confirmed through a comparative analysis of two independent systems. The advanced long-distance ranging technology is expected to have immediate implications for space research initiatives, such as the space telescope array and the satellite gravimetry.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Classical Wireless Communications and Sensing: Their Models and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significant progress of quantum sensing technologies offer numerous radical solutions for measuring a multitude of physical quantities at an unprecedented precision. Among them, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) emerge as an eminent solution for detecting the electric field of radio frequency (RF) signals, exhibiting a great potential in assisting classical wireless communications and sensing. So far, most experimental studies have aimed for the proof of physical concepts to reveal its promise, while the practical signal model of RAQR-aided wireless communications and sensing remained under-explored. Furthermore, the performance of RAQR-based wireless receivers and their advantages over the conventional RF receivers have not been fully characterized. To fill the gap, we introduce the superheterodyne version of RAQRs to the wireless community by presenting an end-to-end reception scheme. We then develop a corresponding equivalent baseband signal model relying on a realistic reception flow. Our scheme and model provide explicit design guidance to RAQR-aided wireless systems. We next study the performance of RAQR-aided wireless systems based on our model, and compare them to a half-wavelength dipole antenna based conventional RF receiver. The results show that the RAQR is capable of achieving a substantial receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of $\sim 22.6$ decibel (dB) and $\sim 33.5$ dB in the standard (unoptimized) and optimized configurations, respectively.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Non-Hermitian Spectral Topology in Hyperbolic Lattices with Non-Abelian Translation Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hyperbolic lattice (HBL) has emerged as a compelling platform for exploring matter in non-Euclidean space. Among its notable features, the breakdown of the conventional Bloch theorem stands out, prompting a reexamination of band theory, with the determination of spectra for non-Hermitian systems being a prominent example. Here, we develop an approach to determining the spectra under open boundary conditions (OBCs), one of the foundations in non-Hermitian lattices, from the reciprocal space of HBLs. By introducing supercells to encompass states that are allowed by non-Abelian translational groups, we perform analytic continuation and base on the point gap topology to acquire uniform spectra, the universal OBC spectral range. Applying this method to a single-band nonreciprocal model and a reciprocal non-Abelian semimetal model, we reveal higher-dimensional skin effects and topological phase transitions, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of our method in predicting spectral topology and investigating non-Hermitian physics in HBLs.</description>

Abstract: We consider $N$ clones of the quantized world, interacting with each other via quantum gravity, coupled by the downscaled Newton constant $G/N$. In the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$, we obtain the semiclassical Einstein equation for every single cloneworld. In the non-relativistic limit, De Filippo had already obtained the semiclassical Schr\"odinger-Newton equation. Extension for the general relativistic case is the main goal of the present work. We compare our simple correlated cloneworlds with Stamp's correlated worldlines and show why they differ despite the conceptual similarity.</description>

      <title>A brief introduction to the diffusion Monte Carlo method and the fixed-node approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods represent a powerful family of computational techniques for tackling complex quantum many-body problems and performing calculations of stationary state properties. QMC is among the most accurate and powerful approaches to the study of electronic structure, but its application is often hindered by a steep learning curve, hence it is rarely addressed in undergraduate and postgraduate classes. This tutorial is a step towards filling this gap. We offer an introduction to the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method, which aims to solve the imaginary time Schr\"odinger equation through stochastic sampling of the configuration space. Starting from the theoretical foundations, the discussion leads naturally to the formulation of a step-by-step algorithm. To illustrate how the method works in simplified scenarios, examples such as the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom are provided. The discussion extends to the fixed-node approximation, a crucial approach for addressing the fermionic sign problem in multi-electron systems. In particular, we examine the influence of trial wavefunction nodal surfaces on the accuracy of DMC energy by evaluating results from a non-interacting two-fermion system. Extending the method to excited states is feasible in principle, but some additional considerations are needed, supported by practical insights. By addressing the fundamental concepts from a hands-on perspective, we hope this tutorial will serve as a valuable guide for researchers and students approaching DMC for the first time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between unitary dynamics and quantum measurements induces a variety of open quantum phenomena that have no counterparts in closed quantum systems at equilibrium. Here, we generally classify Kraus operators and their effective non-Hermitian dynamical generators within the 38-fold way, thereby establishing the tenfold classification for symmetry and topology of monitored free fermions. Our classification elucidates the role of topology in measurement-induced phase transitions and identifies potential topological terms in the corresponding nonlinear sigma models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nontrivial topology in spacetime manifests itself as anomalous boundary states in Lyapunov spectra, such as Lyapunov zero modes and chiral edge modes, constituting the bulk-boundary correspondence in monitored quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold collisions between two Rydberg rubidium atoms ($^{87}$Rb) are investigated by controlling the impact parameter and collision energy. Optical tweezers are employed to hold one atom stationary while propelling the other to a constant velocity. After the tweezers are deactivated, both atoms are excited to a Rydberg state by a $\pi$-pulse. After a collision, a second $\pi$-pulse is applied. If the stationary atom does not experience a significant momentum transfer and is de-excited to its ground state, it can be recaptured when reactivating the tweezer. The impact parameter dependent collision probability is extracted from the atom loss from the tweezer and used to evaluate the collisional cross section between Rydberg atoms. Quantum and classical simulations of elastic two-body collisions show good agreement with the present experimental data and provide insights into the critical parameter regime where quantum effects become important.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the rapid development of quantum computing, many classical blockchain technologies are now considered insecure. The emergence of quantum blockchain holds promise for addressing this issue. Various quantum consensus algorithms have been proposed so far, but there has not yet been a quantum consensus algorithm tailored specifically for consortium blockchain scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum consensus mechanism, named Q-PnV. This consensus mechanism is based on the classical Proof of Vote (PoV), integrating quantum voting, quantum digital signature and quantum random number generators (QRNGs). By combining Q-PnV with a quantum blockchain using weighted hypergraph states, we propose a comprehensive quantum blockchain solution for consortium blockchain scenarios. Compared to the classical method, the quantum blockchain based on Q-PnV can resist quantum attacks and shows significant improvements in security and fairness, making it better suit-ed for the future quantum era.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical phase transitions induced by local projective measurements have attracted a lot of attention in the past few years. It has been in particular argued that measurements may induce an abrupt change in the scaling law of the bipartite entanglement entropy. In this work we show that local projective measurements on a one-dimensional quadratic fermionic system induce a qualitative modification of the time growth of the entanglement entropy, changing from linear to logarithmic. However, in the stationary regime, the logarithmic behavior of the entanglement entropy does not survive in the thermodynamic limit and, for any finite value of the measurement rate, we numerically show the existence of a single area-law phase for the entanglement entropy. We give analytical arguments supporting our conclusions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flux tuning of qubit frequencies in superconducting quantum processors is fundamental for implementing single and multi-qubit gates in quantum algorithms. Typical architectures involve the use of DC or fast RF lines. However, these lines introduce significant heat dissipation and undesirable decoherence mechanisms, leading to a severe bottleneck for scalability. Among different solutions to overcome this issue, we propose integrating tunnel Superconductor-Insulating-thin superconducting interlayer-Ferromagnet-Superconductor Josephson junctions (SIsFS JJs) into a novel transmon qubit design, the so-called ferrotransmon. SIsFS JJs provide memory properties due to the presence of ferromagnetic barriers and preserve at the same time the low-dissipative behavior of tunnel-insulating JJs, thus promoting an alternative tuning of the qubit frequency. In this work, we discuss the fundamental steps towards the implementation of this hybrid ferromagnetic transmon. We will give a special focus on the design, simulations, and preliminary experimental characterization of superconducting lines to provide in-plane magnetic fields, fundamental for an on-chip control of the qubit frequencies in the ferrotransmon.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Eavesdropper Alliance: How to Achieve Symmetric Privacy in Quantum $X$-Secure $B$-Byzantine $E$-Eavesdropped $U$-Unresponsive $T$-Colluding PIR?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum \emph{symmetric} private information retrieval (QSPIR) problem in a system with $N$ databases and $K$ messages, with $U$ unresponsive servers, $T$-colluding servers, and $X$-security parameter, under several fundamental threat models. In the first model, there are $\mathcal{E}_1$ eavesdropped links in the uplink direction (the direction from the user to the $N$ servers), $\mathcal{E}_2$ eavesdropped links in the downlink direction (the direction from the servers to the user), where $|\mathcal{E}_1|, |\mathcal{E}_2| \leq E$; we coin this eavesdropper setting as \emph{dynamic} eavesdroppers. We show that super-dense coding gain can be achieved for some regimes. In the second model, we consider the case with Byzantine servers, i.e., servers that can coordinate to devise a plan to harm the privacy and security of the system together with static eavesdroppers, by listening to the same links in both uplink and downlink directions. It is important to note the considerable difference between the two threat models, since the eavesdroppers can take huge advantage of the presence of the Byzantine servers. Unlike the previous works in SPIR with Byzantine servers, that assume that the Byzantine servers can send only random symbols independent of the stored messages, we follow the definition of Byzantine servers in \cite{byzantine_tpir}, where the Byzantine servers can send symbols that can be functions of the storage, queries, as well as the random symbols in a way that can produce worse harm to the system. In the third and the most novel threat model, we consider the presence of Byzantine servers and dynamic eavesdroppers together. We show that having dynamic eavesdroppers along with Byzantine servers in the same system model creates more threats to the system than having static eavesdroppers with Byzantine servers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transfer and storage of quantum information in a hybrid quantum system, consisting of an ensemble of atoms or spins interacting with a cavity, is adversely affected by the inhomogeneity of the spins, which negates the coherent exchange of excitations between the physical components. Using a full quantum treatment based on variational renormalization group, we show how quantum information encoded in the states of a parametrically driven hybrid system is strongly protected against any decoherence that may arise due to the inhomogeneity in the spin-ensemble.</description>

      <title>Infinite quantum signal processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) represents a real scalar polynomial of degree $d$ using a product of unitary matrices of size $2\times 2$, parameterized by $(d+1)$ real numbers called the phase factors. This innovative representation of polynomials has a wide range of applications in quantum computation. When the polynomial of interest is obtained by truncating an infinite polynomial series, a natural question is whether the phase factors have a well defined limit as the degree $d\to \infty$. While the phase factors are generally not unique, we find that there exists a consistent choice of parameterization so that the limit is well defined in the $\ell^1$ space. This generalization of QSP, called the infinite quantum signal processing, can be used to represent a large class of non-polynomial functions. Our analysis reveals a surprising connection between the regularity of the target function and the decay properties of the phase factors. Our analysis also inspires a very simple and efficient algorithm to approximately compute the phase factors in the $\ell^1$ space. The algorithm uses only double precision arithmetic operations, and provably converges when the $\ell^1$ norm of the Chebyshev coefficients of the target function is upper bounded by a constant that is independent of $d$. This is also the first numerically stable algorithm for finding phase factors with provable performance guarantees in the limit $d\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Functional analytic insights into irreversibility of quantum resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an approach to the study of quantum resource manipulation based on the basic observation that quantum channels which preserve certain sets of states are contractive with respect to the base norms induced by those sets. We forgo the usual physical assumptions on quantum dynamics: instead of enforcing complete positivity, trace preservation, or resource-theoretic considerations, we study transformation protocols as norm-contractive maps. This allows us to apply to this problem a technical toolset from functional and convex analysis, unifying previous approaches and introducing new families of bounds for the distillable resources and the resource cost, both one-shot and asymptotic. Since our expressions lend themselves naturally to single-letter forms, they can often be calculated in practice; by doing so, we demonstrate with examples that they can yield the best known bounds on quantities such as the entanglement cost. As applications, we not only give an alternative derivation of the recent result of [arXiv:2111.02438] which showed that entanglement theory is asymptotically irreversible, but also provide the quantities introduced in that work with explicit operational meaning in the context of entanglement distillation through a variation of the hypothesis testing relative entropy. Besides entanglement, we reveal a new irreversible quantum resource: through improved bounds for state transformations in the resource theory of magic-state quantum computation, we show that there exist qutrit magic states that cannot be reversibly interconverted under stabiliser protocols.</description>

Abstract: TeD-Q is an open-source software framework for quantum machine learning, variational quantum algorithm (VQA), and simulation of quantum computing. It seamlessly integrates classical machine learning libraries with quantum simulators, giving users the ability to leverage the power of classical machine learning while training quantum machine learning models. TeD-Q supports auto-differentiation that provides backpropagation, parameters shift, and finite difference methods to obtain gradients. With tensor contraction, simulation of quantum circuits with large number of qubits is possible. TeD-Q also provides a graphical mode in which the quantum circuit and the training progress can be visualized in real-time.</description>

      <title>Consistent Quantum Causes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing a quantum analog of the modern classical theory of causation, as formulated by Pearl and others using directed acyclic graphs, requires a theory of random or stochastic time development at the microscopic level, where the noncommutation of Hilbert-space projectors cannot be ignored. The Consistent Histories approach provides such a theory. How it works is shown by applying it to simple examples involving beam splitters and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. It justifies the usual laboratory intuition that properly tested apparatus can reveal the earlier microscopic cause (e.g., as in radioactive decay) of a later macroscopic meassurement outcome. This approach is further illustrated by how it resolves the Bell inequalities paradox. The use of quantum circuits in discussions of quantum information in a time-irreversible manner can prevent the proper identification of earlier causes; this is illustrated using a specific circuit in the case of Bell inequalities. The approach to quantum causes known as Quantum Causal Models fails becuase it is not based upon a satisfactory theory of quantum random processes.</description>

      <title>The resource theory of tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor networks provide succinct representations of quantum many-body states and are an important computational tool for strongly correlated quantum systems. Their expressive and computational power is characterized by an underlying entanglement structure, on a lattice or more generally a (hyper)graph, with virtual entangled pairs or multipartite entangled states associated to (hyper)edges. Changing this underlying entanglement structure into another can lead to both theoretical and computational benefits. We study a natural resource theory which generalizes the notion of bond dimension to entanglement structures using multipartite entanglement. It is a direct extension of resource theories of tensors studied in the context of multipartite entanglement and algebraic complexity theory, allowing for the application of the sophisticated methods developed in these fields to tensor networks. The resource theory of tensor networks concerns both the local entanglement structure of a quantum many-body state and the (algebraic) complexity of tensor network contractions using this entanglement structure. We show that there are transformations between entanglement structures which go beyond edge-by-edge conversions, highlighting efficiency gains of our resource theory that mirror those obtained in the search for better matrix multiplication algorithms. We also provide obstructions to the existence of such transformations by extending a variety of methods originally developed in algebraic complexity theory for obtaining complexity lower bounds. The resource theory of tensor networks allows to compare different entanglement structures and should lead to more efficient tensor network representations and contraction algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We present a marginal likelihood strategy integrated into the Kennedy-O'Hagan (KOH) Bayesian framework, where a Gaussian process serves as a prior for model discrepancy. The proposed method is both computationally efficient and numerically stable, even in large dataset regimes where the likelihood function approaches degeneracy. Applied to the characterization of a super-conducting quantum device at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the approach enhances the predictive accuracy of the Lindblad master equations for modeling Ramsey measurement data by effectively quantifying uncertainties consistent with the quantum data</description>

Abstract: Quantum state purification is the task of recovering a nearly pure copy of an unknown pure quantum state using multiple noisy copies of the state. This basic task has applications to quantum communication over noisy channels and quantum computation with imperfect devices, but has only been studied previously for the case of qubits. We derive an efficient purification procedure based on the swap test for qudits of any dimension, starting with any initial error parameter. Treating the initial error parameter and the dimension as constants, we show that our procedure has sample complexity asymptotically optimal in the final error parameter. Our protocol has a simple recursive structure that can be applied when the states are provided one at a time in a streaming fashion, requiring only a small quantum memory to implement.</description>

      <title>Efficient preparation of the AKLT State with Measurement-based Imaginary Time Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation plays a crucial role in several areas of quantum information science, in applications such as quantum simulation, quantum metrology and quantum computing. However, typically state preparation requires resources that scale exponentially with the problem size, due to their probabilistic nature or otherwise, making studying such models challenging. In this article, we propose a method to prepare the ground state of the Affleck-Lieb-Kennedy-Tasaki (AKLT) model deterministically using a measurement-based imaginary time evolution (MITE) approach. By taking advantage of the special properties of the AKLT state, we show that it can be prepared efficiently using the MITE approach. Estimates based on the convergence of a sequence of local projections, as well as direct evolution of the MITE algorithm suggest a constant scaling with respect to the number of AKLT sites, which is an exponential improvement over the naive estimate for convergence. We show that the procedure is compatible with qubit-based simulators, and show that using a variational quantum algorithm for circuit recompilation, the measurement operator required for MITE can be well approximated by a circuit with a much shallower circuit depth compared with the one obtained using the default Qiskit method.</description>

      <title>Fixing detailed balance in ancilla-based dissipative state engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissipative state engineering is a general term for a protocol which prepares the ground state of a complex many-body Hamiltonian using engineered dissipation or engineered environments. Recently, it was shown that a version of this protocol, where the engineered environment consists of one or more dissipative qubit ancillas tuned to be resonant with the low-energy transitions of a many-body system, resulted in the combined system evolving to reasonable approximation to the ground state. This potentially broadens the applicability of the method beyond non-frustrated systems, to which it was previously restricted. Here we argue that this approach has an intrinsic limitation because the ancillas, seen as an effective bath by the system in the weak-coupling limit, do not give the detailed balance expected for a true zero-temperature environment. Our argument is based on the study of a similar approach employing linear coupling to bosonic ancillas. We explore overcoming this limitation using a recently developed technique from open-quantum-systems called pseudomodes. With a simple example model of a 1D quantum Ising chain, we show that detailed balance can be fixed, and a more accurate estimation of the ground state obtained, at the cost of two additional unphysical dissipative modes and the extrapolation error of implementing those modes in physical systems.</description>

Abstract: Color centers in the O-band (1260-1360 nm) are critical for realizing long-coherence quantum network nodes in memory-assisted quantum communications. However, only a limited number of O-band color centers have been explored in silicon hosts as spin-photon interfaces. This study explores and compares two promising O-band defects in silicon: T centers and $^*$Cu (transition metal) color centers. During T center formation, we observed the formation and dissolution of various defects, including the copper-silver-related defect with a doublet line around 1312 nm ($^*$Cu$^{0}_{n}$), near the optical fiber zero dispersion wavelength. We then investigate the photophysics of both T and $^*$Cu centers, focusing on their emission spectra and spin properties to assess their potential for high-fidelity spin-photon interfaces. Additionally, we report a 25\% broadening of the $^*$Cu$^{0}_{0}$ line under a 0.5 T magnetic field, potentially linked to spin degeneracy, suggesting that this defect may provide a promising alternative to T centers for spin-photon interfaces.</description>

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is becoming increasingly more important in times of autonomous driving and other smart industrial applications. Simultaneously a promising new approach to Reinforcement Learning arises using the inherent properties of quantum mechanics, reducing the trainable parameters of a model significantly. However, gradient-based Multi-Agent Quantum Reinforcement Learning methods often have to struggle with barren plateaus, holding them back from matching the performance of classical approaches. We build upon an existing approach for gradient free Quantum Reinforcement Learning and propose three genetic variations with Variational Quantum Circuits for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning using evolutionary optimization. We evaluate our genetic variations in the Coin Game environment and also compare them to classical approaches. We showed that our Variational Quantum Circuit approaches perform significantly better compared to a neural network with a similar amount of trainable parameters. Compared to the larger neural network, our approaches archive similar results using $97.88\%$ less parameters.</description>

      <title>Precision Enhancement in Spatial Measurement by Introducing Squeezed Light into Weak Value Amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precision enhancement is demonstrated in an optical spatial measurement based on weak value amplification (WVA) system and split-like detection, by injecting a TEM$_{10}$ squeezed vacuum beam. It is the first time to experimentally realize high-precision optical spatial measurement beyond the shot noise limit by using squeezing-assisted WVA. Based on the WVA technique, which can amplify the signal by increasing the number of photons that injected into the interferometer, squeezed beam injection can reduce the noise level and can further improve the signal-to-noise ratio(SNR). As a result, a SNR improvement of 2dB, i.e., 1.3 time precision enhancement, can be achieved, by using a 2dB squeezed beam injection and 2.6\% postselection probability in WVA process. Our work provides an effective method to accomplish higher precision in quantum spatial measurement, which has potential applications in gravitational wave interferometer calibration, super-resolution quantum imaging, etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing photonic graph states, crucial in various quantum protocols, is challenging due to the absence of deterministic entangling gates in linear optics. To address this, emitter qubits have been leveraged to establish and transfer the entanglement to photons. We introduce an optimization method for such protocols based on the local Clifford equivalency of states and the graph theoretical correlations of the generation cost parameters. Employing this method, we achieve a 50% reduction in use of the 2-qubit gates for generation of the arbitrary large repeater graph states and similar significant reductions in the total gate count for generation of random dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Differentiation of Linear Optical Circuits</title>

Abstract: Linear optical circuits with single-photon sources offer a promising platform for quantum chemistry and machine learning. However, current applications are all based on support vector machines or gradient-free optimization methods. This paper develops classical and quantum algorithms for evaluating the analytic gradients of linear optical circuits with respect to their phase parameters. First, we set up a general framework by characterising the class of observables whose expectation values can be estimated efficiently by sampling from a passive linear optical circuit with finitely many photons. We then show how to compute the gradients of the expectation values of a special class of ``non-interacting'' observables arising in full-counting-statistics. Our differentiation algorithm uses the Halmos dilation and requires evaluating two circuits of twice the size, using one additional photon. Building on the methods of full-counting-statistics, we show how to recover the gradients of arbitrary observables from the gradient of a non-interacting characteristic function. Throughout the paper, we compare the performance of classical and quantum algorithms on the same estimation problems, analysing the sampling complexity of the algorithms and suggesting different cases for which quantum speed-ups could be obtained.</description>

      <title>Hilbert-Space Ergodicity in Driven Quantum Systems: Obstructions and Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite its long history, a canonical formulation of quantum ergodicity that applies to general classes of quantum dynamics, including driven systems, has not been fully established. Here we introduce and study a notion of quantum ergodicity for closed systems with time-dependent Hamiltonians, defined as statistical randomness exhibited in their longtime dynamics. Concretely, we consider the temporal ensemble of quantum states (time-evolution operators) generated by the evolution, and investigate the conditions necessary for them to be statistically indistinguishable from uniformly random states (operators) in the Hilbert space (space of unitaries). We find that the number of driving frequencies underlying the Hamiltonian needs to be sufficiently large for this to occur. Conversely, we show that statistical pseudo-randomness -- indistinguishability up to some large but finite moment, can already be achieved by a quantum system driven with a single frequency, i.e., a Floquet system, as long as the driving period is sufficiently long. Our work relates the complexity of a time-dependent Hamiltonian and that of the resulting quantum dynamics, and offers a fresh perspective to the established topics of quantum ergodicity and chaos from the lens of quantum information.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of certain pair state in a quantum network with isomorphic branches, governed by the Heisenberg $XY$ Hamiltonian, depends solely on the local structure, and it remains unaffected even if the global structure is altered. All graphs which enable high-fidelity vertex state transfer can be considered as isomorphic branches of a quantum network to exhibit high-fidelity pair state transfer. The results are used to unveil the existence of pair state transfer in various graphs, including paths, cycles, and others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are a promising route to achieving large-scale quantum computers. A key challenge in realising large-scale superconducting quantum processors involves mitigating frequency collisions. In this paper, we present an approach to tuning fixed-frequency qubits with the use of an electron beam to locally anneal the Josephson junction. We demonstrate the ability to both increase and decrease the junction barrier resistance. The technique shows an improvement in wafer scale frequency targetting by assessing the frequency collisions in our qubit architecture. Coherence measurements are also done to evaluate the performance before and after tuning. The tuning process utilises a standard electron beam lithography system, ensuring reproducibility and implementation by any group capable of fabricating these Josephson junctions. This technique has the potential to significantly improve the performance of large-scale quantum computing systems, thereby paving the way for the future of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Recovering Quantum Coherence of a Cavity Qubit Coupled to a Noisy Ancilla through Real-Time Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoherence in qubits, caused by their interaction with a noisy environment, poses a significant challenge to the development of reliable quantum processors. A prominent source of errors arises from noise in coupled ancillas, which can quickly spread to qubits. By actively monitoring these noisy ancillas, it is possible to not only identify qubit decoherence events but also to correct these errors in real time. This approach is particularly beneficial for bosonic qubits, where the interaction with ancillas is a dominant source of decoherence. In this work, we uncover the intricate dynamics of decoherence in a superconducting cavity qubit due to its interaction with a noisy transmon ancilla. By tracking the noisy ancilla trajectory and using real-time feedback, we successfully recover the lost coherence of the cavity qubit, achieving a fivefold increase in its pure dephasing time. Additionally, by detecting ancilla errors and converting them into erasures, we improve the pure dephasing time by more than an order of magnitude. These advances are essential for realizing long-lived cavity qubits with high-fidelity gates, and they pave the way for more efficient bosonic quantum error-correction codes.</description>

      <title>Spin relaxation in inhomogeneous magnetic fields with depolarizing boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field-inhomogeneity-induced relaxation of atomic spins confined in vapor cells with depolarizing walls is studied. In contrast to nuclear spins, such as noble-gas spins, which experience minimal polarization loss at cell walls, atomic spins in uncoated cells undergo randomization at the boundaries. This distinct boundary condition results in a varied dependence of the relaxation rate on the field gradient. By solving the Bloch-Torrey equation under fully depolarizing boundary conditions, we illustrate that the relaxation rate induced by field inhomogeneity is more pronounced for spins with a smaller original relaxation rate (in the absence of the inhomogeneous field). We establish an upper limit for the relaxation rate through calculations in the perturbation regime. Moreover, we connect it to the spin-exchange-relaxation-free magnetometers, demonstrating that its linewidth is most sensitive to inhomogeneous fields along the magnetometer's sensitive axis. Our theoretical result agrees with the experimental data for cells subjected to small pump power. A deviation in high input-power scenarios arises from pump field attenuation, resulting in a non-uniformly distributed light shift that behaves like an inhomogeneous magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians via commutator-free quasi-Magnus operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is arguably the most fundamental application of quantum computers. The Magnus operator is a popular method for time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation in computational mathematics, yet its usage requires the implementation of exponentials of commutators, which has previously made it unappealing for quantum computing. The development of commutator-free quasi-Magnus operators (CFQMs) circumvents this obstacle, at the expense of a lack of provable global numeric error bounds. In this work, we establish one such error bound for CFQM-based time-dependent quantum Hamiltonian simulation by carefully estimating the error of each step involved in their definition. This allows us to compare its cost with the alternatives, and show that CFQMs are often the most efficient product-formula technique available by more than an order of magnitude. As a result, we find that CFQMs may be particularly useful to simulate time-dependent Hamiltonians on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of different forms of weak measurements on the nature of the measurement induced phase transition are theoretically studied in hybrid random quantum circuits of qubits. We use a combination of entanglement measures, ancilla purification dynamics, and a transfer matrix approach to compute the critical exponents, the effective central charge, and the multifractal spectrum of the measurement induced transitions. We compare weak measurements with an infinite number of discrete outcomes to a protocol with only a pair of outcomes and find that to within our numerical accuracy the universal critical properties are unaffected by the weak measurement protocols and are consistent with the universality class found for strong projective measurements.</description>

      <title>Walking behavior induced by $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking in a non-Hermitian $\rm XY$ model with clock anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum system governed by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian may exhibit zero temperature phase transitions that are driven by interactions, just as its Hermitian counterpart, raising the fundamental question how non-Hermiticity affects quantum criticality. In this context we consider a non-Hermitian system consisting of an $\rm XY$ model with a complex-valued four-state clock interaction that may or may not have parity-time-reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. When the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is broken, and time-evolution becomes non-unitary, a scaling behavior similar to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition ensues, but in a highly unconventional way, as the line of fixed points is absent. From the analysis of the $d$-dimensional RG equations, we obtain that the unconventional behavior in the $\mathcal{PT}$ broken regime follows from the collision of two fixed points in the $d\to 2$ limit, leading to walking behavior or pseudocriticality. For $d=2+1$ the near critical behavior is characterized by a correlation length exponent $\nu=3/8$, a value smaller than the mean-field one. These results are in sharp contrast with the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric case where only one fixed point arises for $2&lt;d&lt;4$ and in $d=1+1$ three lines of fixed points occur with a continuously varying critical exponent $\nu$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) represent a class of algorithms that utilize a hybrid approach, combining classical and quantum computing techniques. In this approach, classical computers serve as optimizers that update circuit parameters to find approximate solutions to complex problems. In this study, we apply a method known as Light Cone Cancellation (LCC) to optimize variational circuits, effectively reducing the required number of qubits and gates for circuit simulation. We then evaluate the performance of LCC one of the VQAs -- the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) -- to address the Max-Cut problem. Compared with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), VQE offers greater degrees of freedom and promising results at lower circuit depths. By applying LCC to VQE, we can shift the complexity of circuit simulation from the number of qubits to the number of edges in the graph, i.e., from exponential time to polynomial time. This enables us to solve large problems up to 100 vertices, without actually simulating the entire circuit. From our simulation in a 7-qubit and a 27-qubit fake backends, we show that LCC yields higher approximation ratios than those cases without LCC, implying that the effect of noise is reduced when LCC is applied.</description>

      <title>Trade-off relations between Bell nonlocality and local Kochen-Specker contextuality in generalized Bell scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relations between Bell nonlocality and Kochen-Specker contextuality have been subject of research from many different perspectives in the last decades. Recently, some interesting results on these relations have been explored in the so-called generalized Bell scenarios, that is, scenarios where Bell spatial separation (or agency independence) coexist with (at least one of the) parties' ability to perform compatible measurements at each round of the experiment. When this party has an $n$-cycle compatiblity setup, it was first claimed that Bell nonlocality could not be concomitantly observed with contextuality at this party's local experiment. However, by a more natural reading of the definition of locality, it turns out that both Bell nonlocality and local contextuality can, in fact, be jointly present. In spite of it, in this work we prove that there cannot be arbitrary amounts of both of these two resources together. That is, we show the existence of a trade-off relation between Bell nonlocality and local contextuality in such scenarios. We explore this trade-off both in terms of inequalities and quantifiers, and we discuss how it can be understood in terms of a `global' notion of contextuality. Furthermore, we show that such notion does not only encompass local contextuality and Bell nonlocality, but also other forms of nonclassical correlations.</description>

Abstract: Harnessing high-dimensional entangled states of light presents a frontier for advancing quantum information technologies, from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to enhanced computation and communication protocols. In this context, the spatial degree of freedom stands out as particularly suited for on-chip integration. But while traditional demonstrations produce and manipulate path-entangled states sequentially with discrete optical elements, continuously-coupled nonlinear waveguide systems offer a promising alternative where photons can be generated and interfere along the entire propagation length, unveiling novel capabilities within a reduced footprint. Here we exploit this concept to implement a compact and reconfigurable source of path-entangled photon pairs based on parametric down-conversion in semiconductor nonlinear waveguides arrays. We use a double-pump configuration to engineer the output quantum state and implement various types of spatial correlations, exploiting a quantum interference effect between the biphoton state generated in each pumped waveguide. This demonstration, at room temperature and telecom wavelength, illustrates the potential of continuously-coupled systems as a promising alternative to discrete multi-component quantum circuits for leveraging the high-dimensional spatial degree of freedom of photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an even-parity precession protocol that can detect the nonclassicality of some quantum states using only measurements of a uniformly-precessing variable at different points in time. Depending on the system under study, the protocol may detect the Wigner negativity of a single quantum harmonic oscillator or of a single spin $j\geq 2$; the non-Gaussian entanglement of two harmonic oscillators; or genuine multipartite entanglement of a spin ensemble, whose total spin is an integer. Unlike in other nonclassicality tests, simultaneous or sequential measurements are not required. Our protocol can also detect states that commute with the parity operator, which were missed by similar protocols built from Tsirelson's original precession protocol. This work also closes a long-standing gap by showing the possibility of detecting the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entanglement of an even number of qubits using only collective spin measurements.</description>

Abstract: Continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) on dynamic graphs, referred to as dynamic CTQWs, are a recently introduced universal model of computation that offers a new paradigm in which to envision quantum algorithms. In this work we develop a mapping from dynamic CTQWs to the gate model of computation in the form of an algorithm to convert arbitrary single-edge walks and single self-loop walks, which are the fundamental building blocks of dynamic CTQWs, to their circuit model counterparts. We use this mapping to introduce an efficient sparse quantum state preparation framework based on dynamic CTQWs. Our approach utilizes global information about the target state, relates state preparation to finding the optimal path in a graph, and leads to optimizations in the reduction of controls that are not as obvious in other approaches. Interestingly, classical optimization problems such as the minimal hitting set, minimum spanning tree, and shortest Hamiltonian path problems arise in our framework. We test our methods against the state-of-the-art ancilla free sparse state preparation method and a uniformly controlled rotation method, which is used by Qiskit, and find ours requires fewer CX gates when the target state has a polynomial number of non-zero amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Size Matters: Lorentz Boosted Casimir Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many evidences appear in the past decades and show that the negativity of Casimir energy is responsible for exotic mechanical and gravitational effects. We study in this work the Lorentz boost of a Casimir cavity, on which little attention is paid to its momentum in historical works. We find that the vacuum energy and momentum carried by the cavity transform differently from those of point particles due to the cavity's extension feature. However, the mass-shell condition of the two are identical as long as the cavity is finite along the moving direction only.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Entangled Quantum Noise Radar Over Order of Kilometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, an explicit expression for the maximum detection range of an entangled quantum two-mode squeezed (QTMS) radar, in which a two-mode squeezed vacuum state of microwave electromagnetic fields is used, have been derived by considering both the quantum properties of the entangled microwave fields and radar parameters. By comparing this equation with that of traditional radars, we showed that one can though a QTMS radar as a traditional radar with a reduced threshold signal-to-noise ratio. By discussing the current limitations, it has been shown that the critical parameter to have both simultaneous quantum advantage and substantial radar range is increasing the bandwidth of the generated output signal in the quantum entangled source. It has been shown that by considering the current feasible system parameters, it is possible to implement a QTMS radar with maximum detection range up to the order of $2\mathrm{km}$, which is suitable for recognizing small unmanned aerial vehicles in urban distances. Moreover, based on the false alarm rate, we introduce two classes of early alarm and track QTMS radars. The present approach can be generalized to other quantum radars with different types of quantum sources like electro-opto-mechanical sources, and also may shed new light on investigating the quantum radar system toward practical applications. Finally, we have discussed the potential outlooks to improve and develop the quantum entangled radar systems to be practical from the engineering point of view.</description>

      <title>Genuine Multipartite Entanglement induced by a Thermal Acoustic Reservoir</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is not only fundamental interesting for the study of quantum-to-classical transition, but also is essential for realizing universal quantum computing and quantum networks. Here we investigate the multipartite entanglement (ME) dynamics in a linear chain of N LC resonators interacting optomechanically with a common thermal acoustic reservoir. By presenting the exact analytical solutions of system evolution, we predict the periodic generation of non-Gaussian ME, including the discrete and continuous variables entanglement. Interestingly, the GME is obtained even though the system is in a heat bath. The mechanism relies on the special acoustic environment featuring frequency comb structure. More importantly, our proposed model also allows the periodic generation of entangled multipartite cat states (MCSs), i.e., a typical GHZ state, with high fidelity. This work fundamentally broadens the fields of ME, and have wide applications in implementing thermal-noise-resistant quantum information processing and many-body quantum simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14225v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tachyons have fascinated generations of physicists due to their peculiar behavior, but they did not solve any real physical problem. This may have changed with the recent works of Dragan et al., who have shown that superluminal observers may be related to the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM) because they require introducing non-determinism and wave-like behavior at the fundamental level. Unfortunately, we show that the tachyon quantum field theory proposed as a part of this program is not quantum since the tachyon field commutes at all points and the canonical commutations relations of a quantum scalar field are not satisfied. We also discuss other authors' theories, e.g., we show that the Dhar-Sudarshan's formula for the Feynman propagator violates unitarity, and we apply the LSZ formalism to tachyons for the first time, where we find that one cannot prove the LSZ asymptotic condition just by replacing plane waves with wavepackets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of the Cournot model based on the most general entanglement operator containing quadratic expressions which is symmetric with respect to the exchange of players are considered. The degree of entanglement of games dependent on one and two squeezing parameters and their payoff values in Nash equilibrium are compared. The analysis showed that the relationship between the degree of entanglement of the initial state of the game and the payoff values in Nash equilibrium is ambiguous. The phase values included in the entanglement operator have a strong influence on the final outcome of the game. In a quantum duopoly based on the initial state of a game that depends on one squeezing parameter, the maximum possible payoff in Nash equilibrium cannot be reached when the value of the phase parameter is greater than zero, in contrast to a game that depends on two parameters.</description>

      <title>Over-rotation coherent error induced by pseudo-twirling of quantum gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation schemes (QEM) have greatly enhanced the performance of quantum computers, mostly by reducing errors caused by interactions with the environment. Nevertheless, the presence of coherence errors, typically arising from miscalibration and inter-qubit crosstalk, is a significant challenge to the scalability of quantum computing. Such errors are often addressed using a refined Pauli twirling scheme called Randomized Compiling (RC) that converts the coherent errors into incoherent errors that can then be mitigated by conventional QEM. Unfortunately for multi-qubit gates, RC is restricted to Clifford gates such as CNOT and CPHASE. However, it has been demonstrated experimentally that a direct implementation of multi-qubit non-Clifford gates, i.e. without using multi-qubit Clifford gates, has reduced the depth of the circuit by a factor of four and more. Recently, a framework called pseudo-twirling (PST) for treating coherent error in multi-qubit non-Clifford gates has been introduced and experimentally demonstrated. We show analytically that a higher order correction to the existing PST theory yields an over-rotation coherent error generated by the PST protocol itself. This PST effect has no analogue in RC. Although the small induced over-rotation can amount to a significant coherent error in deep circuits, we explain why it does not degrade the performance of the gate. Interestingly, we find that a simplified twirling scheme that was introduced and exploited experimentally by Kim et al. also displays an induced over-rotation. We study the conditions under which the two twirling schemes display the same over-rotation behavior.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of wave function by coherent ensembles of trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-use some original ideas of de~Broglie, Schr\"odiger, Dirac and Feynman to revise the ensemble interpretation of wave function in quantum mechanics. To this end we introduce coherence (auto-concordance) of ensembles of quantum trajectories in the space-time. The coherence condition accounts phases proportional to classical action, which are in foundation of the Feynman path integral technique. Therefore, our interpretation is entirely based on well-known and tested concepts and methods of wave mechanics. Similarly to other ensemble interpretations our approach allows us to avoid all problems and paradoxes related to wave function collapse during a measurement process. Another consequence is that no quantum computation or quantum cryptography method will ever work if it assumes that a particular q-bit represents the entire wave function.</description>

      <title>Mutual information chain rules for security proofs robust against device imperfections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we derive a number of chain rules for mutual information quantities, suitable for analyzing quantum cryptography with imperfect devices that leak additional information to an adversary. First, we derive a chain rule between smooth min-entropy and smooth max-information, which improves over previous chain rules for characterizing one-shot information leakage caused by an additional conditioning register. Second, we derive an ''information bounding theorem'' that bounds the R\'enyi mutual information of a state produced by a sequence of channels, in terms of the R\'enyi mutual information of the individual channel outputs, similar to entropy accumulation theorems. In particular, this yields simple bounds on the smooth max-information in the preceding chain rule. Third, we derive chain rules between R\'enyi entropies and R\'enyi mutual information, which can be used to modify the entropy accumulation theorem to accommodate leakage registers sent to the adversary in each round of a protocol. We show that these results can be used to handle some device imperfections in a variety of device-dependent and device-independent protocols, such as randomness generation and quantum key distribution.</description>

      <title>Emergent symmetries in prethermal phases of periodically driven quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodically driven closed quantum systems are expected to eventually heat up to infinite temperature reaching a steady state described by a circular orthogonal ensemble (COE). However, such finite driven systems may exhibit sufficiently long prethermal regimes; their properties in these regimes are qualitatively different from that in their infinite temperature steady states. These, often experimentally relevant, prethermal regimes host a wide range of phenomena; they may exhibit dynamical localization and freezing, host Floquet scars, display signatures of Hilbert space fragmentation, and exhibit time crystalline phases. Such phenomena are often accompanied by emergent approximate dynamical symmetries which have no analogue in equilibrium systems. In this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the origin and nature of these symmetries and discuss their role in shaping the prethermal phases of a class of periodically driven closed quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a one-way, one-quantum cascade, whereby a single excitation proceeds one-directionwise in a ladder of energy levels. This makes a variation from more famous two-way cascades where the excitation can go up and down following its excitation or relaxation in the ladder. We provide closed-form solutions for two-photon correlation functions between any transitions in such circular cascades. We discuss how the rich correlations that result from what appears to be an extremely simple implementation, are essentially those which have been obtained from complex architectures relying on strongly-correlated, many-body physics or cavity QED effects, and might constitute the liquid phase of the new family of time materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spin (qubit) is in contact with a bosonic reservoir. The state of the reservoir contains a parameter {\varepsilon} interpolating between quantum and classical reservoir features. We derive the explicit expression for the time-dependent reduced spin density matrix, valid for all values of {\varepsilon} and for energy conserving interactions. We study decoherence and markovianity properties. Our main finding is that the spin decoherence is enhanced (full decoherence) when the spin is coupled to quantum reservoir states while it is dampened (partial decoherence) when coupled to classical reservoir states. The markovianity properties depend in a subtle way on the classicality parameter {\varepsilon} and on the finer details of the spin-reservoir interaction. We further examine scattering and periodicity properties for energy exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Thermal-Noise Limit of Microwave Measurements by Pre-cooling with an Active Cold Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a method, which we here name ``active pre-cooling'' (APC), for removing, just prior to performing a measurement, a large fraction of the deleterious thermal photons that would otherwise occupy the electromagnetic modes of a microwave cavity or some alternative form of radio-frequency resonator. The removal is achieved by temporarily over-coupling the cavity's modes to an active cold load (ACL). We report a room-temperature bench-top demonstration of the method, where this load takes the form of the input of a commercial low-noise amplifier (LNA). No isolator is inserted between the LNA's input and the cavity's coupling port. The noise temperature of a monitored microwave mode drops to 123 K. Upon incorporating our pre-coolable cavity into a time-resolved (tr-) EPR spectrometer, a commensurate improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio is observed, corresponding to a factor-of-5 speed up over a conventional tr-EPR measurement at room temperature for the same precision and/or sensitivity. Modeling indicates the feasibility, for realistic mode quality factors and couplings, of cooling the room-temperature cavity's modes down to a few tens of K, and for this coldness to last several tens of microseconds, whilst the cavity and its contents are optimally interrogated by a microwave tone or pulse sequence. The method thus provides a simple and generally applicable approach to improving the sensitivity and/or read-out speed in pulsed and time-resolved EPR spectroscopy, quantum detection and other radiometric measurements. It provides a first-stage cold reservoir (of microwave photons) for other, deeper cooling methods to work from and, through the use of cryogenic ACLs (realized, in the first instance, as the inputs of existing cryogenic low-noise amplifiers), the method could itself be directly extended to lower temperature regimes.</description>

Abstract: Single-shot quantum error correction has the potential to speed up quantum computations by removing the need for multiple rounds of syndrome extraction in order to be fault-tolerant. Using Quantinuum's H2 trapped-ion quantum computer, we implement the [[33,1,4]] 4D surface code and perform the first experimental demonstration of single-shot quantum error correction with bare ancilla qubits. We conduct memory experiments comparing the 2D and 4D surface codes and find that despite differences in qubit use and syndrome extraction circuit depth, the 4D surface code matches or outperforms the 2D surface code in both the fault-tolerant and single-shot regimes.</description>

Abstract: Work extractable from quantum system can be viewed as a resource to perform some tasks. Here, we try to related the work extractable to some resource theory. To do this, we consider completely passive states and passive states as free states and we formulate resource theories where the maximum work extractable is a monotone, by identifying the free operations. In particular, we study how the free operations act on the free states, showing how a sort of temperature plays a pivotal role in these resource theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating quantum amplitude (the overlap between two quantum states) is a fundamental task in quantum computing and serves as a core subroutine in numerous quantum algorithms. In this work, we present a novel algorithmic framework for estimating quantum amplitudes by transforming pure states into matrix forms and encoding them into non-diagonal blocks of density operators and diagonal blocks of unitary operators. Our framework presents two specific estimation protocols, achieving the standard quantum limit $\epsilon^{-2}$ and the Heisenberg limit $\epsilon^{-1}$, respectively. Whenever one quantum state is prepared by a $\mathit{o}(n)$-depth quantum circuit and the other has a large entanglement under a certain bi-partition, our algorithm can give exponential improvement over the direct Hadamard test and amplitude estimation algorithm for both query complexity and gate complexity. The gate complexity reduction comes from a new technique called channel block encoding. This technique provides a systematical and efficient way to embed the matrix form of a pure state into a density operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a tight upper bound for the difference in von Neumann entropies between two quantum states, $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$. This bound is expressed in terms of the von Neumann entropies of the mutually orthogonal states derived from the Jordan-Hahn decomposition of the difference operator $(\rho_1 - \rho_2)$. This yields a novel entropic inequality that implies the well-known Audenaert-Fannes (AF) inequality. In fact, it also leads to a refinement of the AF inequality. We employ this inequality to obtain a uniform continuity bound for the quantum conditional entropy of two states whose marginals on the conditioning system coincide. We additionally use it to derive a continuity bound for the quantum relative entropy in both variables.

      <title>Heat current and fluctuations between a dissipative qubit and a monitor under continuous measurement and feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous quantum measurement and feedback induce heat exchange between a dissipative qubit and a monitor even in the steady state, as a measurement backaction. Using the Lindblad equation, we identified the maximum and minimum values of the steady-state heat current as the measurement and feedback states vary, and we demonstrate the qubit cooling induced by these processes. Turning our attention to quantum trajectories under continuous measurement and feedback, we observe that the heat current fluctuates around the steady-state values. We reveal that the fluctuations are strongly influenced by the measurement backaction, distinguishing them from the standard Poisson noise typically observed in electric circuits. Our results offer potential application in the development of quantum refrigerators controlled by continuous measurement and feedback, and provide deep insight into quantum thermodynamics from the perspective of fluctuation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a toy model of ion-atom hybrid quantum system for quantum computing. We show that when two atomic qubits in two largely separated optical tweezers interact with a single trapped ion through Rydberg excitation of the atoms, there exists an ion-mediated atom-atom interaction which exceeds the direct interatomic interaction at large separation. We employ this mediated interaction to demonstrate two-qubit control phase gate operation with 97\% fidelity by addressing the individual atomic qubits with lasers.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous tunneling time within the theory of time-of-arrival operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown in Phys. Rev. Lett., 108 170402 (2012) (https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.170402), that quantum tunneling is instantaneous using a time-of-arrival (TOA) operator constructed by Weyl quantization of the classical TOA. However, there are infinitely many possible quantum images of the classical TOA, leaving it unclear if one is uniquely preferred over the others. This raises the question on whether instantaneous tunneling time is simply an artifact of the chosen ordering rule. Here, we demonstrate that tunneling time vanishes for all possible quantum images of the classical arrival time, irrespective of the ordering rule between the position and momentum observables. The result still holds for TOA-operators that are constructed independent of canonical quantization, while still imposing the correct algebra defined by the time-energy canonical commutation relation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Verification of Stabilizer Code Subspaces with Local Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the task of verifying whether a quantum computer, designed to be protected by a specific stabilizer code, correctly encodes the corresponding logical qubits. To achieve this, we develop a general framework for subspace verification and explore several stabilizer code subspaces of practical significance. First, we present two efficient verification strategies for general stabilizer code subspaces, utilizing measurements of their stabilizer generators and stabilizer groups, respectively. Then, building on the observation that certain tests can be conducted in parallel when the subspace exhibits specific structural properties, we propose a coloring strategy tailored to graph code subspaces and an XZ strategy tailored to Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code subspaces. Compared to stabilizer-based strategies, these new strategies require significantly fewer measurement settings and consume fewer state copies, approaching near-global optimality. Notably, all the strategies employ a limited number of Pauli measurements, are non-adaptive, and work on mixed states, enabling efficient experimental certification of both logical qubits and logical operations in noisy quantum computers. This work contributes to the first systematic study of efficient verification of stabilizer code subspaces with local measurements.</description>

Abstract: Intrinsic decoherence models (IDMs) have been proposed in order to solve the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. In this work, we assess the status of two of these models as physical theories by establishing the ultimate bounds on the estimability of their parameters. Our results show that dephasing and dissipative IDMs are amenable to falsification and should be considered physical theories worthy of experimental study.</description>

Abstract: Thermal effects in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Hegger (SSH) topological insulator are studied. Particularly, we focus on quantum information processing (QIP) capacity for thermal ensembles. To evaluate QIP an optimized quantum Fisher information (OQFI) is introduced as a quantifier of entanglement and topological phases are calculated by a definition in real space for the electric polarization of mixture states. For the thermal ensemble, there is a relationship between the Fisher metric and the electric polarization in such a way that in the topological region, there is more entanglement, therefore, these generate more robustness and protection in the quantum information due to thermal effects. Also, long-range hopping effects are studied and it is found that in this case, the OQFI captures these topological phase transitions in the limit of low temperature by this formalism in real space.</description>

      <title>Learning the dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems from experimental data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Multimode Displaced Squeezed State in High-Harmonic Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High harmonic generation is a resource of extremely broad frequency combs of ultrashort light pulses. The non-classical nature of this new quantum source has been recently evidenced in semiconductors by showing that high harmonic generation generates multimode squeezed states of light. Applications in quantum information science require the knowledge of the mode structure of the created states, defining how the quantum properties distribute over the spectral modes. To achieve that, an effective Schmidt decomposition of the reduced photonic state is performed on a tripartite harmonic set by simultaneously measuring the second- and third-order intensity correlation function. The Schmidt number is estimated which indicates an almost single-mode structure for each harmonic, a useful resource in quantum technology. By modelling our data with a displaced squeezed state, we retrieve the dependencies of the measured correlation as a function of the high harmonic driving laser intensity. The effective high-harmonic mode distribution is retrieved, and the strength of the contributing squeezing modes is estimated. Additionally, we demonstrate a significant violation of a Cauchy-Schwarz-type inequality for three biseparable partitions by multiple standard deviations. Our results confirm non-classicality of the high-harmonic generation process in semiconductors. The source operates at room temperature with compact lasers, and it could become a useful resource for future applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Computation of Single-Qubit Marginal Measurement Probabilities to Simulate Certain Classes of Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum circuits are essential for verifying and benchmarking quantum algorithms, particularly for large circuits, where computational demands increase exponentially with the number of qubits. Among available methods, the classical simulation of quantum circuits inspired by density functional theory -- the so-called QC-DFT method, shows promise for large circuit simulations as it approximates the quantum circuits using single-qubit reduced density matrices to model multi-qubit systems. However, the QC-DFT method performs very poorly when dealing with multi-qubit gates. In this work, we introduce a novel CNOT ``functional" that leverages neural networks to generate unitary transformations, effectively mitigating the simulation errors observed in the original QC-DFT method. For random circuit simulations, our modified QC-DFT enables efficient computation of single-qubit marginal measurement probabilities, or single-qubit probability (SQPs), and achieves lower SQP errors and higher fidelities than the original QC-DFT method. Despite some limitations in capturing full entanglement and joint probability distributions, we find potential applications of SQPs in simulating Shor's and Grover's algorithms for specific solution classes. These findings advance the capabilities of classical simulations for some quantum problems and provide insights into managing entanglement and gate errors in practical quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the generation of three-photon states with spatial entanglement in cubic nonlinear coupled waveguides using third-order spontaneous parametric down-conversion and quantum walks. Our approach involves independently pumping two coupled waveguides to generate a path-encoded three-photon Greenberger Horne Zeilinger (GHZ) state, which then evolves with complex spatial dynamics governed by coupling coefficients and phase mismatch. By appropriate parameter tuning, we demonstrate the generation of robust heralded Bell states, uniform states, and GHZ-like states at the chip output. This work demonstrates an integrated source of three-photon spatial entanglement on a simple chip, offering additional reconfigurability for advanced multiphoton quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Reuse-Aware Compilation for Zoned Quantum Architectures Based on Neutral Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing architectures based on neutral atoms offer large scales and high-fidelity operations. They can be heterogeneous, with different zones for storage, entangling operations, and readout. Zoned architectures improve computation fidelity by shielding idling qubits in storage from side-effect noise, unlike monolithic architectures where all operations occur in a single zone. However, supporting these flexible architectures with efficient compilation remains challenging. In this paper, we propose ZAC, a scalable compiler for zoned architectures. ZAC minimizes data movement overhead between zones with qubit reuse, i.e., keeping them in the entanglement zone if an immediate entangling operation is pending. Other innovations include novel data placement and instruction scheduling strategies in ZAC, a flexible specification of zoned architectures, and an intermediate representation for zoned architectures, ZAIR. Our evaluation shows that zoned architectures equipped with ZAC achieve a 22x improvement in fidelity compared to monolithic architectures. Moreover, ZAC is shown to have a 10% fidelity gap on average compared to the ideal solution. This significant performance enhancement enables more efficient and reliable quantum circuit execution, enabling advancements in quantum algorithms and applications.

Abstract: Transversal gates on quantum error correction codes have been a promising approach for fault-tolerant quantum computing, but are limited by the Eastin-Knill no-go theorem. Existing solutions like gate teleportation and magic state distillation are resource-intensive. We present a measurement-free code-switching protocol for universal quantum computation, switching between a stabiliser code for transversal Cliffords and a permutation-invariant code for transversal non-Cliffords that are logical $Z$ rotations for any rational multiple of $\pi$. The novel non-Clifford gates enabled by this code-switching protocol enable implementation of a universal gate set more efficient than the Clifford$+T$ gate set. To achieve this, we present a protocol for performing controlled-NOTs between the codes using near-term quantum control operations that employ a catalytic bosonic mode.</description>

      <title>Classifying Logical Gates in Quantum Codes via Cohomology Operations and Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically construct and classify fault-tolerant logical gates implemented by constant-depth circuits for quantum codes using cohomology operations and symmetry. These logical gates are obtained from unitary operators given by symmetry-protected topological responses, which correspond to generators of group cohomology and can be expressed explicitly on the lattice using cohomology operations including cup product, Steenrod squares and new combinations of higher cup products called higher Pontryagin powers. Our study covers most types of the cohomology operations in the literature. This hence gives rise to several new classes of diagonal and non-diagonal logical gates in increasing Clifford hierarchies beyond the usual color code paradigm corresponding to an $n$-fold cup product, including the logical $R_k$ and multi-controlled $C^m R_k$ gates for codes defined in projective spaces. Implementing these gates could make it more efficient to compile specific types of quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm. We further extend the construction to quantum codes with boundaries, which generalizes the folding approach in color codes. We also present a formalism for addressable and parallelizable logical gates in LDPC codes via higher-form symmetries and apply it to construct addressable logical Clifford gates in expander-based codes including the asymptotically good LDPC codes and hypergraph-product codes. As a byproduct, we find new topological responses of finite higher-form symmetries using higher Pontryagin powers.</description>

Abstract: High-precision, robust quantum gates are essential components in quantum computation and information processing. In this study, we present an alternative perspective, exploring the potential applicability of quantum gates that exhibit heightened sensitivity to errors. We investigate such sensitive quantum gates, which, beyond their established use in in vivo NMR spectroscopy, quantum sensing, and polarization optics, may offer significant utility in precision quantum metrology and error characterization. Utilizing the composite pulses technique, we derive three fundamental quantum gates with narrowband and passband characteristics -- the X (NOT) gate, the Hadamard gate, and gates enabling arbitrary rotations. To systematically design these composite pulse sequences, we introduce the SU(2), modified-SU(2), and regularization random search methodologies. These approaches, many of which are novel, demonstrate superior performance compared to established sequences in the literature, including NB1, SK1, and PB1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistics of excitations play an essential role in understanding phases of matter. In this paper, we introduce a universal method for studying the generalized statistics of Abelian particles and extended excitations in lattices of any dimension. We compute the statistics using the Berry phase of a sequence of unitary operators that transports the excitations while canceling local ambiguities at each step. The sequence is derived from locality, using the Smith normal form. We show that the statistics are quantized invariants. Our method unifies the statistics for the braiding and fusion of particles and loops, and leads to the discovery of novel statistics for membrane excitations. The statistics can be interpreted as the quantum anomaly of a generalized global symmetry, which manifests as an obstruction to gauging the symmetry on lattices. Furthermore, we show that non-trivial statistics forbid short-range entangled states, establishing the dynamical consequence of anomalies in microscopic lattice models.</description>

Abstract: Blind quantum computing (BQC) is a promising application of distributed quantum systems, where a client can perform computations on a remote server without revealing any details of the applied circuit. While the most promising realizations of quantum computers are based on various matter qubit platforms, implementing BQC on matter qubits remains an outstanding challenge. Using silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in nanophotonic diamond cavities with an efficient optical interface, we experimentally demonstrate a universal quantum gate set consisting of single- and two-qubit blind gates over a distributed two-node network. Using these ingredients, we perform a distributed algorithm with blind operations across our two-node network, paving the way towards blind quantum computation with matter qubits in distributed, modular architectures.</description>

      <title>Enhancing fidelity in teleportation of a two-qubit state via a quantum communication channel formed by spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg trimer chains due to a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that two independent spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg trimer chains provide an effective platform for the quantum teleportation of any entangled two-qubit state through the quantum communication channel formed by two Heisenberg dimers. The reliability of this quantum channel is assessed by comparing the concurrences, which quantify a strength of the bipartite entanglement of the initial input state and the readout output state. Additionally, we rigorously calculate quantities fidelity and average fidelity to evaluate the quality of the teleportation protocol depending on temperature and magnetic field. It is evidenced that the efficiency of quantum teleportation of arbitrary entangled two-qubit state through this quantum communication channel can be significantly enhanced by moderate magnetic fields. This enhancement can be attributed to the magnetic-field-driven transition from a quantum antiferromagnetic phase to a quantum ferrimagnetic phase, which supports realization of a fully entangled quantum channel suitable for efficient quantum teleportation. The polymeric trimer chains Cu3(P2O6OH)2 are proposed as an experimental resource of this quantum communication channel, which provides an efficient platform for realization of the quantum teleportation up to moderate temperatures 40 K and extremely high magnetic fields 80 T.</description>

      <title>Mott Transition and Volume Law Entanglement with Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between delocalisation and repulsive interactions can cause electronic systems to undergo a Mott transition between a metal and an insulator. Here we use neural network hidden fermion determinantal states (HFDS) to uncover this transition in the disordered, fully-connected Hubbard model. Whilst dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) provides exact solutions to physical observables of the model in the thermodynamic limit, our method allows us to directly access the wave function for finite system sizes well beyond the reach of exact diagonalisation. We demonstrate how HFDS are able to obtain more accurate results in the metallic regime and in the vicinity of the transition than calculations based on a Matrix Product State (MPS) ansatz, for which the volume law of entanglement exhibited by the system is prohibitive. We use the HFDS method to calculate the energy and double occupancy, the quasi-particle weight and the energy gap and, importantly, the amplitudes of the wave function which provide a novel insight into this model. Our work paves the way for the study of strongly correlated electron systems with neural quantum states.</description>

      <title>The Dual Dynamical Foundation of Orthodox Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper combines mathematical, philosophical, and historical analyses in a comprehensive investigation of the dynamical foundations of the formalism of orthodox quantum mechanics. The results obtained include: (i) A deduction of the canonical commutation relations (CCR) from the tenets of Matrix Mechanics; (ii) A discussion of the meaning of Schr\"odinger's first derivation of the wave equation that not only improves on Joas and Lehner's 2009 investigation on the subject but also demonstrates that the CCR follow of necessity from Schr\"odinger's first derivation of the wave equation, thus correcting the common misconception that the CCR were only posited by Schr\"odinger to pursue equivalence with Matrix Mechanics; (iii) A discussion of the mathematical facts and requirements involved in the equivalence of Matrix and Wave Mechanics that improves on F. A. Muller's classical treatment of the subject; (iv) A proof that the equivalence of Matrix and Wave Mechanics is necessitated by the formal requirements of a dual action functional from which both the dynamical postulates of orthodox quantum mechanics, von Neumann's process 1 and process 2, follow; (v) A critical assessment, based on (iii) and (iv), of von Neumann's construction of unified quantum mechanics over Hilbert space. Point (iv) is our main result. It brings to the open the important, but hitherto ignored, fact that orthodox quantum mechanics is no exception to the golden rule of physics that the dynamics of a physical theory must follow from the action functional. If orthodox quantum mechanics, based as it is on the assumption of the equivalence of Matrix and Wave Mechanics, has this "peculiar dual dynamics," as von Neumann called it, this is so because by assuming the equivalence one has been assuming a peculiar dual action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform two-tone spectroscopy on quantum circuits, where high-frequency radiation is generated by a voltage-biased superconductor-normal-superconductor Josephson junction and detection is carried out by an ancillary microwave resonator. We implement this protocol on two different systems, a transmon qubit and a $\lambda/4$ resonator. We demonstrate that this two-tone Josephson spectroscopy operates well into the millimeter-wave band, reaching frequencies larger than 80 GHz, and is well-suited for probing highly coherent quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Role of Quantum Entanglement in Heavy Ion Collisions through Elliptic Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between initial spatial anisotropy and final state momentum anisotropy in heavy ion collisions through the analysis of elliptic flow ($v_2$) as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$). Building upon previous studies on thermalization in heavy ion collisions using transverse momentum distributions, we extend the analysis to the $p_T$ dependence of $v_2$ in Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions. By employing a two-component model to extract the thermal and hard scattering contributions to the elliptic flow, we aim to gain further insights into the role of quantum entanglement in the rapid thermalization and collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).</description>

      <title>A phase-space view of vibrational energies without the Born-Oppenheimer framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that following the standard mantra of quantum chemistry and diagonalizing the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) Hamiltonian $\hat H_{\rm BO}(\bm R)$ is not the optimal means to construct potential energy surfaces. A better approach is to diagonalize a phase-space electronic Hamiltonian, $\hat H_{\rm PS}(\bm R,\bm P)$, which is parameterized by both nuclear position $\bm R$ and nuclear momentum $\bm P$. The foundation of such a non-perturbative phase-space electronic Hamiltonian can be made rigorous using a partial Wigner transform and the method has exactly the same cost as BO for a semiclassical calculation (and only a slight increase in cost for a quantum nuclear calculation). For a three-particle system, with two heavy particles and one light particle, numerical results show that a phase space electronic Hamiltonian produces not only meaningful electronic momenta (which are completely ignored by BO theory) but also far better vibrational energies. As such, for high level results and/or systems with degeneracies and spin degrees of freedom, we anticipate that future electronic structure and quantum chemistry packages will need to take as input not just the positions of the nuclei but also their momenta.</description>

      <title>Two-color Ytterbium MOT in a compact dual-chamber setup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental scheme for producing ultracold Ytterbium atoms in a compact dual-chamber setup. A dispenser-loaded two-dimensional (2D) magneto-optical trap (MOT) using permanent magnets and operating on the broad $^1S_0\to {}^1P_1$ singlet transition delivers over $10^7$ atoms per second through a differential pumping stage into a three-dimensional (3D) MOT. The two-color 3D MOT uses the broad singlet transition to accumulate $\sim\!2\times 10^7$ atoms of $^{174}\text{Yb}$ within $2.5~\text{s}$ and subsequently the narrow $^1S_0\to {}^3P_1$ intercombination line to cool the atomic cloud to below $10~\mathrm{\mu K}$. We report optimized parameters for each stage of the atom collection sequence, achieving high transfer efficiency. We find that shelving into the triplet state during the broad-transition MOT almost doubles the number of trapped atoms.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Excitation by Near-Resonant Electron Transition in $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical considerations are made for the nuclear excitation from the ground state to the 8 eV $^{229m}$Th isomer via near-resonant electron transitions in Sb-like ($q=39+$) thorium ions. The energy of the first excited atomic state ($J=7/2$) in the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion is estimated to be 8.308$\pm$0.011 eV, which is very close to the new reference value for the $^{229m}$Th nuclear isomer energy, 8.356 eV [Zhang et al., Nature 633, 63 (2024)]. Therefore, the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion provides a unique opportunity to study the nuclear excitation by electron transition process under well-defined atomic conditions in the regime of extremely low nuclear excitation energy. Our results indicate that the upper theoretical limit for the $^{229m}$Th isomer excitation rate reaches an enormous value of $1.27\times10^{16}$ s$^{-1}$ at resonance ($\Delta=0$ meV), but drops many orders of magnitude for the value of electronic transition energy within its uncertainty interval. Additionally, it was shown that using an electron beam ion trap, the production of the $^{229}$Th isomer can reach rates ranging from a few to approximately $7\times10^{19}$ $^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Topological zero modes and bounded modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions and dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology describes global quantities invariant under continuous deformations, such as the number of elementary excitations at a phase boundary, without detailing specifics. Conversely, differential laws are needed to understand the physical properties of these excitations, such as their localization and spatial behavior. For instance, topology mandates the existence of solitonic zero-energy modes at the domain walls between topologically inequivalent phases in topological insulators and superconductors. However, the spatial dependence of these modes is only known in the idealized (and unrealistic) case of a sharp domain wall. Here, we find the analytical solutions of these zero-modes by assuming a smooth and exponentially-confined domain wall. This allows us to characterize the zero-modes using a few length scales: the domain wall width, the exponential decay length, and oscillation wavelength. These quantities define distinct regimes: featureless modes with "no hair" at sharp domain walls, and nonfeatureless modes at smooth domain walls, respectively, with "short hair", i.e., featureless at long distances, and "long hair", i.e., nonfeatureless at all length scales. We thus establish a universal relation between the bulk excitation gap, decay rate, and oscillation momentum of the zero modes, which quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities. Additionally, we reveal an unexpected duality between topological zero modes and Shockley modes, unifying the understanding of topologically-protected and nontopological boundary modes. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of edge modes in topological insulators and Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors and on the differences and similarities between topological and nontopological zero modes in these systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Negativity and Replica Symmetry Breaking in General Holographic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement negativity $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ is a useful measure of quantum entanglement in bipartite mixed states. In random tensor networks (RTNs), which are related to fixed-area states, it was found in [arXiv:2101.11029] that the dominant saddles computing the even R\'enyi negativity $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ generically break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. This calls into question previous calculations of holographic negativity using 2D CFT techniques that assumed $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry and proposed that the negativity was related to the entanglement wedge cross section. In this paper, we resolve this issue by showing that in general holographic states, the saddles computing $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ indeed break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. Our argument involves an identity relating $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ to the $k$-th R\'enyi entropy on subregion $AB^*$ in the doubled state $|{\rho_{AB}}\rangle_{AA^*BB^*}$, from which we see that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry is broken down to $\mathbb{Z}_{k}$. For $k&lt;1$, which includes the case of $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ at $k=1/2$, we use a modified cosmic brane proposal to derive a new holographic prescription for $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ and show that it is given by a new saddle with multiple cosmic branes anchored to subregions $A$ and $B$ in the original state. Using our prescription, we reproduce known results for the PSSY model and show that our saddle dominates over previously proposed CFT calculations near $k=1$. Moreover, we argue that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ symmetric configurations previously proposed are not gravitational saddles, unlike our proposal. Finally, we contrast holographic calculations with those arising from RTNs with non-maximally entangled links, demonstrating that the qualitative form of backreaction in such RTNs is different from that in gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Symmetry in RDMFT and pCCD with Complex-Valued Orbitals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) and coupled cluster theory restricted to paired double excitations (pCCD) are emerging as efficient methodologies for accounting for the so-called non-dynamic electronic correlation effects. Up to now, molecular calculations have been performed with real-valued orbitals. However, before extending the applicability of these methodologies to extended systems, where Bloch states are employed, the subtleties of working with complex-valued orbitals and the consequences of imposing time-reversal symmetry must be carefully addressed. In this work, we describe the theoretical and practical implications of adopting time-reversal symmetry in RDMFT and pCCD when allowing for complex-valued orbital coefficients. The theoretical considerations primarily affect the optimization algorithms, while the practical implications raise fundamental questions about the stability of solutions. Specifically, we find that complex solutions lower the energy when non-dynamic electronic correlation effects are pronounced. We present numerical examples to illustrate and discuss these instabilities and possible problems introduced by N-representability violations.</description>

      <title>Truncation-Free Quantum Simulation of Pure-Gauge Compact QED Using Josephson Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is one of the methods that have been proposed and used in practice to bypass computational challenges in the investigation of lattice gauge theories. While most of the proposals rely on truncating the infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces that these models feature, we propose a truncation-free method based on the exact analogy between the local Hilbert space of lattice QED and that of a Josephson junction. We provide several proposals, mostly semi-analog, arranged according to experimental difficulty. Our method can simulate a quasi-2D system of up to $2\times N$ plaquettes, and we present an approximate method that can simulate the fully-2D theory, but is more demanding experimentally and not immediately feasible. This sets the ground for analog quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories with superconducting circuits, in a completely Hilbert space truncation-free procedure, for continuous gauge groups.</description>

One side of the system is prepared in a ferromagnetic ground state and the other side either in equilibrium at higher temperature or out of equilibrium. We focus on the disorder-order interface in which the order parameter attains a nonzero value, different from the ground state one. In that region, correlations follow a universal behaviour. We analytically compute the asymptotic scaling functions of the one- and two-point equal time correlations of the order parameter and provide numerical evidence that also the non-equal time correlations are universal. We analyze the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetries of subsystems and obtain a prediction that is expected to hold also in the von Neumann limit. Finally, we show that the Wigner-Yanase skew information of the order paramerter in subsystems within the interfacial region scales as their length squared. We propose a semiclassical approximation that is particularly effective close to the edge of the lightcone.</description>

      <title>D-commuting SYK model: building quantum chaos from integrable blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new family of quantum chaotic models by combining multiple copies of integrable commuting SYK models. As each copy of the commuting SYK model does not commute with others, this construction breaks the integrability of each commuting SYK and the family of models demonstrates the emergence of quantum chaos. We study the spectrum of this model analytically in the double-scaled limit. As the number of copies tends to infinity, the spectrum becomes compact and equivalent to the regular SYK model. For finite $d$ copies, the spectrum is close to the regular SYK model in UV but has an exponential tail $e^{E/T_c}$ in the IR. We identify the reciprocal of the exponent in the tail as a critical temperature $T_c$, above which the model should be quantum chaotic. $T_c$ monotonically decreases as $d$ increases, which expands the chaotic regime over the non-chaotic regime. We propose the existence of a new phase around $T_c$, and the dynamics should be very different in two phases. We further carry out numeric analysis at finite $d$, which supports our proposal.
  Given any finite dimensional local Hamiltonian, by decomposing it into $d$ groups, in which all terms in one group commute with each other but terms from different groups may not, our analysis can give an estimate of the critical temperature for quantum chaos based on the decomposition. We also comment on the implication of the critical temperature to future quantum simulations of quantum chaos and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Lieb-Robinson bounds for commuting long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works have revealed the intricate effect of long-range interactions on information transport in quantum many-body systems: In $D$ spatial dimensions, interactions decaying as a power-law $r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha &gt; 2D+1$ exhibit a Lieb-Robinson bound (LRB) with a linear light cone and the threshold $2D+1$ is sharp in general. Here, we observe that mutually commuting, long-range interactions satisfy an enhanced LRB of the form $t \, r^{-\alpha}$ for any $\alpha &gt; 0$. In particular, the linear light cone occurs at $\alpha = 1$ in any dimension. Part of our motivation stems from quantum error-correcting codes. As applications, we derive enhanced bounds on ground state correlations and an enhanced local perturbations perturb locally (LPPL) principle for which we adapt a recent subharmonicity argument of Wang-Hazzard. Similar enhancements hold for commuting interactions with stretched exponential decay.</description>

      <title>Operator Valued Flow Equation Approach to the Bosonic Lattice Polaron: Dispersion Renormalization Beyond the Fr\"ohlich Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the ground state properties of a lattice Bose polaron, a quasiparticle arising from the interaction between an impurity confined to an optical lattice and a surrounding homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate hosting phononic modes. We present an extension of Wegner's and Wilson's flow equation approach, the operator valued flow equation approach, which allows us to calculate the renormalized dispersion of the polaron and assess the role of two-phonon scattering processes on the dispersion. The results obtained in this way are compared to a variational mean-field approach. We find that in certain impurity phonon interaction regimes the shape of the dispersion is significantly altered by the inclusion of two-phonon scattering events as opposed to only single-phonon scattering events. Moreover, our results predict that a polaronic bound state may emerge, which is not present in Fr\"ohlich-type models that only consider single-phonon scattering events.</description>

      <title>Topological Aspects of Dirac Fermions in a Kagom\'e Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dirac fermion with linear dispersion in the kagom\'e lattice governs the low-energy physics of different valleys at two inequivalent corners of hexagonal Brillouin zone. The effective Hamiltonian based on the cyclic permutation symmetry of sublattices is constructed to show that the topology of Dirac fermions at these two valleys is characterized by opposite winding numbers. For spinless fermions, the many-particle interactions produce intervalley scattering and drive an intervalley coherent state with spontaneous translation symmetry breaking. The Dirac fermions acquire a mass term from the simultaneous charge and bond orderings. In this phase, the developed bond texture underlies a hollow-star-of-David pattern in a tripled Wigner-Seitz cell of kagom\'e lattice. It is further demonstrated that the twisting of Dirac mass with vorticity leads to zero Dirac modes at the vortex core, which are intimately related to fractionalization. The hollow-star-of-David phase is shown to have a distinct $\mathbb{Z}_6$ Berry phase with its sign-change counterpart of Dirac mass, i.e. the hexagonal phase, shedding light on the topological origin of zero Dirac modes around the vortex core.</description>

      <title>Light-induced magnetic trapping for cold alkali atoms using a combined optical tweezers and nanofibre platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a magnetic trapping method for cold $^{87}$Rb atoms, utilising the light-induced magnetic fields from the evanescent field of an optical nanofibre (ONF) in conjunction with an optical tweezers. We calculate and plot the trapping potentials for both Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes of the optical tweezers, and quasi-linear polarisation of the ONF-guided field. Based on the optical powers in the tweezers beam and the ONF-guided mode, we analyse the trap depths and the distances of the trap minima from the surface of the nanofibre. We show that, by controlling the powers in both of the optical fields, one can vary the trap position over a few hundreds of nanometres, while also influencing the trap depth and trap frequencies. Such control over atom position is essential both for studying distance-dependent effects on atoms trapped near dielectric surfaces, and minimising these effects for quantum technology applications.</description>
