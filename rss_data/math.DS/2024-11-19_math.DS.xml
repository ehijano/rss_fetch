      <title>Contact Geometry of the Restricted Three-Body Problem on $\mathbb{S}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the contact geometry of the connected components of the energy hypersurface, in the symmetric restricted 3-body problem on $\mathbb{S}^2$, for a specific type of motion of the primaries. In particular, we show that these components are of contact type for all energies below the first critical value and slightly above it. We prove that these components, suitably compactified using a Moser-type regularization are contactomorphic to $R\mathbb{P}^3$ with its unique tight contact structure or to the connected sum of two copies of it, depending on the value of the energy. We exploit Taubes' solution of the Weinstein conjecture in dimension three, to infer the existence of periodic orbits in all these cases.</description>

      <title>Invariant Polydiagonal Subspaces of Matrices and Constraint Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a polydiagonal subspace of the Euclidean space, certain components of the vectors are equal (synchrony) or opposite (anti-synchrony). Polydiagonal subspaces invariant under a matrix have many applications in graph theory and dynamical systems, especially coupled cell networks. We describe invariant polydiagonal subspaces in terms of coloring vectors. This approach gives an easy formulation of a constraint satisfaction problem for finding invariant polydiagonal subspaces. Solving the resulting problem with existing state-of-the-art constraint solvers greatly outperforms the currently known algorithms.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Model Identification Using Time Delayed Nonlinear Maps for Systems with Multiple Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a method, along with its algorithmic and computational framework implementation, and performance verification for dynamical system identification. The approach incorporates insights from phase space structures, such as attractors and their basins. By understanding these structures, we have improved training and testing strategies for operator learning and system identification. Our method uses time delay and non-linear maps rather than embeddings, enabling the assessment of algorithmic accuracy and expressibility, particularly in systems exhibiting multiple attractors. This method, along with its associated algorithm and computational framework, offers broad applicability across various scientific and engineering domains, providing a useful tool for data-driven characterization of systems with complex nonlinear system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and canards in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system: a tutorial in fast-slow dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the FitzHugh-Nagumo $(1,1)$--fast-slow system where the vector fields associated to the slow/fast equations come from the reduction of the Hodgin-Huxley model for the nerve impulse. After deriving dynamical properties of the singular and regular cases, we perform a bifurcation analysis and we investigate how the parameters (of the affine slow equation) impact the dynamics of the system. The study of codimension one bifurcations and the numerical locus of canards concludes this case-study. All theoretical results are numerically illustrated.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev's method for exponential maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proved that the Chebyshev's method applied to an entire function $f$ is a rational map if and only if $f(z) = p(z) e^{q(z)}$, for some polynomials $p$ and $q$. These are referred to as rational Chebyshev maps, and their fixed points are discussed in this article. It is seen that $\infty$ is a parabolic fixed point with multiplicity one bigger than the degree of $q$. Considering $q(z)=p(z)^n+c$, where $p$ is a linear polynomial, $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $c$ is a non-zero constant, we show that the Chebyshev's method applied to $pe^q$ is affine conjugate to that applied to $z e^{z^n}$. We denote this by $C_n$. All the finite extraneous fixed points of $C_n$ are shown to be repelling. The Julia set $\mathcal{J}(C_n)$ of $C_n$ is found to be preserved under rotations of order $n$ about the origin. For each $n$, the immediate basin of $0$ is proved to be simply connected. For all $n \leq 16$, we prove that $\mathcal{J}(C_n)$ is connected. The Newton's method applied to $ze^{z^n}$ is found to be conjugate to a polynomial, and its dynamics is also completely determined.</description>

      <title>An exact solution for a non-autonomous delay differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an exact solution for a simple non-autonomous delay differential equation (DDE) over the entire real-time axis, representing it as a sum of Gaussian-shaped dynamics with distinct peak positions. This marks the first explicit solution for non-autonomous DDEs and is a rare example even among general DDEs. The constructed solution offers key physical insights and facilitates the analysis of system properties, such as the envelope profile of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Carleman-Fourier Linearization of Complex Dynamical Systems: Convergence and Explicit Error Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Carleman-Fourier linearization method for nonlinear dynamical systems with periodic vector fields involving multiple fundamental frequencies. By employing Fourier basis functions, the nonlinear dynamical system is transformed into a linear model on an infinite-dimensional space. The proposed approach yields accurate approximations over extended regions around equilibria and for longer time horizons, compared to traditional Carleman linearization with monomials. Additionally, we develop a finite-section approximation for the resulting infinite-dimensional system and provide explicit error bounds that demonstrate exponential convergence to the original system's solution as the truncation length increases. For specific classes of dynamical systems, exponential convergence is achieved across the entire time horizon. The practical significance of these results lies in guiding the selection of suitable truncation lengths for applications such as model predictive control, safety verification through reachability analysis, and efficient quantum computing algorithms. The theoretical findings are validated through illustrative simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate trajectories that require thrust to maintain periodic structure in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). We produce bounds in position and velocity space for the energy-constrained reachable set of initial conditions. Our trajectories are energy-optimal and analyzed via linear analysis. We provide validation for our technique and analyze the cost of deviating in various directions to the reference. For our given reference, we find that it is relatively expensive to decrease perilune distance for orbits in the Earth-Moon system.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of flow map parameterization methods in Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain an a-posteriori theorem for the existence of partly hyperbolic invariant tori in analytic Hamiltonian systems: autonomous, periodic, and quasi-periodic. The method of proof is based on the convergence of a KAM iterative scheme to solve the invariance equations of tori and their invariant bundles under the framework of the parameterization method. Staring from approximate parameterizations, analytic in a complex strip of the real torus, we derive conditions for existence of analytic parameterizations of tori and bundles in a smaller strip. The proof relies on the careful treatment of the analyticity loss with each iterative step and on the control of geometric properties of symplectic flavour.</description>

      <title>Partially Hyperbolic Dynamics with Quasi-isometric Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the class of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms on a closed 3-manifold with quasi-isometric center. Under the non-wandering condition, we prove that the diffeomorphisms are accessible if there is no $su$-torus. As a consequence, volume-preserving diffeomorphisms in this context are ergodic in the absence of $su$-tori, thereby confirming the Hertz-Hertz-Ures Ergodicity Conjecture for this class.
  We show the existence of transitive Anosov flows on a closed 3-manifold admitting a non-wandering partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism with quasi-isometric center and fundamental group of exponential growth. Furthermore, we provide a complete classification of these diffeomorphisms, showing they fall into two categories: skew products and discretized Anosov flows.</description>

      <title>Computer-aided analysis of high-dimensional Glass networks: periodicity, chaos, and bifurcations in a ring circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glass networks model systems of variables that interact via sharp switching. A body of theory has been developed over several decades that, in principle, allows rigorous proof of dynamical properties in high dimensions that is not normally feasible in nonlinear dynamical systems. Previous work has, however, used examples of dimension no higher than 6 to illustrate the methods. Here we show that the same tools can be applied in dimensions at least as high as 20. An important application of Glass networks is to a recently-proposed design of a True Random Number Generator that is based on an intrinsically chaotic electronic circuit. In order for analysis to be meaningful for the application, the dimension must be at least 20. Bifurcation diagrams show what appear to be periodic and chaotic bands. Here we demonstrate that the analytic tools for Glass networks can be used to rigorously show where periodic orbits are lost, and the types of bifurcations that occur there. The main tools are linear algebra and the stability theory of Poincar\'e maps. All main steps can be automated, and we provide computer code. The methods reviewed here have the potential for many other applications involving sharply switching interactions, such as artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>The role of inducible defence in ecological models: Effects of nonlocal intraspecific competitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phenotypic plasticity is a key factor in driving the evolution of species in the predator-prey interaction. The natural environment is replete with phenotypic plasticity, which is the source of inducible defences against predators, including concealment, cave-dwelling, mimicry, evasion, and revenge. In this work, a predator-prey model is proposed where the prey species shows inducible defence against their predators. The dynamics produce a wide range of non-trivial and impactful results, including the stabilizing effect of the defence mechanism. The model is also analyzed in the presence of spatio-temporal diffusion in a bounded domain. It is found in the numerical simulation that the Turing domain shrinks with the increase of defence level. The work is extended further by introducing a nonlocal term in the intra-specific competition of the prey species. The Turing instability condition has been studied for the local model around the coexisting steady state, followed by the Turing and non-Turing patterns in the presence of the nonlocal interaction term. The work reveals how an increase in inducible defence reduces the Turing domain in the local interaction model but expands it when the range of nonlocal interactions is extended, suggesting a higher likelihood of species colonization.</description>

      <title>Attraction-Repulsion Swarming: A Generalized Framework of t-SNE via Force Normalization and Tunable Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method for data visualization based on attraction-repulsion swarming (ARS) dynamics, which we call ARS visualization. ARS is a generalized framework that is based on viewing the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization technique as a swarm of interacting agents driven by attraction and repulsion. Motivated by recent developments in swarming, we modify the t-SNE dynamics to include a normalization by the \emph{total influence}, which results in better posed dynamics in which we can use a data size independent time step (of $h=1$) and a simple iteration, without the need for the array of optimization tricks employed in t-SNE. ARS also includes the ability to separately tune the attraction and repulsion kernels, which gives the user control over the tightness within clusters and the spacing between them in the visualization.
  In contrast with t-SNE, our proposed ARS data visualization method is not gradient descent on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and can be viewed solely as an interacting particle system driven by attraction and repulsion forces. We provide theoretical results illustrating how the choice of interaction kernel affects the dynamics, and experimental results to validate our method and compare to t-SNE on the MNIST and Cifar-10 data sets.</description>

      <title>Approximate Controllability of Fractional Differential Systems with Nonlocal Conditions of Order $q\in ]1,2[$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript is concerned with the approximate controllability of fractional nonlinear differential equations with nonlocal conditions of order $1&lt;q&lt;2$ in Banach spaces. As far as we know, few articles have investigated this issue. The idea is to see under which sufficient conditions the proposed control problem is approximately controllable. The discussion is based on the theory of resolvent operator, fractional calculus techniques and Krasnoselskii's fixed point theorem under the assumption that the associated linear system is approximately controllable. The obtained results improve some existing analogous ones on this topic. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate the applications of the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Small-signal stability of power systems with voltage droop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The small-signal stability of power grids is a well-studied topic. In this work, we give new sufficient conditions for highly heterogeneous mixes of grid-forming inverters (and other machines) that implement a $V$-$q$ droop to stabilize viable operating states of lossless grids. Assuming the edges are not overloaded, and static voltage limits are satisfied, our conditions are fully local: They can be evaluated bus by bus without information on the rest of the grid. Other than the presence of $V$-$q$ droop, we make no model assumptions. In particular, we do not assume a specific control strategy of the inverters, the number, or type, of their internal degrees of freedom, or that the control is homogeneous throughout the system.
  We achieve this by recasting the dynamics of the nodes as a complex frequency reaction to an active and reactive power signal coming from the grid. By working directly in terms of the node's linearized complex frequency response, the transfer functions capturing the linear response do not depend on arbitrary phases. Further, they are easily interpretable as the frequency/amplitude reaction to active/reactive power imbalance, and correspond directly to the typical design considerations for grid-forming control. By exploiting the presence of the $V$-$q$ droop, we can ensure that the grid's active/reactive power response to a frequency/amplitude change is semi-sectorial. This allows us to use an adapted small phase theorem to obtain local sufficient stability conditions for edges and nodes, which also yields novel results for established control designs.</description>

      <title>First Integrals of Homogeneous Vector Fields and the Eigenmirror Problem of Geometric Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenmirror problem asks: ``When does the reflection of a surface in a curved mirror appear undistorted to an observer?'' We call such a surface an {\em eigensurface} and the corresponding mirror an {\em eigenmirror}. The data for an eigenmirror problem consists of a homogeneous transformation ${\bf H}:\mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ that encodes what it means for two observers to see a surface in the ``same way.''
  A solution to this problem is a differentiable 2-manifold that (1) satisfies a first-order partial differential equation called the {\bf anti-eikonal equation}, and (2) satisfies certain side inequalities that ensure that a ray reflecting off the mirror behaves in a physically meaningful way. Although these side inequalities initially seem like an ad hoc global restriction, we show that under reasonable conditions, an integral curve of the characteristic flow of the anti-eikonal equation may not intersect the boundary of an eigenmirror. Thus, in those cases, the eigenmirror is invariant under the characteristic flow. We give several examples exhibiting our results.</description>

Abstract: We study a number of questions related to the $C^0$-topology of contactomorphisms and contact homeomorphisms. In particular, we show a connection between Rokhlin property of contact homeomorphisms and contact non-squeezing, we define a new conjugation-invariant norm on contactomorphisms and explore its relation to the contact fragmentation norm and we introduce a measure of the size of conjugacy classes which is related to weak conjugacy equivalence. We also show that Sandon's spectral norm is $C^0$-locally bounded and extend its definition to contact homeomorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the endomorphism ring $End(G_A)$ of a subgroup $G_A$ of $\mathbb{Q}^n$ defined by a non-singular $n\times n$-matrix $A$ with integer entries. In the case when the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is irreducible and an extra assumption holds if $n$ is not prime, we show that $End(G_A)$ is commutative and can be identified with a subring of the number field generated by an eigenvalue of $A$. The obtained results can be applied to studying endomorphisms of associated toroidal solenoids and $\mathbb{Z}^n$-odometers. In particular, we build a connection between toroidal solenoids and $S$-integer dynamical systems, provide a formula for the number of periodic points of a toroidal solenoid endomorphism, and show that the linear representation group of a $\mathbb{Z}^n$-odometer is computable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of cyclicity and hypercyclicity in self-similar groups as an analogue of cyclic and hypercyclic vectors for an operator on a Banach space. We derive a sufficient condition for cyclicity of non-finitary automorphisms in contracting discrete automata groups. In the profinite setting we prove that fractal profinite groups may be regarded as measure-preserving dynamical systems and derive a sufficient condition for the ergodicity and the mixing properties of these dynamical systems. Furthermore, we show that a Haar-random element in a super strongly fractal profinite group is hypercyclic almost surely as an application of Birkhoff's ergodic theorem for free semigroup actions.</description>

      <title>Evolving the Euler rotation axis as a dynamical system, using the Euler vector and generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential equations are derived which show how generalized Euler vector representations of the Euler rotation axis and angle for a rigid body evolve in time; the Euler vector is also known as a rotation vector or axis-angle vector. The solutions can exhibit interesting rotational features in this non-abstract, visualizable setting, including spinor-like behavior and quasiperiodicity. The equations are well-behaved at zero, reducing to the simple infinitesimal case there. One of them is equivalent to a known quaternion differential equation. The simple geometric derivation does not depend on Euler's rotation theorem, and yields a proof of Euler's theorem using only infinitesimal motions. With mild regularity conditions on the angular velocity function, there is a continuous evolution of the normalized axis and angle for all time. Dynamical systems properties are discussed, and numerical solutions are used to investigate them when the angular velocity is itself rotating, and the Euler vector trajectory traces out a torus-like shape, with a strobe plot that densely fills in a closed curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\{a_t: t \in \mathbb{R}\}&lt; SL_{d}(\mathbb{R})$ be a diagonalizable subgroup whose expanding horospherical subgroup $U &lt; SL_{d}(\mathbb{R})$ is abelian. By the Birkhoff ergodic theorem, for any $x \in SL_{d}(\mathbb{R})/SL_{d}(\mathbb{Z})$ and for almost every point $u \in U$ the point $ux$ is Birkhoff generic for $a_t$ when $t \to \infty$. We prove that the same is true when $U$ is replaced by any non-degenerate analytic curve in $U$. This Birkhoff genericity result has various applications in Diophantine approximation. For instance, we obtain density estimates for Dirichlet improvability along typical points on a curve in Euclidean space. Other applications address approximations by algebraic numbers and best approximations (in the sense of Lagarias).</description>

Abstract: We consider a dynamical system generated by an analytic perturbation $A_\varepsilon$ of an analytic Anosov diffeomorphism $A_0$ of $\TTT^d$. We show that, if $A_0$ admit a splitting of $\mathrm T\mathds T^d$ in $k$ invariant subspaces, there exists a {\it partial conjugation} $\mathcal H_\e$ of $dA_\e$ and $dA_0$ that preserves the splitting and is analytic in $\e$. This show that the splitting can be extended to $A_\e$. As an application of this results, we obtain that the Lyapunov exponents, if non degenerate, are analytic functions of the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Identifying Markov chain models from time-to-event data: an algebraic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many biological and medical questions can be modeled using time-to-event data in finite-state Markov chains, with the phase-type distribution describing intervals between events. We solve the inverse problem: given a phase-type distribution, can we identify the transition rate parameters of the underlying Markov chain? For a specific class of solvable Markov models, we show this problem has a unique solution up to finite symmetry transformations, and we outline a recursive method for computing symbolic solutions for these models across any number of states. Using the Thomas decomposition technique from computer algebra, we further provide symbolic solutions for any model. Interestingly, different models with the same state count but distinct transition graphs can yield identical phase-type distributions. To distinguish among these, we propose additional properties beyond just the time to the next event. We demonstrate the method's applicability by inferring transcriptional regulation models from single-cell transcription imaging data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05181v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling collective motion in multi-agent systems has gained significant attention. Of particular interest are sufficient conditions for flocking dynamics. We present a generalization of the multi-agent model of Olfati--Saber with nonlinear navigational feedback forces. Unlike the original model, ours is not generally dissipative and lacks an obvious Lyapunov function. We address this by proposing a method to prove the existence of an attractor without relying on LaSalle's principle. Other contributions are as follows. We prove that, under mild conditions, agents' velocities approach the center of mass velocity exponentially, with the distance between the center of mass and the virtual leader being bounded. In the dissipative case, we show existence of a broad class of nonlinear control forces for which the attractor does not contain periodic trajectories, which cannot be ruled out by LaSalle's principle. Finally, we conduct a computational investigation of the problem of reducing propulsion energy consumption by selecting appropriate navigational feedback forces.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles I: self-similarity, aperiodicity and minimality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every positive integer $n$, we introduce a set $\mathcal{T}_n$ made of $(n+3)^2$ Wang tiles (unit squares with labeled edges). We represent a tiling by translates of these tiles as a configuration $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. A configuration is valid if the common edge of adjacent tiles has the same label. For every $n\geq1$, we show that the Wang shift $\Omega_n$, defined as the set of valid configurations over the tiles $\mathcal{T}_n$, is self-similar, aperiodic and minimal for the shift action. We say that $\{\Omega_n\}_{n\geq1}$ is a family of metallic mean Wang shifts, since the inflation factor of the self-similarity of $\Omega_n$ is the positive root of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$. This root is sometimes called the $n$-th metallic mean, and in particular, the golden mean when $n=1$, and the silver mean when $n=2$. When $n=1$, the set of Wang tiles $\mathcal{T}_1$ is equivalent to the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles.</description>

We also show the existence of a trapezoidal piecewise isometry for which the dynamics on the top and bottom edges are distinct 2-interval exchange transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the statistics of the continued fraction expansion of a randomly chosen rational in the unit interval, with a fixed large denominator $q$, approaches the Gauss-Kuzmin statistics with polynomial rate in $q$. This improves on previous results giving the convergence without rate. As an application of this effective rate of convergence, we show that the statistics of a randomly chosen rational in the unit interval, with a fixed large denominator $q$ and prime numerator, also approaches the Gauss-Kuzmin statistics. Our results are obtained as applications of improved non-escape of mass and equidistribution statements for the geodesic flow on the space $SL_2(\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

We show that the resonant states are closely related to special systems of measures supported on the stable manifolds introduced by Climenhaga. As a result, we relate the presence of the resonances on the critical axis to mixing properties of the flow with respect to certain equilibrium measures and show that these equilibrium measures can be reconstructed from the spectral theory of the Anosov flow.</description>

Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to investigate ergodicity of white-forced Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE) on the whole line. Under the assumption that sufficiently many directions of the phase space are stochastically forced, we can prove that the dynamics is attractive toward a unique invariant probability measure with polynomial rate of any power. In order to prove this, we further develop coupling method and establish a sufficiently general criterion for polynomial mixing. The proof of polynomial mixing for KSE is obtained by the combination of the coupling criterion and the Foia\c{s}-Prodi estimate of KSE on the whole line.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel concept of magic billiards, which can be seen as an umbrella, unifying several well-known generalisations of mathematical billiards. We analyse properties of magic billiards in the case of elliptical boundaries. We provide explicit conditions for periodicity in algebro-geometric, analytic, and polynomial forms. A topological description of those billiards is given using Fomenko graphs.</description>

      <title>Derived from expanding endomorphism on $\mathbb{T}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume that $f$ is a smooth special absolutely partial hyperbolic endomorphism on the 2-torus which is homotopic to an expanding linear endomorphism $A$ with irrational real eigenvalues $|\lambda^u_A|&gt;|\lambda^c_A|&gt;1$. When $f$ expands area, the semi-conjugacy $h$ between $f$ and $A$ is the conjugacy; in addition, the conjugacy is smooth if the center bundle of $f$ is $C^1$.</description>

      <title>Marked Length Spectrum Rigidity for Surface Amalgams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that simple, thick negatively curved two-dimensional P-manifolds, a large class of surface amalgams, are marked length spectrum rigid. That is, if two piecewise negatively curved Riemannian metrics (satisfying certain smoothness conditions) on a simple, thick two-dimensional P-manifold assign the same lengths to all closed geodesics, then they differ by an isometry up to isotopy. Our main theorem is a natural generalization of Croke and Otal's celebrated results about marked length spectrum rigidity of negatively curved surfaces.</description>

      <title>Multicellular simulations with shape and volume constraints using optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many living and physical systems such as cell aggregates, tissues or bacterial colonies behave as unconventional systems of particles that are strongly constrained by volume exclusion and shape interactions. Understanding how these constraints lead to macroscopic self-organized structures is a fundamental question in e.g. developmental biology. To this end, various types of computational models have been developed. Here, we introduce a new framework based on optimal transport theory to model particle systems with arbitrary dynamical shapes and deformability properties. Our method builds upon the pioneering work of Brenier on incompressible fluids and its recent applications to materials science. It lets us specify the shapes and volumes of individual cells and supports a wide range of interaction mechanisms, while automatically taking care of the volume exclusion constraint at an affordable numerical cost. We showcase the versatility of this approach by reproducing several classical systems in computational biology.

      <title>Sub-Riemannian geodesics on the Heisenberg 3D nil-manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the projection of the left-invariant sub-Riemannian structure on the 3D Heisenberg group $G$ to the Heisenberg 3D nil-manifold $M$ -- the compact homogeneous space of $G$ by the discrete Heisenberg group.
  First we describe dynamical properties of the geodesic flow for $M$: periodic and dense orbits, and a dynamical characterization of the normal Hamiltonian flow of Pontryagin maximum principle. Then we obtain sharp twoside bounds of sub-Riemannian balls and distance in $G$, and on this basis we estimate the cut time for sub-Riemannian geodesics in $M$.</description>

      <title>Speed and shape of population fronts with density-dependent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate travelling wave solutions in reaction-diffusion models of animal range expansion in the case that population diffusion is density-dependent. We find that the speed of the selected wave depends critically on the strength of diffusion at low density. For sufficiently large low-density diffusion, the wave propagates at a speed predicted by a simple linear analysis. For small or zero low-density diffusion, the linear analysis is not sufficient, but a variational approach yields exact or approximate expressions for the speed and shape of population fronts.</description>

      <title>Infinite stationary measures of co-compact group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated group, and let $\mu$ be a nondegenerate, finitely supported probability measure on $\Gamma$. We show that every co-compact $\Gamma$ action on a locally compact Hausdorff space admits a nonzero $\mu$-stationary Radon measure. The main ingredient of the proof is a stationary analogue of Tarski's theorem: we show that for every nonempty subset $A \subseteq \Gamma$ there is a $\mu$-stationary, finitely additive measure on $\Gamma$ that assigns unit mass to $A$.</description>
