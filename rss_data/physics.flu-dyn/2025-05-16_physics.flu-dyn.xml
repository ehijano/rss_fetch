      <title>Atwood effects on nonlocality of the scalar transport closure in three-dimensional Rayleigh-Taylor mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of nonlocality is assessed in modeling mean scalar transport for three-dimensional variable density Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) mixing. Building on the two-dimensional incompressible work of Lavacot et al. (2024, JFM), the present work extends the Macroscopic Forcing Method (MFM) to variable density problems in three-dimensional space to measure moments of the generalized eddy diffusivity kernel in RT mixing for increasing Atwood numbers (A = 0.05, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8). It is found that as A increases: 1) the eddy diffusivity moments become asymmetric, and 2) the higher-order eddy diffusivity moments become larger relative to the leading-order diffusivity, indicating that nonlocality becomes more important at higher A. There is a particularly strong temporal nonlocality at higher A, suggesting stronger history effects. The implications of these findings for closure modeling for finite-Atwood RT are discussed.</description>

      <title>Impulse-driven transport of liquid metal from z-pinch electrodes and implications for fusion fuel contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Liquid Electrode eXperiment is a surrogate environment to study the dynamic behavior of liquid metal plasma facing components relevant to a z-pinch device. Current pulses with amplitudes between 50 and 200 kA produce magnetic fields up to 30 T at the surface of a wire 1.5 to 2.5 mm in radius, mounted with one end submerged in a pool of liquid metal. The resulting forces generate a fast-moving annular jet surrounding the wire, preceded in some cases by small ejected droplets of varying sizes. High-speed videography records the motion of the liquid metal free surface upon exposure to magnetic pressures between 0.5 and 10 MPa. The vertical velocity of the resulting jets ranged from 0.6 to 5.3 m/s with consistent radial expansion. The velocities of the ejecta ranged from -3.1 to +18.9 m/s in the vertical direction and from -14.3 to +6.3 m/s in the radial direction. We investigate the likelihood and severity of z-pinch core contamination for repetitively-pulsed plasmas in the context of the observed droplets for liquid metal plasma facing component candidate materials: lithium, gallium, silver, tin, lead, FLiBe, and FLiNaK.</description>

      <title>On the elliptic representation of near-wall compressibility correction to k-$\omega$ turbulence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In supersonic and hypersonic flows, the near-wall density variation due to wall cooling poses a challenge for accurately predicting the near-wall velocity and temperature profiles using classical eddy viscosity turbulence models. Compressible turbulent boundary layers are known to follow the universal wall law via semi-local transformation. However, semi-local transformations are not easily incorporated into turbulence models, due to their non-local nature. The current paper proposes a method to integrate near-wall density variation effects using an elliptic equation, which can be used to correct a turbulence model, e.g., the k-$\omega$ two-equation model. The formulation of the elliptic equation only involves dimensional analysis and the proper selection of the local length scale. The variable from the elliptic equation is then incorporated into the $\omega$ equation, which results in a three-equation elliptic k-$\omega$ model. The newly introduced variation is used to modify the slope of the velocity profile starting from the viscous layer to above. Then it achieves a very decent correction of the velocity profile in compressible turbulent channel flows. The proposed elliptic k-$\omega$ model can also improve the velocity predictions in strongly wall-cooled hypersonic turbulent boundary layers.</description>

      <title>The three effects of the pressure force on turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to isolate the three effects of the pressure force on the inner and outer layers: the local direct impact (characterized by the pressure gradient (PG) parameter, $\beta$), the local disequilibrating effect (represented here by the normalized streamwise derivative $d\beta/dX$), and the upstream cumulative effect, while accounting for the inevitable Reynolds number influence. To achieve this objective, we draw on several non-equilibrium and near-equilibrium databases from the literature, and employ a methodology based on the selection of PG parameters that capture the local direct impact and the local disequilibration effect of the PG. The pressure force impact on the inner and outer regions is represented by two parameters: the friction-viscous PG parameter, $\beta_i$, and the PG parameter based on Zagarola-Smits velocity, $\beta_{ZS}$. In the non-equilibrium flow cases, both $\beta_i$ and $\beta_{ZS}$ exhibit similar distributions, initially increasing and then decreasing. However, the rate of change of these parameters along the streamwise direction varies among the flows, indicating differing levels of pressure force disequilibration. In the outer layer, it is found that both the local and cumulative disequilibrating effects modify the mean velocity and Reynolds stress profiles at identical $\beta_{ZS}$ values. In the inner layer, which responds much faster to changes in pressure force, the local disequilibrating effect still modifies the mean velocity profile in the viscous sublayer. Notably, when the mean velocity defect is significant, the behavior of u-structures in the inner layer appears to be governed by how outer turbulence responds to pressure force effects. In contrast, the size of uv-structures in the inner layer scales with the mixed pressure-friction length. Unlike inner u-structures, they are independent of large-scale outer structures and flow history.</description>

      <title>The role of porosity in the transition to inertial regime in porous media flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the fundamental physical mechanism of the transition from Darcy to inertial (Darcy-Forchheimer) regime in the flow through porous media from the perspective of the vortex formation and growth. We focus on investigating the influence of porosity on the tortuosity--Reynolds number relation for periodic stochastic and simple cubic systems by numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations in the pore-scale. We observe that the tortuosity defined by integrals over the fluid volume exhibits similar behavior in both types of systems. We also show that the tortuosity based on averaging of the streamlines length diverges from the volume-integrated one when the inertia onset takes place. We show that the discrepancy between those two tortuosities at increasing Reynolds number carries information about the geometrical confinement within the porous sample and is largely governed by the growth of the volumes occupied by vortices and their kinetic energy. Our results shed new light on the fundamental mechanisms of the transition between Darcy and the inertial regime and bring a better understanding of the role of the porous media geometry in this transition.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Pure and Blended Fuel Sonic Jets in a Mach 2 Crossflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The injection of transverse jets into supersonic compressible crossflows represents a fundamental configuration relevant to a spectrum of high-speed applications. The intricate interactions arising between the crossflow and the injected jet induce complex flow phenomena, including shock waves and vortical structures, the characteristics of which are significantly contingent upon the thermophysical properties of the injected fuel. While prior investigations have addressed the influence of various fuels, a knowledge gap persists concerning the behaviour of alternative and synthetic multicomponent fuels within this flow regime. The present work employs high-fidelity large-eddy simulations (LES) to examine the impact of ten distinct fuels-hydrogen, methane, ethylene, ammonia, syngas mixture, and a synthetic blend, alongside several NH3/H2/N2 mixtures-on the macroscopic flow structures and mixing attributes within a transverse sonic jet immersed in a Mach 2 crossflow. By maintaining a uniform momentum flux ratio across the investigated cases, the study aims to isolate the influence of the unique thermophysical properties of each fuel on the windward mixing layer, a region critically important for initial entrainment processes. The investigation quantifies the effects of molecular weight, heat capacity ratio, and density on the development and evolution of coherent structures through a detailed examination of instantaneous flow fields, vortex dynamics, scalar distributions, and turbulence statistics. The results are expected to provide pertinent insights into fuel-dependent mixing mechanisms in supersonic flows, thereby contributing to the advancement of more efficient and versatile propulsion systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling droplet-particle interactions on solid surfaces by coupling the lattice Boltzmann and discrete element methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical method for investigating interfacial flows coupled with frictional solid particles. Our method combines the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to model the dynamics of a two-component fluid and the discrete element method (DEM) to model contact forces (normal reaction, sliding friction, rolling friction) between solid particles and between solid particles and flat solid surfaces. To couple the fluid and particle dynamics, we (1) use the momentum exchange method to transfer hydrodynamic forces between the fluids and particles, (2) account for different particle wettability using a geometric boundary condition, and (3) explicitly account for capillary forces between particles and liquid-fluid interfaces using a 3D capillary force model. We benchmark the contact forces by investigating the dynamics of a particle bouncing off a solid surface and rolling down an inclined plane. To benchmark the hydrodynamic and capillary forces, we investigate the Segr\`e-Silberberg effect and measure the force required to detach a particle from a liquid-fluid interface, respectively. Motivated by the self-cleaning properties of the lotus leaf, we apply our method to investigate how drops remove contaminant particles from surfaces and quantify the forces acting on particles during removal. Our method makes it possible to investigate the influence of various parameters that are often difficult to tune independently in experiments, including contact angles, surface tension, viscosity, and coefficient of friction between the surface and particles. Our results highlight that friction plays a crucial role when drops remove particles from surfaces.</description>

      <title>Extension of the consistent $\delta^{+}$-SPH model for multiphase flows considering the compressibility of different phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hydrodynamic problems involving wave impact on structures, air compressibility is crucial for accurate pressure prediction when an air bubble is entrapped. In this work, the consistent $\delta^{+}$-SPH model, originally developed for single-phase scenarios, is extended to multiphase contexts. Although the consistent $\delta^{+}$-SPH model shows good performance for single phase and viscous flow simulations, extending it to multiphase scenarios presents challenges, such as proper implementation of particle shifting for multiphase interfaces. Therefore, within the framework of the consistent $\delta^{+}$-SPH, we introduce the following enhancements: firstly, new strategy for handling $\delta \boldmath{u}$-terms given by the particle shifting technique at multiphase interfaces are proposed to maintain stability and conservation. Secondly, for modeling of incompressible phases, like water, an acoustic damper term is introduced to alleviate acoustic waves resulting from the weakly-compressible assumption, which is expected to achieve smooth pressure field comparable to truly-incompressible hypothesis, thereby reducing the nonphysical pressure wave during the violent impact state; for modeling compressible phases like air, a physical sound speed is adopted in the equation of state to accurately model real gas phase compressibility. To test and validate the present multiphase SPH model, simulations were conducted for six scenarios. In particular, except for sloshing with two-layer liquids, the other scenarios fully consider air pressure oscillations when air is entrapped, compressed, or expanded by surrounding flows. The results demonstrate significant advantages of the present SPH model in simulating multiphase problems involving strong liquid impact and different phase compressibility.</description>

      <title>Spatial Features of Reynolds-Stress Carrying Structures in Turbulent Boundary Layers with Pressure Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Reynolds-shear-stress carrying structures in the outer layer of non-equilibrium pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers using four direct numerical simulation databases, two cases of non-equilibrium pressure-gradient boundary layers and two of homogeneous shear turbulence. We examine and compare the spatial organization and shapes of the Reynolds-shear-stress structures, specifically sweeps and ejections, across all cases. The analysis includes five streamwise locations in the boundary layers, varying in pressure-gradient sign, intensity, and upstream history. For the boundary layers, two types of three-dimensional velocity fields are considered: fully spatial fields and spatio-temporal fields using Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis. Comparisons of the results indicate that the statistics of sweep and ejection shapes are sensitive to the choice of convection velocity in Taylor's hypothesis. The sweep and ejection shapes are consistent across all flows when their sizes range from 1 to 10 Corrsin length scales, suggesting that mean shear plays a similar role in all cases, driving the formation of Reynolds-shear-stress carrying structures and contributing to turbulence production. Sweeps and ejections of different types form side-by-side pairs, while structures of the same type align in an upstream-downstream configuration. This behavior persists regardless of pressure gradient variations or upstream history, emphasizing the dominant influence of local mean shear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the nonlinear effects of gravity-driven fluid flow through a two-dimensional, low-porosity, packed bed of stubby stone grains. We focused on preferential channel formation, tortuosity, spatial distribution of kinetic energy, and vortex formation. We show that nonlinear effects dominate at relatively high Reynolds numbers, even though the deviation from Darcy's law is not visible in friction factor measurements. We further notice an increased flow asymmetry of the flow field revealed by vorticity analysis and surprising correlation between tortuosity and apparent permeability in the inertial flow regime.</description>

      <title>Oil slicks dynamics in semi-confined geometries in the presence of water waves: analytical and numerical insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have shown previously that the dynamics of isolated oil slicks on the water's surface after spills is significantly influenced by surface-wave motion practically at the onset of the spreading process. In this work, we draw our attention to another practical scenario of the oil slick's behaviour in semi-confined geometries under the action of surface waves and in the presence of oil leakage source. We hypothesize that the geometric constraints should qualitatively change the oil layer response to the wave motion leading to localization of oil spill domains even at modest levels of the surface-wave perturbations. Several realistic cases were rigorously explored, with special attention paid to the interplay, the combined effect of the two factors, oil influx and wave motion. It was demonstrated quantitatively how the spreading process can be either facilitated or suppressed leading to potential confinement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pattern formation in active biological matter typically arises from the feedback between chemical concentration fields and mechanical stresses. The actomyosin cortex of cells is an archetypal example of an active thin film that displays such patterns. Here, we show how pulsatory patterns emerge in a minimal model of the actomyosin cortex with a single stress-regulating chemical species that exchanges material with the cytoplasm via a linear turnover reaction. Deriving a low-dimensional amplitude-phase model, valid for a one-dimensional periodic domain and a spherical surface, we show that nonlinear waves arise from a secondary parity-breaking bifurcation that originates from the nonreciprocal interaction between spatial modes of the concentration field. Numerical analysis confirms these analytical predictions, and also reveals analogous pulsatory patterns on impermeable domains. Our study provides a generic route to the emergence of nonreciprocity-driven pulsatory patterns that can be controlled by both the strength of activity and the turnover rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the efficiency and ease-of-use of the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm and Sparse Physics-Informed Discovery of Empirical Relations (SPIDER) framework in recovering the relevant governing equations and boundary conditions from data generated by direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent convective flows. In the former case, a weak-form implementation pySINDy is used. Time-dependent data for two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) DNS simulation of Rayleigh-Benard convection and convective plane Couette flow is generated using the Dedalus PDE framework for spectrally solving differential equations. Using pySINDy we are able to recover the governing equations of 2D models of Rayleigh-Benard convection at Rayleigh numbers, R, from laminar, through transitional to moderately turbulent flow conditions, albeit with increasing difficulty with larger Rayleigh number, especially in recovery of the diffusive terms (with coefficient magnitude proportional to 1/R^0.5). SPIDER requires a much smaller library of terms and we are able to recover more easily the governing equations for a wider range of R in 2D and 3D convection and plane flow models and go on to recover constraints (the incompressibility condition) and boundary conditions, demonstrating the benefits and capabilities of SPIDER to go beyond pySINDy for these fluid problems governed by second-order PDEs. [We] demonstrat[e] the potential of machine-learning methods to validate numerical solvers and solutions for such flow problems. We also find that properties of the flow, specifically the correlation time and spatial scales, should inform the initial selection of spatiotemporal subdomain sizes [abbreviated]</description>

      <title>Spectral quantum algorithm for passive scalar transport in shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mixing of scalar substances in fluid flows by stirring and diffusion is ubiquitous in natural flows, chemical engineering, and microfluidic drug delivery. Here, we present a spectral quantum algorithm for scalar mixing by solving the advection-diffusion equation in a quantum computational fluid dynamics framework. We derive exact gate decompositions of the advection and diffusion operators in spectral space. For all but the simplest one-dimensional flows, these operators do not commute. Therefore, we use operator splitting and construct quantum circuits capable of simulating arbitrary polynomial velocity profiles, such as the Blasius profile of a laminar boundary layer. Periodic, Neumann, and Dirichlet boundary conditions can be imposed with the appropriate quantum spectral transform plus additional constraints on the Fourier expansion. We evaluate our approach in statevector simulations of a Couette flow, plane Poiseuille flow, and a polynomial Blasius profile approximation to demonstrate its potential and versatility for scalar mixing in shear flows. The number of gates grows with, at most, the cubed logarithm of the number of grid points. This evaluation shows that spectral accuracy allows comparably large time steps even though the operator splitting limits the temporal order.</description>

      <title>Inferring activity from the flow field around active colloidal particles using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10270</link>

Abstract: Active colloidal particles create flow around them due to non-equilibrium process on their surfaces. In this paper, we infer the activity of such colloidal particles from the flow field created by them via deep learning. We first explain our method for one active particle, inferring the $2s$ mode (or the stresslet) and the $3t$ mode (or the source dipole) from the flow field data, along with the position and orientation of the particle. We then apply the method to a system of many active particles. We find excellent agreements between the predictions and the true values of activity. Our method presents a principled way to predict arbitrary activity from the flow field created by active particles.</description>

      <title>Pilot-wave hydrodynamics of a particle in a density-stratified fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by bouncing drop experiments that revealed how macroscopic systems can exhibit wave-particle properties previously thought to be exclusive to quantum systems, we introduce here a new wave-particle system based on internal gravity waves propagating in density-stratified fluids. Recent experiments on particles (called ludions) oscillating in such a fluid medium suggest that wave-particle interactions can induce symmetry breaking, leading to spontaneous self-propulsion of the particle in the horizontal plane. Here, we propose a minimal hydrodynamic theory showing that this instability can be explained by a Doppler force emerging from interactions between the ludion and its own wave field. We validate our theoretical predictions using direct numerical simulations, which confirm that the growth of the instability is determined by the particle oscillation amplitude. In wall-bounded domains, reflections of the internal waves create a Casimir-like potential that rapidly develops and constrains the particle motion. Despite the presence of the Doppler force, this potential governs the ludion long-term dynamics, leading to capture in fixed points or chaotic attractors near the potential wells. We show that the essential features of this behavior are well captured by a minimal dynamical model. Our findings establish the ludion as a novel hydrodynamic pilot-wave system, offering a new platform for exploring macroscopic wave-particle behaviors, particularly in three-dimensional configurations.</description>

      <title>Ensembles in Urban Large Eddy Simulations with Changing Wind Direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differences between time-averaged and ensemble-averaged wind are studied for the case of changing wind direction. We consider a flow driven by a temporally turning pressure gradient in both an idealized case of a staggered cube array and a realistic urban environment. The repeating structure of the idealized case allows us to construct a large ensemble of 3 240 members with a reasonable compute time. The results indicate that the use of plain time averaging instead of an ensemble average can severely reduce the accuracy of both the mean and variance. These errors are the largest when the averaging time is of the same order as the time scale associated with the turning. Utilizing Taylor diagrams, we show that a reasonable compromise between ensemble size and accuracy can be achieved by calculating the ensemble statistics from temporally averaged results with an averaging time that is clearly smaller than the characteristic time scale. This allows the use of reasonably-sized ensembles with 10-50 members. By applying this approach to the realistic urban geometry, we identify building wakes as the regions most severely affected by the incorrectly use of time averaging.</description>

      <title>Neural network-augmented eddy viscosity closures for turbulent premixed jet flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending gradient-type turbulence closures to turbulent premixed flames is challenging due to the significant influence of combustion heat release. We incorporate a deep neural network (DNN) into Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) models for the turbulent viscosity and thermal conductivity as nonlinear functions of the local flow state and thermochemical gradients. Our models are optimized over the RANS partial differential equations (PDEs) using an adjoint-based data assimilation procedure. Because we directly target the RANS solution, as opposed to the unclosed terms, successfully trained models are guaranteed to improve the in-sample accuracy of the DNN-augmented RANS predictions. We demonstrate the learned closures for in- and out-of-sample $\textit{a posteriori}$ RANS predictions of compressible, premixed, turbulent jet flames with turbulent Damk\"ohler numbers spanning the gradient- and counter-gradient transport regimes. The DNN-augmented RANS predictions have one to two orders of magnitude lower spatiotemporal mean-squared error than those using a baseline $k$--$\epsilon$ model, even for Damk\"ohler numbers far from those used for training. This demonstrates the accuracy, stability, and generalizability of the PDE-constrained modeling approach for turbulent jet flames over this relatively wide Damk\"ohler number range.</description>

      <title>Energy transfer and budget analysis for transient process with operator-driven reduced-order model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the possibility of energy transfer and budget analysis for transient flow using eigenmodes of the operator from the Navier-Stokes equation. We derive the energy transfer equation, which provides the energy budget for the eigenmodes, through the Galerkin projection of the equation using the bi-orthogonality of the eigenmodes and the adjoint mode. Energy budget and transfer analysis between modes were conducted for two-dimensional flow around a cylinder with eigenmodes growing or decaying from a steady flow. Using the linearized energy transfer equation and eigenmodes from global stability analysis, we identify the energy budget and spatial distribution that determine mode growth rates. Moreover, energy budget and transfer analysis are realized by considering the time evolution of the eigenmodes, even during the nonlinear development of the eigenmodes. By introducing time-varying dynamic mode decomposition with a phase-control strategy for multiple time-series datasets from numerical simulations of the phase-controlled initial flow, time-varying eigenmodes are extracted in the transient two-dimensional cylinder flow. With the extracted time-dependent modes and the derived energy transfer equations, the time evolution of the energy budget and spatial distribution of energy transfer can be computed until the eigenmodes developed from the steady field reach the post-transient periodic flow. From the time variation of the energy budget and the transfer distribution, the transient process of the cylinder flow can be characterized by the ratio of the magnitude of viscous diffusion for the eigenmode and energy transfer from the base flow.</description>
