      <title>User-Aware Multilingual Abusive Content Detection in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite growing efforts to halt distasteful content on social media, multilingualism has added a new dimension to this problem. The scarcity of resources makes the challenge even greater when it comes to low-resource languages. This work focuses on providing a novel method for abusive content detection in multiple low-resource Indic languages. Our observation indicates that a post's tendency to attract abusive comments, as well as features such as user history and social context, significantly aid in the detection of abusive content. The proposed method first learns social and text context features in two separate modules. The integrated representation from these modules is learned and used for the final prediction. To evaluate the performance of our method against different classical and state-of-the-art methods, we have performed extensive experiments on SCIDN and MACI datasets consisting of 1.5M and 665K multilingual comments, respectively. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods with an average increase of 4.08% and 9.52% in F1-scores on SCIDN and MACI datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Modeling The Sharing and Diffusion Of Fake News in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of social media platforms has been gradually increasing and fake news spreading is becoming an alarming issue nowadays. The spreading of fake news means disseminating false, confusing, and spurious information which hurts families, communities etc. As a result, this issue has to be resolved sooner so that we can limit the spread of fake news in the virtual world. One needs to identify the fake news spreader to address this issue. In this research, we have tried to reveal the users who are most likely to share fake news as well as the spread prediction that shared pieces of fake news in the social network. We take into account the users information, such as follower counts, like counts, and retweet counts along with users topical interests on different topics as well as connection strength by considering the follower-following ratio. We also consider the complexity features, stylistic features, and psychological effects of news. Finally, we applied different machine-learning algorithms to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Our observation is that the probability of spreading a piece of news shared by users having more followers as well as more likes and retweet counts (aka influential users) is higher compared with other users.</description>

      <title>Information diffusion assumptions can distort our understanding of social network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21554v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To analyze the flow of information online, experts often rely on platform-provided data from social media companies, which typically attribute all resharing actions to an original poster. This obscures the true dynamics of how information spreads online, as users can be exposed to content in various ways. While most researchers analyze data as it is provided by the platform and overlook this issue, some attempt to infer the structure of these information cascades. However, the absence of ground truth about actual diffusion cascades makes verifying the efficacy of these efforts impossible. This study investigates the implications of the common practice of ignoring reconstruction all together. Two case studies involving data from Twitter and Bluesky reveal that reconstructing cascades significantly alters the identification of influential users, therefore affecting downstream analyses in general. We also propose a novel reconstruction approach that allows us to evaluate the effects of different assumptions made during the cascade inference procedure. Analysis of the diffusion of over 40,000 true and false news stories on Twitter reveals that the assumptions made during the reconstruction procedure drastically distort both microscopic and macroscopic properties of cascade networks. This work highlights the challenges of studying information spreading processes on complex networks and has significant implications for the broader study of digital platforms.</description>

      <title>The Toxicity Phenomenon Across Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms have evolved rapidly in modernity without strong regulation. One clear obstacle faced by current users is that of toxicity. Toxicity on social media manifests through a number of forms, including harassment, negativity, misinformation or other means of divisiveness. In this paper, we characterize literature surrounding toxicity, formalize a definition of toxicity, propose a novel cycle of internet extremism, list current approaches to toxicity detection, outline future directions to minimize toxicity in future social media endeavors, and identify current gaps in research space. We present a novel perspective of the negative impacts of social media platforms and fill a gap in literature to help improve the future of social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Multi-layer network analysis of deliberation in an online discussion platform: the case of Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uses a multi-layer network model to study deliberation in online discussion platforms, focusing on the Reddit platform. The model comprises two layers: a discussion layer, which represents the comment-to-comment replies as a hierarchical tree, and an actor layer, which represent the actor-to-actor reply interactions. The interlayer links represent user-comment ownership. We further propose several different network metrics to characterise the level of deliberation in discussion threads, and apply the model and metrics to a large Reddit dataset containing posts from 72 subreddits focused on different topics. We compare the level of deliberation that occurs on different subreddits, finding that subreddits that are based on geographical regions or focus on sports have the highest levels of deliberation. Analysis of the actor layer reveals several features consistent across all subreddits, such as small-world characteristics and similar numbers of highly active users.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Analysis of the Sovereign Citizens Movement on Telegram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online communities of known extremist groups like the alt-right and QAnon have been well explored in past work. However, we find that an extremist group called Sovereign Citizens is relatively unexplored despite its existence since the 1970s. Their main belief is delegitimizing the established government with a tactic called paper terrorism, clogging courts with pseudolegal claims. In recent years, their activities have escalated to threats like forcefully claiming property ownership and participating in the Capitol Riot. This paper aims to shed light on Sovereign Citizens' online activities by examining two Telegram channels, each belonging to an identified Sovereign Citizen individual. We collect over 888K text messages and apply NLP techniques. We find that the two channels differ in the topics they discussed, demonstrating different focuses. Further, the two channels exhibit less toxic content compared to other extremist groups like QAnon. Finally, we find indications of overlapping beliefs between the two channels and QAnon, suggesting a merging or complementing of beliefs.</description>

      <title>Balanced Bidirectional Breadth-First Search on Scale-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To find a shortest path between two nodes $s_0$ and $s_1$ in a given graph, a classical approach is to start a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from $s_0$ and run it until the search discovers $s_1$. Alternatively, one can start two Breadth-First Searches, one from $s_0$ and one from $s_1$, and alternate their layer expansions until they meet. This bidirectional BFS can be balanced by always expanding a layer on the side that has discovered fewer vertices so far. This usually results in significant speedups in real-world networks, and it has been shown that this indeed yields sublinear running time on scale-free graph models such as Chung-Lu graphs and hyperbolic random graphs.
  We improve this layer-balanced bidirectional BFS approach by using a finer balancing technique. Instead of comparing the size of the two BFS trees after each layer expansion, we perform this comparison after each vertex expansion. This gives rise to two algorithms that run faster than the layer-balanced bidirectional BFS on scale-free networks with power-law exponent $\tau \in (2,3)$. The first one is an approximate shortest-path algorithm that outputs a path of length at most 1 longer than the shortest path in time $n^{(\tau-2)/(\tau-1)+o(1)}$. The second one is an exact shortest-path algorithm running in time $n^{1/2+o(1)}$. These runtime bounds hold with high probability when $s_0$ and $s_1$ are chosen uniformly at random among the $n$ vertices of the graph. We also develop an edge-balanced bidirectional BFS algorithm that works under adversarial conditions. This approximate shortest-path algorithm runs in time $n^{1/2+o(1)}$ with high probability when the adversary is allowed to choose $s_0$ and $s_1$ based on their (expected) degree. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on Chung-Lu graphs, Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and real-world networks.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Machine Learning in Sports Betting: Techniques, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sports betting industry has experienced rapid growth, driven largely by technological advancements and the proliferation of online platforms. Machine learning (ML) has played a pivotal role in the transformation of this sector by enabling more accurate predictions, dynamic odds-setting, and enhanced risk management for both bookmakers and bettors. This systematic review explores various ML techniques, including support vector machines, random forests, and neural networks, as applied in different sports such as soccer, basketball, tennis, and cricket. These models utilize historical data, in-game statistics, and real-time information to optimize betting strategies and identify value bets, ultimately improving profitability. For bookmakers, ML facilitates dynamic odds adjustment and effective risk management, while bettors leverage data-driven insights to exploit market inefficiencies. This review also underscores the role of ML in fraud detection, where anomaly detection models are used to identify suspicious betting patterns. Despite these advancements, challenges such as data quality, real-time decision-making, and the inherent unpredictability of sports outcomes remain. Ethical concerns related to transparency and fairness are also of significant importance. Future research should focus on developing adaptive models that integrate multimodal data and manage risk in a manner akin to financial portfolios. This review provides a comprehensive examination of the current applications of ML in sports betting, and highlights both the potential and the limitations of these technologies.</description>

      <title>Faster Local Solvers for Graph Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient computation of graph diffusion equations (GDEs), such as Personalized PageRank, Katz centrality, and the Heat kernel, is crucial for clustering, training neural networks, and many other graph-related problems. Standard iterative methods require accessing the whole graph per iteration, making them time-consuming for large-scale graphs. While existing local solvers approximate diffusion vectors through heuristic local updates, they often operate sequentially and are typically designed for specific diffusion types, limiting their applicability. Given that diffusion vectors are highly localizable, as measured by the participation ratio, this paper introduces a novel framework for approximately solving GDEs using a local diffusion process. This framework reveals the suboptimality of existing local solvers. Furthermore, our approach effectively localizes standard iterative solvers by designing simple and provably sublinear time algorithms. These new local solvers are highly parallelizable, making them well-suited for implementation on GPUs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in quickly obtaining approximate diffusion vectors, achieving up to a hundred-fold speed improvement, and its applicability to large-scale dynamic graphs. Our framework could also facilitate more efficient local message-passing mechanisms for GNNs.</description>

      <title>Estimating Policy Effects in a Social Network with Independent Set Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14142v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating the impact of policy interventions on respondents who are embedded in a social network is often challenging due to the presence of network interference within the treatment groups, as well as between treatment and non-treatment groups throughout the network. In this paper, we propose a novel empirical strategy that combines network sampling based on the identification of independent sets with a stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM) to infer the direct and net effects of a policy. By assigning respondents from an independent set to the treatment, we are able to block direct spillover of the treatment among the treated respondents for an extended period of time, during which the direct effect of the treatment can be isolated from the associated network interference. We empirically demonstrate this using a simulation-based evaluation of a fictitious policy implementation using both real-life and generated networks, and use a counterfactual approach to estimate the treatment effect of the policy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed empirical strategy, and notably, the role of network sampling techniques in influencing the evaluation of policy effects. The findings from this study have the potential to help researchers and policymakers with planning, designing, and anticipating policy responses in a networked society.</description>

      <title>ABCD: Algorithm for Balanced Component Discovery in Signed Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The largest balanced element in signed graphs plays a vital role in helping researchers understand the fundamental structure of the graph, as it reveals valuable information about the complex relationships between vertices in the network. The challenge is an NP-hard problem; there is no current baseline to evaluate state-of-the-art signed graphs derived from real networks. In this paper, we propose a scalable state-of-the-art approach for the maximum balanced sub-graph detection in the network of \emph{any} size. The proposed approach finds the largest balanced sub-graph by considering only the top $K$ balanced states with the lowest frustration index. We show that the ABCD method selects a subset from an extensive signed network with millions of vertices and edges, and the size of the discovered subset is double that of the state-of-the-art in a similar time frame.</description>

      <title>Scaling Frustration Index and Corresponding Balanced State Discovery for Real Signed Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural balance modeling for signed graph networks presents how to model the sources of conflicts. The state-of-the-art focuses on computing the frustration index of a signed graph, a critical step toward solving problems in social and sensor networks and scientific modeling. The proposed approaches do not scale to large signed networks of tens of millions of vertices and edges. In this paper, we propose two efficient algorithms, a tree-based \emph{graphBpp} and a gradient descent-based \emph{graphL}. We show that both algorithms outperform state-of-art in terms of efficiency and effectiveness for discovering the balanced state for \emph{any} size of the network. We introduce the first comparison for large graphs for the exact, tree-based, and gradient descent-based methods. The speedup of the methods is around \emph{300+ times faster} than the state-of-the-art for large signed graphs. We find that the exact method excels at optimally finding the frustration for small graphs only. \emph{graphBpp} scales this approximation to large signed graphs at the cost of accuracy. \emph{graphL} produces a state with a lower frustration at the cost of selecting a proper variable initialization and hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a model for describing advection dynamics on distance-weighted directed graphs. To this end we establish a set of key properties, or axioms, that a discrete advection operator should satisfy, and prove that there exists an essentially unique operator satisfying all such properties. Both infinite and finite networks are considered, as well as possible variants and extensions. We illustrate the proposed model through examples, both analytical and numerical, and we describe an application to the simulation of a traffic network.</description>

      <title>Improving Information Diffusion Prediction by Tackling Noise and Sparsity Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the widespread use of online social media platforms, information diffusion has become a prevalent phenomenon, making Information Diffusion Prediction (IDP) increasingly important for various applications. Despite significant advancements in IDP research, existing methods often overlook issues of noise and sparsity in information diffusion data. User behaviors are frequently influenced by external factors, introducing noise into the data and hindering models' understanding of true diffusion patterns. Additionally, many users have limited interaction data, leading to data sparsity and restricting models' ability to effectively capture user preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called DDiff, which tackles noise and sparsity issues through denoising diffusion and cross-domain contrastive learning. First, we introduce a graph learning encoder module that captures the social homophily of users through their relationships and higher-order connections via information diffusion hypergraphs (IDH). Next, a cross-domain contrastive learning module is designed to facilitate effective knowledge transfer between the information and social domains, addressing the sparsity problem. Furthermore, we propose a denoising diffusion module with IDH to effectively mitigate noise issues by introducing random noise in the forward process and iteratively recovering the corrupted embeddings in the reverse process. Finally, we implement a prediction module to determine the likelihood of subsequent users becoming infected. Experimental results demonstrate that DDiff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the information diffusion prediction task.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis of Social Tie Strength: Definitions, Prediction Methods, and Future Directions</title>

Abstract: The rapid growth of online social networks has underscored the importance of understanding the intensity of user relationships, referred to as "tie strength." Over the past few decades, extensive efforts have been made to assess tie strength in networks. However, the lack of ground-truth tie strength labels and the differing perspectives on tie strength among researchers have complicated the development of effective prediction methods for real-world applications. In our study, we first categorize mainstream understandings of tie strength into seven standardized definitions and verify their effectiveness by investigating the class distributions and correlations across these definitions. We also draw key insights into tie resilience from the perspective of tie dissolution that (1) stronger ties are more resilient than weaker ones, and (2) this tie resiliency ratio increases as the network evolves. We then conduct extensive experiments to evaluate existing tie strength prediction methods under these definitions, revealing that (1) neural network methods capable of learning from semantic features hold great potential for high performance, (2) models struggle under definitions that offer limited understandings of tie strength in the network, (3) existing models face imbalance issues that cannot be addressed by traditional quantity imbalance techniques, and (4) different definitions of tie strength allow for the inference of not only the current state but also the future state of a tie. Building on these findings, we propose strategies to improve existing methods and suggest several promising directions for future research.

      <title>Het-node2vec: second order random walk sampling for heterogeneous multigraphs embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.01425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world problems are naturally modeled as heterogeneous graphs, where nodes and edges represent multiple types of entities and relations. Existing learning models for heterogeneous graph representation usually depend on the computation of specific and user-defined heterogeneous paths, or in the application of large and often not scalable deep neural network architectures. We propose Het-node2vec, an extension of the node2vec algorithm, designed for embedding heterogeneous graphs. Het-node2vec addresses the challenge of capturing the topological and structural characteristics of graphs and the semantic information underlying the different types of nodes and edges of heterogeneous graphs, by introducing a simple stochastic node and edge type switching strategy in second order random walk processes. The proposed approach also introduces an ''attention mechanism'' to focus the random walks on specific node and edge types, thus allowing more accurate embeddings and more focused predictions on specific node and edge types of interest. Empirical results on benchmark datasets show that Hetnode2vec achieves comparable or superior performance with respect to state-of-the-art methods for heterogeneous graphs in node label and edge prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Looking AT the Blue Skies of Bluesky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pitfalls of centralized social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter/X, have led to concerns about control, transparency, and accountability. Decentralized social networks have emerged as a result with the goal of empowering users. These decentralized approaches come with their own tradeoffs, and therefore multiple architectures exist. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale analysis of Bluesky, a prominent decentralized microblogging platform. In contrast to alternative approaches (e.g. Mastodon), Bluesky decomposes and opens the key functions of the platform into subcomponents that can be provided by third party stakeholders. We collect a comprehensive dataset covering all the key elements of Bluesky, study user activity and assess the diversity of providers for each sub-components.</description>

      <title>A cross-platform analysis of polarization and echo chambers in climate change discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21187</link>

Abstract: With the intensification of climate change discussion, social media has become prominent in disseminating reliable and unreliable content. In this study, we present a cross-platform analysis on Youtube and Twitter, and examine the polarization and echo chambers in social media discussions in four datasets related to climate change: COP27, IPCC, Climate Refugees, and Do\~{n}ana. We have identified communities of users spreading misinformation on Twitter, although they remain relatively isolated from the rest of the network. The analysis by interaction type reveals that climate change sceptics use mentions to draw the attention of other communities. The YouTube posts referenced on Twitter reveal a strong correlation in the community organisation of social media, suggesting a platform alignment. Moreover, we report the presence of echo chambers in YouTube post-sharing related to mainstream and sceptical content.</description>
