      <title>Holographic Thermodynamics of an Enhanced Charged AdS Black Hole in String Theory's Playground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m AdS black hole to study thermodynamics. We study the $P-V$ criticality and thermodynamical stability of the black hole. We obtained a first-order phase transition, which may be interpreted as the large/small black hole phase transition. Therefore, we obtained a van der Waals behaviour and obtained critical points. Finally, we calculate quantum work used to resolve the information loss paradox.</description>

      <title>On Ruijsenaars-Schneider spectrum from superconformal indices and ramified instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss two physics-inspired approaches to derivation of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of $A_N$ Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. First approach which was recently proposed by the authors relies on the computations of superconformal indices of class $\mathcal{S}$ $4d$ ${\mathcal N}=2$ theories with the insertion of surface defects. Second approach uses computations of Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of $5d$ ${\mathcal N} = 1^*$ instanton partition functions in the presence of co-dimension two defect. We compare results of these two approaches for the low-lying levels of Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. We also discuss different previously proposed exact quantization conditions for the Coulomb branch parameters of the instanton partition functions and their interpretations in terms of index calculations.</description>

      <title>Integrability in Gravity from Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new perspective on integrability in theories of gravity. We show how the stationary, axisymmetric sector of General Relativity can be described by the boundary dynamics of a four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. This approach shows promise for simplifying solution generating methods in both General Relativity and higher-dimensional supergravity theories. The four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory presented generalises those for flat space integrable models by introducing a space-time dependent branch cut in the spectral plane. We also make contact with twistor space approaches to integrability, showing how the branch cut defects of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory arise from a discrete reduction of six-dimensional Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>TCC in the interior of moduli space and its implications for the string landscape and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the classical Friedmann-Robertson-Walker solutions that describe a universe undergoing a transition from an accelerating expansion phase in the past to an eternal decelerating expansion phase in the future, driven by a scalar field evolving in a potential energy landscape. We show that any solution for which the accelerating phase violates the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC), even in the interior of moduli space, never approaches the asymptotic vacuum with zero particles. Based on the assumption that the effective field theory must be valid for the vacuum on the asymptotic boundary, as motivated by holography and string theory, we argue that (multi-field) scalar potentials with such solutions are disallowed, thus strengthening the case for TCC. In particular, the results imply a new set of complex and highly-nonlinear constraints across the entire string landscape which may make realizing inflation impossible.</description>

      <title>Self-dualities and Galois symmetries in Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that all Feynman integrals within a given family can be expressed as a finite linear combination of master integrals. The master integrals naturally group into sectors. Starting from two loops, there can exist sectors made up of more than one master integral. In this paper we show that such sectors may have additional symmetries. First of all, self-duality, which was first observed in Feynman integrals related to Calabi--Yau geometries, often carries over to non-Calabi--Yau Feynman integrals. Secondly, we show that in addition there can exist Galois symmetries relating integrals. In the simplest case of two master integrals within a sector, whose definition involves a square root $r$, we may choose a basis $(I_1,I_2)$ such that $I_2$ is obtained from $I_1$ by the substitution $r \rightarrow -r$. This pattern also persists in sectors, which a priori are not related to any square root with dependence on the kinematic variables. We show in several examples that in such cases a suitable redefinition of the integrals introduces constant square roots like $\sqrt{3}$. The new master integrals are then again related by a Galois symmetry, for example the substitution $\sqrt{3} \rightarrow -\sqrt{3}$. To handle the case where the argument of a square root would be a perfect square we introduce a limit Galois symmetry. Both self-duality and Galois symmetries constrain the differential equation.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic transport from frame-indifferent kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Newton-Cartan geometry to the kinetic theory of gases that includes non-relativistic gravitational effects and the principle of general covariance. Starting with an introduction to the basics of Newton-Cartan geometry, we examine the motion of point particles within this framework, leading to a detailed analysis of kinetic theory and the derivation of conservation equations. The equilibrium distribution function is explored, and the example of a rotating gas in a gravitational field is discussed. Further, we develop covariant hydrodynamic equations and extend our analysis through a gradient expansion approach to assess first-order constitutive relations for rotating gases. Finally, we address the frame-dependence paradox, presenting a novel resolution that addresses apparent discrepancies. Our construction resolves a fifty-year-old debate about the frame-indifferent formulation of kinetic theory. The resolution is presented in a modern, symmetry-based approach.</description>

      <title>Taming non-analyticities of QFT observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many observables in quantum field theories are involved non-analytic functions of the parameters of the theory. However, it is expected that they are not arbitrarily wild, but rather have only a finite amount of geometric complexity. This expectation has been recently formalized by a tameness principle: physical observables should be definable in o-minimal structures and their sharp refinements. In this work, we show that a broad class of non-analytic partition and correlation functions are tame functions in the o-minimal structure known as $\mathbb{R}_{\mathscr{G}}$ - the structure defining Gevrey functions. Using a perturbative approach, we expand the observables in asymptotic series in powers of a small coupling constant. Although these series are often divergent, they can be Borel-resummed in the absence of Stokes phenomena to yield the full partition and correlation functions. We show that this makes them definable in $\mathbb{R}_{\mathscr{G}}$ and provide a number of motivating examples. These include certain 0-dimensional quantum field theories and a set of higher-dimensional quantum field theories that can be analyzed using constructive field theory. Finally, we discuss how the eigenvalues of certain Hamiltonians in quantum mechanics are also definable in $\mathbb{R}_{\mathscr{G}}$.</description>

      <title>A time operator and the time-of-arrival problem in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Newton-Wigner states and operator are widely accepted to provide an adequate notion of spatial localization of a particle in quantum field theory on a spacelike hypersurface. Replacing the spacelike with a timelike hypersurface, we construct one-particle states of massive Klein-Gordon theory that are localized on the hypersurface in the temporal as well as two spatial directions. This addresses the longstanding problem of a "time operator" in quantum theory. It is made possible by recent advances in quantization on timelike hypersurfaces and the introduction of evanescent particles. As a first application of time-localized states, we consider the time-of-arrival problem. Our results are in accordance with semiclassical expectations of causal propagation of massless and massive particles. As in the Newton-Wigner case, localization is not perfect, but apparent superluminal propagation is exponentially suppressed.</description>

      <title>Timelike boundaries in de Sitter JT gravity and the Gao-Wald theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gao-Wald theorem says that de Sitter spacetime reacts to a positive energy perturbation by getting "taller." How does this change in the presence of timelike boundaries? We study this question in two-dimensional de Sitter JT gravity coupled to conformal matter. The effect of the boundaries has its roots in quantum corrections to the vacuum energy of the CFT due to Casimir-like effects. We consider two different kinds of timelike boundaries, either at locations where the coordinate $\varphi$ is constant or at locations where the dilaton is constant. For each kind we compute the vacuum expectation value of the matter CFT stress tensor. The stress tensor violates the null energy condition in the first case and saturates it in the second case, with each case exhibiting a negative energy density in the vacuum state. We then compute the semiclassical backreaction of this energy density and show how it can make the spacetime "fatter" or "taller," depending on the regime. The spacetime getting fatter corresponds to an increase in the dilaton everywhere and hence also in the static patch horizon area in the higher-dimensional solution, and the spacetime getting taller corresponds to a decrease. We comment on the implications of our results for the quantum theories living on the timelike boundaries.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Analogue for Quantum Field Theory with a Source term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a non-relativistic fluid analogue model for a scalar field coupled to a classical source. The generic analogue gravity model involves the phonon field which is coupled to the acoustic metric. We work in the special relativity limit of the acoustic analogue. By assuming a time dependent external potential on the fluid system, we are able to model a source term for the scalar field. Upon quantisation, phonon creation due to the source is studied.</description>

      <title>String Geometry Theory and The String Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String geometry theory is a candidate of the non-perturvative formulation of string theory. In this theory, strings constitute not only particles but also the space-time. In this review, we identify perturbative vacua, and derive the path-integrals of all order perturbative strings on the corresponding string backgrounds by considering the fluctuations around the vacua. On the other hand, the most dominant part of the path-integral of string geometry theory is the zeroth order part in the fluctuation of the action, which is obtained by substituting the perturbative vacua to the action. This part is identified with the effective potential of the string backgrounds and obtained explicitly. The global minimum of the potential is the string vacuum. The urgent problem is to find the global minimum. We introduce both analytical and numerical methods to solve it.</description>

      <title>Holographic Einstein Ring of Deformed AdS-Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein ring of a deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole (BH) is investigated under the wave optics framework. When the source is fixed on the AdS boundary, we can obtain the corresponding response function generated on the opposite side of the boundary. Utilizing a specialized optical system equipped with a convex lens enables us to capture an image of the BH's holographic Einstein ring on the screen. The influence of the relevant physical parameters and the observed inclination on the characteristics of the Einstein ring can also be studied, which found that the alteration of the observer's position, the image displayed on the screen changes from an axisymmetric ring to an arc, ultimately becoming a solitary point of luminosity. Furthermore, variations in the relevant physical parameters naturally exert an influence on the Einstein ring, resulting in various changes to both its radius and brightness. We also discover the photon ring of the BH from the perspective of the geometric optics, and the numerical results demonstrate that the incident angle of the photon ring is consistent with that of the Einstein ring. It is found that the validity of studying the Einstein ring by wave optics. The investigation on the Einstein rings formed by the deformed AdS-Schwarzschild BHs is anticipated to yield more comprehensive insights into the spacetime geometry, enabling its distinction from Schwarzschild BH.</description>

      <title>Topological equivalence and phase transition rate in holographic thermodynamics of regularized Maxwell theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the holographic dictionary from the proposal that treats Newton's constant as a thermodynamic variable, we establish a thermodynamic topological equivalence between the AdS black holes in the bulk and the thermal states in the dual CFT. The findings further reveal that the thermodynamic topological characteristics of the RegMax AdS black holes are strongly influenced by the characteristic parameter of the regularized Maxwell theory. Additionally, we investigate the phase transition between low and high entropy thermal states within a canonical ensemble in the dual CFT. Our observations indicate that the phase transition behavior of the thermal states mirrors that of the black holes. By modeling the phase transition process as a stochastic process, we are able to calculate the rates of phase transition between the thermal states. This result enhances our understanding of the dominant processes involved in the phase transition of the thermal states in the dual CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resonant energy transfer mechanism, responsible for the presence of fractal patterns in the velocity diagrams of kink-antikink scattering, is analyzed for a family of two-component scalar field theory models, in which the kink solutions have two shape modes (one longitudinal and one orthogonal to the kink orbit), in addition to the zero mode, and in which energy redistribution can occur among these three discrete modes. We investigate the scattering between wobbling kinks whose orthogonal shape mode is initially excited, examining how the final velocities, amplitudes, and frequencies depend on the initial excitation amplitude. The differences that this model presents with respect to the $\phi^4$ model and its novel properties are highlighted. This analysis sheds light on the intricate dynamics that arise from the interplay between multiple degrees of freedom in kink scattering processes, offering insights distinct from those observed in simpler models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that even $\zeta$-functions may be removed from the $\beta$-functions of general multi-coupling theories up to high loop order by means of coupling redefinitions. For theories whose $\beta$-function is determined by the anomalous dimensions of the fields, such as supersymmetric theories, this corresponds to a renormalisation scheme change to a momentum subtraction scheme.</description>

      <title>Plane-parallel waves as Jacobi-Lie models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T-duality and its generalizations are widely recognized either as symmetries or solution-generating techniques in string theory. Recently introduced Jacobi-Lie T-plurality is based on Leibniz algebras whose structure constants ${f_{ab}}^c, {f_c}^{ab}, Z_a, Z^a$ satisfy further conditions. Low dimensional Jacobi-Lie bialgebras were classified a few years ago. We study four- and six-dimensional algebras with structure constants ${f_b}^{ba} = Z^a = 0$ and show that there are several classes consisting of mutually isomorphic algebras.
  Using isomorphisms between Jacobi-Lie bialgebras we investigate three- and four-dimensional sigma models related by Jacobi-Lie T-plurality with and without spectators. In the Double Field Theory formulation constant generalized fluxes $F_A$ are used in the literature to transform dilaton field. We extend the procedure to non-constant fluxes and verify that obtained backgrounds and dilatons solve Supergravity Equations. Most of the resulting backgrounds have vanishing curvature scalars and, as can be seen by finding Brinkmann coordinates, represent plane-parallel waves solving Supergravity Equations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent progress regarding the double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and other $p$-local quantum mechanical random Hamiltonians. These models exhibit an expansion using chord diagrams, which can be solved by combinatorial methods. We describe exact results in these models, including their spectrum, correlation functions, and Lyapunov exponent. In a certain limit, these techniques manifest the relation to the Schwarzian quantum mechanics, a theory of quantum gravity in $AdS_2$. More generally, the theory is controlled by a rigid algebraic structure of a quantum group, suggesting a theory of quantum gravity on non-commutative $q$-deformed $AdS_2$. We conclude with discussion of related universality classes, and survey some of the current research directions.</description>

      <title>On Non Invertible Symmetries in Type IIB Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we uncover a collection of non invertible topological operators linked to the 0-, 2-, 4- and 6-form symmetries arising from the type IIB superstring effective pseudo action. By pinpointing the $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-covariant conserved currents corresponding to these symmetries, we first derive a set of $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant invertible topological operators that encapsulate the integer BPS charges inherent to the theory. Moving forward, by incorporating fractional charges while maintaining gauge invariance, we introduce the non invertible topological operators for each generalized symmetry, and in particular for the $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ 0-form symmetry. Identifying them as a novel kind of symmetries reminiscent of fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE)-like non invertible operators, we study their action on charged objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of the leading self-force (0SF) order, corresponding to the geodesic motion of a light body in the exact background of a heavy body, are explicitly derived for the first time using a flat space scattering amplitude-based approach. This is achieved by utilising the cubic formulation of Einstein's general relativity coupled to the effective worldline action of massive point particles, which was employed to derive the Schwarzschild black hole metric in arXiv:2405.14421.</description>

      <title>Gauging The Diamond: Integrable Coset Models from Twistor Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that certain integrable and conformal field theories in two dimensions can be given a higher-dimensional origin from holomorphic Chern-Simons in six dimensions. Along with anti-self-dual Yang-Mills and four-dimensional Chern-Simons, this gives rise to a diamond correspondence of theories. In this work we extend this framework to incorporate models realised through gaugings. As well as describing a higher-dimensional origin of coset CFTs, by choosing the details of the reduction from higher dimensions, we obtain rich classes of two-dimensional integrable models including homogeneous sine-Gordon models and generalisations that are new to the literature.</description>

      <title>LANSCE-mQ: Dedicated search for milli/fractionally charged particles at LANL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an experiment, LANSCE-mQ, aiming to detect fractionally charged and millicharged particles (mCP) using an 800 MeV proton beam fixed target at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) facility. This search can shed new light on numerous fundamental questions, including charge quantization, the predictions of string theories and grand unification theories, the gauge symmetry of the Standard Model, dark sector models, and the tests of cosmic reheating. We propose to install two-layer scintillation detectors made of plastic (such as EJ-200) or CeBr3 to search for mCPs. Dedicated Geant4 detector simulations and in situ measurements have been conducted to obtain a preliminary determination of the background rate. The dominant backgrounds are beam-induced neutrons and coincident dark current signals from the photomultiplier tubes, while beam-induced gammas and cosmic muons are subdominant. We determined that LANSCE-mQ, the dedicated mCP experiment, has the leading mCP sensitivity for mass between ~ 1 MeV to 300 MeV.</description>

      <title>Well-posed initial value formulation of general effective field theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a proof that all polynomial higher-derivative effective field theories of vacuum gravity admit a well-posed initial value formulation when augmented by suitable regularising terms. These regularising terms can be obtained by field redefinitions and allow to rewrite the resulting equations of motion as a system of second-order nonlinear wave equations. For instance, our result applies to the quadratic, cubic, and quartic truncations of the effective field theory of gravity that have previously appeared in the literature. The regularising terms correspond to fiducial massive modes, however, their masses can be chosen to be non-tachyonic and heavier than the cutoff scale and hence these modes should not affect the dynamics in the regime of validity of effective field theory. Our well-posed formulation is not limited to the weakly coupled regime of these theories, is manifestly covariant and does neither require fine tuning of free parameters nor involves prescribing arbitrary equations.</description>

      <title>A particle's perspective on screening mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Screening mechanisms are a natural method for suppressing long-range forces in scalar-tensor theories as they link the local background density to their strength. Focusing on Brans-Dicke theories, those including a non-minimal coupling between a scalar degree of freedom and the Ricci scalar, we study the origin of these screening mechanisms from a field theory perspective, considering the influence of the Standard Model on the mechanisms. Additionally, we further consider the role of scale symmetries on screening, demonstrating that only certain sectors, those obtaining their mass via the Higgs mechanism, contribute to screening the fifth forces. This has significant implications for baryons, which obtain most of their mass from the gluon's binding energy. Given that the Planck mass is related to the vacuum expectation value of the non-minimally coupled field, we find an extensive region of the parameter space where screening mechanisms create a spatially dependent gravitational constant. We say that the field over-screens when this effect is more significant than the fifth forces suppressed by screening mechanisms, as we illustrate for the chameleon and symmetron models.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed-state SPT from modulated symmetries and hierarchical structure of anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of intrinsic symmetry-protected topological mixed-state(mSPT) in open quantum systems that feature modulated symmetries, such as dipole and subsystem symmetries. Intriguingly, these mSPT phases cannot be realized as the ground states of a gapped Hamiltonian under thermal equilibrium. The microscopic form of the density matrix characterizing these intrinsic mixed-state SPT ensembles is constructed using solvable coupled-wire models that incorporate quenched disorder or quantum channels. A detailed comparison of the hierarchical structure of boundary anomalies in both pure and mixed states is presented, utilizing flux insertion and Laughlin's charge pumping arguments. Finally, we explore the salient features of boundary anomalies in the mixed-state ensemble, which can be detected through the Renyi-N correlation function of charged observables.</description>

      <title>Whispers from the quantum core: the ringdown of semiclassical stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This investigation delves into the ringdown signals produced by semiclassical stars, which are ultra-compact, regular solutions of the Einstein equations incorporating stress-energy contributions from quantum vacuum polarization. These stars exhibit an approximately Schwarzschild exterior and an interior composed of a constant-density classical fluid and a cloud of vacuum polarization. By adjusting their compactness and density, we can alter the internal structure of these stars without modifying the exterior. This adaptability enables us to examine the sensitivity of the ringdown signal to the innermost regions of the emitting object and to compare it with similar geometries that differ substantially only at the core. Our results indicate that echo signals are intrinsically linked to the presence of stable light rings and can be very sensitive to the internal structure of the emitting object. This point was previously overlooked, either due to the imposition of reflective boundary conditions at the stellar surface or due to the assumption of low curvature interior geometries. Specifically, for stellar-sized semiclassical stars, we find that the interior travel time is sufficiently prolonged to render the echoes effectively unobservable. These findings underscore the potential efficacy of ultra-compact objects as black hole mimickers and emphasize that any phenomenological constraints on such objects necessitate a detailed understanding of their specific properties and core structure.</description>

Abstract: Using Darmois-Israel-Sen junction conditions, and with help of Visser's cut-and-paste method, we study the dynamics of thin-shell wormholes that are made of two conformally Killing gravity (a.k.a Harada gravity) black holes. We check the energy conditions for different values of the new parameter that Harada introduced, as alternative for dark energy. We examine the radial acceleration to reveal the attractive and repulsive characteristics of the thin-shell wormhole throat. We consider the dynamics and stability of the wormhole around the static solutions of the linearized radial perturbations at the wormhole throat. Finally, we determine the regions of stability by applying the concavity test on the ''speed of sound'' as a function in the throat radius and other spacetime parameters, particularly the new Harada parameter.</description>

Abstract: The second-order coherence of light is a widely recognized physical quantity used to assess the quantum characteristics of light, and its properties have been extensively investigated in the field of quantum optics. Recently, it has been proposed that second-order coherence can be utilized as an indicator of quantum entanglement. In this study, we evaluated the second-order coherence in the context of the moving-mirror model, which serves as an analog model for Hawking radiation from a black hole. We discuss the relation between entanglement and the second-order coherence of Hawking radiation paying attention to the noise effect due to the thermality of Hawking radiation, which reduces the quantum correlation in the entanglement-harvesting protocol with two-qubit detectors.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIIa. Microwave background parity violation without parity-violating microphysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, which assumes statistical isotropy and parity invariance, predicts the absence of correlations between even-parity and odd-parity observables of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Contrary to these predictions, large-angle CMB temperature anomalies generically involve correlations between even-$\ell$ and odd-$\ell$ angular power spectrum $C_\ell$, while recent analyses of CMB polarization have revealed non-zero equal-$\ell$ $EB$ correlations. These findings challenge the conventional understanding, suggesting deviations from statistical isotropy, violations of parity, or both. Cosmic topology, which involves changing only the boundary conditions of space relative to standard cosmology, offers a compelling framework to potentially account for such parity-violating observations. Topology inherently breaks statistical isotropy, and can also break homogeneity and parity, providing a natural paradigm for explaining observations of parity-breaking observables without the need to add parity violation to the underlying microphysics. Our investigation delves into the harmonic space implications of topology for CMB correlations, using as an illustrative example $EB$ correlations generated by tensor perturbations under both parity-preserving and parity-violating scenarios. Consequently, these findings not only challenge the foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model but also open new avenues for exploring the topological structure of the Universe through CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Initial Conditions for the Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial conditions on the anisotropies of the stochastic gravitational-wave background of cosmological origin (CGWB) largely depend on the mechanism that generates the gravitational waves. Since the CGWB is expected to be non-thermal, the computation of the initial conditions could be more challenging w.r.t. the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), whose interactions with other particles in the early Universe lead to a blackbody spectrum. In this paper, we show that the initial conditions for the cosmological background generated by quantum fluctuations of the metric during inflation deviate from adiabaticity. These primordial gravitational waves are indeed generated by quantum fluctuations of two independent degrees of freedom (the two polarization states of the gravitons). Furthermore, the CGWB plays a negligible role in the Einstein's equations, because its energy density is subdominant w.r.t. ordinary matter. Therefore, the only possible way to compute the initial conditions for inflationary gravitons is to perturb the energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational field defined in terms of the small-scale tensor perturbation of the metric. This new and self-consistent approach shows that a large, non-adiabatic initial condition is present even during the single-field inflation. Such a contribution enhances the total angular power spectrum of the CGWB compared to the standard adiabatic case, increasing also the sensitivity of the anisotropies to the presence of relativistic and decoupled particles in the early Universe. In this work we have also proved that our findings are quite general and apply to both single-field inflation and other scenarios in which the CGWB is generated by the quantum fluctuations of the metric, like the curvaton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A self-consistent gravitational quantum field theory, with gravitational force treated on the same footing as the other three fundamental interactions, was established recently. The gravidynamics predicted by such a theory could lead to important implications, and the comparisons with experimental results may provide us opportunities to test such new approach of gravity based on the framework of the quantum field theory of gauge interactions. In this work, we start with the effective field equation of the gravitational quantum field theory, and then solve the perturbative gravigauge field order by order up to the 1st post-Newtonian level under the assumption of a simplified energy-momentum tensor of perfect fluids. Having the constraints on the related post-Newtonian parameters from the most up-to-date observational data, the new bound on the combined coupling in the gravitational quantum field theory $|\gamma_G(\alpha_G-\alpha_W/2)| \leq (2.4\pm30)\times10^{-6}$ is obtained. Under such bound, we found that the new gravitational quantum field theory successfully passed and found no conflict with the contemporary keynote Solar system experiments of gravity.</description>

      <title>Beyond the instanton gas approach: dominant thimbles approximation for the Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To each complex saddle point of an action, one can attach a Lefschetz thimble on which the imaginary part of the action is constant. Cauchy theorem states that summation over a set of thimbles produces the exact result. This reorganization of the path integral, is an appealing starting point for various approximations: In the realm of auxiliary quantum Monte Carlo methods it provides a framework to alleviate the negative sign problem. Here, we suggest to constrain the integration to the \textit{dominant} thimbles: the thimbles attached to the saddle points with the largest statistical weight. For the Hubbard model, in a formulation where the the Hubbard Stratonovitch field couples to the charge, this provides a \textit{symmetry} consistent approximation to the physics of the Hubbard model: constraining the integration domain does not explicitly break a symmetry. We can test this approach for the Hubbard model at half-filling on a bipartite lattice. The paper builds on the previously developed instanton gas approach, where an exhaustive saddle point approximation was constructed. We present results, showing that the dominant thimbles approximation provides results that are in remarkable agreement with the exact results for various fermionic observables including spin and charge order parameters and single electron spectral functions. We discuss implications of our results for simulations away of half filling.</description>

Abstract: Holographic space-time, a theory of quantum gravity that generalizes string theory and quantum field theory, predicts black holes in the early matter-dominated era of its models of inflation. Before these black holes can decay, there is a chance that enough of these particles merge to produce radiation visible today in the Cosmic Microwave background. To discover if this is the case, we perform a rudimentary computer simulation. We show that no problematic black holes are formed by mergers in the Holographic Space-time models of inflation. However, we conclude that tiny bound structures containing black holes remnants form in this theory unconditionally. Since black hole decay products are mostly massive standard model particles, and perhaps their superpartners, the fate of these structures is a complicated dynamical problem that requires further study. It suggests the possibility of primordial structures on the order of the horizon size at the beginning of the radiation dominated era. This is about $10^9\ L_P$ in the current model.</description>

Abstract: Any non-trivial scattering with massless fields in four spacetime dimensions will generically produce an out-state with memory. Scattering with any massless fields violates the standard assumption of asymptotic completeness -- that all "in" and "out" states lie in the standard (zero memory) Fock space -- and therefore leads to infrared (IR) divergences in the standard $S$-matrix amplitudes. In this paper we define an infrared finite scattering theory which assumes only (1) the existence of in/out algebras and (2) that Heisenberg evolution is an automorphism of these algebras. The resulting "superscattering" map $\$$ allows for transitions between different in/out memory states and agrees with the standard $S$-matrix when it is defined. We construct $\$$-amplitudes by defining (3) a "generalized asymptotic completeness" which accommodates states with memory in the space of asymptotic states and (4) a complete basis of improper states which generalize the usual $n$-particle momentum basis to account for states with memory. Using only general properties of $\$$, we prove an analog of the Weinberg soft theorems in quantum gravity and QED which imply that all $\$$-amplitudes are well-defined in the infrared. We comment on how one must generalize this framework to consider $\$$-amplitudes for theories with collinear divergences (e.g., massless QED and Yang-Mills theories).</description>

      <title>On fusing matrices associated with conformal boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of rational conformal field theories (RCFT) we look at the fusing matrices that arise when a topological defect is attached to a conformal boundary condition. We call such junctions open topological defects. One type of fusing matrices arises when two open defects fuse while another arises when an open defect passes through a boundary operator. We use the topological field theory approach to RCFTs based on Frobenius algebra objects in modular tensor categories to describe the general structure associated with such matrices and how to compute them from a given Frobenius algebra object and its representation theory. We illustrate the computational process on the rational free boson theories. Applications to boundary renormalisation group flows are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Higher-Matter and Landau-Ginzburg Theory of Higher-Group Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-matter is defined by higher-representation of a symmetry algebra, such as the $p$-form symmetries, higher-group symmetries or higher-categorical symmetries. In this paper, we focus on the cases of higher-group symmetries, which are formulated in terms of the strictification of weak higher-groups. We systematically investigate higher-matter charged under 2-group symmetries, defined by automorphism 2-representations. Furthermore, we construct a Lagrangian formulation of such higher-matter fields coupled to 2-group gauge fields in the path space of the spacetime manifold. We interpret such model as the Landau-Ginzburg theory for 2-group symmetries, and discuss the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 2-group symmetries under this framework. Examples of discrete and continuous 2-groups are discussed. Interestingly, we find that a non-split 2-group symmetry can admit an SSB to a split 2-group symmetry, where the Postnikov class is trivialized. We also briefly discuss the strictification of weak 3-groups, weak 3-group gauge fields and 3-representations in special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use hyperbolic tensor networks to construct a holographic map for black hole interiors that adds a notion of locality to the non-isometric codes proposed by Akers, Engelhardt, Harlow, Penington, and Vardhan. We use tools provided by these networks to study the relationship between non-isometries and quantum extremal surfaces behind the horizon. Furthermore, we introduce a limited notion of dynamics for these interior tensor networks based on the qudit models introduced by Akers et al., and study the evolution of quantum extremal surfaces in an evaporating black hole. We also find a tensor network description of a wormhole connecting the black hole interior to the radiation, providing a mechanism for interior states and operators to be encoded in the radiation after the Page time. As a particular case, we construct a tensor network realization of the backwards-forwards maps recently proposed to incorporate non-trivial effective dynamics in dynamical constructions of these non-isometric black hole codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the physical significance of torsion co-cycles in the cohomology of a projective Calabi-Yau three-fold for the (2,2) superconformal field theory (SCFT) associated to the non-linear sigma model with such a manifold as a target space. There are two independent torsion subgroups in the cohomology. While one is associated to an orbifold construction of the SCFT, the other encodes the possibility of turning on a topologically non-trivial flat gerbe for the NS-NS B-field. Inclusion of these data enriches mirror symmetry by providing a refinement of the familiar structures and points to a generalization of the duality symmetry, where the topology of the flat gerbe enters on the same footing as the topology of the underlying manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically simulate a non-Abelian lattice gauge theory in two spatial dimensions, with tensor networks (TN), up to intermediate sizes (&gt;30 matter sites) well beyond exact diagonalization. We focus on the SU(2) Yang-Mills model in Hamiltonian formulation, with dynamical matter and minimally truncated gauge field (hardcore gluon). Thanks to the TN sign-problem-free approach, we characterize the phase diagram of the model at zero and finite baryon number as a function of the quark bare mass and color charge. At intermediate system sizes, we detect a liquid phase of quark-pair bound-state quasiparticles (baryons), whose mass is finite towards the continuum limit. Interesting phenomena arise at the transition boundary where color-electric and color-magnetic terms are maximally frustrated: For low quark masses, we see traces of potential deconfinement, while for high masses, signatures of a possible topological order.</description>

      <title>Toward a physically motivated notion of Gaussian complexity geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general construction of a geometric notion of circuit complexity for Gaussian states (both bosonic and fermionic) in terms of Riemannian geometry. We lay out general conditions that a Riemannian metric function on the space of Gaussian states should satisfy in order for it to yield a physically reasonable measure of complexity. This general formalism can naturally accommodate modifications to complexity geometries that arise from cost functions that depend nontrivially on the instantaneous state and on the direction on circuit space at each point. We explore these modifications and, as a particular case, we show how to account for time-reversal symmetry breaking in measures of complexity, which is often natural from an experimental (and thermodynamical) perspective, but is absent in commonly studied complexity measures. This establishes a first step towards building a quantitative, geometric notion of complexity that faithfully mimics what is experienced as "easy" or "hard" to implement in a lab from a physically motivated point of view.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06994v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermodynamics of a heat-conducting ideal gas system. The study is based on i) the first law of thermodynamics from action formulation which expects heat-dependence of energy density and ii) the existence condition of a (local) Lorentz boost between an Eckart observer and a Landau-Lifshitz observer--a condition that extends the stability criterion of thermal equilibrium. The implications of these conditions include: i) Heat contributes to the energy density through the combination $q/n\Theta^2$ where $q$, $n$, and $\Theta$ represent heat, the number density, and the temperature, respectively. ii) The energy density has a unique minimum at $q=0$. iii) The temperature upper bound suppresses the heat dependence of the energy density inverse quadratically. This result explains why the expected heat dependence is difficult to observe in ordinary situation thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the first twenty moments of three convergent quartic bi-tracial 2-matrix ensembles in the large $N$ limit. These ensembles are toy models for Euclidean quantum gravity originally proposed by John Barrett and collaborators. A perturbative solution is found for the first twenty moments using the Schwinger-Dyson equations and properties of certain bi-colored unstable maps associated to the model. We then apply a result of Guionnet et al. to show that the perturbative and convergent solution coincide for a small neighbourhood of the coupling constants. For each model we compute an explicit expression for the free energy, critical points, and critical exponents in the large $N$ limit. In particular, the string susceptibility is found to be $\gamma =1/2$, hinting that the associated universality class of the model is the continuous random tree.</description>

      <title>Disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models: Integrability and a precursor of chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times, resembling that of quantum chaotic systems such as those with disorder or external kick terms. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix-valued holomorphic quantum modular forms are intricate objects that arise in successive refinements of the Volume Conjecture of knots and involve three holomorphic, asymptotic and arithmetic objects. It is expected that the algebraic properties of these objects can be deduced from the algebraic properties of descendant state integrals, and we illustrate this for the case of the $(-2,3,7)$-pretzel knot.</description>

      <title>Loop Special Relativity: Kaluza-Klein area metric as a line element for stringy events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let a physical event constitute a simple loop in spacetime. This in turn calls for a generalized loop line element (= distance$^2$ between two neighboring loops) capable of restoring, at the shrinking loop limit, the special relativistic line element (= distance$^2$ between the two neighboring centers-of-mass, respectively). Sticking at first stage to a flat Euclidean/Minkowski background, one is led to such a preliminary loop line element, where the role of coordinates is played by the oriented cross-sections projected by the loop event. Such cross-sections are generically center-of-mass independent, unless (owing to a topological term) the loop events are intrinsically wrapped around a Kaluza-Klein like compact fifth dimension. Serendipitously, it is the Kaluza-Klein ingredient which, on top of its traditional assignments, is shown to govern the extension of Pythagoras theorem to loop space. Associated with $M_4 \otimes S_1$ is then a 10-dim loop spacetime metric, whose 4-dim center-of-mass core term is supplemented by a 6-dim Maxwell-style fine structure. The imperative inclusion of a positive (say Nambu-Goto) string tension within the framework of Loop Special Relativity is fingerprinted by a low periodicity breathing mode. Nash global isometric embedding is conjectured to play a major role in the construction of Loop General Relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feynman integrals can be expanded asymptotically with respect to some small parameters at the integrand level, a technique known as the expansion by regions. A naive expansion by regions may break down due to divergences not regulated by the spacetime dimension, exemplified by the rapidity divergences. A criterion to identify unregulated divergences is provided in this article. The analysis is conducted using both parametric and Mellin-Barnes representations, leading to a consistent conclusion. Based on this analysis, it is proven that the presence of unregulated divergences implies the degeneracies of regions, which may help to explain phenomena like the collinear anomaly.</description>
