      <title>Approximating the order 2 quantum Wasserstein distance using the moment-SOS hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal transport theory has recently been extended to quantum settings, where the density matrices generalize the probability measures. In this paper, we study the computational aspects of the order 2 quantum Wasserstein distance, formulating it as an infinite dimensional linear program in the space of positive Borel measures supported on products of two unit spheres. This formulation is recognized as an instance of the Generalized Moment Problem, which enables us to use the moment-sums of squares hierarchy to provide a sequence of lower bounds converging to the distance. We illustrate our approach with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Instance Space Analysis for the Quadratic Assignment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any optimisation problem where diverse algorithmic approaches are available, the task of predicting algorithm performance and selecting the algorithm most likely to perform well on a given instance holds great practical interest. However, if our test instances do not adequately represent the potential problem space, we may be misled about the strengths and weaknesses of an algorithm. In this paper we consider algorithm prediction and selection for the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). We identify and eliminate superficial differences between QAP instances which do not affect problem difficulty and propose several new features for quantifying the characteristics of a particular instance. We then apply Instance Space Analysis to compare the performance of evolutionary and ant colony-based algorithms. Using this analysis, we identify limitations of the existing instance libraries and generators which obscure the true performance profile of these algorithms. Finally, we propose new instance classes which expand the instance space and support new insights into the properties of the problem and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Fast entropy-regularized SDP relaxations for permutation synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce fast randomized algorithms for solving semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations of the partial permutation synchronization (PPS) problem, a core task in multi-image matching with significant relevance to 3D reconstruction. Our methods build on recent advances in entropy-regularized semidefinite programming and are tailored to the unique structure of PPS, in which the unknowns are partial permutation matrices aligning sparse and noisy pairwise correspondences across images. We prove that entropy regularization resolves optimizer non-uniqueness in standard relaxations, and we develop a randomized solver with nearly optimal scaling in the number of observed correspondences. We also develop several rounding procedures for recovering combinatorial solutions from the implicitly represented primal solution variable, maintaining cycle consistency if desired without harming computational scaling. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets in terms of speed and accuracy. Our results highlight PPS as a paradigmatic setting in which entropy-regularized SDP admits both theoretical and practical advantages over traditional low-rank or spectral techniques.</description>

      <title>Speed-Aware Network Design: A Parametric Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network design problems have been studied from the 1950s, as they can be used in a wide range of real-world applications, e.g., design of communication and transportation networks. In classical network design problems, the objective is to minimize the cost of routing the demand flow through a graph. In this paper, we introduce a generalized version of such a problem, where the objective is to tradeoff routing costs and delivery speed; we introduce the concept of speed-coverage, which is defined as the number of unique items that can be sent to destinations in less than 1-day. Speed-coverage is a function of both the network design and the inventory stored at origin nodes, e.g., an item can be delivered in 1-day if it is in-stock at an origin that can reach a destination within 24 hours. Modeling inventory is inherently complex, since inventory coverage is described by an integer function with a large number of points (exponential to the number of origin sites), each one to be evaluated using historical data. To bypass this complexity, we first leverage a parametric optimization approach, which converts the non-linear joint routing and speed-coverage optimization problem into an equivalent mixed-integer linear program. Then, we propose a sampling strategy to avoid evaluating all the points of the speed-coverage function. The proposed method is evaluated on a series of numerical tests with representative scenarios and network sizes. We show that when considering the routing costs and monetary gains resulting from speed-coverage, our approach outperforms the baseline by 8.36% on average.</description>

      <title>CLARSTA: A random subspace trust-region algorithm for convex-constrained derivative-free optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a random subspace trust-region algorithm for general convex-constrained derivative-free optimization (DFO) problems. Similar to previous random subspace DFO methods, the convergence of our algorithm requires a certain accuracy of models and a certain quality of subspaces. For model accuracy, we define a new class of models that is only required to provide reasonable accuracy on the projection of the constraint set onto the subspace. We provide a new geometry measure to make these models easy to analyze, construct, and manage. For subspace quality, we use the concentration on the Grassmann manifold to provide a method to sample subspaces that preserve the first-order criticality measure by a certain percentage with a certain probability lower bound. Based on all these new theoretical results, we present an almost-sure global convergence and a worst-case complexity analysis of our algorithm. Numerical experiments on problems with dimensions up to 10000 demonstrate the reliable performance of our algorithm in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Complete Loss Landscape Analysis of Regularized Deep Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its wide range of applications across various domains, the optimization foundations of deep matrix factorization (DMF) remain largely open. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive study of the loss landscape of the regularized DMF problem. Toward this goal, we first provide a closed-form expression of all critical points. Building on this, we establish precise conditions under which a critical point is a local minimizer, a global minimizer, a strict saddle point, or a non-strict saddle point. Leveraging these results, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition under which each critical point is either a local minimizer or a strict saddle point. This provides insights into why gradient-based methods almost always converge to a local minimizer of the regularized DMF problem. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to visualize its loss landscape under different settings to support our theory.</description>

      <title>A Decomposition Method for Finite-Time Stabilization of Bilinear Systems with Applications to Parabolic and Hyperbolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of finite-time stabilization for a class of bilinear system. We propose a decomposition-based approach in which the nominal system is split into two subsystems, one of which is inherently finite-time stable without control. This allows the stabilization analysis to focus solely on the remaining subsystem. To ensure the well-posedness of the closed-loop system, we establish sufficient conditions on the system and control operators. The stabilization results are then derived using a suitable Lyapunov function and an observation condition. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through examples involving both parabolic and hyperbolic infinite-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>A Zeroth-Order Extra-Gradient Method For Black-Box Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-analytical objectives and constraints often arise in control systems, particularly in problems with complex dynamics, which are challenging yet lack efficient solution methods. In this work, we consider general constrained optimization problems involving black-box objectives and constraints. To solve it, we reformulate it as a min-max problem and propose a zeroth-order extra gradient (ZOEG) algorithm that combines the extra gradient method with a feedback-based stochastic zeroth-order gradient estimator. Then, we apply another coordinate gradient estimator to design the zeroth-order coordinate extra gradient algorithm (ZOCEG) to further improve efficiency. The theoretical analysis shows that ZOEG can achieve the best-known oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(d\epsilon^{-2})$ to get an $\epsilon$-optimal solution ($d$ is the dimension of decision space), and ZOCEG can improve it to $\mathcal{O}(d\epsilon^{-1})$. Furthermore, we develop a variant of ZOCEG, which applies block coordinate updates to enhance the efficiency of single-step gradient estimation. Finally, numerical experiments on a load tracking problem validate our theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>First-order methods for stochastic and finite-sum convex optimization with deterministic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of stochastic and finite-sum convex optimization problems with deterministic constraints. Existing methods typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-$expectedly\ feasible\ stochastic\ optimal$ solution, in which the expected constraint violation and expected optimality gap are both within a prescribed tolerance $\epsilon$. However, in many practical applications, constraints must be nearly satisfied with certainty, rendering such solutions potentially unsuitable due to the risk of substantial violations. To address this issue, we propose stochastic first-order methods for finding an $\epsilon$-$surely\ feasible\ stochastic\ optimal$ ($\epsilon$-SFSO) solution, where the constraint violation is deterministically bounded by $\epsilon$ and the expected optimality gap is at most $\epsilon$. Our methods apply an accelerated stochastic gradient (ASG) scheme or a modified variance-reduced ASG scheme $only\ once$ to a sequence of quadratic penalty subproblems with appropriately chosen penalty parameters. We establish first-order oracle complexity bounds for the proposed methods in computing an $\epsilon$-SFSO solution. As a byproduct, we also derive first-order oracle complexity results for sample average approximation method in computing an $\epsilon$-SFSO solution of the stochastic optimization problem using our proposed methods to solve the sample average problem.</description>

      <title>ADDQ: Adaptive Distributional Double Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bias problems in the estimation of $Q$-values are a well-known obstacle that slows down convergence of $Q$-learning and actor-critic methods. One of the reasons of the success of modern RL algorithms is partially a direct or indirect overestimation reduction mechanism. We propose an easy to implement method built on top of distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to deal with the overestimation in a locally adaptive way. Our framework is simple to implement, existing distributional algorithms can be improved with a few lines of code. We provide theoretical evidence and use double $Q$-learning to show how to include locally adaptive overestimation control in existing algorithms. Experiments are provided for tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo environments.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Modeling of Biological Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex regulatory dynamics of a biological network can be succinctly captured using discrete logic models. Given even sparse time-course data from the system of interest, previous work has shown that global optimization schemes are suitable for proposing logic models that explain the data and make predictions about how the system will behave under varying conditions. Considering the large scale of the parameter search spaces associated with these regulatory systems, performance optimizations on the level of both hardware and software are necessary for making this a practical tool for in silico pharmaceutical research. We show here how the implementation of these global optimization algorithms in a GPU-computing environment can accelerate the solution of these parameter search problems considerably. We carry out parameter searches on two model biological regulatory systems that represent almost an order of magnitude scale-up in complexity, and we find the gains in efficiency from GPU to be a 33%-43% improvement compared to multi-thread CPU implementations and a 33%-1866% increase compared to CPU in serial. These improvements make global optimization of logic model identification a far more attractive and feasible method for in silico hypothesis generation and design of experiments.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic convexity of evolution equations and application to inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review some results on the logarithmic convexity for evolution equations, a well-known method in inverse and ill-posed problems. We start with the classical case of self-adjoint operators. Then, we analyze the case of analytic semigroups. In this general case, we give an explicit estimate, which will be used to study inverse problems for initial data recovery. We illustrate our abstract result by an application to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equations. We discuss both analytic and non-analytic semigroups. We conclude with recent results for the time-fractional evolution equations with the Caputo derivative of order $0&lt;\alpha &lt;1$. We start with symmetric evolution equations. Then, we show that the results extend to the non-symmetric case for diffusion equations, provided that a gradient vector field generates the drift coefficient. Finally, some open problems will be mentioned.</description>

      <title>On gradient descent-ascent flows in metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient descent-ascent (GDA) flows play a central role in finding saddle points of bivariate functionals, with applications in optimization, game theory, and robust control. While they are well-understood in Hilbert and Banach spaces via maximal monotone operator theory, their extension to general metric spaces, particularly Wasserstein spaces, has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory of GDA flows on the product of two complete metric spaces, formulating them as solutions to a system of evolution variational inequalities (EVIs) driven by a proper, closed functional $\phi$. Under mild convex-concave and regularity assumptions on $\phi$, we prove the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the flows via a novel minimizing-maximizing movement scheme and a minimax theorem on metric spaces. We establish a $\lambda$-contraction property, derive a quantitative error estimate for the discrete scheme, and demonstrate regularization effects analogous to classical gradient flows. Moreover, we obtain an exponential decay bound for the Nikaid\^o--Isoda duality gap along the flow. Focusing on Wasserstein spaces over Hilbert spaces, we show the global existence in time and the exponential convergence of the Wasserstein GDA flow to the unique saddle point for strongly convex-concave functionals. Our framework unifies and extends existing analyses, offering a metric-geometric perspective on GDA dynamics in nonlinear and non-smooth settings.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares for Robust Subspace Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust subspace estimation is fundamental to many machine learning and data analysis tasks. Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) is an elegant and empirically effective approach to this problem, yet its theoretical properties remain poorly understood. This paper establishes that, under deterministic conditions, a variant of IRLS with dynamic smoothing regularization converges linearly to the underlying subspace from any initialization. We extend these guarantees to affine subspace estimation, a setting that lacks prior recovery theory. Additionally, we illustrate the practical benefits of IRLS through an application to low-dimensional neural network training. Our results provide the first global convergence guarantees for IRLS in robust subspace recovery and, more broadly, for nonconvex IRLS on a Riemannian manifold.</description>

      <title>Conformal Rigidity and Spectral Embeddings of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of conformally rigid graphs. Graphs are conformally rigid if introducing edge weights cannot increase (decrease) the second (last) eigenvalue of the Graph Laplacian. Edge-transitive graphs and distance-regular graphs are known to be conformally rigid. We establish new results using the connection between conformal rigidity and edge-isometric spectral embeddings of the graph. All $1$-walk regular graphs are conformally rigid, a consequence of a stronger property of their embeddings. Using symmetries of the graph, we establish two related characterizations of when a vertex-transitive graph is conformally rigid. This provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a Cayley graph on an abelian group to be conformally rigid. As an application we exhibit an infinite family of conformally rigid circulants. Our symmetry technique can be interpreted in the language of semidefinite programming which provides another criterion for conformal rigidity in terms of edge orbits. The paper also describes a number of explicit conformally rigid graphs whose conformal rigidity is not yet explained by the existing theory.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of effective UCB-based routing in skill-based queues on real-world data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is about optimally controlling skill-based queueing systems such as data centers, cloud computing networks, and service systems. By means of a case study using a real-world data set, we investigate the practical implementation of a recently developed reinforcement learning algorithm for optimal customer routing. Our experiments show that the algorithm efficiently learns and adapts to changing environments and outperforms static benchmark policies, indicating its potential for live implementation. We also augment the real-world applicability of this algorithm by introducing a new heuristic routing rule to reduce delays. Moreover, we show that the algorithm can optimize for multiple objectives: next to payoff maximization, secondary objectives such as server load fairness and customer waiting time reduction can be incorporated. Tuning parameters are used for balancing inherent performance trade--offs. Lastly, we investigate the sensitivity to estimation errors and parameter tuning, providing valuable insights for implementing adaptive routing algorithms in complex real-world queueing systems.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of critical points on real algebraic sets and applications to optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $F \in \R[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ and the zero set $V=\zero(\mathcal{P},\R^n)$, where $\mathcal{P}:=\{P_1,\ldots,P_s\} \subset \R[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ is a finite set of polynomials. We investigate existence of critical points of $F$ on an infinitesimal perturbation $V_{\xi} = \zero(\{P_1-\xi_1.\ldots,P_s-\xi_s\},\R^n)$. Our motivation is to understand the limiting behavior of central paths in polynomial optimization, which is an important problem in the theory of interior point methods for polynomial optimization. We establish different sets of conditions that ensure existence, finiteness, boundedness, and non-degeneracy of critical points of $F$ on $V_{\xi}$, respectively. These lead to new conditions for the existence, convergence, and smoothness of central paths of polynomial optimization and its extension to non-linear optimization problems involving definable sets and functions in an o-minimal structure. In particular, for nonlinear programs defined by real globally analytic functions, our extension provides a stronger form of the convergence result obtained by Drummond and Peterzil.</description>

      <title>A High-Dimensional Statistical Theory for Convex and Nonconvex Matrix Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of matrix sensing, or trace regression, is a problem wherein one wishes to estimate a low-rank matrix from linear measurements perturbed with noise. A number of existing works have studied both convex and nonconvex approaches to this problem, establishing minimax error rates when the number of measurements is sufficiently large relative to the rank and dimension of the low-rank matrix, though a precise comparison of these procedures still remains unexplored. In this work we provide a high-dimensional statistical analysis for symmetric low-rank matrix sensing observed under Gaussian measurements and noise. Our main result describes a novel phenomenon: in this statistical model and in an appropriate asymptotic regime, the behavior of any local minimum of the nonconvex factorized approach (with known rank) is approximately equivalent to that of the matrix hard-thresholding of a corresponding matrix denoising problem, and the behavior of the convex nuclear-norm regularized least squares approach is approximately equivalent to that of matrix soft-thresholding of the same matrix denoising problem. Here "approximately equivalent" is understood in the sense of concentration of Lipchitz functions. As a consequence, the nonconvex procedure uniformly dominates the convex approach in mean squared error. Our arguments are based on a matrix operator generalization of the Convex Gaussian Min-Max Theorem (CGMT) together with studying the interplay between local minima of the convex and nonconvex formulations and their "debiased" counterparts, and several of these results may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Joint Order Selection, Allocation, Batching and Picking for Large Scale Warehouses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Order picking is the single most cost-intensive activity in picker-to-parts warehouses, and as such has garnered large interest from the scientific community which led to multiple problem formulations and a plethora of algorithms published. Unfortunately, most of them are not applicable at the scale of really large warehouses like those operated by Zalando, a leading European online fashion retailer.
  Based on our experience in operating Zalando's batching system, we propose a novel batching problem formulation for mixed-shelves, large scale warehouses with zoning. It brings the selection of orders to be batched into the scope of the problem, making it more realistic while at the same time increasing the optimization potential.
  We present two baseline algorithms and compare them on a set of generated instances. Our results show that first, even a basic greedy algorithm requires significant runtime to solve real-world instances and second, including order selection in the studied problem shows large potential for improved solution quality.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-order Gradient and Quasi-Newton Methods for Nonsmooth Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the minimization of a Lipschitz continuous and expectation-valued function defined as $f(\mathbf{x}) \triangleq \mathbb{E}[{\tilde f}(\mathbf{x}, \boldsymbol{\xi})]$, over a closed and convex set. Our focus lies on obtaining both asymptotics as well as rate and complexity guarantees for computing an approximate stationary point (in a Clarke sense) via zeroth-order schemes. We adopt a smoothing-based approach reliant on minimizing $f_{\eta}$ where $f_{\eta}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{u}}[f(\mathbf{x}+\eta \mathbf{u})]$, $\mathbf{u}$ is a random variable defined on a unit sphere, and $\eta &gt; 0$. It has been observed that a stationary point of the $\eta$-smoothed problem is a $2\eta$-stationary point for the original problem in the Clarke sense. In such a setting, we develop two sets of schemes with promising empirical behavior. (I) We develop a smoothing-enabled variance-reduced zeroth-order gradient framework (VRG-ZO) and make two sets of contributions for the sequence generated by the proposed zeroth-order gradient scheme. (a) The residual function of the smoothed problem tends to zero almost surely along the generated sequence, allowing for making guarantees for $\eta$-Clarke stationary solutions of the original problem; (b) To compute an $\mathbf{x}$ that ensures that the expected norm of the residual of the $\eta$-smoothed problem is within $\epsilon$ requires no greater than $O(\eta^{-1} \epsilon^{-2})$ projection steps and $ O\left(\eta^{-2} \epsilon^{-4}\right)$ function evaluations. (II) Our second scheme is a zeroth-order stochastic quasi-Newton scheme (VRSQN-ZO) reliant on a combination of randomized and Moreau smoothing; the corresponding iteration and sample complexities for this scheme are $ O\left(\eta^{-5}\epsilon^{-2}\right)$ and $ O\left(\eta^{-7}\epsilon^{-4}\right)$, respectively</description>

      <title>Duality between controllability and observability for target control and estimation in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Output controllability and functional observability are properties that enable, respectively, the control and estimation of part of the state vector. These notions are of utmost importance in applications to high-dimensional systems, such as large-scale networks, in which only a target subset of variables (nodes) is sought to be controlled or estimated. Although the duality between full-state controllability and observability is well established, the characterization of the duality between their generalized counterparts remains an outstanding problem. Here, we establish both the weak and the strong duality between output controllability and functional observability. Specifically, we show that functional observability of a system implies output controllability of a dual system (weak duality), and that under a certain geometric condition the converse holds (strong duality). As an application of the strong duality, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for target control via static feedback. This allow us to establish a separation principle between the design of target controllers and the design of functional observers in closed-loop systems. These results generalize the classical duality and separation principles in modern control theory.</description>

      <title>On the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus tests for functional observability and output controllability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional observability and output controllability are properties that establish the conditions for the partial estimation and partial control of the system state, respectively. In the special case of full-state observability and controllability, the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) tests provide conditions for the properties to hold based on the system eigenspace. Generalizations of the PBH test have been recently proposed for functional observability and output controllability, but thus far have only been proven valid for diagonalizable systems. Here, we rigorously establish the generalized PBH test for functional observability, extending its validity to a broader class of systems using Jordan decomposition. Likewise, we determine the class of systems under which the generalized PBH test is sufficient and necessary for output controllability. These results have immediate implications for observer and controller design, pole assignment, and optimal placement of sensors and drivers.</description>

      <title>Contextual Optimization under Covariate Shift: A Robust Approach by Intersecting Wasserstein Balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contextual optimization, a decision-maker leverages contextual information, often referred to as covariates, to better resolve uncertainty and make informed decisions. In this paper, we examine the challenges of contextual decision-making under covariate shift, a phenomenon where the distribution of covariates differs between the training and test environments. Such shifts can lead to inaccurate upstream estimations for test covariates that lie far from the training data, ultimately resulting in suboptimal downstream decisions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Intersection Wasserstein-balls DRO (IW-DRO), which integrates multiple estimation methods into the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework. At the core of our approach is an innovative ambiguity set defined as the intersection of two Wasserstein balls, with their centers constructed using appropriate nonparametric and parametric estimators. On the computational side, we reformulate the IW-DRO problem as a tractable convex program and develop an approximate algorithm tailored for large-scale problems to enhance computational efficiency. From a theoretical perspective, we demonstrate that IW-DRO achieves superior performance compared to single Wasserstein-ball DRO models. We further establish performance guarantees by analyzing the coverage of the intersection ambiguity set and the measure concentration of both estimators under the Wasserstein distance. Notably, we derive a finite-sample concentration result for the Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimator under covariate shift. The proposed IW-DRO framework offers practical value for decision-makers operating in uncertain environments affected by covariate shifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove existence of a value for two-player zero-sum stopper vs. singular-controller games on finite-time horizon, when the underlying dynamics is one-dimensional, diffusive and bound to evolve in $[0,\infty)$. We show that the value is the maximal solution of a variational inequality with both obstacle and gradient constraint and satisfying a Dirichlet boundary condition at $[0,T)\times\{0\}$. Moreover, we obtain an optimal strategy for the stopper. In order to achieve our goals, we rely on new probabilistic methods, yielding gradient bounds and equi-continuity for the solutions of penalised partial differential equations that approximate the variational inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate high-dimensional non-convex optimization, focusing on the algorithmic difficulties posed by saddle points and regions of flat curvature. We develop a unified framework that integrates stochastic perturbations, curvature-adaptive learning rates, and randomized subspace descent to improve escape efficiency and scalability. Our theoretical analysis shows that gradient flow almost surely avoids strict saddles, with escape likelihood increasing exponentially in the ambient dimension. For noise-perturbed gradient descent, we derive explicit escape-time bounds that depend on curvature and noise magnitude. Adaptive step sizes further reduce escape time by adjusting to local gradient variance. To improve scalability, we establish global convergence rates for randomized subspace descent using projections of logarithmic dimension that preserve descent direction with high probability. Numerical experiments on nonlinear and constrained objectives validate these results and demonstrate practical robustness in large-scale settings.</description>

      <title>Two-echelon Electric Vehicle Routing Problem in Parcel Delivery: A Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-echelon parcel delivery systems using electric vehicles (EVs) are crucial for managing urban logistics complexity and promoting sustainability. In multi-echelon systems, particularly within two-stage systems, larger vehicles transport parcels from a central depot to satellite hubs, where smaller EVs pick up the parcels and carry out last-mile deliveries. This system could increase efficiency, reduce emissions, and improve service reliability. The two-echelon electric vehicle routing problem (2E-EVRP), an extension of the traditional two-echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP), addresses EV-specific challenges such as battery constraints and recharging stations to tackle environmental impacts, urban congestion, and e-commerce demands. While effectively reducing costs, energy use, and emissions, the 2E-EVRP faces modeling challenges due to multi-echelon structures, EV limitations, and recharging station selection. This paper systematically reviews 2E-EVRP literature, analyzing key studies. It proposes a classification scheme to categorize the papers based on the problem variants, objectives, constraints, and solution methods. It identifies gaps such as delivery tardiness, environmental trade-offs, multi-objective optimization, multiple depots, split deliveries, and time-dependent travel conditions. Future research directions include aligning models with urban policies, integrating parcel lockers, enabling same-day delivery, and incorporating advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles. Methodological advancements suggest using machine learning, reinforcement learning, and simulation-based approaches to enhance dynamic routing and real-time decision-making. These directions aim to expand the 2E-EVRP applicability, addressing theoretical and practical challenges in sustainable urban logistics for future works.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Periodic Monotonicity Preserving Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three nested classes of discrete-time linear time-invariant systems, which differ by the set of periodic signals that they leave invariant, are studied. The first class preserves the property of periodic monotonicity (period-wise unimodality). The second class is invariant to signals with at most two sign changes per period, and the third class results from the second by additionally requiring that periodic signals with zero sign-changes are mapped to the same kind. Tractable characterizations for each system class are derived by the use and extension of total positivity theory via geometric interpretations. Central to our results is the characterization of sequentially convex contours. Our characterizations also extend to the loop gain of Lur'e feedback systems as the considered signals sets are invariant under common static non-linearities, e.g., ideal relay, saturation, sigmoid function, quantizer, etc. In particular, our developments aim to form a base for signal-based fixed-point theorems towards the prediction of self-sustained oscillations. Our examples on relay feedback systems indicate how periodic monotonicity preservation give rise to useful insights towards this goal.</description>

      <title>Parallel Polyhedral Projection Method for the Convex Feasibility Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the Parallel Polyhedral Projection Method (3PM) and the Approximate Parallel Polyhedral Projection Method (A3PM) for finding a point in the intersection of finitely many closed convex sets. Each iteration has two phases: parallel projections onto the target sets (exact in 3PM, approximate in A3PM), followed by an exact or approximate projection onto a polyhedron defined by supporting half-spaces. These strategies appear novel, as existing methods largely focus on parallel schemes like Cimmino's method. Numerical experiments demonstrate that A3PM often outperforms both classical and recent projection-based methods when the number of sets is greater than two. Theoretically, we establish global convergence for both 3PM and A3PM without regularity assumptions. Under a Slater condition or error bound, we prove linear convergence, even with inexact projections. Additionally, we show that 3PM achieves superlinear convergence under suitable geometric assumptions.</description>

      <title>A Parallelizable Quaternion Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05211v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) is a celebrated tool for tensor data analysis. The sequential HOSVD was recently generalized to the quaternion domain, while a naive quaternion extension of the classical HOSVD% by De Lathauwer et al., which can be excecuted in parallel, incurs issues. To leverage the power of parallel computing, this work introduces a two-sided quaternion HOSVD (TS-QHOSVD) that can be parallelized on two processors. It is proved that TS-QHOSVD (i) preserves the HOSVD ordering property, (ii) inherits the orthogonality property at the first and the last modes, and (iii) satisfies the weak orthogonality at all modes. The truncated TS-QHOSVD is then developed, with its error bound being established. We apply the proposed model on color video denoising as well as scientific data compression arising from 3D Navier-Stokes equation and Lorentz system to demonstrate its efficacy.</description>

Abstract: This article addresses the nonadaptive and robust output regulation problem of the general nonlinear output feedback system with error output. The global robust output regulation problem for a class of general output feedback nonlinear systems with an uncertain exosystem and high relative degree can be tackled by constructing a linear generic internal model, provided that a continuous nonlinear mapping exists. Leveraging the proposed nonadaptive framework facilitates the conversion of the nonlinear robust output regulation problem into a robust nonadaptive stabilization formulation for the augmented system endowed with Input-to-State Stable dynamics. This approach removes the need for constructing a specific Lyapunov function with positive semi-definite derivatives and avoids the common assumption of linear parameterization of the nonlinear system. The nonadaptive approach is extended by incorporating the nonparametric learning framework to ensure the feasibility of the nonlinear mapping, which can be tackled using a data-driven method. Moreover, the introduced nonparametric learning framework allows the controlled system to learn the dynamics of the steady-state input behaviour from the signal generated from the internal model with the output error as the feedback. As a result, the nonadaptive/nonparametric approach can be advantageous to guarantee the convergence of the estimation and tracking error even when the underlying controlled system dynamics are complex or poorly understood. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated for a benchmark example: a controlled duffing system and two practical examples: a continuously stirred tank reactor and a continuous bioreactor.</description>

      <title>Active Learning of Deep Neural Networks via Gradient-Free Cutting Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02145v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active learning methods aim to improve sample complexity in machine learning. In this work, we investigate an active learning scheme via a novel gradient-free cutting-plane training method for ReLU networks of arbitrary depth and develop a convergence theory. We demonstrate, for the first time, that cutting-plane algorithms, traditionally used in linear models, can be extended to deep neural networks despite their nonconvexity and nonlinear decision boundaries. Moreover, this training method induces the first deep active learning scheme known to achieve convergence guarantees, revealing a geometric contraction rate of the feasible set. We exemplify the effectiveness of our proposed active learning method against popular deep active learning baselines via both synthetic data experiments and sentimental classification task on real datasets.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Online Optimization for Vehicle-Home-Grid Integration including Household Load Prediction and Battery Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the economic impact of vehicle-home-grid integration, by proposing an online energy management algorithm that optimizes energy flows between an electric vehicle (EV), a household, and the electrical grid. The algorithm leverages vehicle-to-home (V2H) for self-consumption and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) for energy trading, adapting to real-time conditions through a hybrid long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for accurate household load prediction, alongside a comprehensive nonlinear battery degradation model accounting for both cycle and calendar aging. Simulation results reveal significant economic advantages: compared to smart unidirectional charging, the proposed method yields an annual economic benefit of up to EUR 3046.81, despite a modest 1.96% increase in battery degradation. Even under unfavorable market conditions, where V2G energy selling generates no revenue, V2H alone ensures yearly savings of EUR 425.48. A systematic sensitivity analysis investigates how variations in battery capacity, household load, and price ratios affect economic outcomes, confirming the consistent benefits of bidirectional energy exchange. These findings highlight the potential of EVs as active energy nodes, enabling sustainable energy management and cost-effective battery usage in real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Class Stackelberg Games for the Co-Design of Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a co-design problem, encompassing simultaneous design of system infrastructure and control, through a game-theoretical framework. To this end, we propose the co-design problem as a two-layer hierarchical strategic interaction. At the upper layer, a leader (or multiple leaders) determines system design parameters, while at the lower layer, a follower (or multiple followers) optimizes the control strategy. To capture this hierarchy, we propose four novel classes of Stackelberg games that integrate diverse strategic behaviors, including combinations of cooperative and non-cooperative interactions across two different layers. Notably, the leaders' interactions are represented using a normal-form game, whereas the followers' interactions are modeled by different games (dynamic games in discrete time). These distinct game structures result in a Stackelberg game that accommodates different game types per layer, and/or supports heterogeneous strategic behaviors involving cooperation and non-cooperation simultaneously. Learning algorithms using the best-response dynamics are used to solve the game problems when considering a discrete strategic space for the leaders. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through an application to the co-design of the Barcelona drinking water network.</description>

      <title>Vertex addition to a ball graph with application to reliability and area coverage in autonomous swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19197</link>

Abstract: A unit ball graph consists of a set of vertices, labeled by points in Euclidean space, and edges joining all pairs of points within distance $1$. These geometric graphs are used to model a variety of spatial networks, including communication networks between agents in an autonomous swarm. In such an application, vertices and/or edges of the graph may not be perfectly reliable; an agent may experience failure or a communication link rendered inoperable. With the goal of designing robust swarm formations, or unit ball graphs with high reliability (probability of connectedness), in a preliminary conference paper we provided an algorithm with cubic time complexity to determine all possible changes to a unit ball graph by repositioning a single vertex. Using this algorithm and Monte Carlo simulations, one obtains an efficient method to modify a unit ball graph by moving a single vertex to a location which maximizes the reliability. Another important consideration in many swarm missions is area coverage, yet highly reliable ball graphs often contain clusters of vertices. Here, we generalize our previous algorithm to improve area coverage as well as reliability. Our algorithm determines a location to add or move a vertex within a unit ball graph which maximizes the reliability, under the constraint that no other vertices of the graph be within some fixed distance. We compare this method of obtaining graphs with high reliability and evenly distributed area coverage to another method which uses a modified Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for ball graphs.</description>
