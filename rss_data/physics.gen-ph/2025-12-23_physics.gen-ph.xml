      <title>Magnetic flux imaging in a 3D superconductor integrated circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on imaging magnetic flux distributions in a multilayered superconductor integrated circuit which emerge during magnetization and after field cooling of the circuit in the DC magnetic field. The obtained complicated field maps expose the flux propagation across the patterned superconducting ground planes sandwiching layers with Josephson junction-based logic cells, fine wire grid around the functional units, and multiple superconducting fill structures located in different inner layers. The observed intricate flux distributions are explained by specific patterns of Meissner screening currents and superconducting critical currents in different mutually interacting parts of the integrated circuit. Our results provide important insights into possible ways of improving the protection of superconductor integrated circuits from magnetic fields and their resilience against flux trapping.</description>

      <title>The Jacobi's principle of stationary full action and its consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to extend the applicability of the stationarity principle of the full Jacobi action to non-conservative natural systems and to derive equations of motion corresponding to this extended principle. To this end, in addition to the well-known variation of the Jacobi action with respect to coordinates, we propose independently variating time. Small variations in coordinates and time depend on the point on the true trajectory with the usual boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Dynamics and Local Entropy Balance on Causal Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that spacetime dynamics can be organized by a Planck-scale bookkeeping rule, applied per modular $2 \pi$ interval, that balances the geometric entropy increment $\delta A/4G$ against a reversible modular-energy flow $\delta \langle K\rangle$ and an irreversible Landauer-Bennett cost $\ln 2 \delta N_c$, where $K$ is the (dimensionless) modular Hamiltonian of the chosen region defined relative to the chosen reference state, generating entanglement flow across the local screen and $N_c$ counts logically irreversible classical record updates (registration strokes) on that screen. This "information-geometry ledger" is consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking area law, and -- when enforced on small causal screens under the standard entanglement-equilibrium assumptions -- recovers the full nonlinear Einstein equation. In FLRW cosmology, the same bookkeeping motivates a two-component vacuum sector $\rho_{vac} = \rho_{\Lambda} + 3 \varepsilon H^2 / 8 \pi G$ when a constant inefficiency parameter epsilon is assumed.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and Gravitational transformations in Electrochemistry and NMR spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.09350v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A relativistic transformation of the electrode potential has been derived to account for time dilation effects in electrode processes. This newly formulated Lorentz transformation is interpreted through the generation of spin-2 boson gravitons, originating from the fusion of spin-1 boson virtual photons, which subsequently escape into higher dimensions. Gravitational transformations of the electrode potential have also been derived, explaining the observed decrease in cell potential under stronger gravitational fields. The reduction in electrode potential near a gravitational source is attributed to a greater flux of gravitons escaping into higher dimensions in stronger gravitational fields compared to weaker ones. Similarly, the potential energy associated with the spin of magnetically active nuclei in an applied magnetic field, as observed in NMR spectroscopy, is shown to be Lorentz variant. This provides a mathematical demonstration that the Hamiltonian describing the energy of such nuclei is also Lorentz variant. The relativistic and gravitational transformations of both the electrode potential and the spin-related potential energy in magnetic fields are shown to be analogous.</description>

      <title>Finite-time gradient blow-up and shock formation in Israel-Stewart theory: Bulk, shear, and diffusion regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first demonstration of finite-time gradient blow-ups in Israel-Stewart (IS) theories with 1+1D plane symmetry, mathematically showing the existence of smooth initial data that can evolve into shocks across three regimes: pure bulk viscosity, shear viscosity, and diffusion. Through numerical simulations of bulk-viscous fluids, we verify that these shocks satisfy Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, exhibit characteristic velocity crossing (Mach number obeys $\mathcal{M}_u &gt; 1 &gt; \mathcal{M}_d$), and maintain thermodynamic consistency, required for physical shocks. Our results reveal a crucial early-time dynamical phase -- previously unexplored in steady-state analyses -- where nonlinear effects dominate viscous damping, resolving the apparent impossibility of IS-type theories predicting shock formation. While restricted to simplified 1+1D systems with separate viscous effects, this work establishes foundational insights for shock formation in relativistic viscous hydrodynamics, highlighting critical challenges for extending to 3+1D systems or to a full IS theory where multiple nonlinear modes interact. The findings emphasize that both initial data structure and numerical methodology require careful consideration when studying shocks in relativistic viscous fluids.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Brillouin's negentropy law of information and Landauer's law on data erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The link between information and energy introduces the observer and their knowledge into the understanding of a fundamental quantity of physics. Two approaches compete to account for this link, Brillouin's negentropy law of information and Landauer's law on data erasure, which are often confused. The first, based on the Clausius' inequality and Shannon's mathematical results is very robust, while the second, based on the simple idea that information needs a material embodiment (data-bits) is today perceived as more physical and prevails. In this paper, we show that Landauer's idea results from a confusion between information (a global emergent concept) and data (a local material object). This confusion leads to many inconsistencies and is incompatible with thermodynamics and information theory. The reason it prevails is interpreted to be due to a frequent tendency of materialism towards reductionism, neglecting emergence and seeking to eliminate the role of the observer. A paradoxical trend given that it is often accompanied by the materialist idea that all scientific knowledge nevertheless originates from observation. Information and entropy are actually emergent quantities introduced in the theory by convention.</description>
