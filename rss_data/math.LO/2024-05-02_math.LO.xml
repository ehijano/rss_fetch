      <title>Complexities of Theories of Profinite Subgroups of $S_\omega$ via Tree Presentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although $S_\omega$ (the group of all permutations of $\mathbb{N}$) is size continuum, both it and its closed subgroups can be presented as the set of paths through a countable tree. The subgroups of $S_\omega$ that can be presented this way with finite branching trees are exactly the profinite ones. We use these tree presentations to find upper bounds on the complexity of the existential theories of profinite subgroups of $S_\omega$, as well as to prove sharpness for these bounds. These complexity results enable us to distinguish a simple subclass of profinite groups, those with \emph{orbit independence}, for which we find an upper bound on the complexity of the entire first order theory.</description>

      <title>Measurable Brooks's Theorem for Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a descriptive version of Brooks's theorem for directed graphs. In particular, we show that, if $D$ is a Borel directed graph on a standard Borel space $X$ such that the maximum degree of each vertex is at most $d \geq 3$, then unless $D$ contains the complete symmetric directed graph on $d + 1$ vertices, $D$ admits a $\mu$-measurable $d$-dicoloring with respect to any Borel probability measure $\mu$ on $X$, and $D$ admits a $\tau$-Baire-measurable $d$-dicoloring with respect to any Polish topology $\tau$ compatible with the Borel structure on $X$. We also prove a definable version of Gallai's theorem on list dicolorings for directed graphs by showing that any Borel directed graph of bounded degree whose connected components are not Gallai trees is Borel degree-list-dicolorable.</description>

      <title>Unified inverse correspondence for LE-logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Kracht's theory of internal describability from classical modal logic to the family of all logics canonically associated with varieties of normal lattice expansions (LE algebras). We work in the purely algebraic setting of perfect LEs; the formulas playing the role of Kracht's formulas in this generalized setting pertain to a first order language whose atoms are special inequalities between terms of perfect algebras. Via duality, formulas in this language can be equivalently translated into first order conditions in the frame correspondence languages of several types of relational semantics for LE-logics.</description>

      <title>Algebraic types in Zilber's exponential field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise the model-theoretic algebraic closure in Zilber's exponential field. A key step involves showing that certain algebraic varieties have finite intersections with certain finite-rank subgroups of the graph of exponentiation. Mordell-Lang for algebraic tori (a theorem of Laurent) plays a central role in our proof.</description>

      <title>Courcelle's Theorem: A Self-Contained Proof and a Path-Width Variant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Courcelle's Theorem is an important result in graph theory, proving the existence of linear-time algorithms for many decision problems on graphs whose tree-width is bounded by a constant. The purpose of this text is twofold: to provide an explanation and step-by-step proof of Courcelle's Theorem as applied to graphs of tree-width bounded by a constant, and to show explicitly (on the example of path-width) how to apply the same principles to other graph classes. We present these topics in a way that does not assume any particular knowledge on the part of the reader except a basic understanding of mathematics and possibly the fundamentals of graph theory. Our hope is to make the topic accessible to a broader mathematical audience, to which end we have included extensive explanations and pretty pictures.</description>

      <title>An efficient quantifier elimination procedure for Presburger arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All known quantifier elimination procedures for Presburger arithmetic require doubly exponential time for eliminating a single block of existentially quantified variables. It has even been claimed in the literature that this upper bound is tight. We observe that this claim is incorrect and develop, as the main result of this paper, a quantifier elimination procedure eliminating a block of existentially quantified variables in singly exponential time. As corollaries, we can establish the precise complexity of numerous problems. Examples include deciding (i) monadic decomposability for existential formulas, (ii) whether an existential formula defines a well-quasi ordering or, more generally, (iii) certain formulas of Presburger arithmetic with Ramsey quantifiers. Moreover, despite the exponential blowup, our procedure shows that under mild assumptions, even NP upper bounds for decision problems about quantifier-free formulas can be transferred to existential formulas. The technical basis of our results is a kind of small model property for parametric integer programming that generalizes the seminal results by von zur Gathen and Sieveking on small integer points in convex polytopes.</description>
