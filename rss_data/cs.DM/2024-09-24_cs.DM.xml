      <title>Fast Local Search Strategies for Large-Scale General Quadratic Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the area of general quadratic integer programming (QIP), encompassing both unconstrained (UQIP) and constrained (CQIP) variants. These NP-hard problems have far-reaching applications, yet the non-convex cases have received limited attention in the literature. To address this gap, we introduce a closed-form formula for single-variable changes, establishing novel necessary and sufficient conditions for 1-Opt local improvement in UQIP and CQIP. We develop a simple local and sophisticated tabu search with an oscillation strategy tailored for large-scale problems. Experimental results on instances with up to 8000 variables demonstrate the efficiency of these strategies, producing high-quality solutions within a short time. Our approaches significantly outperform the Gurobi 11.0.2 solver.</description>

      <title>Task scheduling for autonomous vehicles in the Martian environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we introduced a novel variant of Electric VRP/TSP, the Solar Powered Rover Routing Problem (SPRRP), to tackle the routing of energy-constrained autonomous electric vehicles for Martian missions. We proposed a basic formulation of the problem based on the graph model that decomposes each Point of Interest into movement, charging, and research tasks. We have also outlined further possibilities for extending the problem.</description>

      <title>On the periodic decompositions of multidimensional configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $d$-dimensional configurations, that is, colorings of the $d$-dimensional integer grid $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with finitely many colors. Moreover, we interpret the colors as integers so that configurations are functions $\mathbb{Z}^d \to \mathbb{Z}$ of finite range. We say that such function is $k$-periodic if it is invariant under translations in $k$ linearly independent directions. It is known that if a configuration has a non-trivial annihilator, that is, if some non-trivial linear combination of its translations is the zero function, then it is a sum of finitely many periodic functions. This result is known as the periodic decomposition theorem. We prove two different improvements of it. The first improvement gives a characterization on annihilators of a configuration to guarantee the $k$-periodicity of the functions in its periodic decomposition -- for any $k$. The periodic decomposition theorem is then a special case of this result with $k=1$. The second improvement concerns so called sparse configurations for which the number of non-zero values in patterns grows at most linearly with respect to the diameter of the pattern. We prove that a sparse configuration with a non-trivial annihilator is a sum of finitely many periodic fibers where a fiber means a function whose non-zero values lie on a unique line.</description>

      <title>The vertex-pancyclicity of the simplified shuffle-cube and the vertex-bipancyclicity of the balanced shuffle-cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ $=$ $(V,E)$ is vertex-pancyclic if for every vertex $u$ and any integer $l$ ranging from $3$ to $|V|$, $G$ contains a cycle $C$ of length $l$ such that $u$ is on $C$. A bipartite graph $G$ $=$ $(V,E)$ is vertex-bipancyclic if for every vertex $u$ and any even integer $l$ ranging from $4$ to $|V|$, $G$ contains a cycle $C$ of length $l$ such that $u$ is on $C$. The simplified shuffle-cube and the balanced shuffle-cube, which are two variants of the shuffle-cube and are superior to shuffle-cube in terms of vertex-transitivity. In this paper, we show that the $n$-dimensional simplified shuffle-cube is vertex-pancyclic for $n\geqslant 6$, and the $n$-dimensional balanced shuffle-cube is vertex-bipancyclic for $n\geqslant 2$.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial Kernel for Deletion to the Scattered Class of Cliques and Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The class of graph deletion problems has been extensively studied in theoretical computer science, particularly in the field of parameterized complexity. Recently, a new notion of graph deletion problems was introduced, called deletion to scattered graph classes, where after deletion, each connected component of the graph should belong to at least one of the given graph classes. While fixed-parameter algorithms were given for a wide variety of problems, little progress has been made on the kernelization complexity of any of them. In this paper, we present the first non-trivial polynomial kernel for one such deletion problem, where, after deletion, each connected component should be a clique or a tree - that is, as densest as possible or as sparsest as possible (while being connected). We develop a kernel consisting of O(k^5) vertices for this problem.</description>

      <title>Extending the Extension: Deterministic Algorithm for Non-monotone Submodular Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximization of submodular functions under various constraints is a fundamental problem that has been studied extensively. A powerful technique that has emerged and has been shown to be extremely effective for such problems is the following. First, a continues relaxation of the problem is obtained by relaxing the (discrete) set of feasible solutions to a convex body, and extending the discrete submodular function $f$ to a continuous function $F$ known as the multilinear extension. Then, two algorithmic steps are implemented. The first step approximately solves the relaxation by finding a fractional solution within the convex body that approximately maximizes $F$; and the second step rounds this fractional solution to a feasible integral solution. While this ``fractionally solve and then round'' approach has been a key technique for resolving many questions in the field, the main drawback of algorithms based on it is that evaluating the multilinear extension may require a number of value oracle queries to $f$ that is exponential in the size of $f$'s ground set. The only known way to tackle this issue is to approximate the value of $F$ via sampling, which makes all algorithms based on this approach inherently randomized and quite slow.
  In this work, we introduce a new tool, that we refer to as the extended multilinear extension, designed to derandomize submodular maximization algorithms that are based on the successful ``solve fractionally and then round'' approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new tool on the fundamental problem of maximizing a submodular function subject to a matroid constraint, and show that it allows for a deterministic implementation of both the fractionally solving step and the rounding step of the above approach. As a bonus, we also get a randomized algorithm for the problem with an improved query complexity.</description>

      <title>A Bi-criterion Steiner Traveling Salesperson Problem with Time Windows for Last-Mile Electric Vehicle Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of energy-efficient and safe routing of last-mile electric freight vehicles. With the rising environmental footprint of the transportation sector and the growing popularity of E-Commerce, freight companies are likely to benefit from optimal time-window-feasible tours that minimize energy usage while reducing traffic conflicts at intersections and thereby improving safety. We formulate this problem as a Bi-criterion Steiner Traveling Salesperson Problem with Time Windows (BSTSPTW) with energy consumed and the number of left turns at intersections as the two objectives while also considering regenerative braking capabilities. We first discuss an exact mixed-integer programming model with scalarization to enumerate points on the efficiency frontier for small instances. For larger networks, we develop an efficient local search-based heuristic, which uses several operators to intensify and diversify the search process. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods using benchmark data and real-world instances from Amazon delivery routes in Austin, US. Comparisons with state-of-the-art solvers shows that our heuristics can generate near-optimal solutions within reasonable time budgets, effectively balancing energy efficiency and safety under practical delivery constraints.</description>

      <title>Bounded indegree $k$-forests problem and a faster algorithm for directed graph augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two problems for a directed graph $G$, which we show to be closely related. The first one is to find $k$ edge-disjoint forests in $G$ of maximal size such that the indegree of each vertex in these forests is at most $k$. We describe a min-max characterization for this problem and show that it can be solved in $O(k \delta m \log n)$ time, where $(n,m)$ is the size of $G$ and $\delta$ is the difference between $k$ and the edge connectivity of the graph. The second problem is the directed edge-connectivity augmentation problem, which has been extensively studied before: find a smallest set of directed edges whose addition to the graph makes it strongly $k$-connected. We improve the complexity for this problem from $O(k \delta (m+\delta n)\log n)$ [Gabow, STOC 1994] to $O(k \delta m \log n)$, by exploiting our solution for the first problem. A similar approach with the same complexity also works for the undirected version of the problem.</description>

Abstract: We treat three cubic recurrences, two of which generalize the famous iterated map $x \mapsto x (1-x)$ from discrete chaos theory. A feature of each asymptotic series developed here is a constant, dependent on the initial condition but otherwise intrinsic to the function at hand.</description>
