      <title>A Cloud-based Real-time Probabilistic Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Estimation using the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remaining useful life (RUL) estimation is an important metric that helps in condition-based maintenance. Damage data obtained from the diagnostics techniques are often noisy and the RUL estimated by calibrating the parameters of the physics-based predictive model with the damage data is less reliable. Estimating the probabilistic RUL by quantifying the uncertainty in the predictive model parameters using the noisy data increases confidence in the predicted values. Uncertainty quantification methods generate statistical samples for the model parameters, that represent the uncertainty, by evaluating the predictive model several times. The computational time for solving a physics-based predictive model is significant, which makes the statistical techniques that enable probabilistic RUL estimation to be computationally expensive. It is essential to reduce the computational time for RUL so that RUL can be estimated in a feasible time. In this work, real-time probabilistic RUL estimation is demonstrated in adhesively bonded joints using the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling method and cloud-based computations. The SMC sampling method is an alternative to traditional MCMC methods, which enables generating of statical parameter samples in parallel. The parallel computational capabilities of the SMC methods are exploited by running the SMC simulation on multiple cloud calls. This approach is demonstrated by estimating fatigue RUL in the adhesively bonded joint. The accuracy of probabilistic RUL estimated by SMC is validated by comparing it with RUL estimated by the MCMC and the experimental values. The SMC simulation is run on the cloud and the computational speedup of the SMC is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>A Game-theoretic model of forex trading with stochastic strategies and information asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction strategies for reward in competitive environments are significantly influenced by the nature and extent of available information.In financial markets,particularly foreign exchange(forex),traders operate independently with limited information,often yielding highly unpredictable outcomes.This study introduces a game theoretic framework modeling the market as a strategically active participant,rather than a neutral entity, within a stochastic,imperfect information setting.In this model,the market alternates sequentially with new traders,each trader having limited visibility of the market's moves,while the market observes and counteracts each trader strategy.Through a series of simulations,we show that this information asymmetry enables the market to consistently outperform traders on aggregate.This outcome suggests that real world forex environments may inherently favor market structures with greater informational advantage,challenging the perception of a level playing field.The model provides a basis for simulating skewed information environments,highlighting how strategic imbalances contribute to trader losses.Further optimization of the intelligent market scoring and refined simulations of trader market interactions can enhance predictive analytics for forex,offering a robust tool for market behavior analysis.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network for Cerebral Blood Flow Prediction With Clinical Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of cerebral blood flow is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases. Traditional computational methods, however, often incur significant computational costs, limiting their practicality in real-time clinical applications. This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) to predict blood flow and pressure in previously unseen cerebral vascular network structures that were not included in training data. The GNN was developed using clinical datasets from patients with stenosis, featuring complex and abnormal vascular geometries. Additionally, the GNN model was trained on data incorporating a wide range of inflow conditions, vessel topologies, and network connectivities to enhance its generalization capability. The approach achieved Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.727 for pressure and 0.824 for flow rate, with sufficient training data. These findings demonstrate the potential of the GNN for real-time cerebrovascular diagnostics, particularly in handling intricate and pathological vascular networks.</description>

      <title>Influence of Critical Current Distribution on Operation, Quench Detection and Protection of HTS Pancake Coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductor (HTS) coated conductors (CC) are often wound into pancake coils with electrical insulation in-between the turns. The copper terminals are used for current injection and conduction cooling. An inherent variation of the critical current along the CC length results from its manufacturing process. This variation causes non-uniform heat generation, particularly when the coil is operated at a high fraction of the nominal critical current or when large critical current defects are present. The temperature distribution resulting from the balance between cooling and heating, in combination with the magnetic field and critical current distributions, determines whether a thermal runaway occurs. Accurately predicting the level of critical current defects that can be tolerated during conduction-cooled operation is difficult and requires a 3D coupled electromagnetic and thermal simulation. This paper presents the results of simulations that are performed with the open-source Finite Element Quench Simulator (FiQuS) tool developed at CERN as part of the STEAM framework. The 3D coupled magnetodynamic-thermal simulations are based on the H-phi formulation and use thin shell approximations, a CC homogenization and conduction-cooling. The critical current (Ic) is varied along the CC length. The effect of a single defect specified as a reduction of Ic along the CC length is investigated in terms of the coil's ability to reach and maintain the operating conditions. The Ic and length of the defect that results in a thermal runaway are analyzed in terms of defect location. In addition, a classical 1D scenario with a quench heater is studied. Both the local defect and the heater cases are compared in terms of the voltage signal available for quench detection. These cases result in very different requirements for quench detection, and their implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Efficient numerical methods for the Maxey-Riley-Gatignol equations with Basset history term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Maxey-Riley-Gatignol equations (MRGE) describe the motion of a finite-sized, spherical particle in a fluid. Because of wake effects, the force acting on a particle depends on its past trajectory. This is modelled by an integral term in the MRGE, also called Basset force, that makes its numerical solution challenging and memory intensive. A recent approach proposed by Prasath et al. exploits connections between the integral term and fractional derivatives to reformulate the MRGE as a time-dependent partial differential equation on a semi-infinite pseudo-space. They also propose a numerical algorithm based on polynomial expansions. This paper develops a numerical approach based on finite difference instead, by adopting techniques by Koleva et al. and Fazio et al. to cope with the issues of having an unbounded spatial domain. We compare convergence order and computational efficiency for particles of varying size and density of the polynomial expansion by Prasath et al., our finite difference schemes and a direct integrator for the MRGE based on multi-step methods proposed by Daitche. While all methods achieve their theoretical convergence order for neutrally buoyant particles with zero initial relative velocity, they suffer from various degrees of order reduction if the initial relative velocity is non-zero or the particle has a different density than the fluid.</description>
