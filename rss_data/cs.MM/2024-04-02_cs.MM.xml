      <title>MIPS at SemEval-2024 Task 3: Multimodal Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations with Multimodal Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents our winning submission to Subtask 2 of SemEval 2024 Task 3 on multimodal emotion cause analysis in conversations. We propose a novel Multimodal Emotion Recognition and Multimodal Emotion Cause Extraction (MER-MCE) framework that integrates text, audio, and visual modalities using specialized emotion encoders. Our approach sets itself apart from top-performing teams by leveraging modality-specific features for enhanced emotion understanding and causality inference. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the advantages of our multimodal approach, with our submission achieving a competitive weighted F1 score of 0.3435, ranking third with a margin of only 0.0339 behind the 1st team and 0.0025 behind the 2nd team.

      <title>Multimodal Pretraining, Adaptation, and Generation for Recommendation: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized recommendation serves as a ubiquitous channel for users to discover information or items tailored to their interests. However, traditional recommendation models primarily rely on unique IDs and categorical features for user-item matching, potentially overlooking the nuanced essence of raw item contents across multiple modalities such as text, image, audio, and video. This underutilization of multimodal data poses a limitation to recommender systems, especially in multimedia services like news, music, and short-video platforms. The recent advancements in pretrained multimodal models offer new opportunities and challenges in developing content-aware recommender systems. This survey seeks to provide a comprehensive exploration of the latest advancements and future trajectories in multimodal pretraining, adaptation, and generation techniques, as well as their applications to recommender systems. Furthermore, we discuss open challenges and opportunities for future research in this domain. We hope that this survey, along with our tutorial materials, will inspire further research efforts to advance this evolving landscape.</description>

      <title>Learning to Generate Conditional Tri-plane for 3D-aware Expression Controllable Portrait Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Export3D, a one-shot 3D-aware portrait animation method that is able to control the facial expression and camera view of a given portrait image. To achieve this, we introduce a tri-plane generator that directly generates a tri-plane of 3D prior by transferring the expression parameter of 3DMM into the source image. The tri-plane is then decoded into the image of different view through a differentiable volume rendering. Existing portrait animation methods heavily rely on image warping to transfer the expression in the motion space, challenging on disentanglement of appearance and expression. In contrast, we propose a contrastive pre-training framework for appearance-free expression parameter, eliminating undesirable appearance swap when transferring a cross-identity expression. Extensive experiments show that our pre-training framework can learn the appearance-free expression representation hidden in 3DMM, and our model can generate 3D-aware expression controllable portrait image without appearance swap in the cross-identity manner.</description>

      <title>360+x: A Panoptic Multi-modal Scene Understanding Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human perception of the world is shaped by a multitude of viewpoints and modalities. While many existing datasets focus on scene understanding from a certain perspective (e.g. egocentric or third-person views), our dataset offers a panoptic perspective (i.e. multiple viewpoints with multiple data modalities). Specifically, we encapsulate third-person panoramic and front views, as well as egocentric monocular/binocular views with rich modalities including video, multi-channel audio, directional binaural delay, location data and textual scene descriptions within each scene captured, presenting comprehensive observation of the world. Figure 1 offers a glimpse of all 28 scene categories of our 360+x dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first database that covers multiple viewpoints with multiple data modalities to mimic how daily information is accessed in the real world. Through our benchmark analysis, we presented 5 different scene understanding tasks on the proposed 360+x dataset to evaluate the impact and benefit of each data modality and perspective in panoptic scene understanding. We hope this unique dataset could broaden the scope of comprehensive scene understanding and encourage the community to approach these problems from more diverse perspectives.</description>

      <title>SpikeMba: Multi-Modal Spiking Saliency Mamba for Temporal Video Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal video grounding (TVG) is a critical task in video content understanding. Despite significant advancements, existing methods often limit in capturing the fine-grained relationships between multimodal inputs and the high computational costs with processing long video sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel SpikeMba: multi-modal spiking saliency mamba for temporal video grounding. In our work, we integrate the Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and state space models (SSMs) to capture the fine-grained relationships of multimodal features effectively. Specifically, we introduce the relevant slots to enhance the model's memory capabilities, enabling a deeper contextual understanding of video sequences. The contextual moment reasoner leverages these slots to maintain a balance between contextual information preservation and semantic relevance exploration. Simultaneously, the spiking saliency detector capitalizes on the unique properties of SNNs to accurately locate salient proposals. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SpikeMba, which consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across mainstream benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Text-to-Visual Generation with Image-to-Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in generative AI, comprehensive evaluation remains challenging because of the lack of effective metrics and standardized benchmarks. For instance, the widely-used CLIPScore measures the alignment between a (generated) image and text prompt, but it fails to produce reliable scores for complex prompts involving compositions of objects, attributes, and relations. One reason is that text encoders of CLIP can notoriously act as a "bag of words", conflating prompts such as "the horse is eating the grass" with "the grass is eating the horse". To address this, we introduce the VQAScore, which uses a visual-question-answering (VQA) model to produce an alignment score by computing the probability of a "Yes" answer to a simple "Does this figure show '{text}'?" question. Though simpler than prior art, VQAScore computed with off-the-shelf models produces state-of-the-art results across many (8) image-text alignment benchmarks. We also compute VQAScore with an in-house model that follows best practices in the literature. For example, we use a bidirectional image-question encoder that allows image embeddings to depend on the question being asked (and vice versa). Our in-house model, CLIP-FlanT5, outperforms even the strongest baselines that make use of the proprietary GPT-4V. Interestingly, although we train with only images, VQAScore can also align text with video and 3D models. VQAScore allows researchers to benchmark text-to-visual generation using complex texts that capture the compositional structure of real-world prompts. We introduce GenAI-Bench, a more challenging benchmark with 1,600 compositional text prompts that require parsing scenes, objects, attributes, relationships, and high-order reasoning like comparison and logic. GenAI-Bench also offers over 15,000 human ratings for leading image and video generation models such as Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 3, and Gen2.</description>

      <title>Robust Active Speaker Detection in Noisy Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of active speaker detection (ASD) in noisy environments and formulates a robust active speaker detection (rASD) problem. Existing ASD approaches leverage both audio and visual modalities, but non-speech sounds in the surrounding environment can negatively impact performance. To overcome this, we propose a novel framework that utilizes audio-visual speech separation as guidance to learn noise-free audio features. These features are then utilized in an ASD model, and both tasks are jointly optimized in an end-to-end framework. Our proposed framework mitigates residual noise and audio quality reduction issues that can occur in a naive cascaded two-stage framework that directly uses separated speech for ASD, and enables the two tasks to be optimized simultaneously. To further enhance the robustness of the audio features and handle inherent speech noises, we propose a dynamic weighted loss approach to train the speech separator. We also collected a real-world noise audio dataset to facilitate investigations. Experiments demonstrate that non-speech audio noises significantly impact ASD models, and our proposed approach improves ASD performance in noisy environments. The framework is general and can be applied to different ASD approaches to improve their robustness. Our code, models, and data will be released.</description>

      <title>Self-Adaptive Sampling for Efficient Video Question-Answering on Image--Text Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04192v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video question-answering is a fundamental task in the field of video understanding. Although current vision--language models (VLMs) equipped with Video Transformers have enabled temporal modeling and yielded superior results, they are at the cost of huge computational power and thus too expensive to deploy in real-time application scenarios. An economical workaround only samples a small portion of frames to represent the main content of that video and tune an image--text model on these sampled frames. Recent video understanding models usually randomly sample a set of frames or clips, regardless of internal correlations between their visual contents, nor their relevance to the problem. We argue that such kinds of aimless sampling may omit the key frames from which the correct answer can be deduced, and the situation gets worse when the sampling sparsity increases, which always happens as the video lengths increase. To mitigate this issue, we propose two frame sampling strategies, namely the most domain frames (MDF) and most implied frames (MIF), to maximally preserve those frames that are most likely vital to the given questions. MDF passively minimizes the risk of key frame omission in a bootstrap manner, while MIS actively searches key frames customized for each video--question pair with the assistance of auxiliary models. The experimental results on three public datasets from three advanced VLMs (CLIP, GIT and All-in-one) demonstrate that our proposed strategies can boost the performance for image-text pretrained models. The source codes pertaining to the method proposed in this paper are publicly available at https://github.com/declare-lab/sas-vqa.</description>

      <title>Can I Trust Your Answer? Visually Grounded Video Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study visually grounded VideoQA in response to the emerging trends of utilizing pretraining techniques for video-language understanding. Specifically, by forcing vision-language models (VLMs) to answer questions and simultaneously provide visual evidence, we seek to ascertain the extent to which the predictions of such techniques are genuinely anchored in relevant video content, versus spurious correlations from language or irrelevant visual context. Towards this, we construct NExT-GQA -- an extension of NExT-QA with 10.5$K$ temporal grounding (or location) labels tied to the original QA pairs. With NExT-GQA, we scrutinize a series of state-of-the-art VLMs. Through post-hoc attention analysis, we find that these models are extremely weak in substantiating the answers despite their strong QA performance. This exposes the limitation of current VLMs in making reliable predictions. As a remedy, we further explore and propose a grounded-QA method via Gaussian mask optimization and cross-modal learning. Experiments with different backbones demonstrate that this grounding mechanism improves both grounding and QA. With these efforts, we aim to push towards trustworthy VLMs in VQA systems. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/doc-doc/NExT-GQA.</description>

      <title>HiCMAE: Hierarchical Contrastive Masked Autoencoder for Self-Supervised Audio-Visual Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Emotion Recognition (AVER) has garnered increasing attention in recent years for its critical role in creating emotion-ware intelligent machines. Previous efforts in this area are dominated by the supervised learning paradigm. Despite significant progress, supervised learning is meeting its bottleneck due to the longstanding data scarcity issue in AVER. Motivated by recent advances in self-supervised learning, we propose Hierarchical Contrastive Masked Autoencoder (HiCMAE), a novel self-supervised framework that leverages large-scale self-supervised pre-training on vast unlabeled audio-visual data to promote the advancement of AVER. Following prior arts in self-supervised audio-visual representation learning, HiCMAE adopts two primary forms of self-supervision for pre-training, namely masked data modeling and contrastive learning. Unlike them which focus exclusively on top-layer representations while neglecting explicit guidance of intermediate layers, HiCMAE develops a three-pronged strategy to foster hierarchical audio-visual feature learning and improve the overall quality of learned representations. To verify the effectiveness of HiCMAE, we conduct extensive experiments on 9 datasets covering both categorical and dimensional AVER tasks. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised audio-visual methods, which indicates that HiCMAE is a powerful audio-visual emotion representation learner. Codes and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/sunlicai/HiCMAE.</description>

      <title>WaterVG: Waterway Visual Grounding based on Text-Guided Vision and mmWave Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perception of waterways based on human intent is significant for autonomous navigation and operations of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) in water environments. Inspired by visual grounding, we introduce WaterVG, the first visual grounding dataset designed for USV-based waterway perception based on human prompts. WaterVG encompasses prompts describing multiple targets, with annotations at the instance level including bounding boxes and masks. Notably, WaterVG includes 11,568 samples with 34,987 referred targets, whose prompts integrates both visual and radar characteristics. The pattern of text-guided two sensors equips a finer granularity of text prompts with visual and radar features of referred targets. Moreover, we propose a low-power visual grounding model, Potamoi, which is a multi-task model with a well-designed Phased Heterogeneous Modality Fusion (PHMF) mode, including Adaptive Radar Weighting (ARW) and Multi-Head Slim Cross Attention (MHSCA). Exactly, ARW extracts required radar features to fuse with vision for prompt alignment. MHSCA is an efficient fusion module with a remarkably small parameter count and FLOPs, elegantly fusing scenario context captured by two sensors with linguistic features, which performs expressively on visual grounding tasks. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations have been conducted on WaterVG, where our Potamoi archives state-of-the-art performances compared with counterparts.</description>

      <title>Break-for-Make: Modular Low-Rank Adaptations for Composable Content-Style Customization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized generation paradigms empower designers to customize visual intellectual properties with the help of textual descriptions by tuning or adapting pre-trained text-to-image models on a few images. Recent works explore approaches for concurrently customizing both content and detailed visual style appearance. However, these existing approaches often generate images where the content and style are entangled. In this study, we reconsider the customization of content and style concepts from the perspective of parameter space construction. Unlike existing methods that utilize a shared parameter space for content and style, we propose a learning framework that separates the parameter space to facilitate individual learning of content and style, thereby enabling disentangled content and style. To achieve this goal, we introduce "partly learnable projection" (PLP) matrices to separate the original adapters into divided sub-parameter spaces. We propose "break-for-make" customization learning pipeline based on PLP, which is simple yet effective. We break the original adapters into "up projection" and "down projection", train content and style PLPs individually with the guidance of corresponding textual prompts in the separate adapters, and maintain generalization by employing a multi-correspondence projection learning strategy. Based on the adapters broken apart for separate training content and style, we then make the entity parameter space by reconstructing the content and style PLPs matrices, followed by fine-tuning the combined adapter to generate the target object with the desired appearance. Experiments on various styles, including textures, materials, and artistic style, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art single/multiple concept learning pipelines in terms of content-style-prompt alignment.</description>
