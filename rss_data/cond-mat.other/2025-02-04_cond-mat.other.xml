      <title>Momentum distribution of He-3 in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-particle density matrix of a one-dimensional system of fermions featuring a hard-core repulsive interaction at short distances can be computed (numerically) exactly by means of the continuous-space Worm Algorithm, without any sign instability. We present here results for this quantity, and the related momentum distribution, for a He-3 fluid. It is shown that effects of quantum statistics are observable in both the fully polarized and in the unpolarized system, with only a relatively small suppression in the latter case.</description>

      <title>Searching for fixed points of dynamical systems by the Explorative Relaxation Reditribution Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being able to effectively locate saddle (and other fixed) points in dynamical systems holds tremendous implications in a number of applications in engineering and science, among which the study of rare events in molecular simulations stands as one of the most prominent field of interest. Although there is a vast literature on methods aiming at addressing this challenge, open issues still remain in several aspects such as computational efficiency and easy implementation. In this work, we suggest that the Relaxation Redistribution Method (RRM) - formerly introduced to solve the invariance equation in the context of stiff dynamical systems ruling detailed chemical kinetics - can be reformulated to locate saddle and other fixed points even for stochastic simulators driven by effective energy gradients. This new formulation of the RRM is referred to as the Explorative Relaxation Redistribution Method (ERRM). Benchmarks based on the popular Mueller-Brown and other potentials are used to test the ERRM.</description>

      <title>Charge and heat pumping in the Rice-Mele chain at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that quantized topological charge pumping takes place in the half filled Rice-Mele chain performing a closed cycle in parameter space. We extend previous studies to the case of charge and heat transport at arbitrary filling and temperature using the corresponding continuity equation with focus in the non-interacting case. The amount of charge and heat transported for any adiabatic time dependence of the parameters is given by a double integral of an analytical function. We find that quantized transport is lost except in trivial cases. In particular, for popular pumping circuits used which lead to quantized non-trivial charge transport at zero temperature, the heat transported in the cycle vanishes. For other pumping circuits, there is a heat transport among even and odd sites of the chain and the environment. As the temperature is increased, the transported charge and heat decrease and vanish at infinite temperature.</description>

      <title>Predicting quantum materials properties using novel faithful machine learning embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is accelerating the progress of materials prediction and classification, with particular success in CGNN designs. While classical ML methods remain accessible, advanced deep networks are still challenging to build and train. We introduce two new adaptations and refine two existing ML networks for generic crystalline quantum materials properties prediction and optimization. These new models achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting TQC classification and strong performance in predicting band gaps, magnetic classifications, formation energies, and symmetry group. All networks easily generalize to all quantum crystalline materials property predictions. To support this, full implementations and automated methods for data handling and materials predictions are provided, facilitating the use of deep ML methods in quantum materials science. Finally, dataset error rates are analyzed using an ensemble model to identify and highlight highly atypical materials for further investigations.</description>
