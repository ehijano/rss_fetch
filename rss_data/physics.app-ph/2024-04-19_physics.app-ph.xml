      <title>Hydrogen plasma inhibits ion beam restructuring of materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focused ion beam (FIB) techniques are employed widely for nanofabrication, and processing of materials and devices. However, ion irradiation often gives rise to severe damage due to atomic displacements that cause defect formation, migration and clustering within the ion-solid interaction volume. The resulting restructuring degrades the functionality of materials, and limits the utility FIB ablation and nanofabrication techniques. Here we show that such restructuring can be inhibited by performing FIB irradiation in a hydrogen plasma environment via chemical pathways that modify defect binding energies and transport kinetics, as well as material ablation rates. The method is minimally-invasive and has the potential to greatly expand the utility of FIB nanofabrication techniques in processing of functional materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Intelligent mechanical metamaterials towards learning static and dynamic behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of intelligent machines has recently spurred the development of physical neural networks, a class of intelligent metamaterials capable of learning, whether in silico or in situ, from observed data. In this study, we introduce a back-propagation framework for lattice-based mechanical neural networks (MNNs) to achieve prescribed static and dynamic performance. This approach leverages the steady states of nodes for back-propagation, efficiently updating the learning degrees of freedom without prior knowledge of input loading. One-dimensional MNNs, trained with back-propagation in silico, can exhibit the desired behaviors on demand function as intelligent mechanical machines. The framework is then employed for the precise morphing control of the two-dimensional MNNs subjected to different static loads. Moreover, the intelligent MNNs are trained to execute classical machine learning tasks such as regression to tackle various deformation control tasks. Finally, the disordered MNNs are constructed and trained to demonstrate pre-programmed wave bandgap control ability, illustrating the versatility of the proposed approach as a platform for physical learning. Our approach presents an efficient pathway for the design of intelligent mechanical metamaterials for a wide range of static and dynamic target functionalities, positioning them as powerful engines for physical learning.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional 3D printing of PEDOT:PSS aerogels with tunable electromechanical performance for unconventional stretchable interconnects and thermoelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of soft electronics will expand to the third dimension. This will require the integration of mechanically-compliant three-dimensional functional structures with stretchable materials. This study demonstrates omnidirectional direct ink writing (DIW) of Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) aerogels with tunable electrical and mechanical performance, which can be integrated with soft substrates. Several PEDOT:PSS hydrogels were formulated for DIW and freeze-dried directly on stretchable substrates to form integrated aerogels displaying high shape fidelity and minimal shrinkage. The effect of additives and processing in the PEDOT:PSS hydro and aerogels morphology, and the link with their electromechanical properties was elucidated. This technology demonstrated 3D-structured stretchable interconnects and planar thermoelectric generators (TEGs) for skin electronics, as well as vertically-printed high aspect ratio thermoelectric pillars with a high ZT value of 3.2 10^-3 and ultra-low thermal conductivity of 0.065 W/(m K). Despite their comparatively low ZT, the aerogel pillars outpowered their dense counterparts in realistic energy harvesting scenarios where contact resistances cannot be ignored, and produced up to 26 nW/cm2 (corresponding to a gravimetric power density of 0.76 mW/kg) for a difference of temperature of 15 K. This work suggests promising advancements in soft and energy-efficiency electronic systems relevant to soft robotics and wearable.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-accurate and wafer-scale process for nonlinear frequency mixers in thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonics have led to a new generation of high-performance electro-optic devices, including modulators, frequency combs, and microwave-to-optical transducers. However, the broader adoption of TFLN-based devices that rely on all-optical nonlinearities have been limited by the sensitivity of quasi-phase matching (QPM), realized via ferroelectric poling, to fabrication tolerances. Here, we propose a scalable fabrication process aimed at improving the wavelength-accuracy of optical frequency mixers in TFLN. In contrast to the conventional pole-before-etch approach, we first define the waveguide in TFLN and then perform ferroelectric poling. This sequence allows for precise metrology before and after waveguide definition to fully capture the geometry imperfections. Systematic errors can also be calibrated by measuring a subset of devices to fine-tune the QPM design for remaining devices on the wafer. Using this method, we fabricated a large number of second harmonic generation devices aimed at generating 737 nm light, with 73% operating within 5 nm of the target wavelength. Furthermore, we also demonstrate thermo-optic tuning and trimming of the devices via cladding deposition, with the former bringing ~96% of tested devices to the target wavelength. Our technique enables the rapid growth of integrated quantum frequency converters, photon pair sources, and optical parametric amplifiers, thus facilitating the integration of TFLN-based nonlinear frequency mixers into more complex and functional photonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topology and surface characteristics of lyophilisates significantly impact the stability and reconstitutability of freeze-dried pharmaceuticals. Consequently, visual quality control of the product is imperative. However, this procedure is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also expensive and prone to errors. In this paper, we present an approach for fully automated, non-destructive inspection of freeze-dried pharmaceuticals, leveraging robotics, computed tomography, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Solid and hollow plasmonic nanoresonators for carrier envelope phase read-out</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometry of various plasmonic nanoantennae was numerically optimized to maximize their sensitivity to the carrier envelope phase (CEP) of the exciting ultra-short laser pulses. To verify the CEP sensitivity, the near-field response of the investigated nanoantennae was analyzed by combining frequency and time-domain numerical computations. The simulation methodology, capable of accurately calculating the time-dependent photocurrent stem from optical field emission, enabled the determination and optimization of all key parameters characterizing and governing the CEP dependence of the near-field responses. Three-types of structures were inspected, including individual triangular and teardrop-shaped nanoantennae and plasmonic lenses consisting of three hemispheres with gradually decreasing diameters. All structure types were optimized in solid and hollow compositions of gold nanoresonators as well. It was shown that hollow /solid singlets produce the largest /intermediate CEP dependent - to - CEP independent integrated current components' ratio, while their absolute CEP dependent integrated currents were the smallest /intermediate among the optimized structures. The highest /intermediate CEP sensitivity was achieved via solid plasmonic lenses due to their very large absolute CEP dependent integrated photocurrent originating from huge near-field enhancement in the nanogaps, while the integrated current components' ratio was smaller than for counterpart singlets.</description>

      <title>Green and Solid State Reduction of GO Monolayers Sandwiched between Arachidic Acid LB Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel, single step and environment friendly solid state approach for reduction of graphene oxide (GO) monolayers has been demonstrated, in which, arachidic acid-GO-arachidic acid (AA-GO-AA) sandwich structure obtained by Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique was heat treated at moderate temperatures to obtain RGO sheets. Heat treatment of AA-GO-AA sandwich structure at 200 C results in substantial reduction of GO, with concurrent removal of AA molecules. Such developed RGO sheets possess sp2-C content of 69%, O/C ratio of 0.17 and significantly reduced I(D) and I(G) ratio of ~1.1. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) studies on RGO sheets evidenced significant increase in density of states in immediate vicinity of Fermi level and decrease in work function after reduction. Bottom gated field effect transistors fabricated with isolated RGO sheets displayed charge neutrality point at a positive gate voltage, indicating p-type nature, consistent with UPS and electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) measurement results.The RGO sheets obtained by heat treatment of AA-GO-AA sandwich structure exhibited conductivity in the range of 2-7Scm-1 and field effect mobility of 0.03-2cm2V-1s-1, which are consistent with values reported for RGO sheets obtained by various chemical or thermal reduction procedures.The extent of GO reduction is determined primarily by proximity of AA molecules and found to be unaltered with either escalation of heat treatment temperature or increase of AA content in sandwich structure. The single-step GO reduction approach demonstrated in this work is an effective way for development of RGO monolayers with high structural quality towards graphene-based electronic device applications.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Electromagnetic Illusions: Empowering Smart Environments with Reconfigurable Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study delves into the innovative landscape of metasurfaces, with a particular focus on their role in achieving EM illusion (EMI) a facet of paramount significance. The control of EM waves assumes a pivotal role in mitigating issues such as signal degradation, interference, and reduced communication range. Furthermore, the engineering of waves serves as a foundational element in achieving invisibility or minimized detectability. This survey unravels the theoretical underpinnings and practical designs of EMI coatings, which have been harnessed to develop functional metasurfaces. EMI, practically achieved through engineered coatings, confers a strategic advantage by either reducing the radar cross-section of objects or creating misleading footprints. In addition to illustrating the outstanding achievements in reconfigurable cloaking, this study culminates in the proposal of a novel approach, suggesting the emergence of EMI without the need for physically coating the device to conceal and thus proposing the concept of a smart EMI environment. This groundbreaking work opens a new way for engineers and researchers to unlock exotic and versatile designs that build on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). Crucially the designs enabled by the proposed approach, present a wide array of applications, encompassing camouflaging, deceptive sensing, radar cognition control, and defence security, among others. In essence, this research stands as a beacon guiding the exploration of uncharted territories in wave control through smart EMI environments, with profound implications spanning basic academic research in RIS through advanced security technologies and communication systems.</description>

      <title>Broadband microwave signal generation with programmable chirp shapes via low-speed electronics-controlled phase-modulated optical loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broadband microwave signals with customized chirp shapes are highly captivating in practical applications. Compared with electronic technology, photonic solutions are superior in bandwidth, but suffer from flexible and rapid manipulation of chirp shape. Here, we demonstrate a novel concept for generating broadband microwave signals with programmable chirp shapes. It is realized on a simple fiber-optic platform involving a continuous-wave laser, a phase-modulated optical loop, low-speed electronics at MHz, and an optical coherent receiver. Microwave signals with bandwidths beyond tens of GHz, even up to hundreds of GHz, can be generated, where the chirp shape is identical to the low-frequency driving waveform of the phase-modulated optical loop. Besides, signal parameters, such as bandwidth, center frequency, and temporal duration, can be reconfigured in real time. In the experiment, highly-coherent microwave signals with various customized chirp shapes are generated, where the time resolution for programming the chirp shape is 649 ps. The center frequency and bandwidth tuning ranges exceed 21 GHz, and the temporal duration is tuned in the range of 9 ns to 180 ns.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and conservation of spin angular momentum, helicity, and chirality in photonic time-varying media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization-dependent dynamical properties of light as the spin angular momentum (SAM), helicity, and chirality are conserved quantities in free-space. Despite their similarities on account of their relationship with a circular state of polarization, SAM, helicity, and chirality emerge from distinct symmetries, which endows them with different physical meanings, properties, and practical applications. In this work, we investigate the behavior of such quantities in time-varying media (TVM), i.e., how a temporal modulation impacts their symmetries and conservation laws. Our results demonstrate that the SAM is conserved for any time modulation, helicity is only preserved in impedance-matched time modulations, while chirality is not conserved. In addition, the continuity equations highlight the dependence of the chirality with the energy content of the fields. These results provide additional insights into the similarities and differences between SAM, helicity, and chirality, as well as their physical meaning. Furthermore, our theoretical framework provides with a new perspective to analyze polarization-dependent light-matter interactions in TVM.</description>

      <title>Response of premixed Jet Flames to Blast wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study investigates the response dynamics of premixed jet flames when incident with blast waves along the jet axis. In the present work, blast waves are generated using the wire-explosion technique. The generated blast wave interacts with premixed jet flames that are stabilised over a thin fuel-air jet nozzle. The study is performed over a wide range of parametric space, varying the Reynolds number ($Re$) and normalised equivalence ratio ($\Phi$) of the premixed jet and the strength of the generated blast fronts ($M_{s,r}$). The blast wave imposes a decaying flow field profile characterised by a sharp discontinuity at the blast front. This is accompanied by a subsequent induced flow arising due to entertainment from the surroundings as the blast-imposed flow fields decay to sub-ambient levels. While the jet flame is observed to respond to the blast front with a jittery motion, it is found to lift off following the interaction with the induced flow. Depending on the operating conditions ($Re$, $\Phi$, and $M_{s,r}$), the flame lift-off is followed by an extinction or a re-attachment event. The flame response is further classified into two re-attachment and three extinction sub-regimes based on the response dynamics of the flame base and flame tip following the interaction process. The flame response entails flame base lift-off and flame tip distortion, potentially leading to a flame pinch-off event contingent on the operating conditions. A mathematical model was developed to explain the flame base response dynamics, yielding a scaling law for flame base lift-off height. Flame tip response trends were elucidated by extending the vorticity transport equation to estimate the vortex roll-up rate in the shear boundary surrounding the flame. Flame pinch-off was observed when shear layer vortices reached critical circulation limits and shed at length scales lower than the flame height.</description>
