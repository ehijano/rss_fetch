      <title>On the Nilpotent Graph of a finite Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If G is a non-nilpotent group and nil(G) = {g \in G : &lt;g, h&gt; is nilpotent for all h\in G}, the nilpotent graph of G is the graph with set of vertices G-nil(G) in which two distinct vertices are related if they generate a nilpotent subgroup of G. Several properties of the nilpotent graph associated with a finite non-nilpotent group G are studied in this work. Lower bounds for the clique number and the number of connected components of the nilpotent graph of G are presented in terms of the size of its Fitting subgroup and the number of its strongly self-centralizing subgroups, respectively. It is proved the nilpotent graph of the symmetric group of degree n is disconnected if and only if n or n-1 is a prime number, and no finite non-nilpotent group has a self-complementary nilpotent graph. For the dihedral group Dn, it is determined the number of connected components of its nilpotent graph is one more than n when n is odd; or one more than the 2'-part of n when n is even. In addition, a formula for the number of connected components of the nilpotent graph of PSL(2,q), where q is a prime power, is provided. Finally, necessary and sufficient conditions for specific subsets of a group, containing connected components of its nilpotent graph, to contain one of its Sylow p-subgroups are studied; and it is shown the nilpotent graph of a finite non-nilpotent group G with nil(G) of even order is non-Eulerian.</description>

      <title>Finite groups with some particular maximal invariant subgroups being nilpotent or all non-nilpotent maximal invariant subgroups being normal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $G$ be finite groups such that $A$ acts coprimely on $G$ by automorphisms. We provide a complete classification of a finite group $G$ in which every maximal $A$-invariant subgroup containing the normalizer of some $A$-invariant Sylow subgroup is nilpotent. Moreover, we show that both the hypothesis that every maximal $A$-invariant subgroup of $G$ containing the normalizer of some $A$-invariant Sylow subgroup is nilpotent and the hypothesis that every non-nilpotent maximal $A$-invariant subgroup of $G$ is normal are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Two Generalizations of Hopfian Abelian Groupa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper targets to generalize the notion of Hopfian groups in the commutative case by defining the so-called {\bf relatively Hopfian groups} and {\bf weakly Hopfian groups}, and establishing some their crucial properties and characterizations. Specifically, we prove that for a reduced Abelian $p$-group $G$ such that $p^{\omega}G$ is Hopfian (in particular, is finite), the notions of relative Hopficity and ordinary Hopficity do coincide. We also show that if $G$ is a reduced Abelian $p$-group such that $p^{\omega}G$ is bounded and $G/p^{\omega}G$ is Hopfian, then $G$ is relatively Hopfian. This allows us to construct a reduced relatively Hopfian Abelian $p$-group $G$ with $p^{\omega}G$ an infinite elementary group such that $G$ is {\bf not} Hopfian. In contrast, for reduced torsion-free groups, we establish that the relative and ordinary Hopficity are equivalent. Moreover, the mixed case is explored as well, showing that the structure of both relatively and weakly Hopfian groups can be quite complicated.</description>

      <title>Equivariant neural networks and piecewise linear representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equivariant neural networks are neural networks with symmetry. Motivated by the theory of group representations, we decompose the layers of an equivariant neural network into simple representations. The nonlinear activation functions lead to interesting nonlinear equivariant maps between simple representations. For example, the rectified linear unit (ReLU) gives rise to piecewise linear maps. We show that these considerations lead to a filtration of equivariant neural networks, generalizing Fourier series. This observation might provide a useful tool for interpreting equivariant neural networks.</description>

      <title>Mixed identities for oligomorphic automorphism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study mixed identities for oligomorphic automorphism groups of countable relational structures. Our main result gives sufficient conditions for such a group to not admit a mixed identity without particular constants. We study numerous examples and prove in many cases that there cannot be a non-singular mixed identity.</description>

      <title>Torsion groups of subexponential growth cannot act on finite-dimensional CAT(0)-spaces without a fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that finitely generated groups which are Liouville and without infinite finite-dimensional linear representations must have a global fixed point whenever they act by isometry on a finite-dimensional complete CAT(0)-space. This provides a partial answer to an old question in geometric group theory and proves partly a conjecture formulated by Norin, Osajda, and Przytycki. It applies in particular to Grigorchuk's groups of intermediate growth and other branch groups as well as to simple groups with the Liouville property such as those found by Matte Bon and by Nekrashevych. The method of proof uses ultralimits, equivariant harmonic maps, subharmonic functions, horofunctions and random walks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for recognizing whether a character belongs to $\Sigma^m$. In order to apply it we just need to know that the ambient group is of type $\mathrm{FP}_m$ or of type $\mathrm{F}_2$ and that the word problem is solvable for this group. Then finite data is sufficient proof of membership in $\Sigma^m$, not just for the given character but also for a neighborhood of it.</description>

      <title>Entropy of group actions beyond uniform lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropy of measure preserving or continuous actions of amenable discrete groups allows for various equivalent approaches. Among them are the ones given by the techniques developed by Ollagnier and Pinchon on the one hand and the Ornstein-Weiss lemma on the other. We extend these two approaches to the context of actions of amenable topological groups. In contrast to the discrete setting, our results reveal a remarkable difference between the two concepts of entropy in the realm of non-discrete groups: while the first quantity collapses to 0 in the non-discrete case, the second yields a well-behaved invariant for amenable unimodular groups. Concerning the latter, we moreover study the corresponding notion of topological pressure, prove a Goodwyn-type theorem, and establish the equivalence with the uniform lattice approach (for locally compact groups admitting a uniform lattice). Our study elaborates on a version of the Ornstein-Weiss lemma due to Gromov.</description>

      <title>Heat properties for groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit Fourier's approach to solve the heat equation on the circle in the context of (twisted) reduced group C*-algebras, convergence of Fourier series and semigroups associated to negative definite functions. We introduce some heat properties for countably infinite groups and investigate when they are satisfied. Kazhdan's property (T) is an obstruction to the weakest property, and our findings leave open the possibility that this might be the only one. On the other hand, many groups with the Haagerup property satisfy the strongest version. We show that this heat property implies that the associated heat problem has a unique solution regardless of the choice of the initial datum.</description>

      <title>Marked length spectrum rigidity from rigidity on subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for studying length spectrum rigidity problems based on a combination of ideas from dynamical systems and geometric group theory. This allows us to compare the marked length spectrum of metrics and distance-like functions coming from various geometric origins. Using our new perspective, we provide concise proofs of well-known length spectrum rigidity results and are able to extend classical results to a variety of new settings. Our methods rely on studying Manhattan curves and a coarse geometric analogue of Teichm\"uller space equipped with a symmetrized version of the Thurston metric.</description>

      <title>Compact and finite-type support in the homology of big mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any infinite-type surface $S$, a natural question is whether the homology of its mapping class group contains any non-trivial classes that are supported on (i) a compact subsurface or (ii) a finite-type subsurface. Our purpose here is to study this question, in particular giving an almost-complete answer when the genus of $S$ is positive (including infinite) and a partial answer when the genus of $S$ is zero. Our methods involve the notion of shiftable subsurfaces as well as homological stability for mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces.</description>
