      <title>Efficiently driving F$_1$ molecular motor in experiment by suppressing nonequilibrium variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: F$_1$-ATPase (F$_1$) is central to cellular energy transduction. Forcibly rotated by another motor F$_\mathrm{o}$, F$_1$ catalyzes ATP synthesis by converting mechanical work into chemical free energy stored in the molecule ATP. The details of how F$_\mathrm{o}$ drives F$_1$ are not fully understood; however, evaluating efficient ways to rotate F$_1$ could provide fruitful insights into this driving since there is a selective pressure to improve efficiency. Here, we show that rotating F$_1$ with an angle clamp is significantly more efficient than a constant torque. Our experiments, combined with theory and simulation, indicate that the angle clamp significantly suppresses the nonequilibrium variation that contributes to the futile dissipation of input work.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the role of ribosomal A1493 in stabilization and rigid support for the codon-anticodon helix from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ribosome ensures translational accuracy by monitoring codon-anticodon interactions at the A site decoding center. However, the mechanism by which conserved nucleotide A1493 contributes to this process remains controversial. To address this, we performed molecular dynamics simulations initiated from ribosomal recognition intermediate, revealing A1493's multiple roles in decoding. Through 2D umbrella sampling, we quantified the coupling between A1493 flipping and the stability of the first base pair in the codon-anticodon helix. Our results demonstrate that A1493 promotes mRNA-tRNA pairing through entropy-driven stabilization, amplifies stability differences between cognate and near-cognate tRNAs, and functions as a "wedge" to provide rigid support for the codon-anticodon helix. Further analysis identified steric complementarity as essential for proper A1493 flipping, with the tRNA 37th position playing a key structural role. Additionally, we explored how pseudouridine modification and translocation influence codon-anticodon stability. Together, these findings refine the current mechanistic framework of ribosomal decoding.</description>

      <title>Kinetic roughening transition of ice crystals and its implications during recrystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth and morphology of ice crystals are highly sensitive to environmental conditions. Under atmospheric pressure, rapid growth from the liquid phase produces dendritic structures with sixfold symmetry. This morphology results from subtle variations in surface tension linked to crystallographic orientation, which guides arm growth under supercooled conditions. In contrast, slow growth yields disk-shaped crystals with rounded surfaces, suggesting surface roughness on all but the basal planes. Roughening is a thermodynamic phenomenon where a crystal surface becomes non-faceted due to the absence of a step-edge barrier, leading to large surface fluctuations. A kinetic roughening transition is a temperature-dependent shift in growth behaviour, in which faceted surfaces at low temperatures transform into rounded surfaces at higher temperatures. To observe slow growth at low temperatures, supercooling must be minimized, which can be achieved by lowering the melting point. This study investigates the kinetic roughening transition in ice crystals grown in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and proline-water solutions. Using cryomicroscopy and real-time image analysis, we identified a distinct roughening transition temperature (TR = -15.4 oC). At TR, the crystal growth morphology shifted from circular disks at higher temperatures to hexagonal plates at lower temperatures. This transition was solute-independent and governed primarily by temperature. Ice consistently melted as circular disks, regardless of temperature. Recrystallization experiments confirmed that crystals grew as hexagonal plates below TR but melted as disks. We also examined the influence of antifreeze protein III (AFPIII), which binds to specific crystallographic planes and modifies morphology through a distinct mechanism, effectively suppressing kinetic roughening</description>

      <title>Hacktive Matter: data-driven discovery through hackathon-based cross-disciplinary coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past decade has seen unprecedented growth in active matter and autonomous biomaterials research, yielding diverse classes of materials that promise revolutionary applications such as self-healing infrastructure and self-sensing tissue implants. However, inconsistencies in metrics, definitions, and analysis algorithms across research groups, as well as the high-dimension data streams, has hindered identification of performance intersections. Progress in this arena demands multi-disciplinary team approaches to discovery with scaffolded training and cross-pollination of ideas, and requires new learning and collaboration methods. To address this challenge, we have developed a hackathon platform to train future scientists and engineers in big data, interdisciplinary collaboration, and community coding; and to design and beta-test high-throughput (HTP) biomaterials analysis software and workflows. We enforce a flat hierarchy, pairing participants ranging from high school students to faculty with varied experiences and skills to collectively contribute to data acquisition and processing, ideation, coding, testing and dissemination. With clearly-defined goals and deliverables, participants achieve success through a series of tutorials, small group coding sessions, facilitated breakouts, and large group report-outs and discussions. These modules facilitate efficient iterative algorithm development and optimization; strengthen community and collaboration skills; and establish teams, benchmarks, and community standards for continued productive work. Our hackathons provide a powerful model for the soft matter community to educate and train students and collaborators in cutting edge data-driven analysis, which is critical for future innovation in complex materials research.</description>

      <title>The geometric nature of homeostatic stress in biological growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Morphogenesis, the process of growth and shape formation in biological tissues, is driven by complex interactions between mechanical, biochemical, and genetic factors. Traditional models of biological growth often rely on the concept of homeostatic Eshelby stress, which defines an ideal target state for the growing body. Any local deviation from this state triggers growth and remodelling, aimed at restoring balance between mechanical forces and biological adaptation. Despite its relevance in the biomechanical context, the nature of homeostatic stress remains elusive, with its value and spatial distribution often chosen arbitrarily, lacking a clear biological interpretation or understanding of its connection to the lower scales of the tissue. To bring clarity on the nature of homeostatic stress, we shift the focus from Eshelby stress to growth incompatibility, a measure of geometric frustration in the tissue that is the primary source of residual stresses in the developing body. Incompatibility, measured by the Ricci tensor of the growth metric at the continuous level, can be potentially regulated at the cell level through connections with the surrounding cells, making it a more meaningful concept than homeostatic stress. In this geometric perspective, achieving a homeostatic state corresponds to the establishment of a physiological level of frustration in the body, a process leading to the generation and maintenance of the mechanical stresses that are crucial to tissue functionality. In this work we present a formulation of biological growth that penalises deviations from a desired state of incompatibility, similar to the way the Einstein-Hilbert action operates in General Relativity. The proposed framework offers a clear and physically grounded approach that elucidates the regulation of size and shape, while providing a means to link cellular and tissue scales in biological systems.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Imaging of Plant Delayed Luminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Delayed luminescence (DL) is a quantized signal that is characteristic of photoexcited molecules entering a relaxed state. Studying DL provides critical insight into photophysical mechanisms via analysis of specific spatiotemporal dynamics. In this study, we developed a high-sensitivity DL imaging system using a quantitative scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (qCMOS) camera and a single-photon counting resolution. By optimizing the optical architecture and signal processing algorithms together, we achieved full-field spatiotemporal DL imaging at megapixel resolution (i.e., 2304 $\times$ 4096 pixels). Key findings include the following: (1) we observed spatial heterogeneity in DL intensity across the leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana, with stronger signals detected in veins and at sites of mechanical injury; (2) species-specific DL responses occurred in response to oxidative stress, with Hydrocotyle vulgaris and Ginkgo biloba showing enhanced central DL activity; (3) Excitation using white light induced maximum DL intensity, while red and blue light differentially modulated decay kinetics. Finally, we develop a two-level quantum model that links DL dynamics to the populations of excited-state electrons, thereby developing a theoretical framework for future photophysical research. Overall, this work may help future studies of plant phenotyping under stress and light environment optimization.</description>
