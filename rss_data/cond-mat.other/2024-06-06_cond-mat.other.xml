      <title>Construction and Observation of Flexibly Controllable High-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Skin Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is one of the most fundamental phenomena in non-Hermitian physics. Although it is established that one-dimensional NHSE originates from the nontrivial spectral winding topology, the topological origin behind the higher-dimensional NHSE remains unclear so far. This poses a substantial challenge in constructing and manipulating high-dimensional NHSEs. Here, an intuitive bottom-to-top scheme to construct high-dimensional NHSEs is proposed, through assembling multiple independent one-dimensional NHSEs. Not only the elusive high-dimensional NHSEs can be effectively predicted from the well-defined one-dimensional spectral winding topologies, but also the high-dimensional generalized Brillouin zones can be directly synthesized from the one-dimensional counterparts. As examples, two two-dimensional nonreciprocal acoustic metamaterials are experimentally implemented to demonstrate highly controllable multi-polar NHSEs and hybrid skin-topological effects, where the sound fields can be frequency-selectively localized at any desired corners and boundaries. These results offer a practicable strategy for engineering high-dimensional NHSEs, which could boost advanced applications such as selective filters and directional amplifiers.</description>

      <title>SO($N$) singlet-projection model on the pyrochlore lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extensive quantum Monte Carlo study of a nearest-neighbor, singlet-projection model on the pyrochlore lattice that exhibits SO($N$) symmetry and is sign-problem-free. We find that in contrast to the previously studied two-dimensional variations of this model that harbor critical points between their ground state phases, the non-bipartite pyrochlore lattice in three spatial dimensions appears to exhibit a first-order transition between a magnetically-ordered phase and some, as yet uncharacterized, paramagnetic phase. We also observe that the magnetically-ordered phase survives to a relatively large value of $N=8$, and that it is gone for $N=9$.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of the vanishing EELS cross section in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In transmission electron energy-loss spectroscopy, the cross section in 2D is quenched by kinematic effects once the momentum transfer becomes smaller than a critical value set by $q_z$, the momentum loss parallel to the beam. Our highly momentum ($\Delta q = 0.02$~\r{A}$^{-1}$) and energy ($\Delta E = 45$~meV) resolved setup is instrumental on delivering the unprecedented experimental verification of quenched 2D EEL spectra on freestanding graphene at momentum transfers $q$ below $0.06$\r{A}$^{-1}$. We retrieve the intrinsic uniform dielectric response of graphene from measured spectra by quantifying the kinematic suppression.</description>
