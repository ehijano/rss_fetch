      <title>Electric field of DNA in solution: who is in charge?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solution, DNA is a highly charged macromolecule which bears a unit of negative charge on each phosphate of its sugar-phosphate backbone. Although partially compensated by counterions adsorbed at or condensed near it, DNA still produces a substantial electric field in its vicinity, which is screened by buffer electrolyte at longer distances from the DNA. Such field has been explored so far predominantly within the scope of a primitive model of the electrolytic solution, not considering more complicated structural effects of the water solvent. In this paper we investigate the distribution of electric field around DNA using linear response nonlocal electrostatic theory, applied here for helix-specific charge distributions, and compare the predictions of such theory with specially performed fully atomistic large scale molecular dynamics simulations. The main finding of this study is that oscillations in the electrostatic potential distribution are present around DNA, caused by the overscreening effect of structured water. Surprisingly, electrolyte ions at physiological concentrations do not strongly disrupt these oscillations, and rather distribute according to these oscillating patterns, indicating that water structural effects dominate the short-range electrostatics. We also show that (i) structured water adsorbed in the grooves of DNA lead to a positive electrostatic potential core, (ii) the Debye length some 10 {\AA} away from the DNA is reduced, effectively renormalised by the helical pitch of the DNA, and (iii) Lorentzian contributions to the nonlocal dielectric function of water, effectively reducing the dielectric constant close to the DNA, enhances the overall electric field. The impressive agreement between the atomistic simulations and the developed theory substantiates the use of nonlocal electrostatics when considering solvent effects in molecular processes in biology.</description>

      <title>A universal phase-field mixture representation of thermodynamics and shock wave mechanics in porous soft biologic continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A continuum mixture theory is formulated for large deformations, thermal effects, phase interactions, and degradation of soft biologic tissues. Such tissues consist of one or more solid and fluid phases and can demonstrate nonlinear anisotropic elastic, viscoelastic, thermoelastic, and poroelastic physics. Under extremely large or rapid deformations, for example impact or shock loading, tissues may fracture, tear, or rupture. Mechanisms are encompassed in a universal, thermodynamically consistent formulation that combines the continuum theory of mixtures with phase-field mechanics of fracture. A metric tensor of generalized Finsler space supplies geometric insight on effects rearrangements of microstructure, for example degrading collagen fibers. Governing equations are derived, and energy potentials and kinetic laws posited, for generic soft porous tissues with solid and liquid or gas phases. Shock waves are modeled as singular surfaces; Hugoniot states and shock decay are studied analytically. Suitability of the framework for representing blood, skeletal muscle, and liver is demonstrated. Insight into physics presently unresolved by experiments is obtained.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Molecular Magic: AI Insights on the Formation of Extraordinarily Stretchable Hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deliberate manipulation of ammonium persulfate, methylenebisacrylamide, dimethyleacrylamide, and polyethylene oxide concentrations resulted in the development of a hydrogel with an exceptional stretchability, capable of extending up to 260 times its original length. This study aims to elucidate the molecular architecture underlying this unique phenomenon by exploring potential reaction mechanisms, facilitated by an artificial intelligence prediction system. Artificial intelligence predictor introduces a novel approach to interlinking two polymers, involving the formation of networks interconnected with linear chains following random chain scission. This novel configuration leads to the emergence of a distinct type of hydrogel, herein referred to as a "Span Network." Additionally, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is used to investigate functional groups that may be implicated in the proposed mechanism, with ester formation confirmed among numerous hydroxyl end groups obtained from chain scission of PEO and carboxyl groups formed on hydrogel networks.</description>

      <title>Bending-Rotation coupling in the viscoelasticity of semi-flexible polymers -- Rigorous perturbation analysis from the rod limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian motion and viscoelasticity of semi-flexible polymers is a subject that has been studied for many years. Still, rigorous analysis has been hindered due to the difficulty in handling the constraint that polymer chains cannot be stretched along the contour. Here, we show a straightforward method to solve the problem. We consider a stiff polymer that has a persistent length $L_p$ much larger than the contour length $L$. We express the polymer configuration using three types of variables: the position vector of the center of mass $R_c$, the unit vector $n$ along the main axis, and the normal coordinates $u_p$ for bending. Solving the Smoluchowski equation for the distribution function of these variables, we calculate the equilibrium time correlation function $ \langle P(t)\cdot P(0) \rangle$ of the end-to-end vector $P$ and the complex modulus $G^*(\omega)$ of dilute solution. They include the bending effect to the first order in $\theta \equiv L/L_p$ and reduce to the exact results for the rigid rod in the limit of $\theta \to 0$. The rotational diffusion coefficient increases slightly by the semi-flexibility because the equilibrium length of the semi-flexible polymer is smaller than that of the rigid rod with the same contour length. The storage modulus shows the same asymptotic dependence $G'(\omega) \sim \omega^{3/4}$ predicted by Shankar, Pasquali, and Morse [J. Rheol. 2002, 46, 1111--1154]. The high-frequency viscosity is predicted to be dependent on the thickness of the semi-flexible polymers.</description>

      <title>Chemical Reactions regulated by Phase-Separated Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-separated liquid condensates can spatially organize and thereby regulate chemical processes. However, the physicochemical mechanisms underlying such regulation remain elusive as the intramolecular interactions responsible for phase separation give rise to a coupling between diffusion and chemical reactions at non-dilute conditions. Here, we derive a theoretical framework that decouples the phase separation of scaffold molecules from the reaction kinetics of diluted clients. As a result, phase volume and client partitioning coefficients become control parameters, which enables us to dissect the impact of phase-separated condensates on chemical reactions. We apply this framework to two chemical processes and show how condensates affect the yield of reversible chemical reactions and the initial rate of a simple assembly process. In both cases, we find an optimal condensate volume at which the respective chemical reaction property is maximal. Our work can be applied to experimentally quantify how condensed phases alter chemical processes in systems biology and unravel the mechanisms of how biomolecular condensates regulate biochemistry in living cells.</description>

      <title>Non-additivity in many-body interactions between membrane-deforming spheres increases disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membrane-induced interactions have been predicted to be important for the organization of membrane proteins. Measurements of the interactions between two and three membrane deforming objects have revealed their non-additive nature. They are thought to lead to complex many-body effects, however, experimental evidence is lacking to date. We here present an experimental method to measure many-body effects in membrane-mediated interactions using colloidal spheres placed between a deflated giant unilamellar vesicles and a planar substrate. The thus confined colloidal particles cause a large deformation of the membrane while not being physochemically attached to it and interact through it. Two particles are found to attract with a maximum force of 0.2~pN. For three particles, we observe a preference for forming compact equilateral triangles over a linear arrangement. We use numerical energy minimization to establish that the attraction stems from a reduction in the membrane-deformation energy caused by the particles. Confining up to 36 particles, we find a preference for hexagonally close packed clusters. However, with increasing number of particles the order of the confined particles decreases, while at the same time, diffusivity of the particles increases. Our experiments for the first time show that the non-additive nature of membrane-mediated interactions affects the interactions and arrangements and ultimately leads to spherical aggregates with liquid-like order of potential importance for cellular processes.</description>

      <title>Closely piling up of multiple adhesive fronts in adhesive friction due to re-attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand why the adhesive frictional force was in linear proportion to the real contact area in experiments, we investigate the adhesive friction generated by sliding elastic solids adhered to a rigid surface via multiple adhesive springs. Our results indicate that the shear-off force of the interface increases with the energetically guided re-attachment rate of adhesive springs, reaching saturation at high re-attachment rates. Remarkably, this shear-off force can surpass the predictions made by the fracture theory. By plotting the adhesive forces along the interface, we observe substantial high adhesive forces distributed throughout the interface, based on which we identify multiple adhesive fronts closely piling up along the interface. These regions can exhibit similar force profiles, and their number appears to increase with the size of the interface, leading to a linear increase in the calculated shear-off force with the size of the interface. We then suggest that multiple adhesive fronts closely pile up to back up each other in adhesive friction due to re-attachments, which may provide profound insights into understanding the observed phenomena associated with adhesive friction along an interface.</description>

      <title>A scalable method to model large suspensions of colloidal phoretic particles with arbitrary shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phoretic colloids self-propel thanks to surface flows generated in response to surface gradients (thermal, electrical, or chemical), that are self-induced and/or generated by other particles. Here we present a scalable and versatile framework to model chemical and hydrodynamic interactions in large suspensions of arbitrarily shaped phoretic particles, accounting for thermal fluctuations at all Damkholer numbers. Our approach, inspired by the Boundary Element Method (BEM), employs second-layer formulations, regularised kernels and a grid optimisation strategy to solve the coupled Laplace-Stokes equations with reasonable accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost associated with BEM. As demonstrated by our large-scale simulations, the capabilities of our method enable the exploration of new physical phenomena that, to our knowledge, have not been previously addressed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Simulating dynamics of ellipsoidal particles using lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic particles are often encountered in different fields of soft matter and complex fluids. In this work, we present an implementation of the coupled hydrodynamics of solid ellipsoidal particles and the surrounding fluid using the lattice Boltzmann method. A standard link-based mechanism is used to implement the solid-fluid boundary conditions. We develop an implicit method to update the position and orientation of the ellipsoid. This exploits the relations between the quaternion which describes the ellipsoid's orientation and the ellipsoid's angular velocity to obtain a stable and robust dynamic update. The proposed algorithm is validated by looking at four scenarios: (i) the steady translational velocity of a spheroid subject to an external force in different orientations, (ii) the drift of an inclined spheroid subject to an imposed force, (iii) three-dimensional rotational motions in a simple shear flow (Jeffrey's orbits), and (iv) developed fluid flows and self-propulsion exhibited by a spheroidal microswimmer. In all cases the comparison of numerical results showed good agreement with known analytical solutions, irrespective of the choice of the fluid properties, geometrical parameters, and lattice Boltzmann model, thus demonstrating the robustness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Freezing delay of a drop impacting on a monolayer of cold grains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a subfreezing droplet impact scenario in a low-humidity environment, where the target is a cold granular monolayer. When the undercooling degree of targets passes a threshold, such a granular layer effectively postpones the bulk freezing time of the droplet in comparison with the impact on the bare substrate underneath. In this case, the retraction of the droplet after impact reduces the contact area with the cold substrate, even though both the grains and the substrate are wettable to the liquid. We find that the significant changes in the dynamic behavior are triggered by freezing the liquid that wets the pores. Owing to the small dimension of the pores, the freezing process is rapid enough to match the dynamics over the droplet dimension. In certain circumstances, the rapid freezing may even stop liquid penetration and shed icing from the underneath surface.</description>

      <title>Integrating local energetics into Maxwell-Calladine constraint counting to design mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Maxwell-Calladine index theorem plays a central role in our current understanding of the mechanical rigidity of discrete materials. By considering the geometric constraints each material component imposes on a set of underlying degrees of freedom, the theorem relates the emergence of rigidity to constraint counting arguments. However, the Maxwell-Calladine paradigm is significantly limited -- its exclusive reliance on the geometric relationships between constraints and degrees of freedom completely neglects the actual energetic costs of deforming individual components. To address this limitation, we derive a generalization of the Maxwell-Calladine index theorem based on susceptibilities that naturally incorporate local energetic properties such as stiffness and prestress. Using this extended framework, we investigate how local energetics modify the classical constraint counting picture to capture the relationship between deformations and external forces. We then combine this formalism with group representation theory to design mechanical metamaterials where differences in symmetry between local energy costs and structural geometry are exploited to control responses to external forces.</description>

      <title>Transformable Super-Isostatic Crystals Self-Assembled from Segment Colloidal Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colloidal particles can spontaneously self-assemble into ordered structures, which not only can manipulate the propagation of light, but also vibration or phonons. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we study the self-assembly of perfectly aligned segment rod particles with lateral flat cutting. Under the help of surface attractions, we find that particles with different cutting degree can self-assemble into different crystal phases characterized by bond coordination z that varies from 3 to 6. Importantly, we identify a transformable super-isostatic structures with pgg symmetry and redundant bonds (z=5). We find that this structure can support either the soft bulk model or soft edge model depending on its Poisson's ratio which can be tuned from positive to negative by a uniform soft deformation. Importantly, the bulk soft modes are associated with states of self-stress along the direction of zero strain during the uniform soft deformation. This self-assembled transformable super-isostatic structure may act as mechanical metamaterials with potential application in micro-mechanical engineering.</description>

Abstract: Liquid crystals are the prototype of the so-called soft condensed matter. In simple terms they are "structured liquids" that historically have received a lot of interest because they help to generate new concepts and knowledge in Physics, and possess important electro--optical applications, e. g., in displays of mobile computers and telephones. More recently, it has been discovered that liquid crystals could be applied in fabrication of metamaterials and in biomedicine where they are potentially useful for tissue identification, controlled drug delivery and detection of bacteria and viruses. However, in Mexico, liquid crystals courses are included only in a few undergraduate programs on Physics being elective in most of the cases. Therefore, literature for teaching about liquid crystals in Spanish is scarce. In this paper we will discuss about elementary Physics of liquid crystals and the mathematical tools that permit to analyze them. We will explain, mainly, how to analytically characterize the symmetry and order of static uniaxial nematic liquid crystals, the most simple of all liquid crystal phases. We will conduct this explanation in basic terms, suitable for science and engineering students at intermediate undergraduate level, with knowledge about linear algebra and vector calculus, willing to approach for the first time to this subject. Our goal is to support the Latin American scientific community in preparing human resources in this field. The article is written in Spanish to contribute to the establishment and communication of concepts that only exist in other languages in the specialized literature.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Structural Effects of Water on DNA Homology Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03213v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanism behind mutual recognition of homologous DNA sequences prior to genetic recombination is one of the remaining puzzles in molecular biology. Leading models of homology recognition, based on classical electrostatics, neglect the short-range nonlocal screening effects arising from structured water around DNA, and hence may only provide insight for relatively large separations between interacting DNAs. We elucidate the role of the effects of the nonlocal dielectric response of water on DNA-DNA interaction and show that these can dramatically enhance the driving force for recognition.</description>
