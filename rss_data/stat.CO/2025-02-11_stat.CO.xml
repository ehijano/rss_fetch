      <title>Predictive Coresets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern data analysis often involves massive datasets with hundreds of thousands of observations, making traditional inference algorithms computationally prohibitive. Coresets are selection methods designed to choose a smaller subset of observations while maintaining similar learning performance. Conventional coreset approaches determine these weights by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the likelihood functions of the full and weighted datasets; as a result, this makes them ill-posed for nonparametric models, where the likelihood is often intractable. We propose an alternative variational method which employs randomized posteriors and finds weights to match the unknown posterior predictive distributions conditioned on the full and reduced datasets. Our approach provides a general algorithm based on predictive recursions suitable for nonparametric priors. We evaluate the performance of the proposed coreset construction on diverse problems, including random partitions and density estimation.</description>

      <title>Case for a unified surrogate modelling framework in the age of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate models are widely used in natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning to approximate complex systems and reduce computational costs. However, the current landscape lacks standardisation across key stages of the pipeline, including data collection, sampling design, model class selection, evaluation metrics, and downstream task performance analysis. This fragmentation limits reproducibility, reliability, and cross-domain applicability. The issue has only been exacerbated by the AI revolution and a new suite of surrogate model classes that it offers. In this position paper, we argue for the urgent need for a unified framework to guide the development and evaluation of surrogate models. We outline essential steps for constructing a comprehensive pipeline and discuss alternative perspectives, such as the benefits of domain-specific frameworks. By advocating for a standardised approach, this paper seeks to improve the reliability of surrogate modelling, foster cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer, and, as a result, accelerate scientific progress.</description>

      <title>Approximate Bayesian inference for joint partially linear modeling of longitudinal measurements and spatial time-to-event data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of longitudinal measurements and survival time in statistical modeling offers a powerful framework for capturing the interplay between these two essential outcomes, particularly when they exhibit associations. However, in scenarios where spatial dependencies among entities are present due to geographic regions, traditional approaches may fall short. In response, this paper introduces a novel approximate Bayesian hierarchical model tailored for jointly analyzing longitudinal and spatial survival outcomes. The model leverages a conditional autoregressive structure to incorporate spatial effects, while simultaneously employing a joint partially linear model to capture the nonlinear influence of time on longitudinal responses. Through extensive simulation studies, the efficacy of the proposed method is rigorously evaluated. Furthermore, its practical utility is demonstrated through an application to real-world HIV/AIDS data sourced from various Brazilian states, showcasing its adaptability and relevance in epidemiological research.</description>

      <title>A fresh view on Least Quantile of Squares Regression based on new optimization approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regression analysis is an important instrument to determine the effect of the explanatory variables on response variables. When outliers and bias errors are present, the standard weighted least squares estimator may perform poorly. For this reason, many alternative robust techniques have been studied in literature. In these terms, the Least Squares Quantile (LQS), and in particular the Least Squares Median, are among the regression estimators that exhibit better robustness properties. However, the accurate computation of this estimators is computationally demanding, resulting in a difficult estimator to obtain. In this paper, new novel approaches to compute a global optimal solution for the LQS estimator based on single-level and bilevel optimization methods are proposed. An extensive computational study is provided to support the efficiency of the methods considered, and an ad hoc procedure to address the scalability of the problem to larger instances is proposed.</description>

      <title>An efficient Monte Carlo method for valid prior-free possibilistic statistical inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferential models (IMs) offer prior-free, Bayesian-like, posterior degrees of belief designed for statistical inference, which feature a frequentist-like calibration property that ensures reliability of said inferences. The catch is that IMs' degrees of belief are possibilistic rather than probabilistic and, since the familiar Monte Carlo methods approximate probabilistic quantities, there are computational challenges associated with putting the IM framework into practice. The present paper addresses this shortcoming by developing a new Monte Carlo-based tool designed specifically to approximate the IM's possibilistic output. The proposal is based on a characterization of the possibilistic IM's credal set, which identifies the "best probabilistic approximation" of the IM as a mixture distribution that can be readily approximated and sampled from; these samples can then be transformed into a possibilistic approximation of the IM. Numerical results are presented highlighting the proposed approximation's accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Bhirkuti's Test of Bias Acceptance: Examining in Psychometric Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces Bhirkuti's Test of Bias Acceptance, a systematic graphical framework for evaluating bias and determining its acceptability under varying experimental conditions. Absolute Relative Bias (ARB), while useful for understanding bias, is sensitive to outliers and population parameter magnitudes, often overstating bias for small values and understating it for larger ones. Similarly, Relative Efficiency (RE) can be influenced by variance differences and outliers, occasionally producing counterintuitive values exceeding 100%, which complicates interpretation. By addressing the limitations of traditional metrics such as Absolute Relative Bias (ARB) and Relative Efficiency (RE), the proposed graphical methodology framework leverages ridgeline plots and standardized estimate to provide a comprehensive visualization of parameter estimate distributions. Ridgeline plots done this way offer a robust alternative by visualizing full distributions, highlighting variability, trends, outliers, descriptives and facilitating more informed decision-making. This study employs multivariate Latent Growth Models (LGM) and Monte Carlo simulations to examine the performance of growth curve modeling under planned missing data designs, focusing on parameter estimate recovery and efficiency. By combining innovative visualization techniques with rigorous simulation methods, Bhirkuti's Test of Bias Acceptance provides two methods of versatile and interpretable toolset for advancing quantitative research in bias evaluation and efficiency assessment.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Inference for Spatial Data Using Low-Rank Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in information technology have enabled the creation of massive spatial datasets, driving the need for scalable and efficient computational methodologies. While offering viable solutions, centralized frameworks are limited by vulnerabilities such as single-point failures and communication bottlenecks. This paper presents a decentralized framework tailored for parameter inference in spatial low-rank models to address these challenges. A key obstacle arises from the spatial dependence among observations, which prevents the log-likelihood from being expressed as a summation-a critical requirement for decentralized optimization approaches. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel objective function leveraging the evidence lower bound, which facilitates the use of decentralized optimization techniques. Our approach employs a block descent method integrated with multi-consensus and dynamic consensus averaging for effective parameter optimization. We prove the convexity of the new objective function in the vicinity of the true parameters, ensuring the convergence of the proposed method. Additionally, we present the first theoretical results establishing the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator within the context of spatial low-rank models. Extensive simulations and real-world data experiments corroborate these theoretical findings, showcasing the robustness and scalability of the framework.</description>
