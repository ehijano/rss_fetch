      <title>Symmetry-mediated quantum coherence of $W^{5+}$ spins in an oxygen-deficient double perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidating the factors limiting quantum coherence in real materials is essential to the development of quantum technologies. Here we report a strategic approach to determine the effect of lattice dynamics on spin coherence lifetimes using oxygen deficient double perovskites as host materials. In addition to obtaining millisecond $T_1$ spin-lattice lifetimes at T ~ 10 K, measurable quantum superpositions were observed up to room temperature. We determine that $T_2$ enhancement in $Sr_2CaWO_{6-\delta}$ over previously studied $Ba_2CaWO_{6-\delta}$ is caused by a dynamically-driven increase in effective site symmetry around the dominant paramagnetic site, assigned as $W^{5+}$ via electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Further, a combination of experimental and computational techniques enabled quantification of the relative strength of spin-phonon coupling of each phonon mode. This analysis demonstrates the effect of thermodynamics and site symmetry on the spin lifetimes of $W^{5+}$ paramagnetic defects, an important step in the process of reducing decoherence to produce longer-lived qubits.</description>

      <title>Design Kinetic Parameters for Improved Resilience of Materials under Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High entropy alloys (HEAs) have captured much attention in recent years due to their conceivably improved radiation resistance compared to pure metals and traditional alloys. However, among HEAs, there are millions of design possibilities considering all potential compositions. In this study, we develop criteria to design HEAs with improved radiation resilience taking into consideration defect properties to promote interstitial-vacancy recombination. First, we conduct rate theory calculations on defects followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on pure W and W-based multicomponent concentrated alloys. It is found that when the diffusion coefficients for single vacancies and interstitials become similar and the effective migration energies of defects is minimum (maximum diffusivities), defect recombination becomes optimal, and the concentration of defects is significantly reduced. This is supported by MD simulations indicating improved radiation resistance of V- and Cr-based alloys, which satisfy the above-stated criteria. Furthermore, experimental observations also reinforce the proposed approach. This study sheds light on the design criteria for improved radiation resistance and helps material selection without the need of extensive experimental work.</description>

      <title>Harmonic-Induced Plasmonic Resonant Energy Transfer between Metal and Semiconductor Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures combining two or more metal and/or semiconductor nanoparticles exhibit enhanced upconversion arising from localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs). However, coupled plasmon-exciton systems are slowed by excitonic relaxation and metallic multi-plasmon systems are not broadly tunable. Here, we describe a heterostructure in which insulating alumina layers vary separation between CuS and Au nanoparticles, allowing experimental confirmation of the d^(-6) dependence typical of surface-dipole mediated interactions between Au and CuS plasmons, as demonstrated in Lumerical simulations. Transient-absorption spectroscopy shows faster plasmon relaxation in heterostructured Au/CuS (690 fs) than CuS nanoparticles (929 fs), signifying direct energy transfer. Moreover, coupling between the second-harmonic LSPRs of CuS and the fundamental LSPR in Au is evident in nonlinear absorption measurement. This defines a novel harmonic-induced plasmonic resonant energy transfer (HIPRET) dynamic linking the metallic Au plasmon and the broad semiconductor plasmon in CuS. This prototype for tunable, ultrafast plasmonic upconversion exemplifies a strategy for high-efficiency nonlinear nanodevices that have promising applications in photocatalysis, parametric down-conversion and biomedical imaging.</description>

      <title>Advancing Simulations of Coupled Electron and Phonon Nonequilibrium Dynamics Using Adaptive and Multirate Time Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic structure calculations in the time domain provide a deeper understanding of nonequilibrium dynamics in materials. The real-time Boltzmann equation (rt-BTE), used in conjunction with accurate interactions computed from first principles, has enabled reliable predictions of coupled electron and lattice dynamics. However, the timescales and system sizes accessible with this approach are still limited, with two main challenges being the different timescales of electron and phonon interactions and the cost of computing collision integrals. As a result, only a few examples of these calculations exist, mainly for two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here we leverage adaptive and multirate time integration methods to achieve a major step forward in solving the coupled rt-BTEs for electrons and phonons. Relative to conventional (non-adaptive) time-stepping, our approach achieves a 10x speedup for a given target accuracy, or greater accuracy by 3-6 orders of magnitude for the same computational cost, enabling efficient calculations in both 2D and bulk materials. This efficiency is showcased by computing the coupled electron and lattice dynamics in graphene up to $\sim$100 ps, as well as modeling ultrafast lattice dynamics and thermal diffuse scattering maps in a bulk material (silicon). These results open new opportunities for quantitative studies of nonequilibrium physics in materials.</description>

      <title>The spin-switch scanning tunneling microscopy: an architecture to probe electron-phonon interactions in the atomic scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the spin-valve-like ferromagnet/spin glass/ferromagnet (FM/SG/FM) structure, the tunneling current is dominated by resistance switch (RS) instead of the local density of states according to the conventional tunneling theory. Here we show lattice-site dependent RS behaviors in one-quintuple-layer Bi2Te3 deposited on single MnBi2Te4 septuple layer, which comes from the difference in the efficiency of tunneling electrons to induce focused current or phonons at different sites, switching remotely the spin valve by spin-transfer torque or spin-phonon interactions. These lead to the observation of the dynamic 2-state lattice when the tip scans across the surface as well as the ability of scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to reveal atomic-scale features of electron-phonon (EP) interactions. Our work demonstrates the possibility of the spin-switch STM to image lattice-site dependent EP interactions of any materials deposited on the FM/SG/FM structure.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic Dark Excitonic Mott Insulator in the Breathing-Kagome Lattice Material Nb$_3$Cl$_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of flat bands (FBs) in breathing Kagome lattices (BKLs), we present a detailed first-principles study of the optical response of single-layer (SL) Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ using the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) method, incorporating self-energy corrections and excitonic effects. Our findings reveal a rich spectrum of strongly bound excitons. The key results are fourfold: (i) SL Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ exhibits a dark spin-triplet Frenkel exciton ground state with binding energy substantially larger than the GW-renormalized band gap, giving rise to a negative exciton energy peak at $-0.14$ eV and indicating an excitonic Mott insulator phase potentially stable at room temperature ($k_B T = 0.025$ eV); (ii) the brightest exciton peak appears at 1.2 eV, in excellent agreement with experimental optical absorption spectra. (iii) We map the low-energy Frenkel exciton system onto a Hubbard model with spin-1 particles on a triangular lattice, resulting in frustrated spin configurations due to antiferromagnetic spin-spin exchange interaction. (iv) As the spin-triplet Frenkel excitons have electric dipoles that interact with each other via electric dipole-dipole interaction, we obtain antiferroelectric ordering, possibly stable at room temperature. Thus, we propose that Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ is a multiferroic dark spin-triplet excitonic Mott insulator.</description>

      <title>Mass Acquisition of Dirac Fermions in Bi4I4 by Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive Dirac fermions, which are essential for realizing novel topological phenomena, are expected to be generated from massless Dirac fermions by breaking the related symmetry, such as time-reversal symmetry (TRS) in topological insulators or crystal symmetry in topological crystalline insulators. Here, we report scanning tunneling microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies of {\alpha}-Bi4I4, which reveals the realization of massive Dirac fermions in the (100) surface states without breaking the TRS. Combined with first-principle calculations, our experimental results indicate that the spontaneous symmetry breaking engenders two nondegenerate edges states at the opposite sides of monolayer Bi4I4 after the structural phase transition, imparting mass to the Dirac fermions after taking the interlayer coupling into account. Our results not only demonstrate the formation of the massive Dirac fermions by spontaneous symmetry breaking, but also imply the potential for the engineering of Dirac fermions for device applications.</description>

      <title>Transport resistance dominates the fill factor losses in record organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic photovoltaics are a promising solar cell technology well-suited to mass production using roll-to-roll processes. The efficiency of lab-scale solar cells has exceeded 20% and considerable attention is currently being given to understanding and minimising the remaining loss mechanisms preventing higher efficiencies. While recent efficiency improvements are partly owed to reducing non-radiative recombination losses at open-circuit, the low fill factor due to a significant transport resistance is becoming the Achilles heel of organic photovoltaics. The term transport resistance refers to a voltage and light intensity dependent charge collection loss in low-mobility materials. In this Perspective, we demonstrate that even the highest efficiency organic solar cells reported to-date have significant performance losses that can be attributed to transport resistance and that lead to high fill factor losses. We provide a closer look at the transport resistance and the material properties influencing it. We describe how to experimentally characterise and quantify the transport resistance by providing easy to follow instructions. Furthermore, the causes and theory behind transport resistance are detailed. In particular, we integrate the relevant figures of merit and different viewpoints on the transport resistance. Finally, we outline strategies that can be followed to minimise these charge collection losses in future solar cells.</description>

      <title>On the construction of explicit analytical driving forces for crack nucleation in the phase field approach to brittle fracture with application to Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager strength surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of recent papers have modified the classical variational phase-field fracture models to successfully predict both the nucleation and propagation of cracks in brittle fracture under general loading conditions. This is done through the introduction of a consistent crack nucleation driving force in the phase field governing equations, which results in the model being able to capture both the strength surface and fracture toughness of the material. This driving force has been presented in the literature for the case of Drucker-Prager strength surface and specific choice of stress states on the strength surface that are captured exactly for finite values of the phase field regularization length parameter $\varepsilon$. Here we present an explicit analytical expression for this driving force given a general material strength surface when the functional form of the strength locus is linear in the material parameter coefficients. In the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$, the formulation reproduces the exact material strength surface and for finite $\varepsilon$ the strength surface is captured at any n 'distinct' points on the strength surface where n is the minimum number of material coefficients required to describe it. The presentation of the driving force in the current work facilitates the easy demonstration of its consistent nature. Further, in the equation governing crack nucleation, the toughness in the classical models is shown to be replaced by an effective toughness in the modified theory, that is dependent on the stress. The derived analytical expressions are verified via application to the widely employed Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager strength surfaces.</description>

      <title>Segregation, ordering, and precipitation in refractory alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tungsten-based low-activation high-entropy alloys are possible candidates for next-generation fusion reactors due to their exceptional tolerance to irradiation, thermal loads, and stress. We develop an accurate and efficient machine-learned interatomic potential for the W-Ta-Cr-V system and use it in hybrid Monte Carlo molecular dynamics simulations of ordering and segregation to all common types of defects in WTaCrV. The predictions are compared to atom probe tomography analysis of segregation and precipitation in WTaCrV thin films. By also considering two other alloys, WTaV and MoNbTaVW, we are able to draw general conclusions about preferred segregation in refractory alloys and the reasons behind it, guiding future alloy design and elucidating experimental observations. We show that the experimentally observed CrV precipitates in WTaCrV form semicoherent bcc-to-bcc interfaces with the surrounding matrix, as coherent precipitates are not thermodynamically stable due to excessive lattice mismatch. The predictions from simulations align well with our atom probe tomography analysis as well as previous experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Chiral Phonons Enhance Ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments suggest that the conditions for ferromagnetic order in, e.g., magnetite, can be modified by adsorption of chiral molecules. Especially, the coercivity of magnetite was increased by nearly 100 \%, or 20 times the earth magnetic flux density, at room temperature. The coercivity was, moreover, demonstrated to increase linearly with temperature in a finite range around room temperature. Based on these results, a mechanism is proposed for providing the necessary enhancement of the magnetic anisotropy. It is shown that nuclear vibrations (phonons) coupled to ferromagnetic spin excitations (magnons) absorb the thermal energy in the system, thereby diverting the excess energy that otherwise would excite magnons in the ferromagnet. This energy diversion, not only restores the ferromagnetic order but also enhances its stability by increasing the anisotropy energy for magnon excitations. The coupling between phonons with magnons is enabled by chirality due to the lack of inversion symmetry.</description>

      <title>Paradoxical creation of a polydomain pattern by electric field in BaTiO3 crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that ferroelectric single crystals can be turned from a polydomain to a monodomain state by the application of an electric field. Here we report an unexpected opposite effect: the formation of through-the-crystal polydomain pattern in a monodomain BaTiO3 crystal in response to the applied electric field favoring the initial orientation of the polarization. The effect is achieved for special electric field direction which equally selects two domain states, which are present in the polydomain pattern. At the formation of the pattern, the new wedge domains propagate from the sides of the sample in the direction transverse to the electric field. The observations are rationalized in terms of a simple analytical model treating energies of competing domain configurations as functions of the electric field. The results of the analytical treatment are supported by phase field modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallium oxide is a novel advanced material gaining increasing attention for its unique combination of functional properties. It forms in several phases or polymorphs - {\alpha}, {\beta}, {\gamma}, and {\kappa} - having variable properties because of different lattice symmetries. Optical properties are of particular importance as they determine specific device applications and can also be used for phase identification. However, a direct comparison of optical polymorph signatures, including such critical parameters as bandgaps, is challenging due to the scattered, limited, or even absent data for certain phases in the literature. To address this issue, in the present work we systematically cross-correlate optical emission and absorption features of {\alpha}, {\beta}, {\gamma}, and {\kappa} thin films, as well as differently oriented {\beta}-phase bulk crystals and {\gamma}/{\beta} double polymorph structures. We demonstrate that the optical bandgap and emission features scale consistently across these polymorphs upon minimization of the methodological uncertainties. As a result, this work provides a comparative library of near- and far-field optical signatures of the polymorphs for use by the multidisciplinary research community working with gallium oxide.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Nonlinear Mechanics of Bio-inspired Materials Through Interface Engineering and Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many biological materials such as nacre and bone, the material structure consists of hard grains and soft interfaces, with the interfaces playing a significant role in the material's mechanical behavior. This type of structures has been utilized in the design of various bio-inspired composite materials. Such applications often require the materials to exhibit a specified nonlinear stress-strain relationship. A key challenge lies in identifying appropriate interface properties from an infinite search space to achieve a given target stress-strain curve. This study introduces a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework specifically tailored for the inverse design of interfaces in bio-inspired composites. As a notable advantage, this method is capable of expanding the design space, allowing the discovery of optimal solutions even when the target curve deviates significantly from the initial dataset. Furthermore, our results show that BO can identify distinct interface designs that produce similar target stress-strain responses, yet differ in their deformation and failure mechanisms. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed BO framework to address a wide range of inverse design challenges in nonlinear mechanics problems.</description>

      <title>Kinetic view on dynamic plasticity of crystalline solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microstructural changes in solids, driven by energy flows, do not develop in a static continuous space, such as the space considered in conventional plasticity models. The applied forces create an evolving internal energy landscape, which is constrained by crystallography but has characteristic spatial and temporal scales that form dynamically. To describe this view, we replace a common model for the evolution of dislocation substructure in metals with the evolution of microscopic slips in a combinatorial structure referred to as a polytopal cell complex (PCC). The micro-slips are associated with the 2-cells (faces) of the PCC and are driven by the minimisation of a properly defined Lagrangian. The approach provides a comprehensive statistical and thermodynamic description of plastic flow development. It allows the investigation of energy levels associated with different slip systems and reveals the microscopic mechanisms that result in the phenomenon of strain rate sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: The solubility of helium in liquid metals is a knowledge of fundamental importance in the design of the future nuclear fusion reactors, since the formation of helium bubbles inside the breeding blankets of the reactors can be a threat to the durability of the devices and, more importantly, to the efficiency of tritium recovery. In the present work we report a detailed set of calculations of the solubility of helium in lead and lead-lithium alloys. A series of molecular dynamics simulations have been combined with a classical perturbative procedure able to compute the free energy of insertion of a helium atom inside a liquid metal bath, directly related to the solubility of helium. As the most important case, the concentration of the eutectic solution has been explored in full detail. We have found that solubility of helium in pure lithium is lower than in pure lead, predicting a value at the eutectic state (16% Li-84% Pb at 508 K) of about $5 \times 10^{-16}$ Pa$^{-1}$. The observed trend indicates that solubilties rise with increasing temperatures.</description>

      <title>Domain Structure and Interface Control of Mechanical Stiffness in Sustainable Cellulose Bio-nanocomposites</title>

Abstract: Renewable and biodegradable plastics derived from soy protein isolate (SPI) offer a promising alternative to conventional petroleum-based plastics, particularly for film-grade bioplastics applications such as plastic bags. However, even with reinforcement from cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), their mechanical properties including stiffness lag behind those of petroleum-based plastics. To identify pathways for improving CNC-reinforced SPI composites, we studied stiffening mechanisms by interpreting experimental data using homogenization models that accounted for CNC agglomeration and the formation of CNC/SPI interphases. To model effects of surface modification of CNCs with polydopamine (polyDOPA), we incorporated two key mechanisms: enhanced CNC dispersion and modified CNC-SPI interfacial interactions. Models accounted for interphases surrounding CNCs, arising from physicochemical interactions with the polyDOPA-modified CNC surfaces. Consistent wih experimental observations of polyDOPA modification enhancing mechanical properties through both increased spatial distribution of CNCs and matrix-filler interactions, results demonstrated that improved dispersion and interfacial bonding contribute to increased composite stiffness. Results highlight the potential of biodegradable CNC/SPI bio-nanocomposites as sustainable plastic alternatives, and suggest pathways for further enhancing their mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>An introduction to reservoir computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of artificial neural networks that are implemented in a physical system. A major challenge in this context is that these networks are difficult to train since training here would require a change of physical parameters rather than simply of coefficients in a computer program. For this reason, reservoir computing, where one employs high-dimensional recurrent networks and trains only the final layer, is widely used in this context. In this chapter, I introduce the basic concepts of reservoir computing. Moreover, I present some important physical implementations coming from electronics, photonics, spintronics, mechanics, and biology. Finally, I provide a brief discussion of quantum reservoir computing.</description>

      <title>Two types of colossal magnetoresistance with distinct mechanisms in Eu5In2As6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent reports of colossal negative magnetoresistance (CMR) in a few magnetic semimetals and semiconductors have attracted attention, because these materials are devoid of the conventional mechanisms of CMR such as mixed valence, double exchange interaction, and Jahn-Teller distortion. New mechanisms have thus been proposed, including topological band structure, ferromagnetic clusters, orbital currents, and charge ordering. The CMR in these compounds has been reported in two forms: either a resistivity peak or a resistivity upturn suppressed by a magnetic field. Here we reveal both types of CMR in a single antiferromagnetic semiconductor Eu5In2As6. Using the transport and thermodynamic measurements, we demonstrate that the peak-type CMR is likely due to the percolation of magnetic polarons with increasing magnetic field, while the upturn-type CMR is proposed to result from the melting of a charge order under the magnetic field. We argue that similar mechanisms operate in other compounds, offering a unifying framework to understand CMR in seemingly different materials.</description>

      <title>Hugoniot equation of state and sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass under shock compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Davemaoite, as the third most abundant mineral in the lower mantle, constitutes significant amounts in pyrolite and mid-ocean ridge basalts. Due to its unquenchable nature, measurements by static compression techniques on physical properties of davemaoite at lower mantle conditions are rare and technically challenging, and those are essential to constrain compositions and properties of mineralogical models in the lower mantle. Here, we present Hugoniot equation of state and sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass under shock compression. The CaSiO3 glass transforms into the crystalline phase above 34 GPa and completely transforms into davemaoite above 120 GPa. Thermal equation of state and Hugoniot temperature of davemaoite have been derived from the shock wave data. The CaSiO3 glass under shcok compression has very high shock temperature. Shock wave experiments for sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass indicate that no melting is observed at Hugoniot pressure up to 117.6 GPa. We propose that the melting temperature of davemaoite should be higher than those reported theoretically by now.</description>

      <title>Photoelectron superlubricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superlubricity, a state where friction between two contact surfaces is nearly zero, has a great potential to revolutionize various mechanical systems by significantly reducing energy dissipation and enhancing efficiency. It can be realized either by structural incommensurate contact between crystalline surfaces or by creating highly passive interfaces to cancel out the adhesive forces. However, fabricating and maintaining such superlubric surfaces still present challenges, often disabled by surface structural defects or susceptibility to humid atmospheres, which renders superlubricity fragile. Here, we propose a novel strategy of photoelectron superlubricity (PESL), where robust superlubricity can be achieved in humid atmospheres by in-situ laser-irradiating the contact interface of an amorphous carbon film sliding against sapphire ball. We demonstrate that PESL not only exhibits a high resistance to environmental disturbances but also features rapid response. The formation of PESL originates from the laser-irradiating induced formation of nanographene-layered interface and enrichment of photoelectrons at the interface, resulting in a repulsive electric field between the nanographene layers. The discovery of PESL opens a new avenue for achieving superlubricity, and also provides novel insights for smart friction, mechanical motion control and light manipulation.</description>

      <title>Effective Medium Theory for Time-modulated Subwavelength Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a general framework for deriving effective material properties of time-modulated systems of subwavelength resonators. It applies to subwavelength resonator systems with a general form of time-dependent parameters. We show that the resonators can be accurately described by a point-scattering formulation when the width of the resonators is small. In contrast to the static setting, where this point interaction approximation yields a Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the effective material properties, the mode coupling in the time-modulated case instead yields an infinite linear system of Lippmann-Schwinger-type equations. The effective equations can equivalently be written as a system of integro-differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a numerical scheme to approximately solve the system of coupled equations and illustrate the validity of the effective equation.</description>

      <title>A parameter-free statistical model for two-dimensional carbon nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy degeneracy in physical systems may be induced by symmetries of the Hamiltonian, and the resonance of degeneracy states in carbon nanostructures can effectively enhance the stability of the system. Combining the octet rule, we introduce a parameter-free statistical model to determine the physical properties by lifting the energy degeneracy in carbon nanostructures. This model offers a direct path to accurately ascertain electron density distributions in quantum systems, akin to how charge density is used in density functional theory to deduce system properties. Our methodology diverges from traditional quantum mechanics, focusing instead on this unique statistical model by minimizing bonding free energy to determine the fundamental properties of materials. Applied to carbon nanoclusters and graphynes, our model not only precisely predicts bonding energies and electron density without relying on external parameters, but also enhances the prediction of electronic structures through bond occupancy numbers, which act as effective hopping integrals. This innovation offers insights into the structural properties and quantum behavior of electrons across various dimensions.</description>

      <title>Spin correlations in the parent phase of Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$ODFeSe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elucidating spin correlations in the parent compounds of high-temperature superconductors is crucial for understanding superconductivity. We used neutron scattering to study spin correlations in Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$ODFeSe, an insulating material with reduced electron carriers compared to its superconducting counterpart ($T_c$ = 41 K), serving as the undoped parent compound. Our findings show a reduced total fluctuating moment in this insulator relative to FeSe and 122 iron pnictides, likely due to increased interlayer distances from intercalation, which enhance fluctuations and reduce the intensity of spin excitations. Moreover, we observed a V-shaped spin wave-like excitation dispersion, contrasting with the twisted hourglass pattern in the superconducting counterpart. Electron doping shifts spin excitation from ($\pi$, 0) point to an incommensurate position towards ($\pi$, $\pi$) direction below 65 meV. This transition from V-shaped to hourglass-like dispersion, akin to behaviors in hole-doped cuprates, suggests a potential shared mechanism in magnetism and superconductivity across these diverse systems.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning Accelerated Descriptor Design for Catalyst Discovery: A CO$_2$ to Methanol Conversion Case Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of novel thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can easily be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. Finally, we propose new promising candidate materials such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) offers a promising avenue to surpass the efficiency limitations of current solar cell technology. However, disentangling intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to photocurrent remains a significant challenge. Here, we fabricate high-quality, lateral devices based on atomically thin ReS2 with minimal contact resistance, providing an optimal platform for distinguishing intrinsic bulk photovoltaic signals from other extrinsic photocurrent contributions originating from interfacial effects. Our devices exhibit large bulk photovoltaic performance with intrinsic responsivities of 1 mA/W in the visible range, without the need for external tuning knobs such as strain engineering. Our experimental findings are supported by theoretical calculations. Furthermore, our approach can be extrapolated to investigate the intrinsic BPVE in other non-centrosymmetric van der Waals materials, paving the way for a new generation of efficient light-harvesting devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A first-principles approach for calculating ion separation in solution through two-dimensional (2D) membranes is proposed and applied. Ionic energy profiles across the membrane are obtained first, where solvation effects are simulated explicitly with machine-learning molecular dynamics, electrostatic corrections are applied to remove finite-size capacitive effects, and a mean-field treatment of the charging of the electrochemical double layer is used. Entropic contributions are assessed analytically and validated against thermodynamic integration. Ionic separations are then inferred through a microkinetic model of the filtration process, accounting for steady-state charge separation effects across the membrane. The approach is applied to Li$^{+}$, Na$^{+}$, K$^{+}$ sieving through a crown-ether functionalized graphene membrane, with a case study of the mechanisms for a highly selective and efficient extraction of lithium from aqueous solutions.</description>

Abstract: We consider disordered finite systems of subwavelength resonators where the disorder is in the spatial arrangement of the resonators and their material parameters are perturbed randomly. We elucidate the mechanism of wave localisation in such systems. To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism, make precise the notions of bandgap and localised eigenmodes, study their stabilities with respect to fluctuations in the system, and highlight the importance of defect hybridisation and level repulsion in creating localised eigenmodes for a given arrangement of the resonators by randomly changing their material parameters. We also introduce a method of localised eigenmode prediction based on the discrete Green function of the disordered system of resonators and show the existence of bound eigenmodes in disordered systems where local translation invariance is broken.</description>

Abstract: Transition-metal phthalocyanine molecules have attracted considerable interest in the context of spintronics device development due to their amenability to diverse bonding regimes and their intrinsic magnetism. The latter is highly influenced by the quantum fluctuations that arise at the inevitable metal-molecule interface in a device architecture. In this study, we have systematically investigated the dynamical screening effects in phthalocyanine molecules hosting a series of transition-metal ions (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) in contact with the Cu(111) surface. Using comprehensive density functional theory plus Anderson's Impurity Model calculations, we show that the orbital-dependent hybridization and electron correlation together result in strong charge and spin fluctuations. While the instantaneous spin moments of the transition-metal ions are near atomic-like, we find that screening gives rise to considerable lowering or even quenching of these. Our results highlight the importance of quantum fluctuations in metal-contacted molecular devices, which may influence the results obtained from theoretical or experimental probes, depending on their possibly material-dependent characteristic sampling time-scales.</description>

      <title>Monolayer Capping Provides Close to Optimal Resistance to Laser Dewetting of Au Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) relies on fast, localized heating of the magnetic medium during the write process. Au plasmonic near-field transducers are an attractive solution to this challenge, but increased thermal stability of Au films is required to improve long-term reliability. This work compares the effect of nanoscale Al, AlOx, and Ta capping films on Au thin films with Ti or Ta adhesion layers for use in HAMR and other high-temperature plasmonic applications. Thermal stability is investigated using a bespoke laser dewetting system, and SEM and AFM are extensively used to interrogate the resulting dewet areas. The most effective capping layers are found to be 0.5-1 nm of Al or AlOx, which can eliminate dewetting under certain conditions. Even one monolayer of AlOx is shown to be highly effective in reducing dewetting. In the case of thicker capping layers of Ta and AlOx, the Au film can easily dewet underneath, leaving an intact capping layer. It is concluded that thinner capping layers are most effective against dewetting as the Au cannot dewet without breaking them and pulling them apart during the dewetting process. A simple model based on energetics considerations is developed, which explains how thinner capping layers can more effectively protect the metal from pore or fissure creation. The model provides some convenient guidelines for choosing both the substrate and capping layer, for a given metal, to maximize the resistance to laser-induced damage.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Co-pilot for Screening of Organic Molecular Additives for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has been extensively employed in planar perovskite photovoltaics to screen effective organic molecular additives, while encountering predictive biases for novel materials due to small datasets and reliance on predefined descriptors. Present work thus proposes an effective approach, Co-Pilot for Perovskite Additive Screener (Co-PAS), an ML-driven framework designed to accelerate additive screening for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Co-PAS overcomes predictive biases by integrating the Molecular Scaffold Classifier (MSC) for scaffold-based pre-screening and utilizing Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (JTVAE) latent vectors to enhance molecular structure representation, thereby enhancing the accuracy of power conversion efficiency (PCE) predictions. Leveraging Co-PAS, we integrate domain knowledge to screen an extensive dataset of 250,000 molecules from PubChem, prioritizing candidates based on predicted PCE values and key molecular properties such as donor number, dipole moment, and hydrogen bond acceptor count. This workflow leads to the identification of several promising passivating molecules, including the novel Boc-L-threonine N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (BTN), which, to our knowledge, has not been explored as an additive in PSCs and achieves a device PCE of 25.20%. Our results underscore the potential of Co-PAS in advancing additive discovery for high-performance PSCs.</description>

      <title>Cooperative polymer dynamics at the crossover between the unentangled and the entangled regimes: theoretical predictions of scattering and linear shear relaxation for polyethylene melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of polymer melts at the crossover between unentagled and entangled regimes is formalized here through an extension of the Cooperative Dynamics Generalized Langevin Equation (CDGLE) (\textit{J. Chem. Phys.} 110,7574 (1999)), by including the constraint to the dynamics due to entanglements through an effective inter-monomer potential that confines the motion of the chains. As one polymer chain in a melt interpenetrates with a $\sqrt{N}$ other chains, with $N$ the degree of chain polymerization, their dynamics is coupled through their potential of mean-force, leading to chains' cooperative motion and center-of-mass subdiffusive dynamics. When increasing the degree of polymerization, the extended CDGLE approach describes the dynamical behavior of unentangled to weakly entangled systems undergoing cooperative dynamics. By direct comparison of the CDGLE with data of Neutron Spin Echo (NSE) experiments on polyethylene melts we find that the cooperative dynamics in entangled systems are confined in the region delimited by entanglements. We extend the CDGLE to describe linear dynamical mechanical measurements and use it to calculate shear relaxation for the polyethylene samples investigated by NSE. The effects of cooperative dynamics, local flexibility, and entanglements in the shear relaxation are discussed. It is noteworthy that the theoretical approach describes with accuracy the crossover from unentangled to entangled-global dynamics for polyethylene melts of increasing chain length, covering the regimes of unentangled and weakly entangled (up to $13$ entanglements) dynamics in one approach.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate precise control over coherently excited circular phonon modes using high-intensity terahertz lasers, opening new pathways towards dynamical, ultrafast design of magnetism in functional materials. While the phonon Zeeman effect enables a theoretical description of phonon-induced magnetism, it lacks efficient angular momentum transfer from the phonon to the electron sector. In this work, we put forward a coupling mechanism based on electron-nuclear quantum geometry, with the inverse Faraday effect as a limiting case. This effect is rooted in the phase accumulation of the electronic wavefunction under a circular evolution of nuclear coordinates. An excitation pulse then induces a transient level splitting between electronic orbitals that carry angular momentum. First-principle simulations on SrTiO$_3$ demonstrate that in parts of the Brillouin zone, this splitting between orbitals carrying angular momentum can easily reach 50 meV.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of displacive ferroelectricity: applications to quantum criticality and classical phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate quantitative prediction of the finite-temperature properties of a phase transitioning system has been a long-standing challenge in condensed matter physics and materials science. Here we regard a collective vector mode as essential quasiparticle excitation of the displacive ferroelectricity. Starting from the quantum statistic description of this excitation, we develop a self-consistent, microscopically based phase-transition theory of displacive ferroelectricity. This theory enables one to use only the ground-state properties to predict the finite-temperature properties and in particular, the criticality of phase transitions, in a striking contrast to the widely used Landau-Ginzburg phenomenological description near the critical point. Its applications to the quantum paraelectrics SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$ as well as the classical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ demonstrate remarkable quantitative agreements with the experimentally measured critical behaviors of the phase transitions and the corresponding dielectric/ferroelectric properties throughout the entire temperature ranges of the phases without fitting parameters. The theory should be general and can be utilized to understand a broad range of phase transitions in other bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Curie temperature in substitutionally disordered alloys using a first-principles based model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When exploring new magnetic materials, the effect of alloying plays a crucial role for numerous properties. By altering the alloy composition, it is possible to tailor, e.g., the Curie temperature ($T_\text{C}$). In this work, $T_\text{C}$ of various alloys is investigated using a previously developed technique [Br\"{a}nnvall et al. Phys. Rev. Mat. (2024)] designed for robust predictions of $T_\text{C}$ across diverse chemistries and structures. The technique is based on density functional theory calculations and utilizes the energy difference between the magnetic ground state and the magnetically disordered paramagnetic state. It also accounts for the magnetic entropy in the paramagnetic state and the number of nearest magnetic neighbors. The experimentally known systems, Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$, Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$, Fe$_{1-x}$V$_x$, NiMnSb-based Heusler alloys, Ti$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$N, and Co$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ are investigated. The experimentally unexplored system Fe$_{1-x}$Tc$_x$ is also tested to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed method in guiding future experimental efforts. This work demonstrates the broad applicability of the developed method across various systems, requiring less hands-on adjustments compared to other theoretical approaches.</description>

      <title>Tuning Higher Order Structure in Colloidal Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09029v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colloidal particles self assemble into a wide range of structures under external AC electric fields due to induced dipolar interactions [Yethiraj and Van Blaaderen Nature 421 513 (2003)]. As a result of these dipolar interactions, at low volume fraction the system is modulated between a hard-sphere like state (in the case of zero applied field) and a "string fluid" upon application of the field. Using both particle-resolved experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the emergence of the string fluid with a variety of structural measures including two-body and higher-order correlations. The higher-order structure we probe using three-body spatial correlation functions and a many-body approach based on minimum energy clusters of a dipolar-Lennard-Jones system. This yields a series of geometrically distinct minimum energy clusters upon increasing the strength of the dipolar interaction, which are echoed in the higher-order structure of the colloidal fluids we study here. We find good agreement between experiment and simulation at the two-body level, although some discrepancies are found at higher field strength, where the system falls out of equilibrium. Higher-order correlations exhibit reasonable agreement between experiment and simulation, again with more discrepancy at higher field strength for three--body correlation functions. At higher field strength, the cluster population in our experiments and simulations is dominated by the minimum energy clusters for all sizes $8 \leq m \leq 12$. The agreement that we find here is notable considering that there is no fit parameter in our mapping between experiment and simulation.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and characterization of the novel breathing pyrochlore compound Ba3Tm2Zn5O11</title>

Abstract: In this study, a novel material from the rare-earth based breathing pyrochlore family, Ba3Tm2Zn5O11, was successfully synthesized. Powder x-ray diffraction and high-resolution powder neutron diffraction confirmed phase purity and the F-43m breathing pyrochlore crystal structure, while thermogravimetric analysis revealed incongruent melting behavior compared to its counterpart, Ba3Yb2Zn5O11. High-quality single crystals of Ba3Tm2Zn5O11 were grown using the traveling solvent floating zone technique and assessed using Laue x-ray diffraction and single crystal x-ray diffraction. Thermodynamic characterization indicated paramagnetic behavior down to 0.05 K, and inelastic neutron scattering measurements identified distinct dispersionless crystal electric field energy bands, with the fitted crystal electric field model predicting a single-ion singlet ground state and an energy gap of ~9 meV separating it from the first excited (singlet) state. Additional low-energy excitation studies on single crystals revealed dispersionless bands at 0.8 and 1 meV. Computed phonon dispersions from first-principles calculations ruled out phonons as the origin of these modes, further illustrating the puzzling and unique properties of Ba3Tm2Zn5O11.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties and field-induced phenomena in the Jeff = 1/2 distorted kagome antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intertwining between competing degrees of freedom, anisotropy, and frustration-induced quantum fluctuations offers an ideal ground to realize exotic quantum phenomena in the rare-earth-based kagome lattice. The magnetic susceptibility reveals the presence of two energy scales in agreement with the INS results. The higher energy state is dominated by CEF excitations, where the lowest Kramers ground-state doublet is well separated from the excited state suggesting that the compound realizes a low-energy state at low temperatures. The second energy scale is witnessed via thermodynamic results that reveal an anomaly at 0.3 K typical of a phase transition, which is attributed to the presence of complex magnetic ordering phenomena. The broad maximum in the specific heat well above 0.3 K indicates the presence of short-range spin correlations that is corroborated by muon spin relaxation rate results. The isothermal magnetization reveals a field-induced 1/3 magnetization plateau at low temperatures. muSR relaxation rate experiments, on the other hand, neither show the signature of a phase transition nor spin-freezing down to 34 mK. The ZF muSR relaxation is governed by the Orbach process and reveals the presence of a fluctuating state owing to the depopulation of crystal field levels reflected as a constant value of relaxation rate in the temperature range 0.4-10 K. NMR results indicate the presence of fluctuating Nd3+ moments down to 1.8 K consistent with muSR experiments. Our comprehensive results reveal that a field-induced quantum critical phenomenon is at play in this frustrated kagome magnet and enable us to construct a phase diagram exemplifying the proximity effect of competing magnetic states. This sets the stage to investigate the broad RE3BWO9 family of rare-earth kagome magnets promising to host exotic quantum states driven by spin-orbit coupling and geometrical frustration.</description>

      <title>Physics-based battery model parametrisation from impedance data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.</description>
