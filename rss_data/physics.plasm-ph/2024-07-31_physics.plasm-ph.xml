      <title>Optical effects induced in unmagnetized chiral cold plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmagnetized cold plasma modes are investigated in the context of the chiral Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw (MCJF) electrodynamics, where the axion chiral factor acts retrieving some typical properties of magnetized plasmas. The Maxwell equations are rewritten for a cold, uniform, and collisionless fluid plasma model, allowing us to determine the dispersion relation, new refractive indices and propagating modes. We find four distinct refractive indices modified by the purely timelike CFJ background that plays the magnetic conductivity chiral parameter role, associated with right-circularly polarized [RCP] and left-circularly polarized [LCP] waves. For each refractive index, the propagation and absorption zones are determined and illustrated for some specific parameter values. Modified RCP and LCP helicons are found in the low-frequency regime. The optical behavior is investigated, revealing that the chiral factor induces birefringence, measured in terms of the rotatory power (RP). The dichroism coefficient is carried out for the absorbing zones. The negative refraction zones may enhance the involved rotatory power, yielding RP sign reversion, a feature of rotating plasmas and MCFJ chiral plasmas.</description>

      <title>The Interplay Between Collisionless Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alongside magnetic reconnection, turbulence is another fundamental nonlinear plasma phenomenon that plays a key role in energy transport and conversion in space and astrophysical plasmas. From a numerical, theoretical, and observational point of view there is a long history of exploring the interplay between these two phenomena in space plasma environments; however, recent high-resolution, multi-spacecraft observations have ushered in a new era of understanding this complex topic. The interplay between reconnection and turbulence is both complex and multifaceted, and can be viewed through a number of different interrelated lenses - including turbulence acting to generate current sheets that undergo magnetic reconnection (turbulence-driven reconnection), magnetic reconnection driving turbulent dynamics in an environment (reconnection-driven turbulence) or acting as an intermediate step in the excitation of turbulence, and the random diffusive/dispersive nature of magnetic field lines embedded in turbulent fluctuations enabling so-called stochastic reconnection. In this paper, we review the current state of knowledge on these different facets of the interplay between turbulence and reconnection in the context of collisionless plasmas, such as those found in many near-Earth astrophysical environments, from a theoretical, numerical, and observational perspective. Particular focus is given to several key regions in Earth's magnetosphere - Earth's magnetosheath, magnetotail, and Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices on the magnetopause flanks - where NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale mission has been providing new insights on the topic.</description>

      <title>Exact boundary-value solution for an electromagnetic wave propagating in a linearly-varying index of refraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of electromagnetic waves in a linearly-varying index of refraction is a fundamental problem in wave physics, being relevant in fusion science for describing certain wave-based heating and diagnostic schemes. Here, an exact solution is obtained for a given incoming wavefield specified on the boundary transverse to the direction of inhomogeneity by performing a spectral, rather than asymptotic, matching. Two case studies are then presented: a Gaussian beam at oblique incidence and a speckled wavefield at normal incidence. For the Gaussian beam, it is shown that when the waist $W$ is sufficiently large, oblique incidence manifests simply as rigid translation and focal shift of the corresponding diffraction pattern at normal incidence. The destruction of the hyperbolic umbilic caustic (corresponding to a critically focused beam) as $W$ is reduced is then demonstrated. The caustic disappears once $W \lesssim \delta_a \sqrt{L}$ ($L$ being the medium lengthscale normalized by the Airy skin depth $\delta_a$), at which point the wave behavior is increasingly described by Airy functions, but experiences less focusing as a result. To maximize the intensity of a launched Gaussian beam at a turning point, one should therefore minimize the imaginary part of the launched complex beam parameter while having the real part satisfy critical focusing. For the speckled wavefield, it is shown that the transverse speckle pattern only couples to the Airy longitudinal pattern when the coupling parameter $\eta = \sqrt{L}/f_\#$ is large, with $f_\#$ being the f-number of the launching aperture. When $\eta \ll 1$, a reduced description of the total wavefield can be obtained by simply multiplying the incoming speckle pattern with the Airy swelling.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Energy Conversion Associated with Kinetic Microinstabilities in Earth's Magnetosheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma in the terrestrial magnetosheath is characterised by very weak particle-particle collisions, so kinetic microinstabilities are thought to be responsible for regulating the thermodynamics of the plasma. By exciting electromagnetic waves, these instabilities redistribute free energy in velocity space, moulding the velocity distribution function (VDF) into a lower energy state. In the high-beta magnetosheath, relatively small perturbations to the VDF can easily excite instabilities compared to in the low-beta inner heliosphere. Since magnetic fields cannot do work on the particles, electric fields mediate energy exchange between the electromagnetic field and the bulk fluid properties of the plasma. We investigate signatures of non-ideal energy conversion associated with turbulent fluctuations in the context of electron and ion temperature anisotropy-beta instabilities, utilising over 24 hours of data spread over 163 distinct intervals of in situ magnetosheath observations from Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS). We find that average energy conversion into fluid flow is enhanced along instability boundaries, suggesting that turbulence is playing a role in how free energy is redistributed in the plasma. The work enables a quantification of the energetics which are associated with the role of kinetic microinstabilities in regulating collisionless plasma thermodynamics. This work provides insight into the open question of how specific plasma processes couple into the turbulent dynamics and ultimately lead to energy dissipation and particle energisation in collisionless plasmas.</description>

      <title>Measurement of differential collisional excitation cross sections for the K$\alpha$ emission of He-like oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the energy-differential cross sections for collisional excitation of the soft X-ray electric-dipole K$\alpha$ ($x+y+w$) emission from He-like oxygen (O VII), using an electron beam ion trap. Values near their excitation thresholds were extracted from the observed emissivity by rapidly cycling the energy of the exciting electron beam. This allows us to subtract time-dependent contributions of the forbidden $z$-line emission to the multiplet. We develop a time-dependent collisional-radiative model to further demonstrate the method and predict all spectral features. We then compare the extracted $x+y+w$ cross-sections with calculations based on distorted-wave and R-matrix methods from the literature and our own predictions using the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC). All R-matrix results are validated by our measurements of direct and resonant excitation, supporting the use of such state-of-the-art codes for astrophysical and plasma physics diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Implementation of matrix compression in the coupling of JOREK to realistic 3D conducting wall structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JOREK is an advanced non-linear simulation code for studying MHD instabilities in magnetically confined fusion plasmas and their control and/or mitigation. A free-boundary and resistive wall extension was introduced via coupling to the STARWALL and CARIDDI codes, both able to provide dense response matrices describing the electromagnetic interactions between plasma and conducting structures. For detailed CAD representations of the conducting structures and high resolutions for the plasma region, memory and computing time limitations restrict the possibility of simulating the ITER tokamak. In the present work, the Singular Value Decomposition provided by routines from the ScaLAPACK library has been successfully applied to compress some of the dense response matrices and thus optimize memory usage. This is demonstrated for simulations of Tearing Mode and Vertical Displacement Event instabilities. An outlook to future applications on large production cases and further extensions of the method are discussed.</description>

      <title>Understanding Large-Scale Plasma Simulation Challenges for Fusion Energy on Supercomputers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding plasma instabilities is essential for achieving sustainable fusion energy, with large-scale plasma simulations playing a crucial role in both the design and development of next-generation fusion energy devices and the modelling of industrial plasmas. To achieve sustainable fusion energy, it is essential to accurately model and predict plasma behavior under extreme conditions, requiring sophisticated simulation codes capable of capturing the complex interaction between plasma dynamics, magnetic fields, and material surfaces. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive HPC analysis of two prominent plasma simulation codes, BIT1 and JOREK, to advance understanding of plasma behavior in fusion energy applications. Our focus is on evaluating JOREK's computational efficiency and scalability for simulating non-linear MHD phenomena in tokamak fusion devices. The motivation behind this work stems from the urgent need to advance our understanding of plasma instabilities in magnetically confined fusion devices. Enhancing JOREK's performance on supercomputers improves fusion plasma code predictability, enabling more accurate modelling and faster optimization of fusion designs, thereby contributing to sustainable fusion energy. In prior studies, we analysed BIT1, a massively parallel Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code for studying plasma-material interactions in fusion devices. Our investigations into BIT1's computational requirements and scalability on advanced supercomputing architectures yielded valuable insights. Through detailed profiling and performance analysis, we have identified the primary bottlenecks and implemented optimization strategies, significantly enhancing parallel performance. This previous work serves as a foundation for our present endeavours.</description>

      <title>3D MHD modelling of plasmoid drift following massive material injection in a tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01399v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanisms of plasmoid drift following massive material injection are studied via 3D non-linear MHD modelling with the JOREK code, using a transient neutral source deposited at the low field side midplane of a JET H-mode plasma to clarify basic processes and compare with existing theories. The simulations confirm the important role of the propagation of shear Alfv\'en wave (SAW) packets from both ends of the plasmoid (``SAW braking'') and the development of external resistive currents along magnetic field lines (``P\'egouri\'e braking'') in limiting charge separation and thus the $\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ plasmoid drift, where $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively. The drift velocity is found to be limited by the SAW braking on the few microseconds timescale for cases with relatively small source amplitude while the P\'egouri\'e braking acting on a longer timescale is shown to set in earlier with larger toroidal extent of the source, both in good agreement with existing theories. The simulations also identify the key role of the size of the $\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ flow region on plasmoid drift and show that the saturated velocity caused by dominant SAW braking agrees well with theory when considering an effective pressure within the $\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ flow region. The existence of SAWs in the simulations is demonstrated and the 3D picture of plasmoid drift is discussed.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Three-dimensional Simulation of Surface Charging on Rotating Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface charging phenomenon of asteroids, mainly resulting from solar wind plasma and solar radiation, has been studied extensively. However, the influence of asteroid's rotation on surface charging has yet to be fully understood. Here neural network is established to replace numerical integration, improving the efficiency of dynamic three-dimensional simulation. We implement simulation of rotating asteroids and surrounding plasma environment under different conditions, including quiet solar wind and solar storms, various minerals on asteroid's surface also be considered. For asteroids with rotation periods comparable to orbital period, effect of orbital motion and obliquity also be studied. Results show that under typical solar wind, the maximum and minimum potential of asteroids will gradually decrease with their increasing periods, especially when solar wind is obliquely incident. For asteroid has period longer than one week, this decreasing trend will become extremely slow. During solar storm passing, solar wind plasma changes sharply, the susceptibility of asteroid's surface potential to rotation is greatly pronounced. Minerals on surface also count, plagioclase is the most sensitive mineral among those we explored, while ilmenite seems indifferent to changes in rotation periods. Understanding the surface charging of asteroid under various rotation periods or angles, is crucial for further research into solar wind plasma and asteroid's surface dust motion, providing a reference for safe landing exploration of asteroids.</description>
