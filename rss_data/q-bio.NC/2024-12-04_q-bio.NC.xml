      <title>BEOL Electro-Biological Interface for 1024-Channel TFT Neurostimulator with Cultured DRG Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for high-quality neurostimulation, driven by the development of brain-computer interfaces, has outpaced the capabilities of passive microelectrode-arrays, which are limited by channel-count and biocompatibility. This work proposes a back-end-of-line (BEOL) process for 1024-channel stimulator with bioelectrodes and waterproof encapsulation to stimulate dorsal root ganglion neurons. We introduce an active-matrix neurostimulator based on n-type low-temperature poly-silicon thin-film transistor, adding PEDOT:PSS and SU-8 as bioelectrodes and encapsulation. This enables precise stimulation of DRG neurons, addressing key challenges in neurostimulation systems.</description>

      <title>Eye dominance and testing order effects in the circularly-oriented macular pigment optical density measurements that rely on the perception of structured light-based stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychophysical discrimination of structured light (SL) stimuli may be useful in screening for various macular disorders, including degenerative macular diseases. The circularly-oriented macular pigment optical density (coMPOD), calculated from the discrimination performance of SL-induced entoptic phenomena, may reveal a novel functional biomarker of macular health. In this study, we investigated the potential influence of eye dominance and testing order effects on SL-based stimulus perception, factors that potentially influence the sensitivity of screening tests based on SL technology. A total of 28 participants (aged 18-38 years) were selected for the study after undergoing a comprehensive eye examination. A psychophysical task was performed where various SL-based entoptic images with multiple azimuthal fringes rotating with a specific temporal frequency were projected onto the participants' retinas. By occluding the central areas of entoptic images, we measured the retinal eccentricity ($R$) of the perceivable area of the stimuli. The slope of the coMPOD profile ($a$-value) was calculated for each participant using a spatiotemporal sensitivity model that takes into account the perceptual threshold measurements of structured light stimuli with varying spatial densities and temporal frequencies. The Pearson correlation coefficient between eye dominance and testing order effects was $r=0.8$ ($p&lt;0.01$). The Bland-Altman plots for both factors indicated zero bias. The results indicate repeatable measurements for both eyes, implying minimal impact from eye dominance and testing order on SL-based stimulus perception. The results provide a foundation for future studies exploring the clinical utility of SL tools in eye health.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical feature extraction on functional brain networks for autism spectrum disorder identification with resting-state fMRI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive developmental disorder of the central nervous system, which occurs most frequently in childhood and is characterized by unusual and repetitive ritualistic behaviors. Currently, diagnostic methods primarily rely on questionnaire surveys and behavioral observation, which may lead to misdiagnoses due to the subjective evaluation and measurement used in these traditional methods. With the advancement in medical imaging, MR imaging-based diagnosis has become an alternative and more objective approach. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid neural Network model for ASD identification, termded ASD-HNet, to hierarchically extract features on the functional brain networks based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. This hierarchical method can better extract brain representations, improve the diagnostic accuracy, and help us better locate brain regions related to ASD. Specifically, features are extracted from three scales: local regions of interest (ROIs) scale, community-clustering scale, and the whole-communities scale. For the ROI scale, graph convolution is used to transfer features between ROIs. At the community cluster scale, functional gradients are introduced, the clustering algorithm K-Means is used to automatically cluster ROIs with similar functional gradients into several communities, and features of ROIs belonging to the same community are extracted to characterize these communities. At global information integration scale, we extract global features from community-scale brain networks to characterize the whole brain networks. We validate the effectiveness of our method using the public dataset of Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I), and elucidate the interpretability of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASD-HNet can yield superior performance than compared methods.</description>

      <title>Active learning of neural population dynamics using two-photon holographic optogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in techniques for monitoring and perturbing neural populations have greatly enhanced our ability to study circuits in the brain. In particular, two-photon holographic optogenetics now enables precise photostimulation of experimenter-specified groups of individual neurons, while simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging enables the measurement of ongoing and induced activity across the neural population. Despite the enormous space of potential photostimulation patterns and the time-consuming nature of photostimulation experiments, very little algorithmic work has been done to determine the most effective photostimulation patterns for identifying the neural population dynamics. Here, we develop methods to efficiently select which neurons to stimulate such that the resulting neural responses will best inform a dynamical model of the neural population activity. Using neural population responses to photostimulation in mouse motor cortex, we demonstrate the efficacy of a low-rank linear dynamical systems model, and develop an active learning procedure which takes advantage of low-rank structure to determine informative photostimulation patterns. We demonstrate our approach on both real and synthetic data, obtaining in some cases as much as a two-fold reduction in the amount of data required to reach a given predictive power. Our active stimulation design method is based on a novel active learning procedure for low-rank regression, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Simple Channel Compression Method for Brain Signal Decoding on Classification Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the application of brain-computer interface (BCI), while pursuing accurate decoding of brain signals, we also need consider the computational efficiency of BCI devices. ECoG signals are multi-channel temporal signals which is collected using a high-density electrode array at a high sampling frequency. The data between channels has a high similarity or redundancy in the temporal domain. The redundancy of data not only reduces the computational efficiency of the model, but also overwhelms the extraction of effective features, resulting in a decrease in performance. How to efficiently utilize ECoG multi-channel signals is one of the research topics. Effective channel screening or compression can greatly reduce the model size, thereby improving computational efficiency, this would be a good direction to solve the problem. Based on previous work [1], this paper proposes a very simple channel compression method, which uses a learnable matrix to perform matrix multiplication on the original channels, that is, assigning weights to the channels and then linearly add them up. This effectively reduces the number of final channels. In the experiment, we used the vision-based ECoG multi-classification dataset owned by our laboratory to test the proposed channel selection (compression) method. We found that the new method can compress the original 128-channel ECoG signal to 32 channels (of which subject MonJ is compressed to 8 channels), greatly reducing the size of the model. The demand for GPU memory resources during model training is reduced by about 68.57%, 84.33% for each subject respectively; the model training speed also increased up around 3.82, 4.65 times of the original speed for each subject respectively. More importantly, the performance of the model has improved by about 1.10% compared with our previous work, reached the SOTA level of our unique visual based ECoG dataset</description>

      <title>Persian Version of Wayfinding Questionnaire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial navigation ability is essential for daily functioning, and the Wayfinding Questionnaire (WQ) is a validated self-report tool assessing this ability through 22 items across three subscales: Navigation and Orientation (11 items), Distance Estimation (3 items), and Spatial Anxiety (8 items). This study introduces the Persian translation of the WQ, adapted for Persian-speaking populations using a rigorous forward-backward translation, cognitive debriefing, and cultural adaptation process to ensure alignment with the original tool's reliability and validity. The Persian WQ provides a complete assessment of spatial navigation skills and identifies potential navigation challenges. Furthermore, the Persian WQ serves as a valuable resource for future research exploring spatial navigation and memory in diverse populations.</description>

      <title>Multi-timescale synaptic plasticity on analog neuromorphic hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As numerical simulations grow in complexity, their demands on computing time and energy increase. Hardware accelerators offer significant efficiency gains in many computationally intensive scientific fields, but their use in computational neuroscience remains limited. Neuromorphic substrates, such as the BrainScaleS architectures, offer significant advantages, especially for studying complex plasticity rules that require extended simulation runtimes. This work presents the implementation of a calcium-based plasticity rule that integrates calcium dynamics based on the synaptic tagging-and-capture hypothesis on the BrainScaleS-2 system. The implementation of the plasticity rule for a single synapse involves incorporating the calcium dynamics and the plasticity rule equations. The calcium dynamics are mapped to the analog circuits of BrainScaleS-2, while the plasticity rule equations are numerically solved on its embedded digital processors. The main hardware constraints include the speed of the processors and the use of integer arithmetic. By adjusting the timestep of the numerical solver and introducing stochastic rounding, we demonstrate that BrainScaleS-2 accurately emulates a single synapse following a calcium-based plasticity rule across four stimulation protocols and validate our implementation against a software reference model.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a dynamical state of coherent bursting with power-law distributed avalanches from collective stochastic dynamics of adaptive neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous brain activity in the absence of external stimuli is not random but contains complex dynamical structures such as neuronal avalanches with power-law duration and size distributions. These experimental observations have been interpreted as supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the brain is operating near a critical point of phase transition between two states, and attracted much attention. Here, we show that a dynamical state of coherent bursting, with power-law distributed avalanches and features as observed in experiments, emerges in networks of adaptive neurons with stochastic input when excitation is sufficiently strong and balanced by adaptation. We demonstrate that these power-law distributed avalanches are direct consequences of stochasticity and coherent bursting, which in turn is the result of a balance between excitation and adaptation. Our work thus shows that the observed dynamical features of neuronal avalanches can arise from collective stochastic dynamics of adaptive neurons under suitable conditions and need not be signatures of criticality.</description>

      <title>Exploring Geometrical Properties of Chaotic Systems Through an Analysis of the Rulkov Neuron Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While extensive research has been conducted on chaos emerging from a dynamical system's temporal dynamics, our research examines extreme sensitivity to initial conditions in discrete-time dynamical systems from a geometrical perspective. Specifically, we develop methods of detecting, classifying, and quantifying geometric structures that lead to chaotic behavior in maps, including certain bifurcations, fractal geometry, strange attractors, multistability, fractal basin boundaries, and Wada basins of attraction. We also develop slow-fast dynamical systems theory for discrete-time systems, with a specific application to modeling the spiking and bursting behavior emerging from the electrophysiology of biological neurons. Our research mainly focuses on two simple low-dimensional slow-fast Rulkov maps, which model both non-chaotic and chaotic spiking-bursting neuronal behavior. We begin by exploring the maps' individual dynamics and parameter spaces, performing bifurcation analyses, describing and quantifying their chaotic dynamics, and modeling an injection of current into them. Then, by putting these neurons into different physical arrangements and coupling them with a flow of current, we find that complex dynamics and geometries emerge from the existence of multistability and final state sensitivity in higher-dimensional state space. We then analyze the complexity and fractalization of these coupled neuron systems' attractors and basin boundaries using our mathematical and computational methods. This paper begins with a conversational introduction to the geometry of chaos, then integrates mathematics, physics, neurobiology, computational modeling, and electrochemistry to present original research that provides a novel perspective on how types of geometrical sensitivity to initial conditions appear in discrete-time neuron systems.</description>
