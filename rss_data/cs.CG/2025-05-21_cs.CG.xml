      <title>EuLearn: A 3D database for learning Euler characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present EuLearn, the first surface datasets equitably representing a diversity of topological types. We designed our embedded surfaces of uniformly varying genera relying on random knots, thus allowing our surfaces to knot with themselves. EuLearn contributes new topological datasets of meshes, point clouds, and scalar fields in 3D. We aim to facilitate the training of machine learning systems that can discern topological features. We experimented with specific emblematic 3D neural network architectures, finding that their vanilla implementations perform poorly on genus classification. To enhance performance, we developed a novel, non-Euclidean, statistical sampling method adapted to graph and manifold data. We also introduce adjacency-informed adaptations of PointNet and Transformer architectures that rely on our non-Euclidean sampling strategy. Our results demonstrate that incorporating topological information into deep learning workflows significantly improves performance on these otherwise challenging EuLearn datasets.</description>

      <title>Towards Non-Euclidean Foundation Models: Advancing AI Beyond Euclidean Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of foundation models and Large Language Models (LLMs), Euclidean space is the de facto geometric setting of our machine learning architectures. However, recent literature has demonstrated that this choice comes with fundamental limitations. To that end, non-Euclidean learning is quickly gaining traction, particularly in web-related applications where complex relationships and structures are prevalent. Non-Euclidean spaces, such as hyperbolic, spherical, and mixed-curvature spaces, have been shown to provide more efficient and effective representations for data with intrinsic geometric properties, including web-related data like social network topology, query-document relationships, and user-item interactions. Integrating foundation models with non-Euclidean geometries has great potential to enhance their ability to capture and model the underlying structures, leading to better performance in search, recommendations, and content understanding. This workshop focuses on the intersection of Non-Euclidean Foundation Models and Geometric Learning (NEGEL), exploring its potential benefits, including the potential benefits for advancing web-related technologies, challenges, and future directions.

      <title>Bounding the density of binary sphere packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides the currently best known upper bound on the density of a packing in three-dimensional Euclidean space of two types of spheres whose size ratio is the largest one that allows the insertion of a small sphere in each octahedral hole of a hexagonal compact packing of large spheres. This upper bound is obtained by bounding from above the density of the tetrahedra which can appear in the additively-weighted Delaunay decomposition of the sphere centers of such packings. The proof relies on challenging computer calculations in interval arithmetic and may be of interest by their own.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic rigidity property from the realizability of chirotope extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a finite full-dimensional point configuration in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that if a point configuration $Q$ has the property that all finite chirotopes realizable by adding (generic) points to $P$ are also realizable by adding points to $Q$, then $P$ and $Q$ are equal up to a direct affine transform. We also show that for any point configuration $P$ and any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there is a finite, (generic) extension $\widehat P$ of $P$ with the following property: if another realization $Q$ of the chirotope of $P$ can be extended so as to realize the chirotope of $\widehat P$, then there exists a direct affine transform that maps each point of $Q$ within distance $\varepsilon$ of the corresponding point of $P$.</description>

      <title>VisDiff: SDF-Guided Polygon Generation for Visibility Reconstruction and Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to capture rich representations of combinatorial structures has enabled the application of machine learning to tasks such as analysis and generation of floorplans, terrains, images, and animations. Recent work has primarily focused on understanding structures with well-defined features, neighborhoods, or underlying distance metrics, while those lacking such characteristics remain largely unstudied. Examples of these combinatorial structures can be found in polygons, where a small change in the vertex locations causes a significant rearrangement of the combinatorial structure, expressed as a visibility or triangulation graphs. Current representation learning approaches fail to capture structures without well-defined features and distance metrics. In this paper, we study the open problem of Visibility Reconstruction: Given a visibility graph $G$, construct a polygon $P$ whose visibility graph is $G$.
  We introduce VisDiff, a novel diffusion-based approach to generate polygon $P$ from the input visibility graph $G$. The main novelty of our approach is that, rather than generating the polygon's vertex set directly, we first estimate the signed distance function (SDF) associated with the polygon. The SDF is then used to extract the vertex location representing the final polygon. We show that going through the SDF allows VisDiff to learn the visibility relationship much more effectively than generating vertex locations directly. In order to train VisDiff, we create a carefully curated dataset. We use this dataset to benchmark our method and achieve 26% improvement in F1-Score over standard methods as well as state of the art approaches.</description>
