      <title>Ensemble Deep Learning for enhanced seismic data reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic data often contain gaps due to various obstacles in the investigated area and recording instrument failures. Deep learning techniques offer promising solutions for reconstructing missing data parts by leveraging existing information. However, self-supervised methods frequently struggle with capturing under-represented features such as weaker events, crossing dips, and higher frequencies. To address these challenges, we propose a novel ensemble deep model along with a tailored self-supervised training approach for reconstructing seismic data with consecutive missing traces. Our model comprises two branches of U-nets, each fed from distinct data transformation modules aimed at amplifying under-represented features and promoting diversity among learners. Our loss function minimizes relative errors at the outputs of individual branches and the entire model, ensuring accurate reconstruction of various features while maintaining overall data integrity. Additionally, we employ masking while training to enhance sample diversity and memory efficiency. Application on two benchmark synthetic datasets and two real datasets demonstrates improved accuracy compared to a conventional U-net, successfully reconstructing weak events, diffractions, higher frequencies, and reflections obscured by groundroll. However, our method requires a threefold of training time compared to a simple U-net. An implementation of our method with TensorFlow is also made available.</description>

      <title>Fast Diffusion Model For Seismic Data Noise Attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise is one of the primary sources of interference in seismic exploration. Many authors have proposed various methods to remove noise from seismic data; however, in the face of strong noise conditions, satisfactory results are often not achievable. In recent years, methods based on diffusion models have been applied to the task of strong noise processing in seismic data. However, due to iterative computations, the computational efficiency of diffusion-based methods is much lower than conventional methods. To address this issue, we propose using an improved Bayesian equation for iterations, removing the stochastic terms from the computation. Additionally, we proposed a new normalization method adapted to the diffusion model. Through various improvements, on synthetic datasets and field datasets, our proposed method achieves significantly better noise attenuation effects compared to the benchmark methods, while also achieving a several-fold increase in computational speed. We employ transfer learning to demonstrate the robustness of our proposed method on open-source synthetic seismic data and validate on open-source field data sets. Finally, we open-sourced the code to promote the development of high-precision and efficient seismic exploration work.</description>
