      <title>Monotonicity of the ultrafilter number function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether the ultrafilter number function $\kappa \mapsto \mathfrak{u}(\kappa)$ on the cardinals is monotone, that is, $\mathfrak{u}(\lambda) \le \mathfrak{u}(\kappa)$ holds for all cardinals $\lambda &lt; \kappa$ or not. We show that monotonicity can fail, but the failure has a large cardinal strength. On the other hand, we prove that there are many limitations of the failure of monotonicity. For instance, if $\kappa$ is a singular cardinal with countable cofinality or a strong limit singular cardinal, then $\mathfrak{u}(\kappa) \le \mathfrak{u}(\kappa^+)$ holds.</description>

Abstract: We study \L o\'s's theorem in a choiceless context. We introduce some variants of \L o\'s's theorem. These variants seem weaker than \L o\'s's theorem, but we prove that these are equivalent to \L o\'s's theorem.</description>

      <title>Subseries Numbers for Convergent Subseries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every conditionally convergent series of real numbers has a subseries that diverges. The subseries numbers, previously studied in arXiv:1801.06206 , answer the question how many subsets of the natural numbers are necessary, such that every conditionally convergent series has a subseries that diverges, with the index set being one of our chosen sets. By restricting our attention to subseries generated by an index set that is both infinite and coinfinite, we may ask the question where the subseries have to be convergent. The answer to this question is a cardinal characteristic of the continuum.
  We consider several closely related variations to this question, and show that our cardinal characteristics are related to several well-known cardinal characteristics of the continuum. In our investigation, we simultaneously will produce dual results, answering the question how many conditionally convergent series one needs such that no single infinite coinfinite set of indices makes all of the series converge.</description>

      <title>Maximal WAP and tame quotients of type spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study maximal WAP and tame (in the sense of topological dynamics) quotients of $S_X(\mathfrak{C})$, where $\mathfrak{C}$ is a sufficiently saturated (called monster) model of a complete theory $T$, $X$ is a $\emptyset$-type-definable set, and $S_X(\mathfrak{C})$ is the space of complete types over $\mathfrak{C}$ concentrated on $X$. Namely, let $F_{\textrm{WAP}}\subseteq S_X(\mathfrak{C})\times S_X(\mathfrak{C})$ be the finest closed, $aut(\mathfrak{C})$-invariant equivalence relation on $S_X(\mathfrak{C})$ such that the flow $( aut(\mathfrak{C}), S_X(\mathfrak{C})/F_{\textrm{WAP}} )$ is WAP, and let $F_{\textrm{Tame}}\subseteq S_X(\mathfrak{C})\times S_X(\mathfrak{C})$ be the finest closed, $aut(\mathfrak{C})$-invariant equivalence relation on $S_X(\mathfrak{C})$ such that the flow $( aut(\mathfrak{C}), S_X(\mathfrak{C})/F_{\textrm{Tame}} )$ is tame. We show good behaviour of $F_{\textrm{WAP}}$ and $F_{\textrm{Tame}}$ under changing the monster model $\mathfrak{C}$. Namely, we prove that if $\mathfrak{C}'\succ \mathfrak{C}$ is a bigger monster model, $F'_{\textrm{WAP}}$ and $F'_{\textrm{Tame}}$ are the counterparts of $F_{\textrm{WAP}}$ and $F_{\textrm{Tame}}$ computed for $\mathfrak{C}'$, and $r\colon S_X(\mathfrak{C}')\to S_X(\mathfrak{C})$ is the restriction map, then $r[F'_{\textrm{WAP}}]=F_{\textrm{WAP}}$ and $r[F'_{\textrm{Tame}}]=F_{\textrm{Tame}}$. Using these results, we show that the Ellis (or ideal) groups of $( aut(\mathfrak{C}), S_X(\mathfrak{C})/F_{\textrm{WAP}} )$ and $(aut(\mathfrak{C}), S_X(\mathfrak{C})/F_{\textrm{Tame}})$ do not depend on the choice of the monster model $\mathfrak{C}$.</description>

      <title>$F_\sigma$-ideals, colorings, and representation in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent works by L. Drewnowski and I. Labuda and J. Mart\'inez et al., non-pathological analytic \( P \)-ideals and non-pathological \( F_\sigma \)-ideals have been characterized and studied in terms of their representations by a sequence \( (x_n)_n \) in a Banach space, as \( \mathcal{C}((x_n)_n) \) and \( \mathcal{B}((x_n)_n) \). The ideal \( \mathcal{C}((x_n)_n) \) consists of sets where the series \( \sum_{n \in A} x_n \) is unconditionally convergent, while \( \mathcal{B}((x_n)_n) \) involves weak unconditional convergence.
  In this paper, we further study these representations and provide effective descriptions of \( \mathcal{B} \)- and \( \mathcal{C} \)-ideals in the universal spaces \( C([0,1]) \) and \( C(2^{\mathbb{N}}) \), addressing a question posed by Borodulin-Nadzieja et al. A key aspect of our study is the role of the space \( c_0 \) in these representations. We focus particularly on \( \mathcal{B} \)-representations in spaces containing many copies of \( c_0 \), such as \( c_0 \)-saturated spaces of continuous functions.
  A central tool in our analysis is the concept of \( c \)-coloring ideals, which arise from homogeneous sets of continuous colorings. These ideals, generated by homogeneous sets of 2-colorings, exhibit a rich combinatorial structure. Among our results, we prove that for \( d \geq 3 \), the random \( d \)-homogeneous ideal is pathological,
  we construct hereditarily non-pathological universal \( c \)-coloring ideals, and we show that every \( \mathcal{B} \)-ideal represented in \( C(K) \), for \( K \) countable, contains a \( c \)-coloring ideal. Furthermore, by leveraging \( c \)-coloring ideals, we provide examples of \( \mathcal{B} \)-ideals that are not \( \mathcal{B} \)-representable in \( c_0 \). These findings highlight the interplay between combinatorial properties of ideals and their representations in Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Individual choice sequences -- History, development and use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We follow the history and development of Brouwer's use of individual choice sequences up to the discovery of a method to apply them successfully in 1927. With the principles we derive from this first use we analyze in detail Brouwer's work from that time onward. Our reconstruction uses only very basic principles. It aligns exactly with Brouwer's work after 1927 and, moreover, it gives a clear explanation of the proofs of his results and the terms he uses.</description>

      <title>The Alternation Hierarchy of First-Order Logic on Words is Decidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for any $i &gt; 0$, it is decidable, given a regular language, whether it is expressible in the $\Sigma_i[&lt;]$ fragment of first-order logic FO[&lt;]. This settles a question open since 1971.
  Our main technical result relies on the notion of polynomial closure of a class of languages $\mathcal{V}$, that is, finite unions of languages of the form $L_0a_1L_1\cdots a_nL_n$ where each $a_i$ is a letter and each $L_i$ a language of $\mathcal{V}$. We show that if a class $\mathcal{V}$ of regular languages with some closure properties (namely, a positive variety) has a decidable separation problem, then so does its polynomial closure Pol($\mathcal{V}$). The resulting algorithm for Pol($\mathcal{V}$) has time complexity that is exponential in the time complexity for $\mathcal{V}$ and we propose a natural conjecture that would lead to a polynomial time blowup instead.
  Corollaries include the decidability of half levels of the dot-depth hierarchy and the group-based concatenation hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Skolemization In Intermediate Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skolemization, with Herbrand's theorem, underpins automated theorem proving and various transformations in computer science and mathematics. Skolemization removes strong quantifiers by introducing new function symbols, enabling efficient proof search algorithms. We characterize intermediate first-order logics that admit standard (and Andrews) Skolemization. These are the logics that allow classical quantifier shift principles. For some logics not in this category, innovative forms of Skolem functions are developed that allow Skolemization. Moreover, we analyze predicate intuitionistic logic with quantifier shift axioms and demonstrate its Kripke frame-incompleteness. These findings may foster resolution-based theorem provers for non-classical logics. This article is part of a larger project investigating Skolemization in non-classical logics.</description>

      <title>On Ordinal Invariants in Well Quasi Orders and Finite Antichain Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.00428v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ordinal invariants height, length, and width of well quasi orders (WQO), with particular emphasis on width, an invariant of interest for the larger class of orders with finite antichain condition (FAC). We show that the width in the class of FAC orders is completely determined by the width in the class of WQOs, in the sense that if we know how to calculate the width of any WQO then we have a procedure to calculate the width of any given FAC order. We show how the width of WQO orders obtained via some classical constructions can sometimes be computed in a compositional way. In particular, this allows proving that every ordinal can be obtained as the width of some WQO poset. One of the difficult questions is to give a complete formula for the width of Cartesian products of WQOs. Even the width of the product of two ordinals is only known through a complex recursive formula. Although we have not given a complete answer to this question we have advanced the state of knowledge by considering some more complex special cases and in particular by calculating the width of certain products containing three factors. In the course of writing the paper we have discovered that some of the relevant literature was written on cross-purposes and some of the notions re-discovered several times. Therefore we also use the occasion to give a unified presentation of the known results.
  ERRATUM:We incorrectly claimed in Lemma 4.4(1) that the formula $o(P\cdot Q)=o(P)\cdot o(Q)$ for wpos $P$ and $Q$ was due to Abraham and Bonnet.</description>

      <title>Computable classifications of continuous, transducer, and regular functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.09499v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic algorithmic framework that unites global and local classification problems using index sets. We prove that the classification problem for continuous (binary) regular functions among almost everywhere linear, pointwise linear-time Lipschitz functions is $\Sigma^0_2$-complete. (Every regular function is pointwise linear-time Lipschitz.) We show that a function $f\colon [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is (binary) transducer if and only if it is continuous regular. As one of many consequences, our $\Sigma^0_2$-completeness result covers the class of transducer functions as well. Finally, we show that the Banach space $C[0,1]$ of real-valued continuous functions admits an arithmetical classification among separable Banach spaces. Our proofs combine methods of abstract computability theory, automata theory, and functional analysis.</description>

Abstract: The following is a 2008 conjecture of Abraham, Bonnet and Kubi\'s: [ABK Conjecture] Every well quasi order (wqo) is a countable union of better quasi orders (bqo). We obtain a partial progress on the conjecture, by showing that the class of orders that are a countable union of better quasi orders (sigma-bqo) is closed under various operations. These include diverse products, such as the Dress-Shieffels product. We develop various properties of the latter product. In relation with the main question, we explore the class of alpha-wqo for countable ordinals alpha and obtain several closure properties and a Hausdorff-style classification theorem. Our main contribution is the discovery of various properties of sigma-bqos and ruling out potential counterexamples to the ABK Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Axiomatic Theory of Independence Relations in Model Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This course introduces the fruitful links between model theory and a combinatoric of sets given by independence relations. An independence relation on a set is a ternary relation between subsets. Chapter 1 should be considered as an introductory chapter. It does not mention first-order theories or formulas. It introduces independence relations in a naive set theory framework. Its goal is to get the reader familiar with basic axioms of independence relations (which do not need an ambient theory to be stated) as well as introduce closure operators and pregeometries. Chapter 2 introduces the model-theoretic context. The two main examples (algebraically closed fields and the random graph) are described as well as independence relations in those examples. Chapter 3 gives the axioms of independence relations in a model-theoretic context. It introduces the general toolbox of the model-theorists (indiscernible sequences, Ramsey/Erdos-Rado and compactness) and the independence relations of heirs/coheirs with two main applications: Adler's theorem of symmetry (how symmetry emerges from a weaker set of axioms, which is rooted in the work of Kim and Pillay) and a criterion for NSOP4 using stationary independence relations in the style of Conant. Independence relations satisfying Adler's theorem of symmetry are here called 'Adler independence relations' or AIR. Chapter 4 treats forking and dividing. It is proved that dividing independence is always stronger than any AIR (even though it is not an AIR in general) a connection between the independence theorem and forking independence, which holds in all generality and is based on Kim-Pillay's approach. Then, simplicity is defined and the interesting direction of the Kim-Pillay theorem (namely that the existence of an Adler independence relation satisfying the independence theorem yields simplicity) is deduced from earlier results.</description>

      <title>Counting Sets with Surnatural Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How many odd numbers are there? How many even numbers? From Galileo to Cantor, the suggestion was that there are the same number of odd, even and natural numbers, because all three sets can be mapped in one-one fashion to each other. This jars with our intuition: cardinality fails to discriminate between sets that are intuitively of different sizes.
  The class of surreal numbers $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{No}}$ is the largest possible ordered field. In this work we define a function, the magnum, mapping a selection of countable sets to a subclass of the surreals, the surnatural numbers $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{Nn}}$. Set magnums are found to be consistent with our intuition about relative set sizes. The magnum of a proper subset of a set is strictly less than the magnum of the set itself, in harmony with Euclid's axiom, ``the whole is greater than the part''.
  Two approaches are taken to specify magnums. First, they are determined by following the genetic assignment of magnums in the way the surreal numbers themselves are defined. Second, the domain of the counting sequence, which is defined for every countable set, is extended, to evaluate it on the surnatural numbers. The two methods are shown to be consistent.
  For a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{N}$, the magnum is defined as the value at $\omega$ of the extended counting function of $A$. Larger sets are partitioned into finite components and a more general definition of magnums is presented. Several theorems concerning the properties of magnums are proved, and are employed to evaluate the magnums of a range of interesting countable sets.
  The relativity of the magnum function is discussed and a number of examples illustrate how its value depends on the choice and ordering of the reference set. In particular, we show how the rational numbers may be ordered in such a way that all unit rational intervals have equal magnums.</description>

Abstract: We show that the equational theory of the structure $\langle \omega^{\omega}: (x,y)\mapsto x+y, x\mapsto \omega x \rangle $ is finitely axiomatizable and give a simple axiom schema when the domain is the set of transfinite ordinals. We give an algorithm that given a pair of terms $(E,F)$ decides in linear time with respect of their common length whether or not $E=F$ is a consequence of the axioms.</description>

      <title>Boundedly finite-to-one functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10183v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A function is boundedly finite-to-one if there is a natural number $k$ such that each point has at most $k$ inverse images. In this paper, we prove in $\mathsf{ZF}$ (i.e., the Zermelo--Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice) several results concerning this notion, among which are the following:
  (1) For each infinite set $A$ and natural number $n$, there is no boundedly finite-to-one function from $\mathcal{S}(A)$ to $\mathcal{S}_{\leq n}(A)$, where $\mathcal{S}(A)$ is the set of all permutations of $A$ and $\mathcal{S}_{\leq n}(A)$ is the set of all permutations of $A$ moving at most $n$ points.
  (2) For each infinite set $A$, there is no boundedly finite-to-one function from $\mathcal{B}(A)$ to $\mathrm{fin}(A)$, where $\mathcal{B}(A)$ is the set of all partitions of $A$ such that every block is finite and $\mathrm{fin}(A)$ is the set of all finite subsets of $A$.</description>

      <title>On maximal order type of the lexicographic product</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the previously submitted version of this paper, available here for the record, we stated the following : "We give a self-contained proof of Isa Vialard's formula for $o(P\cdot Q)$ where $P$ and $Q$ are wpos. The proof introduces the notion of a cut of partial order, which might be of independent interest." In fact, the argument presented in the paper is wrong and Vialard formula has no known proof. I will try to prove the formula $o(P\cdot Q)=o(P)\cdot o(Q)$ from the [DzSS] paper because I believe that Altman's purported counter-example mentioned in the preprint is incorrect.

      <title>Big Ramsey degrees using parameter spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.00967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the universal homogeneous partial order has finite big Ramsey degrees and discuss several corollaries. Our proof relies on parameter spaces and the Carlson-Simpson theorem rather than on (a strengthening of) the Halpern-L\"auchli theorem and the Milliken tree theorem, which are typically used to bound big Ramsey degrees in the existing literature (originating from the work of Laver and Milliken).
  This new technique has many additional applications. We show that the homogeneous universal triangle-free graph has finite big Ramsey degrees, providing a short proof of a recent result by Dobrinen. Moreover, generalizing an indivisibility (vertex partition) result of Nguyen van Th\'e and Sauer, we give an upper bound on big Ramsey degrees of metric spaces with finitely many distances. This leads to a new combinatorial argument for the oscillation stability of the Urysohn Sphere.</description>

      <title>A generalization of de Vries duality to closed relations between compact Hausdorff spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stone duality generalizes to an equivalence between the categories $\mathsf{Stone}^{\mathsf{R}}$ of Stone spaces and closed relations and $\mathsf{BA}^\mathsf{S}$ of boolean algebras and subordination relations. Splitting equivalences in $\mathsf{Stone}^{\mathsf{R}}$ yields a category that is equivalent to the category $\mathsf{KHaus}^\mathsf{R}$ of compact Hausdorff spaces and closed relations. Similarly, splitting equivalences in $\mathsf{BA}^\mathsf{S}$ yields a category that is equivalent to the category $\mathsf{DeV^S}$ of de Vries algebras and compatible subordination relations. Applying the machinery of allegories then yields that $\mathsf{KHaus}^\mathsf{R}$ is equivalent to $\mathsf{DeV^S}$, thus resolving a problem recently raised in the literature.
  The equivalence between $\mathsf{KHaus}^\mathsf{R}$ and $\mathsf{DeV^S}$ further restricts to an equivalence between the category ${\mathsf{KHaus}}$ of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous functions and the wide subcategory $\mathsf{DeV^F}$ of $\mathsf{DeV^S}$ whose morphisms satisfy additional conditions. This yields an alternative to de Vries duality. One advantage of this approach is that composition of morphisms is usual relation composition.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10088v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a result of 33 intercontinental Zoom calls, we characterise big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order. This is an infinitary extension of the well known fact that finite partial orders endowed with linear extensions form a Ramsey class (this result was announced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and R\"odl in 1984 with first published proof by Paoli, Trotter and Walker in 1985). Towards this, we refine earlier upper bounds obtained by Hubi\v{c}ka based on a new connection of big Ramsey degrees to the Carlson-Simpson theorem and we also introduce a new technique of giving lower bounds using an iterated application of the upper-bound theorem.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Preservations of Ulam Stability-type Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show some preservation results of amenably extending strongly Ulam stable groups under mild decay assumptions, including quantitative preservation of asymptotic bounds under the assumption that the modulus of stability is H\"older continuous of exponent $s&gt;\frac 1 2$ at 0, utilizing some simplistic integral estimates. Additionally, we show some partial results around inductive preservation of modulus bounds in infinite dimensions using these integral estimates, as well as strong quantitative preservation in the finite dimensional case. This implies the existence of $\mathfrak{U}$ uniformly stable existential closures among groups with sufficiently large Lipschitz estimates of any countable group. Finally, we show quantitative control preserving difficulty of approximation of maps over stable groups on diagonally embedding into higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the shatter function of semilinear set systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the shatter function of a semilinear set system on $\mathbb{R}^m$ is asymptotic to a polynomial. This confirms, for the structure $(\mathbb{R}; +, &lt;)$, a conjecture of Chernikov and is a step towards characterizing model-theoretic linearity via shatter functions.</description>
