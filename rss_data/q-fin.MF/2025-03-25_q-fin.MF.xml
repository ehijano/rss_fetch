      <title>Clearing Sections of Lattice Liability Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern financial networks involve complex obligations that transcend simple monetary debts: multiple currencies, prioritized claims, supply chain dependencies, and more. We present a mathematical framework that unifies and extends these scenarios by recasting the classical Eisenberg-Noe model of financial clearing in terms of lattice liability networks. Each node in the network carries a complete lattice of possible states, while edges encode nominal liabilities. Our framework generalizes the scalar-valued clearing vectors of the classical model to lattice-valued clearing sections, preserving the elegant fixed-point structure while dramatically expanding its descriptive power. Our main theorem establishes that such networks possess clearing sections that themselves form a complete lattice under the product order. This structure theorem enables tractable analysis of equilibria in diverse domains, including multi-currency financial systems, decentralized finance with automated market makers, supply chains with resource transformation, and permission networks with complex authorization structures. We further extend our framework to chain-complete lattices for term structure models and multivalued mappings for complex negotiation systems. Our results demonstrate how lattice theory provides a natural language for understanding complex network dynamics across multiple domains, creating a unified mathematical foundation for analyzing systemic risk, resource allocation, and network stability.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Models for Two Stocks with Superhedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An agent-based modelling methodology for the joint price evolution of two stocks is put forward. The method models future multidimensional price trajectories reflecting how a class of agents rebalance their portfolios in an operational way by reacting to how stocks' charts unfold. Prices are expressed in units of a third stock that acts as numeraire. The methodology is robust, in particular, it does not depend on any prior probability or analytical assumptions and it is based on constructing scenarios/trajectories. A main ingredient is a superhedging interpretation that provides relative superhedging prices between the two modelled stocks. The operational nature of the methodology gives objective conditions for the validity of the model and so implies realistic risk-rewards profiles for the agent's operations. Superhedging computations are performed with a dynamic programming algorithm deployed on a graph data structure. Null subsets of the trajectory space are directly related to arbitrage opportunities (i.e. there is no need for probabilistic considerations) that may emerge during the trajectory set construction. It follows that the superhedging algorithm handles null sets in a rigorous and intuitive way. Superhedging and underhedging bounds are kept relevant to the investor by means of a worst case pruning method and, as an alternative, a theory supported pruning that relies on a new notion of small arbitrage.</description>

      <title>Rough Heston model as the scaling limit of bivariate heavy-tailed INAR($\infty$) processes and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a novel link between nearly unstable heavy-tailed integer-valued autoregressive (INAR) processes and the rough Heston model via discrete scaling limits. We prove that a sequence of bivariate cumulative INAR($\infty$) processes converge in law to the rough Heston model under appropriate scaling conditions, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding how microstructural order flow drives rough volatility dynamics. Our theoretical framework extends the scaling limit techniques from Hawkes processes to the INAR($\infty$) setting. Thus we can carry out Monte Carlo simulation of the rough Heston model through simulating the corresponding approximating INAR($\infty$) processes. Extensive numerical experiments illustrate the improved accuracy and efficiency of the proposed simulation method as compared to the literature, in the pricing of not only European options, but also path-dependent options such as arithmetic Asian options, lookback options and barrier options.</description>

      <title>ESG-coherent risk measures for sustainable investing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing interest in sustainable investing calls for an axiomatic approach to measures of risk and reward that focus not only on financial returns, but also on measures of environmental and social sustainability, i.e. environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores. We propose definitions for ESG-coherent risk measures and ESG reward-risk ratios based on functions of bivariate random variables that are applied to financial returns and ESG scores, extending the traditional univariate measures to the ESG case. We provide examples and present an empirical analysis in which the ESG-coherent risk measures and ESG reward-risk ratios are used to rank stocks.</description>

      <title>Set risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of set risk measures (SRMs), which are real-valued maps defined on the space of all non-empty, closed, and bounded sets of almost surely bounded random variables. Traditional risk measures typically operate on spaces of random variables, but SRMs extend this framework to sets of random variables. We establish an axiom scheme for SRMs, similar to classical risk measures but adapted for set operations. The main technical contribution is an axiomatic dual representation of convex SRMs by using regular, finitely additive measures on the unit ball of the dual space of essentially bounded random variables. We explore worst-case SRMs, which evaluate risk as the supremum of individual risks within a set, and provide a collection of examples illustrating the applicability of our framework to systemic risk, portfolio optimization, and decision-making under uncertainty. This work extends the theory of risk measures to a more general and flexible setup, accommodating a broader range of financial and mathematical applications.</description>
