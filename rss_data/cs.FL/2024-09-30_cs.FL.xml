      <title>Non-cooperative rational synthesis problem for probabilistic strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the decidability and complexity of non-cooperative rational synthesis problem (abbreviated as NCRSP) for some classes of probabilistic strategies. We show that NCRSP for stationary strategies and Muller objectives is in 3-EXPTIME, and if we restrict the strategies of environment players to be positional, NCRSP becomes NEXPSPACE solvable. On the other hand, NCRSP_&gt;, which is a variant of NCRSP, is shown to be undecidable even for pure finite-state strategies and terminal reachability objectives. Finally, we show that NCRSP becomes EXPTIME solvable if we restrict the memory of a strategy to be the most recently visited t vertices where t is linear in the size of the game.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Weighted Information Extraction: A Simpler and Faster Algorithm for Ranked Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information extraction from textual data, where the query is represented by a finite transducer and the task is to enumerate all results without repetition, and its extension to the weighted case, where each output element has a weight and the output elements are to be enumerated sorted by their weights, are important and well studied problems in database theory. On the one hand, the first framework already covers the well-known case of regular document spanners, while the latter setting covers several practically relevant tasks that cannot be described in the unweighted setting.
  It is known that in the unweighted case this problem can be solved with linear time preprocessing O(|D|) and output-linear delay O(|s|) in data complexity, where D is the input data and s is the current output element. For the weighted case, Bourhis, Grez, Jachiet, and Riveros [ICDT 2021] recently designed an algorithm with linear time preprocessing, but the delay of O(|s| log(|D|)) depends on the size of the data.
  We first show how to leverage the existing results on enumerating shortest paths to obtain a simple alternative algorithm with linear preprocessing and a delay of O(|s_i| + min{ log(i), \log(|D|)}) for the i^{th} output element s_i (in data complexity); thus, substantially improving the previous algorithm. Next, we develop a technically involved rounding technique that allows us to devise an algorithm with linear time preprocessing and output-linear delay O(|s|) with high probability. To this end, we combine tools from algebra, high-dimensional geometry, and linear programming.</description>

      <title>Beyond Decisiveness of Infinite Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verification of infinite-state Markov chains is still a challenge despite several fruitful numerical or statistical approaches. For decisive Markov chains, there is a simple numerical algorithm that frames the reachability probability as accurately as required (however with an unknown complexity). On the other hand when applicable, statistical model checking is in most of the cases very efficient. Here we study the relation between these two approaches showing first that decisiveness is a necessary and sufficient condition for almost sure termination of statistical model checking. Afterwards we develop an approach with application to both methods that substitutes to a non decisive Markov chain a decisive Markov chain with the same reachability probability. This approach combines two key ingredients: abstraction and importance sampling (a technique that was formerly used for efficiency). We develop this approach on a generic formalism called layered Markov chain (LMC). Afterwards we perform an empirical study on probabilistic pushdown automata (an instance of LMC) to understand the complexity factors of the statistical and numerical algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this prototype is the first implementation of the deterministic algorithm for decisive Markov chains and required us to solve several qualitative and numerical issues.</description>

      <title>Completeness Theorems for Kleene algebra with tests and top</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07190v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two completeness results for Kleene algebra with tests and a top element, with respect to guarded string languages and binary relations. While the equational theories of those two classes of models coincide over the signature of Kleene algebra, this is no longer the case when we consider an additional constant ``top'' for the full element. Indeed, the full relation satisfies more laws than the full language, and we show that those additional laws can all be derived from a single additional axiom. We recover that the two equational theories coincide if we slightly generalise the notion of relational model, allowing sub-algebras of relations where top is a greatest element but not necessarily the full relation. We use models of closed languages and reductions in order to prove our completeness results, which are relative to any axiomatisation of the algebra of regular events. For one of our constructions, we extend the concept of finite monoid recognisability to guarded-string languages; this device makes it possible to obtain a PSpace algorithm for the equational theory of binary relations.</description>

      <title>On shortest products for nonnegative matrix mortality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set of matrices with integer entries, the matrix mortality problem asks if there exists a product of these matrices equal to the zero matrix. We consider a special case of this problem where all entries of the matrices are nonnegative. This case is equivalent to the NFA mortality problem, which, given an NFA, asks for a word $w$ such that the image of every state under $w$ is the empty set. The size of the alphabet of the NFA is then equal to the number of matrices in the set. We study the length of shortest such words depending on the size of the alphabet. We show that for an NFA with $n$ states this length can be at least $2^n - 1$ for an alphabet of size $n$, $2^{(n - 4)/2}$ for an alphabet of size $3$ and $2^{(n - 2)/3}$ for an alphabet of size $2$. We also discuss further open problems related to mortality of NFAs and DFAs.</description>

      <title>The Bright Side of Timed Opacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2009, Franck Cassez showed that the timed opacity problem, where an attacker can observe some actions with their timestamps and attempts to deduce information, is undecidable for timed automata (TAs). Moreover, he showed that the undecidability holds even for subclasses such as event-recording automata. In this article, we consider the same definition of opacity for several other subclasses of TAs: with restrictions on the number of clocks, of actions, on the nature of time, or on a new subclass called observable event-recording automata. We show that opacity can mostly be retrieved, except for one-action TAs and for one-clock TAs with $\epsilon$-transitions, for which undecidability remains. We then exhibit a new decidable subclass in which the number of observations made by the attacker is limited.</description>
