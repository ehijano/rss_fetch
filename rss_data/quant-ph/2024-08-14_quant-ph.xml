      <title>Optimal quantum state tomography with local informationally complete measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verification of near-term quantum devices. While QST for a generic quantum many-body state requires an exponentially large amount of resources, most physical quantum states are structured and can often be represented by a much smaller number of parameters, making efficient QST potentially possible. A prominent example is a matrix product state (MPS) or a matrix product density operator (MPDO), which is believed to represent most physical states generated by one-dimensional (1D) quantum devices. We study whether a general MPS/MPDO state can be recovered with bounded errors using only a number of state copies polynomial in the number of qubits, which is necessary for efficient QST. To make this question practically interesting, we assume only local measurements of qubits directly on the target state. By using a local symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measurement (SIC-POVM), we provide a positive answer to the above question for a variety of common many-body quantum states, including typical short-range entangled states, random MPS/MPDO states, and thermal states of one-dimensional Hamiltonians. In addition, we also provide an affirmative no answer for certain long-range entangled states such as a family of generalized GHZ states, but with the exception of target states that are known to have real-valued wavefunctions. Our answers are supported by a near-perfect agreement between an efficient calculation of the Cramer-Rao bound that rigorously bounds the sample complexity and numerical optimization results using a machine learning assisted maximal likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm. This agreement also leads to an optimal QST protocol using local SIC-POVM that can be practically implemented on current quantum hardware and is highly efficient for most 1D physical states.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multiparty Entanglement Distribution with DODAG-X Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the DODAG-X protocol for multipartite entanglement distribution in quantum networks. Leveraging the power of Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs), our protocol optimizes resource consumption and enhances robustness to noise in dynamic and lossy networks. Implementing a variation on the X-protocol within the DODAG, we minimize graph verification and path-finding calculations, significantly reducing computational overhead when compared to other entanglement routing schemes. Additionally, our benchmarks on grid lattice and small-world topologies reveal substantial measurement reduction compared to existing protocols. We demonstrate the success of DODAG-X for generating maximal three-party entanglement in arbitrary networks, and describe the potential for scaling to generic $n$-party entanglement. The DODAG-X protocol provides a scalable and efficient solution for entanglement routing, advancing current techniques for reliable quantum communication and network applications.</description>

      <title>Slow approach to adiabaticity in many-body non-Hermitian systems: the Hatano-Nelson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the near adiabatic dynamics in a non-Hermitian quantum many-body system by investigating a finite-time ramp of the imaginary vector potential in the interacting Hatano-Nelson model. The excess energy, the Loschmidt echo, and the density imbalance are analyzed using bosonization and exact diagonalization. The energy becomes complex valued, despite the instantaneous Hamiltonian having the same real spectrum throughout. The adiabatic limit is approached very slowly through damped oscillations. The decay scales with $\tau^{-1}$ with $\tau$ the ramp duration, while the oscillation period is $2L/v$ with $v$ the Fermi velocity and $L$ the system length. Yet, without the need for auxiliary controls, a shortcut to adiabaticity is found for ramp times commensurate with the period. Our work highlights the intricate interplay of adiabaticity and non-Hermitian many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum compilation of two-qubit gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological quantum compilation of two-qubit operations within a system of Fibonacci anyons. Our primary goal is to generate gates that are approximately leakage-free and equivalent to the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate up to single-qubit operations. These gates belong to the local equivalence class [CNOT]. Additionally, we explore which local equivalence classes of two-qubit operations can be naturally generated by braiding Fibonacci anyons. We discovered that most of the generated classes are located near the edges of the Weyl chamber representation of two-qubit gates, specifically between the local equivalence classes of the identity [1] and [CNOT], and between those of the double-controlled-NOT [DCNOT] and [SWAP]. Furthermore, we found a numerically exact implementation of a local equivalent of the SWAP gate using a sequence of only nine elements from the Fibonacci braiding gate set.</description>

      <title>The x+y Floquet code: A simple example for topological quantum computation in the path integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The path-integral approach to topological quantum error correction provides a unified way to construct and analyze fault-tolerant circuits in spacetime. In this work, we demonstrate its utility and versatility at hand of a simple example: We construct a new fault-tolerant circuit for the toric-code phase by traversing its path integral on a $(x,y,z)$ cubic lattice in the $x+y$ direction. The circuit acts on qubits on a square lattice, and alternates between horizontal nearest-neighbor $CX$ gates and vertical nearest-neighbor $ZZ$ and $XX$ measurements. We show how to incorporate boundaries and corners into the fault-tolerant circuit and how to perform topologically protected logic gates. As a specific example, we consider performing a fault-tolerant logical $ZZ$ measurement via lattice surgery of two spatial rectangular blocks of our fault-tolerant circuit.</description>

      <title>Impact of Jahn-Teller distortions on persistent molecular ring current in benzene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circularly polarized femtosecond UV laser pulse can remove a {\pi} electron from benzene in such a way that the leftover hole circulates around the cation as a persistent ring current. We investigate the time dependent strength of the current as the molecule relaxes from the D6h symmetry of the neutral to the D2h symmetry of the cation due to the Jahn-Teller effect. We explore the effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking on persistent ring currents for benzene cation, because it is one of the most comprehensively studied examples of the Jahn-Teller effect.</description>

      <title>Generating Fock-state superposition from coherent state by quantum measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-level Fock states and their superpositions are essentially exotic testbeds for nonclassical physics and valuable resources for quantum technologies. We provide a simple protocol on quantum measurement to generate an arbitrary Fock state and selected superposed Fock states from a coherent state of a target resonator, without any carefully tailored external driving. This conditional protocol can be efficiently constructed by a sequence of joint free-evolution of the resonator and an ancillary qubit, that are coupled via a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and projective measurements on the qubit. By properly choosing the duration of each evolution-measurement cycle and the initial state of the resonator, we can generate a desired Fock state $|n\rangle$ and a superposed Fock state $(|0\rangle+|n\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$, $n\sim10$, with a fidelity over $99\%$ in less than $30$ measurements. Moreover, our protocol can be straightforwardly extended to the generation of a multi-excitation Bell state $(|00\rangle+|nn\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$ in a double-resonator system.</description>

      <title>Strategies for optimizing double-bracket quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently double-bracket quantum algorithms have been proposed as a way to compile circuits for approximating eigenstates. Physically, they consist of appropriately composing evolutions under an input Hamiltonian together with diagonal evolutions. Here, we present strategies to optimize the choice of the double-bracket evolutions to enhance the diagonalization efficiency. This can be done by finding optimal generators and durations of the evolutions. We present numerical results regarding the preparation of double-bracket iterations, both in ideal cases where the algorithm's setup provides analytical convergence guarantees and in more heuristic cases, where we use an adaptive and variational approach to optimize the generators of the evolutions. As an example, we discuss the efficacy of these optimization strategies when considering a spin-chain Hamiltonian as the target. To propose algorithms that can be executed starting today, fully aware of the limitations of the quantum technologies at our disposal, we finally present a selection of diagonal evolution parametrizations that can be directly compiled into CNOTs and single-qubit rotation gates. We discuss the advantages and limitations of this compilation and propose a way to take advantage of this approach when used in synergy with other existing methods.</description>

      <title>Accurately Simulating the Time Evolution of an Ising Model with Echo Verified Clifford Data Regression on a Superconducting Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an error mitigation strategy composed of Echo Verification (EV) and Clifford Data Regression (CDR), the combination of which allows one to learn the effect of the quantum noise channel to extract error mitigated estimates for the expectation value of Pauli observables. We analyse the behaviour of the method under the depolarizing channel and derive an estimator for the depolarization rate in terms of the ancilla purity and postselection probability. We also highlight the sensitivity of this probability to noise, a potential bottleneck for the technique. We subsequently consider a more general noise channel consisting of arbitrary Pauli errors, which reveals a linear relationship between the error rates and the estimation of expectation values, suggesting the learnability of noise in EV by regression techniques. Finally, we present a practical demonstration of Echo Verified Clifford Data Regression (EVCDR) on a superconducting quantum computer and observe accurate results for the time evolution of an Ising model over a spin-lattice consisting of up to 35 sites and circuit depths in excess of 1,000.</description>

      <title>Threshold in quantum correlated interference for a particle interacting with two scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlated interference is calculated for a microscopic particle retro-reflecting from two spatially separated scatterers that are free to move, all three of which are treated as quantum bodies: the positions of the particle traversing this one-dimensional interferometer and those of the interferometer components are all uncertain. Interference in a measurement of only the particle is shown to disappear for microscopic yet appear for mesoscopic scatterers, contrary to that of a quantum-classical transition. A measurement of this threshold can verify quantum correlations in many-body systems by measuring only the retro-reflected microscopic particle. The decoherence of a mesoscopic scatterer is determined by this threshold without it having to traverse slits or beamsplitters.</description>

      <title>Steady-state entanglement of interacting masses in free space through optimal feedback control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a feedback strategy based on optimal quantum feedback control for Gaussian systems to maximise the likelihood of steady-state entanglement detection between two directly interacting masses. We employ linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control to engineer the phase space dynamics of the two masses and propose Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)-type variance minimisation constraints for the feedback to facilitate unconditional entanglement generation. This scheme allows for stationary entanglement in parameter regimes where strategies based on total energy minimisation ($cooling$) would fail. This feedback strategy, applied to the system of two masses driven out-of-thermal equilibrium [arXiv:2408.06251] enables unconditional entanglement generation under realistic experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimal number of stabilizer measurement rounds in an idling surface code patch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logical qubits can be protected against environmental noise by encoding them into a highly entangled state of many physical qubits and actively intervening in the dynamics with stabilizer measurements. In this work, we numerically optimize the rate of these interventions: the number of stabilizer measurement rounds for a logical qubit encoded in a surface code patch and idling for a given time. We model the environmental noise on the circuit level, including gate errors, readout errors, amplitude and phase damping. We find, qualitatively, that the optimal number of stabilizer measurement rounds is getting smaller for better qubits and getting larger for better gates or larger code sizes. We discuss the implications of our results to some of the leading architectures, superconducting qubits, and neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Quantum key distribution based on mid-infrared and telecom band two-color entanglement source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the high noise caused by solar background radiation, the existing satellite-based free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) experiments are mainly carried out at night, hindering the establishment of a practical all-day real-time global-scale quantum network. Given that the 3-5 {\mu}m mid-infrared (MIR) band has extremely low solar background radiation and strong scattering resistance, it is one of the ideal bands for free-space quantum communication. Here, firstly, we report on the preparation of a high-quality MIR (3370 nm) and telecom band (1555 nm) two-color polarization-entangled photon source, then we use this source to realize a principle QKD based on free-space and fiber hybrid channels in a laboratory. The theoretical analysis clearly shows that a long-distance QKD over 500 km of free-space and 96 km of fiber hybrid channels can be reached simultaneously. This work represents a significant step toward developing all-day global-scale quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Squeezed states of light after high-harmonic generation in excited atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) has recently emerged as a promising method for generating non-classical states of light with frequencies spanning from the infrared up to the extreme ultraviolet regime. In this work, we theoretically investigate the generation of squeezed states of light through HHG processes in atomic systems that had been initially driven to their first excited state. Our study reveals significant single-mode squeezing in both the driving field and low-order harmonic modes. Additionally, we characterize two-mode squeezing features in the generated states, both between fundamental and harmonic modes, and among the harmonic modes themselves. Using these correlations, we demonstrate the generation of optical Schr\"odinger kitten states through heralding measurements, specifically via photon subtraction in one of the modes influenced by two-mode squeezing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current methods for verifying quantum computers are predominately based on interactive or automatic theorem provers. Considering that quantum computers are dynamical in nature, this paper employs and extends the concepts from the verification of dynamical systems to verify properties of quantum circuits. Our main contribution is to propose k-inductive barrier certificates over complex variables and show how to compute them using Hermitian Sum of Squares optimization. We apply this new technique to verify properties of different quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Chiral-Extended Photon-Emitter Dressed States in Non-Hermitian Topological Baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of quantum emitters and non-Hermitian structured baths has received increasing attention in recent years. Here, we predict unconventional quantum optical behaviors of quantum emitters coupled to a non-Hermitian topological bath, which is realized in a 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic chain subjected to nonlocal dissipation. In addition to the Hermitian-like chiral bound states in the middle line gap and skin-mode-like hidden bound states inside the point gap, we identify peculiar in-gap chiral and extended photon-emitter dressed states. This is due to the competition of topological-edge localization and non-Hermitian skin-mode localization in combination with the non-Bloch bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, when two emitters are coupled to the same bath, such in-gap dressed states can mediate the nonreciprocal long-range emitter-emitter interactions, with the interaction range limited only by the dissipation of the bath. Our work opens the door to further study rich quantum optical phenomena and exotic many-body physics utilizing quantum emitters coupled to non-Hermitian topological baths.</description>

      <title>Neural Quantum States and Peaked Molecular Wave Functions: Curse or Blessing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of neural quantum states has recently experienced a tremendous progress, making them a competitive tool of computational quantum many-body physics. However, their largest achievements to date mostly concern interacting spin systems, while their utility for quantum chemistry remains yet to be demonstrated. Two main complications are the peaked structure of the molecular wave functions, which impedes sampling, and large number of terms in second quantised Hamiltonians, which hinders scaling to larger molecule sizes. In this paper we address these issues jointly and argue that the peaked structure might actually be key to drastically more efficient calculations. Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithm for autoregressive sampling without replacement and a procedure to calculate a computationally cheaper surrogate for the local energy. We complement them with a custom modification of the stochastic reconfiguration optimisation technique and a highly optimised GPU implementation. As a result, our calculations require substantially less resources and exhibit more than order of magnitude speedup compared to the previous works. On a single GPU we study molecules comprising up to 118 qubits and outperform the ``golden standard'' CCSD(T) benchmark in Hilbert spaces of $\sim 10^{15}$ Slater determinants, which is orders of magnitude larger than what was previously achieved. We believe that our work underscores the prospect of NQS for challenging quantum chemistry calculations and serves as a favourable ground for the future method development.</description>

      <title>Creating two-qudit maximally entangled quantum link through bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a set-up for creating maximally entangled two-qudit links between distant nodes which are weakly coupled with interacting spin-s bulk (processor). We exhibit that such quantum links of arbitrary spin quantum number can be formed when the system is prepared at a very low temperature. We find that the Heisenberg and the bilinear-biquadratic (BBQ) spin-s models are the potential candidates to achieve the maximal entanglement in equilibrium. By eliminating the equilibrium requirement, we show that a completely polarized state in the bulk and a suitable qudit state in the link can evolve over time to produce a highly entangled state, as per the BBQ Hamiltonian with nearest- and next-nearest neighbor interactions. When the number of sites in the bulk grows, so does the maximum entanglement produced in dynamics. Further, both the static and the dynamical protocols presented here remain efficient even if the spin quantum numbers of the bulk and the connection are unequal.</description>

      <title>The spin-one Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation revisited: analytical study of its structure and a careful choice of interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation is investigated for spin one bosons with the so-called natural (normal) and unnatural (abnormal) parity states for non-minimal vector interactions. To illustrate the current state of knowledge about the equation, a thorough but concise discussion is made on what can be achieved analytically within this framework for well-known phenomenological interactions, including Coulomb, soft-core, Cornell, Kratzer, and exponential type interactions. In the non-exponential cases, the equation, depending on the chosen interaction, is studied in relation to the confluent, doubly-confluent, and biconfluent Heun functions. Furthermore, to show the need for careful treatment of various parity states, a Kratzer-type potential, such as a generalized Coulomb interaction, is discussed in depth using the Lie algebraic approach, showing the need for careful analysis of abnormal parity states in a fairly explicit way. The energies obtained are discussed using some figures to explicitly show the different regimes, as well as the absence of the Klein paradox. Finally, some directions for future work that would undoubtedly need to be explored in this field are discussed.</description>

      <title>Deceleration of electrons by an oscillating field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum corrections to electron dynamics under an oscillating electromagnetic field are found within the Floquet theory of periodically driven quantum systems. It is demonstrated that emission of photons by an electron oscillating under the field is asymmetric with respect to the direction of its forward movement. Since emission of each photon is accompanied by momentum transfer to the electron, such a skew emission leads to the quantum recoil force decelerating the electron. Possible manifestations of this phenomenon are discussed for various electronic systems driven by laser irradiation.</description>

      <title>Randomized Benchmarking Protocol for Dynamic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic circuit operations -- measurements with feedforward -- are important components for future quantum computing efforts, but lag behind gates in the availability of characterization methods. Here we introduce a series of dynamic circuit benchmarking routines based on interleaving dynamic circuit operation blocks $F$ in one-qubit randomized benchmarking sequences of data qubits. $F$ spans between the set of data qubits and a measurement qubit and may include feedforward operations based on the measurement. We identify six candidate operation blocks, such as preparing the measured qubit in $|0\rangle$ and performing a $Z$-Pauli on the data qubit conditioned on a measurement of `1'. Importantly, these blocks provide a methodology to accumulate readout assignment errors in a long circuit sequence. We also show the importance of dynamic-decoupling in reducing ZZ crosstalk and measurement-induced phase errors during dynamic circuit blocks. When measured on an IBM Eagle device with appropriate dynamical decoupling, the results are consistent with measurement assignment error and the decoherence of the data qubit as the leading error sources.</description>

      <title>Vestigial Gapless Boson Density Wave Emerging between $\nu = 1/2$ Fractional Chern Insulator and Finite-Momentum Supersolid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The roton-triggered charge-density-wave (CDW)is widely studied in fractional quantum Hall (FQH) and fractional Chern insulator (FCI) systems, and there also exist field theoretical and numerical realizations of continuous transition from FCI to superfluid (SF). However, the theory and numerical explorations of the transition between FCI and supersolid (SS) are still lacking. In this work, we study the topological flat-band lattice models with $\nu$ = 1/2 hard-core bosons, where the previous studies have discovered the existence of FCI states and possible direct FCI-SS transitions. While the FCI is robust, we find the direct FCI-SS transition is absent, and there exist more intriguing scenarios. In the case of checkerboard lattice, we find an intermediate gapless CDW state without SF, sandwiched between FCI and SS. This novel state is triggered by the roton instability in FCI and it further continuously brings about the intertwined finite-momentum SF fluctuation when the CDW order is strong enough, eventually transiting into an unconventional finite-momentum SS state. The intermediate gapless CDW state is a vestige from the SS state, since the increasing quantum fluctuation melts only the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-type SF order in SS but its (secondary) product -- the CDW order -- survives. On honeycomb lattice, we find no evidence of SS, but discover an interesting sequence of FCI-Solid I-Solid II transitions, with both solids incompressible. Moreover, in contrast to previous single-roton condensation, this sequence of FCI-Solid I-Solid II transitions is triggered by the softening of multi-roton modes in FCI. Considering the intertwined wave vectors of the CDW orders, Solid I is a vestige of Solid II. Our work provides new horizon not only for the quantum phase transitions in FCI but also for the intertwined orders and gapless states in bosonic systems, which will inspire future studies.</description>

      <title>Emergent Gauge Fields and the "Choi-Spin Liquids" in Steady States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the steady states of the evolution of a class of Lindbladians can be mapped to the "Gutzwiller projected" wave functions in the doubled Hilbert space, i.e. the representation of the density matrix through the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. A Gutzwiller projection is expected to introduce emergent dynamical gauge fields to the system, hence if one starts with a gapless free fermion pure quantum state, the steady state of the Lindbladian evolution in the doubled Hilbert space is an analog of an algebraic spin liquid, which is dubbed the "Choi-spin liquid". The Choi-spin liquid can also be produced through strong measurement without post-selection. Predictions of the Choi-spin liquids can be made based on the understanding from the studies on spin liquids, and we will design the experimental protocol to test these predictions. We also demonstrate that if one starts with a Chern insulator, the steady state of the Lindbladian evolution is expected to have a spontaneous "strong-to-weak" U(1) symmetry breaking, which corresponds to a superconductor in the doubled Hilbert space.</description>

Abstract: The realization of electron-spin resonance at the single-atom level using scanning tunneling microscopy has opened new avenues for coherent quantum sensing and quantum state manipulation at the ultimate size limit. This allows to build many-body Hamiltonians and the study of their complex physical behavior. Recently, a novel qubit platform has emerged from this field, raising questions about the driving mechanism from single-atom magnets. In this work, we demonstrate how single-atom magnets can be used to drive a nearby single spin qubit efficiently, while also addressing critical aspects related to the optimization of experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Evidence of P-wave Pairing in K2Cr3As3 Superconductors from Phase-sensitive Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: P-wave superconductors hold immense promise for both fundamental physics and practical applications due to their unusual pairing symmetry and potential topological superconductivity. However, the exploration of the p-wave superconductors has proved to be a complex endeavor. Not only are they rare in nature but also the identification of p-wave superconductors has been an arduous task in history. For example, phase-sensitive measurement, an experimental technique which can provide conclusive evidence for unconventional pairing, has not been implemented successfully to identify p-wave superconductors. Here, we study a recently discovered family of superconductors, A2Cr3As3 (A = K, Rb, Cs), which were proposed theoretically to be a candidate of p-wave superconductors. We fabricate superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) on exfoliated K2Cr3As3, and perform the phase-sensitive measurement. We observe that such SQUIDs exhibit a pronounced second-order harmonic component sin(2{\phi}) in the current-phase relation, suggesting the admixture of 0- and {\pi}-phase. By carefully examining the magnetic field dependence of the oscillation patterns of critical current and Shapiro steps under microwave irradiation, we reveal a crossover from 0- to {\pi}-dominating phase state and conclude that the existence of the {\pi}-phase is in favor of the p-wave pairing symmetry in K2Cr3As3.</description>

      <title>Insights on molecular P implantation for scalable spin-qubit arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information technologies hold immense promise, with quantum computers poised to revolutionize problem-solving capabilities. Among the leading contenders are solid-state spin-qubits, particularly those utilizing the spin of phosphorous donors (31 P ). While significant progress has been made in enhancing quantum coherence and qubit control, challenges persist, notably in achieving precise and scalable P placement in Si substrate. This paper investigates by means of molecular dynamics the use of molecular PF2 ions for implantation, aiming to reduce placement uncertainty while maintaining detection efficiency. We examine energy transfer, molecule integrity, implantation profiles, electronic signal components, and stable damage. Among other things we find that the assumption that the molecule only breaks apart immediately due to the presence of an a-SiO2 layer on the surface of the crystal and that the intensity of the electronic signal from ion-solid interactions does not correlate necessarily with the penetration depth of P.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic data for four metastable state clear-out transitions between 399 nm and 412 nm for all even long-lived isotopes of Yb$^+$ as well as their hyperfine structure in $^{171}$Yb$^+$. The strong $^2 \rm{D}_{3/2} \rightarrow {}^1[1/2]_{1/2}$ transition at 412 nm represents an attractive alternative for the standard 935 nm repumper used in cooling and trapping experiments, while the transition to the $^3[3/2]_{3/2}$ state at 411 nm clears out the $^2 $F$_{7/2}$ state, for which typically 638 nm or 760 nm are used. These two alternative transitions simplify the experimental setup by removing the need for infrared optics to cool and manipulate Yb$^+$ and may be of particular interest when considering integrated photonics solutions. We also present data for the transitions $^2 $D$_{3/2} \rightarrow {}^3[1/2]_{3/2}$ at 399 nm, and $^2 $D$_{3/2} \rightarrow {}^1[5/2]_{5/2}$ at 410 nm including decay branching ratios of the excited states.</description>

Abstract: Formal languages are essential for computer programming and are constructed to be easily processed by computers. In contrast, natural languages are much more challenging and instigated the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). One major obstacle is the ubiquity of ambiguities. Recent advances in NLP have led to the development of large language models, which can resolve ambiguities with high accuracy. At the same time, quantum computers have gained much attention in recent years as they can solve some computational problems faster than classical computers. This new computing paradigm has reached the fields of machine learning and NLP, where hybrid classical-quantum learning algorithms have emerged. However, more research is needed to identify which NLP tasks could benefit from a genuine quantum advantage. In this thesis, we applied formalisms arising from foundational quantum mechanics, such as contextuality and causality, to study ambiguities arising from linguistics. By doing so, we also reproduced psycholinguistic results relating to the human disambiguation process. These results were subsequently used to predict human behaviour and outperformed current NLP methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel anomaly detection framework that combines the robust statistical principles of density-estimation-based anomaly detection methods with the representation-learning capabilities of deep learning models. The method originated from this framework is presented in two different versions: a shallow approach employing a density-estimation model based on adaptive Fourier features and density matrices, and a deep approach that integrates an autoencoder to learn a low-dimensional representation of the data. By estimating the density of new samples, both methods are able to find normality scores. The methods can be seamlessly integrated into an end-to-end architecture and optimized using gradient-based optimization techniques. To evaluate their performance, extensive experiments were conducted on various benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that both versions of the method can achieve comparable or superior performance when compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Notably, the shallow approach performs better on datasets with fewer dimensions, while the autoencoder-based approach shows improved performance on datasets with higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Influence of disordered and anisotropic interactions on relaxation dynamics and propagation of correlations in tweezer arrays of Rydberg dipoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of irregular one- and two-dimensional arrays of Rydberg dipoles featuring spatially anisotropic interactions. Starting from a collectively polarized initial state, we map out the dynamical phase diagram and identify a crossover between regimes of regular and anomalously slow relaxation of the initial collective order, that strongly depends on both the degree of interaction disorder and anisotropy. In addition, we find the regime of slow relaxation is characterized by a sub-ballistic propagation of correlations that remained confined to short distances even at long times. To explain our findings we develop an analytic model based on decoupled clusters of interacting dipoles that goes beyond prior theoretical works and enables us to identify multiple relaxation timescales. Our findings can be relevant for a wide variety of quantum science platforms naturally featuring disordered dipolar interactions, including polar molecules, frozen Rydberg gases and NV centers.</description>

      <title>Rapid stochastic spatial light modulator calibration and pixel crosstalk optimisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic light potentials generated by phase-modulating liquid-crystal spatial light modulators (SLMs) are widely used in quantum technology applications. Accurate calibration of the wavefront and intensity profile of the laser beam at the SLM display is key to the high fidelity of holographic potentials. Here, we present a new calibration technique that is faster than previous methods while maintaining the same level of accuracy. By employing stochastic optimisation and random speckle intensity patterns, we calibrate a digital twin that accurately models the experimental setup. This approach allows us to measure the wavefront at the SLM to within $\lambda /170$ in ~ 5 minutes using only 10 SLM phase patterns, a significant speedup over state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, our digital twin models pixel crosstalk on the liquid-crystal SLM, enabling rapid calibration of model parameters and reducing the error in light potentials by a factor of ~ 5 without losing efficiency. Our fast calibration technique will simplify the implementation of high-fidelity light potentials in, for example, quantum-gas microscopes and neutral-atom tweezer arrays where high-NA objectives and thermal lensing can deform the wavefront significantly. Applications in the field of holographic displays that require high image fidelity will benefit from the novel pixel crosstalk calibration, especially for displays with a large field of view and increased SLM diffraction angles.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantages in (n,d)-&gt;1 Random Access Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:1510.03045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A random access code (RAC), corresponding to a communication primitive with various applications in quantum information theory, is an instance of a preparation-and-measurement scenario. In this work, we consider (n,d)-RACs constituting an "n"-length string, constructed from a "d" size set of letters, and send an encoding of the string in a single d-level physical system and present their quantum advantages. We first characterize optimal classical RACs, proving that the well-known classical strategy known as majority-encoding-identity-decoding is indeed optimal. We then construct a quantum protocol by exploiting only two incompatible measurements, the minimal requirement, and show the advantages beyond the classical one. We also discuss the generality of our results and whether quantum advantages are valid for all types of (n, d)-&gt;1 RACs.</description>

      <title>Restrictions on realizable unitary operations imposed by symmetry and locality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.05524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to a fundamental result in quantum computing, any unitary transformation on a composite system can be generated using so-called 2-local unitaries that act only on two subsystems. Beyond its importance in quantum computing, this result can also be regarded as a statement about the dynamics of systems with local Hamiltonians: although locality puts various constraints on the short-term dynamics, it does not restrict the possible unitary evolutions that a composite system with a general local Hamiltonian can experience after a sufficiently long time. Here we show that this universality does not remain valid in the presence of conservation laws and global continuous symmetries such as U(1) and SU(2). In particular, we show that generic symmetric unitaries cannot be implemented, even approximately, using local symmetric unitaries. Based on this no-go theorem, we propose a method for experimentally probing the locality of interactions in nature. In the context of quantum thermodynamics, our results mean that generic energy-conserving unitary transformations on a composite system cannot be realized solely by combining local energy-conserving unitaries on the components. We show how this can be circumvented via catalysis.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Secure Direct Communication (QSDC) is an important branch of quantum cryptography, which enables the secure transmission of messages without prior key encryption. However, traditional quantum communication protocols rely on the security and trustworthiness of the devices employed to implement the protocols, which can be susceptible to attacks. Device-independent (DI) quantum protocols, on the other hand, aim to secure quantum communication independent of the devices used by leveraging fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. In this research paper, we introduce the first DI-QSDC protocol that includes user identity authentication to establish the authenticity of both sender and receiver before message exchange. We also extend this approach to a DI Quantum Dialogue (QD) protocol where both parties can send secret messages upon mutual authentication.</description>

      <title>Recovering complete positivity of non-Markovian quantum dynamics with Choi-proximity regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A relevant problem in the theory of open quantum systems is the lack of complete positivity of dynamical maps obtained after weak-coupling approximations, a famous example being the Redfield master equation. A number of approaches exist to recover well-defined evolutions under additional Markovian assumptions, but much less is known beyond this regime. Here we propose a numerical method to cure the complete-positivity violation issue while preserving the non-Markovian features of an arbitrary original dynamical map. The idea is to replace its unphysical Choi operator with its closest physical one, mimicking recent work on quantum process tomography. We also show that the regularized dynamics is more accurate in terms of reproducing the exact dynamics: this allows to heuristically push the utilization of these master equations in moderate coupling regimes, where the loss of positivity can have relevant impact.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Temporal Fragility in the XY Surface Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important outstanding challenge that must be overcome in order to fully utilize the XY surface code for correcting biased Pauli noise is the phenomena of fragile temporal boundaries that arise during the standard logical state preparation and measurement protocols. To address this challenge we propose a new logical state preparation protocol based on locally entangling qubits into small Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like states prior to making the stabilizer measurements that place them in the XY-code state. We prove that in this new procedure $O(\sqrt{n})$ high-rate errors along a single lattice boundary can cause a logical failure, leading to an almost quadratic reduction in the number of fault-configurations compared to the standard state-preparation approach. Moreover, the code becomes equivalent to a repetition code for high-rate errors, guaranteeing a 50% code-capacity threshold during state preparation for infinitely biased noise. With a simple matching decoder we confirm that our preparation protocol outperforms the standard one in terms of both threshold and logical error rate in the fault-tolerant regime where measurements are unreliable and at experimentally realistic biases. We also discuss how our state-preparation protocol can be inverted for similar fragile-boundary-mitigated logical-state measurement.</description>

      <title>Unleashed from Constrained Optimization: Quantum Computing for Quantum Chemistry Employing Generator Coordinate Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical approaches offer potential solutions to quantum chemistry problems, yet they also introduce challenges. These challenges include addressing the barren plateau and ensuring the accuracy of the ans\"{a}tze, which often manifest as constrained optimization problems. In this work, we explore the interconnection between constrained optimization and generalized eigenvalue problems through \textcolor{black}{the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) excitation generators. These generators often serve as building blocks constituting the ans\"{a}tze in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter VQE (ADAPT-VQE) simulations. Here, inspired by the generator coordinate method, we employ these UCC excitation generators to construct non-orthogonal, overcomplete many-body generating functions, projecting the system Hamiltonian into a practical working subspace. This approach results in a generalized eigenvalue problem that provides rigorous lower bounds to VQE/ADAPT-VQE energies, effectively bypassing issues related to barren plateaus and heuristic numerical minimizers typical in standard VQE methods. Diverging from conventional quantum subspace expansion methods, we introduce an adaptive scheme that robustly constructs many-body basis sets from a pool of the UCC excitation generators. This scheme supports the development of a hierarchical ADAPT quantum-classical strategy, enabling a balanced interplay between subspace expansion and ansatz optimization to address complex, strongly correlated quantum chemical systems efficiently and cost-effectively. The effective Hamiltonian generated by our approach also supports the computation of excited states and dynamic properties, setting the stage for more advanced quantum simulations in chemistry.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in ultrafast electron emission, microscopy, and diffraction have demonstrated a remarkable ability to manipulate free electrons with quantum coherence using light beams. Here, we present a framework for exploring free electron quantum number in ultrafast electron-light interactions. We derive an explicit Jackiw-Rebbi solution for a low-energy free electron wavefunction subjected to a spatiotemporally twisted laser field, resulting in a flying topologically protected bound state with a quantum number of e/2 - termed a "half-electron". This flying bound state is dispersion-free due to its topological nature. We demonstrate the topological confinement and pair generation mechanism of half-electrons in free space, expanding their domain beyond the topological states typically found in solids and photonics. This advancement enhances our understanding of emulating exotic quantum and topological effects with low-energy free electrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum states of angular momentum and spin generally are not invariant under rotations of the reference frame. Therefore, they can be used as a resource of relative orientation, which is encoded in the asymmetry of the state under consideration. In this paper we introduce the analytical characterization of the rotational information by parameterizing the group characteristic function by polynomial functions. By doing so, we show that the set of states achievable through transformations lacking a reference frame (rotationally covariant ones) admits an analytical characterization and can be studied through the use of semidefinite optimization techniques. We demonstrate the developed methods via examples, and provide a physical scenario in which a reference-independent operation performs a metrologically useful operation: the preparation of a state of light improving interferometer sensitivity, which equivalently can be realized as a postprocessing step.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality under imperfect teleportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement, measurement, and classical communication together enable teleportation of quantum states between distant parties, in principle with perfect fidelity. To what extent do correlations and entanglement of a many-body wavefunction transfer under imperfect teleportation protocols? We address this question for the case of an imperfectly teleported quantum critical wavefunction, focusing on the ground state of a critical Ising chain. We demonstrate that imperfections, e.g., in the entangling gate adopted for a given protocol, effectively manifest as weak measurements acting on the otherwise pristinely teleported critical state. Armed with this perspective, we leverage and further develop the theory of measurement-altered quantum criticality to quantify the resilience of critical-state teleportation. We identify classes of teleportation protocols for which imperfection $(i)$ preserves both the universal long-range entanglement and correlations of the original quantum critical state, $(ii)$ weakly modifies these quantities away from their universal values, and $(iii)$ obliterates long-range entanglement altogether while preserving power-law correlations, albeit with a new set of exponents. We also show that mixed states describing the average over a series of sequential imperfect teleportation events retain pristine power-law correlations due to a `built-in' decoding algorithm, though their entanglement structure measured by the negativity depends on errors similarly to individual protocol runs. These results may allow one to design teleportation protocols that optimize against errors -- highlighting a potential practical application of measurement-altered criticality.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum Computing and Differential Privacy: Insights into Quantum Computing Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While quantum computing has strong potential in data-driven fields, the privacy issue of sensitive or valuable information involved in the quantum algorithm should be considered. Differential privacy (DP), which is a fundamental privacy tool widely used in the classical scenario, has been extended to the quantum domain, i.e., quantum differential privacy (QDP). QDP may become one of the most promising approaches toward privacy-preserving quantum computing since it is not only compatible with classical DP mechanisms but also achieves privacy protection by exploiting unavoidable quantum noise in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This paper provides an overview of the various implementations of QDP and their performance in terms of privacy parameters under the DP setting. Specifically, we propose a taxonomy of QDP techniques, categorizing the literature on whether internal or external randomization is used as a source to achieve QDP and how these implementations are applied to each phase of the quantum algorithm. We also discuss challenges and future directions for QDP. By summarizing recent advancements, we hope to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date review for researchers venturing into this field.</description>

Abstract: The behavior of quantum states at exceptional points and critical points in quantum phase transitions is intriguing yet puzzling. In this study, we demonstrate, without applying the adiabatic approximation, that the information carried by quantum states evolving across these critical points is not destroyed. Instead, the quantum states remain unaffected by the critical points, much like an object passing through a black hole's event horizon. Further similarities between exceptional points, quantum phase transitions, and black hole event horizons are explored in this work.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian simulation for low-energy states with optimal time dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of simulating time evolution under a Hamiltonian $H$ within its low-energy subspace. Assuming access to a block-encoding of $H'=(H-E)/\lambda$ for some $E \in \mathbb R$, the goal is to implement an $\epsilon$-approximation to $e^{-itH}$ when the initial state is confined to the subspace corresponding to eigenvalues $[-1, -1+\Delta/\lambda]$ of $H'$. We present a quantum algorithm that uses $O(t\sqrt{\lambda\Gamma} + \sqrt{\lambda/\Gamma}\log(1/\epsilon))$ queries to the block-encoding for any $\Gamma$ such that $\Delta \leq \Gamma \leq \lambda$. When $\log(1/\epsilon) = o(t\lambda)$ and $\Delta/\lambda = o(1)$, this result improves over generic methods with query complexity $\Omega(t\lambda)$. Our quantum algorithm leverages spectral gap amplification and the quantum singular value transform. Using standard access models for $H$, we show that the ability to efficiently block-encode $H'$ is equivalent to $H$ being what we refer to as a "gap-amplifiable" Hamiltonian. This includes physically relevant examples such as frustration-free systems, and it encompasses all previously considered settings of low-energy simulation algorithms. We also provide lower bounds for low-energy simulation. In the worst case, we show that the low-energy condition cannot be used to improve the runtime of Hamiltonian simulation. For gap-amplifiable Hamiltonians, we prove that our algorithm is tight in the query model with respect to $t$, $\Delta$, and $\lambda$. In the practically relevant regime where $\log (1/\epsilon) = o(t\Delta)$ and $\Delta/\lambda = o(1)$, we also prove a matching lower bound in gate complexity (up to log factors). To establish the query lower bounds, we consider $\mathrm{PARITY}\circ\mathrm{OR}$ and degree bounds on trigonometric polynomials. To establish the lower bound on gate complexity, we use a circuit-to-Hamiltonian reduction acting on a low-energy state.</description>

Abstract: Spectral loopholes in the 1000-2100 nm range have been the focus of attention of quantum hacking research aimed at searching and elimination of vulnerabilities in quantum key distribution systems. In this work, we concentrate on shorter wavelengths ranged from 400 nm up to 800 nm and experimentally study spectra of insertion losses for a number of fiber optical components to assess potentials for their implementation as countermeasures. We show that efficiency of the elements commonly used as countermeasures against hacking attacks in the telecom range can be significantly impaired in the visible range. It is found that the vulnerabilities detected in this range play an increasingly important role for hacking strategies such as the induced-photorefraction attack whose efficiency improves when the wavelength decreases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a modified version of the proof given Jing-Yang-Zhao's paper titled "Local Unitary Equivalence of Quantum States and Simultaneous Orthogonal Equivalence," which established the correspondance between local unitary equivalence and simultaneous orthogonal equivalence of $2$-qubits. Our modified proof utilizes a hypermatrix algebra framework, and through this framework we are able to generalize this correspondence to $3$-qubits. Finally, we apply a generalization of Specht's criterion (first proved in "Specht's Criterion for Systems of Linear Mappings" by V. Futorney, R. A. Horn, and V. V. Sergeichuk) to reduce the problem of local unitary equivalence of $3$-qubits to checking trace identities and a few other easy-to-check properties. We also note that all of these results can be extended to $2$ and $3$ qudits if we relax the notion of LU equivalence to quasi-LU equivalence, as defined in the aforementioned paper by Jing et. al.</description>

Abstract: In single-particle Madelung mechanics, the single-particle quantum state $\Psi(\vec{x},t) = R(\vec{x},t) e^{iS(\vec{x},t)/\hbar}$ is interpreted as comprising an entire conserved fluid of classical point particles, with local density $R(\vec{x},t)^2$ and local momentum $\vec{\nabla}S(\vec{x},t)$ (where $R$ and $S$ are real). The Schr\"{o}dinger equation gives rise to the continuity equation for the fluid, and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for particles of the fluid, which includes an additional density-dependent quantum potential energy term $Q(\vec{x},t) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\vec{\nabla}R(\vec{x},t)}{R(\vec{x},t)}$, which is all that makes the fluid behavior nonclassical. In particular, the quantum potential can become negative and create a nonclassical boost in the kinetic energy. This boost is related to superoscillations in the wavefunction, where the local frequency of $\Psi$ exceeds its global band limit. Berry showed that for states of definite energy $E$, the regions of superoscillation are exactly the regions where $Q(\vec{x},t)&lt;0$. For energy superposition states with band-limit $E_+$, the situation is slightly more complicated, and the bound is no longer $Q(\vec{x},t)&lt;0$. However, the fluid model provides a definite local energy for each fluid particle which allows us to define a local band limit for superoscillation, and with this definition, all regions of superoscillation are again regions where $Q(\vec{x},t)&lt;0$ for general superpositions. An alternative interpretation of these quantities involving a \textit{reduced quantum potential} is reviewed and advanced, and a parallel discussion of superoscillation in this picture is given. Detailed examples are given which illustrate the role of the quantum potential and superoscillations in a range of scenarios.</description>

Abstract: This study examines the holographic representation of the quantum theory of transmission lines, which play a crucial role in quantum computing and quantum information. Utilizing Yurke and Denker's quantum circuit network theory within the framework of continuous MERA (cMERA) in AdS space, we analyze the quantization and interactions of transmission lines. The metric is revealed to be described by the inductance of the quantum circuit, which is AdS-space in its 0-limit. These results provide new insights into handling and controlling complex phenomena in quantum circuits, potentially advancing the understanding of quantum computing and quantum communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All quantum harmonic oscillators possess an ontological variable, which implies that they may be interpreted in terms of classical logic. Since many quantum models are based on quantum harmonic oscillators, this observation may open pathways towards a better understanding of how to interpret quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We construct a relativistic quantum communication channel between two localized qubit systems, mediated by a relativistic quantum field, that can achieve the theoretical maximum for the quantum capacity in arbitrary curved spacetimes using the Unruh-DeWitt detector formalism. Using techniques from algebraic quantum field theory, we express the quantum capacity of the quantum communication channel purely in terms of the correlation functions of the field and the causal propagator for the wave equation. Consequently, the resulting quantum channel, and hence the quantum capacity, are by construction manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant, respect the causal structure of spacetime, and are independent of the details of the background geometry, topology, and the choice of Hilbert space (quasifree) representations of the field.</description>

      <title>Strongest nonlocal sets with minimum cardinality in multipartite systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum nonlocality based on state discrimination describes the global property of the set of orthogonal states and has a wide range of applications in quantum cryptographic protocols. Strongest nonlocality is the strongest form of quantum nonlocality recently presented in multipartite quantum systems: a set of orthogonal multipartite quantum states is strongest nonlocal if the only orthogonality-preserving local measurements on the subsystems in every bipartition are trivial. In this work, we found a construction of strongest nonlocal sets in $\mathbb{C}^{d_{1}}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d_{2}}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d_{3}}$ $(2\leq d_{1}\leq d_{2}\leq d_{3})$ of size $d_2d_3+1$ without stopper states. Then we obtain the strongest nonlocal sets in four-partite systems with $d^3+1$ orthogonal states in $\mathbb{C}^d\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}$ $(d\geq2)$ and $d_{2}d_{3}d_{4}+1$ orthogonal states in $\mathbb{C}^{d_{1}}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d_{2}}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d_{3}}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d_{4}}$ $(2\leq d_{1}\leq d_{2}\leq d_{3}\leq d_{4})$. Surprisingly, the number of the elements in all above constructions perfectly reaches the recent conjectured lower bound and reduces the size of the strongest nonlocal set in $\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}$ of [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.108.062407}{Phys. Rev. A \textbf{108}, 062407 (2023)}] by $d-2$. In particular, the general optimal construction of the strongest nonlocal set in four-partite system is completely solved for the first time, which further highlights the theory of quantum nonlocality from the perspective of state discrimination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a novel quantum system characterization and error mitigation framework that applies Pauli check sandwiching (PCS). We motivate our work with prior art in software optimizations for quantum programs like noise-adaptive mapping and multi-programming, and we introduce the concept of PCS while emphasizing design considerations for its practical use. We show that by carefully embedding Pauli checks within a target application (i.e. a quantum circuit), we can learn quantum system noise profiles. Further, PCS combined with multi-programming unlocks non-trivial fidelity improvements in quantum program outcomes.</description>

      <title>Out of the Loop: Structural Approximation of Optimisation Landscapes and non-Iterative Quantum Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (qaoa) is a widely studied quantum-classical iterative heuristic for combinatorial optimisation. While qaoa targets problems in complexity class NP, the classical optimisation procedure required in every iteration is itself known to be NP-hard. Still, advantage over classical approaches is suspected for certain scenarios, but nature and origin of its computational power are not yet satisfactorily understood. By introducing means of efficiently and accurately approximating the qaoa optimisation landscape from solution space structures, we derive a new algorithmic variant: Instead of performing an iterative quantum-classical computation for each input instance, our non-iterative method is based on a quantum circuit that is instance-independent, but problem-specific. It matches or outperforms unit-depth qaoa for key combinatorial problems, despite reduced computational effort. Our approach is based on proving a long-standing conjecture regarding instance-independent structures in qaoa. By ensuring generality, we link existing empirical observations on qaoa parameter clustering to established approaches in theoretical computer science, and provide a sound foundation for understanding the link between structural properties of solution spaces and quantum optimisation.</description>

      <title>Quantum obesity and steering ellipsoids for fermionic fields in Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger dilation spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates quantum obesity (QO), quantum discord (QD), and the quantum steering ellipsoid (QSE) for bipartite Gisin states subjected to Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilation of spacetime on the second qubit. These three quantifiers are introduced to characterize quantum correlations beyond entanglement and can also function as entanglement witnesses. Our results demonstrate a monotonic decrease in the physical accessibility of both QD and QO as the dilation parameter increases within the region-I of the second qubit. Conversely, in the anti-particle region, the accessibility of QD and QO stabilizes at finite values of the dilation parameter owing to the influence of the Pauli exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac statistics, subsequently increasing gradually. Notably, the QSE in the region-I expands as the Dirac field frequency rises and the dilation parameter diminishes, while the opposite trend is observed in the anti-particle region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.09428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks (TN) have found a wide use in machine learning, and in particular, TN and deep learning bear striking similarities. In this work, we propose the quantum-classical hybrid tensor networks (HTN) which combine tensor networks with classical neural networks in a uniform deep learning framework to overcome the limitations of regular tensor networks in machine learning. We first analyze the limitations of regular tensor networks in the applications of machine learning involving the representation power and architecture scalability. We conclude that in fact the regular tensor networks are not competent to be the basic building blocks of deep learning. Then, we discuss the performance of HTN which overcome all the deficiency of regular tensor networks for machine learning. In this sense, we are able to train HTN in the deep learning way which is the standard combination of algorithms such as Back Propagation and Stochastic Gradient Descent. We finally provide two applicable cases to show the potential applications of HTN, including quantum states classification and quantum-classical autoencoder. These cases also demonstrate the great potentiality to design various HTN in deep learning way.</description>

      <title>Constructing Berry-Maxwell equations with Lorentz invariance and Gauss' law of Weyl monopoles in 4D energy-momentum space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the construction of a reciprocal electromagnetic field by extending the Berry curvatures into four-dimensional (4D) energy-momentum space. The resulting governing equations, termed Berry-Maxwell equations, are derived, by incorporating Lorentz invariance to constrain the parameter space of energy-momentum. Notably, these Berry-Maxwell equations exhibit dual and self-dual structures compared to the Maxwell equations. The very existence of Berry-Maxwell equations is independent of the geometrical phase of matter waves, implying that they cannot be directly derived from the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. Indeed, we find that the physical reality of this reciprocal electromagnetic field is rooted in the fundamental principles of special relativity and Gauss's law of Weyl monopoles. To validate our theory experimentally, we outline three effects for verification: (i) Lorentz boost of a Weyl monopole, (ii) reciprocal Thouless pumping, and (iii) plane-wave solutions of Berry-Maxwell's equations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlations and order in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In magic angle twisted bilayer graphene, transport, thermodynamic and spectroscopic experiments pinpoint at a competition between distinct low-energy states with and without electronic order. We use Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) on the topological heavy Fermion (THF) model of twisted bilayer graphene to investigate the emergence of electronic correlations and long-range order in the absence of strain. We contrast moment formation, Kondo screening and ordering on a temperature basis and explain the nature of emergent correlated states based on three central phenomena: (i) the formation of local spin and valley isospin moments around 100K, (ii) the ordering of the local isospin moments around 10K preempting Kondo screening, and (iii) a cascadic redistribution of charge between localized and delocalized electronic states upon doping. At integer fillings, we find that low energy spectral weight is depleted in the symmetric phase, while we find insulating states with gaps enhanced by exchange coupling in the zero-strain ordered phases. Doping away from integer filling results in distinct metallic states: a "bad metal" above the ordering temperature, where scattering off the disordered local moments suppresses electronic coherence, and a "good metal" in the ordered states with coherence of quasiparticles facilitated by isospin order. This finding reveals coherence from order as the microscopic mechanism behind the Pomeranchuk effect observed experimentally. Upon doping, there is a periodic charge reshuffling between localized and delocalized electronic orbitals leading to cascades of doping-induced Lifshitz transitions, local spectral weight redistributions and periodic variations of the electronic compressibility. Our findings provide a unified understanding of the most puzzling aspects of scanning tunneling spectroscopy, transport, and compressibility experiments.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Transverse Field Ising Model on the Kagome Lattice using a Programmable Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06698v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of competing interactions due to geometry leads to frustration in quantum spin models. As a consequence, the ground state of such systems often displays a large degeneracy that can be lifted due to thermal or quantum effects. One such example is the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the Kagome lattice. It was shown that while the same model on the triangular lattice is ordered at zero temperature for small transverse field due to an order by disorder mechanism, the Kagome lattice resists any such effects and exhibits only short range spin correlations and a trivial paramagnetic phase. We embed this model on the latest architecture of D-Wave's quantum annealer, the Advantage2 prototype, which uses the highly connected Zephyr graph. Using advanced embedding and calibration techniques, we are able to embed a Kagome lattice with mixed open and periodic boundary conditions of 231 sites on the full graph of the currently available prototype. Through forward annealing experiments, we show that under a finite longitudinal field the system exhibits a one-third magnetization plateau, consistent with a classical spin liquid state of reduced entropy. An anneal-pause-quench protocol is then used to extract an experimental ensemble of states resulting from the equilibration of the model at finite transverse and longitudinal field. This allows us to construct a partial phase diagram and confirm that the system exits the constrained Hilbert space of the classical spin liquid when subjected to a transverse field. We connect our results to previous theoretical results and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, which helps us confirm the validity of the quantum simulation realized here, thereby extracting insight into the performance of the D-Wave quantum annealer to simulate non-trivial quantum systems in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Many-body quantum interference route to the two-channel Kondo effect: Inverse design for molecular junctions and quantum dot devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular junctions -- whether actual single molecules in nanowire break junctions or artificial molecules realized in coupled quantum dot devices -- offer unique functionality due to their orbital complexity, strong electron interactions, gate control, and many-body effects from hybridization with the external electronic circuit. Inverse design involves finding candidate structures that perform a desired function optimally. Here we develop an inverse design strategy for generalized quantum impurity models describing molecular junctions, and as an example, use it to demonstrate that many-body quantum interference can be leveraged to realize the two-channel Kondo critical point in simple 4- or 5-site molecular moieties. We show that remarkably high Kondo temperatures can be achieved, meaning that entropy and transport signatures should be experimentally accessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03353v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems displaying quantum topological order feature robust characteristics that are very attractive to quantum computing schemes. Topological quantum field theories have proven to be powerful in capturing the quintessential attributes of systems displaying topological order including, in particular, their anyon excitations. Here, we investigate systems that lie outside this common purview, and present a rich class of models exhibiting topological orders with distance-dependent interactions between anyons. As we illustrate, in some instances, the gapped lowest-energy excitations are comprised of anyons that densely cover the entire system. This leads to behaviors not typically described by topological quantum field theories. We examine these models by performing exact dualities to systems displaying conventional (i.e., Landau) orders. Our approach enables a general method for mapping generic Landau-type theories to dual models with topological order of the same spatial dimension. The low-energy subspaces of our models can be made more resilient to thermal effects than those of surface codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is the leading conjecture for the emergence of statistical mechanics in generic isolated quantum systems and is formulated in terms of the matrix elements of operators. An analog known as the ergodic bipartition (EB) describes entanglement and locality and is formulated in terms of the components of eigenstates. In this paper, we significantly generalize the EB and unify it with the ETH, extending the EB to study higher correlations and systems out of equilibrium. Our main result is a diagrammatic formalism that computes arbitrary correlations between eigenstates and operators based on a recently uncovered connection between the ETH and free probability theory. We refer to the connected components of our diagrams as generalized free cumulants. We apply our formalism in several ways. First, we focus on chaotic eigenstates and establish the so-called subsystem ETH and the Page curve as consequences of our construction. We also improve known calculations for thermal reduced density matrices and comment on an inherently free probabilistic aspect of the replica approach to entanglement entropy previously noticed in a calculation for the Page curve of an evaporating black hole. Next, we turn to chaotic quantum dynamics and demonstrate the ETH as a sufficient mechanism for thermalization, in general. In particular, we show that reduced density matrices relax to their equilibrium form and that systems obey the Page curve at late times. We also demonstrate that the different phases of entanglement growth are encoded in higher correlations of the EB. Lastly, we examine the chaotic structure of eigenstates and operators together and reveal previously overlooked correlations between them. Crucially, these correlations encode butterfly velocities, a well-known dynamical property of interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While there have been many developments in computational probes of both strongly-correlated molecular systems and machine-learning accelerated molecular dynamics, there remains a significant gap in capabilities in simulating accurate non-local electronic structure over timescales on which atoms move. We develop an approach to bridge these fields with a practical interpolation scheme for the correlated many-electron state through the space of atomic configurations, whilst avoiding the exponential complexity of these underlying electronic states. With a small number of accurate correlated wave functions as a training set, we demonstrate provable convergence to near-exact potential energy surfaces for subsequent dynamics with propagation of a valid many-body wave function and inference of its variational energy whilst retaining a mean-field computational scaling. This represents a profoundly different paradigm to the direct interpolation of potential energy surfaces in established machine-learning approaches. We combine this with modern electronic structure approaches to systematically resolve molecular dynamics trajectories and converge thermodynamic quantities with a high-throughput of several million interpolated wave functions with explicit validation of their accuracy from only a few numerically exact quantum chemical calculations. We also highlight the comparison to traditional machine-learned potentials or dynamics on mean-field surfaces.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of 3 V Programmable Josephson Junction Arrays Using Non-Integer-Multiple Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article demonstrates a new kind of programmable logic for the representation of an integer that can be used for the programmable Josephson voltage standard. It can enable the numbers of junctions in most bits to be variable integer values, which is different from normal binary logic or ternary logic. Consequently, missing junctions due to superconducting short circuits can be tolerated under this logic. This logic can also have nearly the same segmentation efficiency as ternary logic. The completeness of the sequences using this logic is proven by the recursive method in mathematics in this paper. After that, a new algorithm for the representation of integers is presented according to the proven process, and an analysis of the number of fault-tolerant junctions for each bit is provided. Although the first and second bits are not tolerant to missing junctions, bits beyond these can tolerate one to hundreds of missing junctions. Due to the non-fixed multiples between the bits of the sequence, this logic is called non-integer-multiple logic. Finally, the design and fabrication of a 3 V programmable Josephson junction array using this logic are described, and the measurements and analysis of the characteristic parameters are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensemble inequivalence, i.e. the possibility of observing different thermodynamic properties depending on the statistical ensemble which describes the system, is one of the hallmarks of long-range physics, which has been demonstrated in numerous classical systems. Here, an example of ensemble inequivalence of a long-range quantum ferromagnet is presented. While the $T=0$ microcanonical quantum phase-diagram coincides with that of the canonical ensemble, the phase-diagrams of the two ensembles are different at finite temperature. This is in contrast with the common lore of statistical mechanics of systems with short-range interactions where thermodynamic properties are bound to coincide for macroscopic systems described by different ensembles. The consequences of these findings in the context of atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) setups are delineated.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</title>

Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action having two contributions. The first contribution is proportional to the logarithm of the volume associated to the higher-order network by the metric. In the vacuum this contribution determines the entropy of the geometry. The second contribution is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>

      <title>Bipartite reweight-annealing algorithm to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative in high precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. We avoid directly computing the overlap of two partition functions within different spacetime manifolds and instead obtain them separately via reweight-annealing scheme. The incremental process can be designed along the path of real physical parameters in this frame, and all intermediates are EEs of corresponding parameters, so the algorithm efficiency is improved by more than $10^4$ of times. The calculation of EE becomes much cheaper and simpler. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purification maps a mixed state to a pure state and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We link the operator complexity of the density matrix to the state/operator complexity of purified states using three purification schemes: time-independent, time-dependent, and instantaneous purification. We propose inequalities among the operator and state complexities of mixed states and their purifications, demonstrated with a single qubit, two-qubit Werner states, and infinite-dimensional diagonal mixed states. We find that the complexity of a vacuum evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles created between left and right Rindler wedges. Finally, for the thermofield double state evolving from zero to finite temperature, we show that 1) the state complexity follows the Lloyd bound, reminiscent of the quantum speed limit, and 2) the Krylov state/operator complexities are subadditive in contrast to the holographic volume complexity.</description>
