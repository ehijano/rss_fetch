      <title>Hybrid AM/FM Mode-Locking of Singly-Resonant OPOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a new mode-locking regime in the singly-resonant OPO employing simultaneous amplitude- and frequency-modulation of the intracavity field. This OPO exhibits deterministic, "turn-key" formation of a stable, broadband, chirped frequency comb with high conversion efficiency. Comb-forming dynamics follow a simple phase-space dynamical model, governed by cavity dispersion and modulator chirp, which agrees closely with full numerical simulations. The comb exhibits fast, mode-hop-free tuning over the full gain window of the OPA crystal, controlled by the modulator frequency. Conditions for comb stability, and techniques to enhance comb bandwidth through intentional phase-mismatch and chirping, are investigated.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics of Wannier-Stark states in an active synthetic photonic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic emulators have facilitated the investigation of numerous solid-state phenomena and have contributed to the development of optical devices inspired by quantum mechanics. Although current photonic emulators are constrained to bosonic behavior with local interactions, the utilization of active synthetic lattices holds promise for surpassing these limitations. In this study, we propose employing the modulated ring fast-gain laser as a foundation for emulating quench dynamics within a synthetic lattice that conforms to equal density filling of its reciprocal space. To illustrate the effectiveness of this emulation platform, we subject a dispersed Wannier-Stark ladder to quenching and directly observe oscillations, enabled by the fast-gain, along with their coherent stabilization to a single Wannier stark state. These coherent dynamics stem directly from our lasers liquid state of light, a characteristic resulting from fast-gain and explained by the rapid decay of fluctuations occurring on the system's shortest timescale. Additionally, by adequately biasing the lattice through detuning the modulation from the cavity resonance, this process supports oscillatory dynamics within the synthetic space.</description>

      <title>Optical characterization of size- and substrate-dependent performance of ultraviolet hybrid plasmonic nanowire lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanowire-based plasmonic lasers are now established as nano-sources of coherent radiation, appearing as suitable candidates for integration into next-generation nanophotonic circuitry. However, compared to their photonic counterparts, their relatively high losses and large lasing thresholds still pose a burdening constraint on their scalability. In this study, the lasing characteristics of ZnO nanowires on Ag and Al substrates, operating as optically-pumped short-wavelength plasmonic nanolasers, are systematically investigated in combination with the size-dependent performance of the hybrid cavity. A hybrid nanomanipulation-assisted single nanowire optical characterization combined with high-throughput PL spectroscopy enables the correlation of the lasing characteristics to the metal substrate and the nanowire diameter. The results evidence that the coupling between excitons and surface plasmons is closely tied to the relationship between substrate dispersive behavior and nanowire diameter. Such coupling dictates the degree to which the lasing character, be it more plasmonic- or photonic-like, can define the stimulated emission features and, as a result, the device performance.</description>

      <title>Tunable Localisation in Parity-Time-Symmetric Resonator Arrays with Imaginary Gauge Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to illustrate both analytically and numerically the interplay of two fundamentally distinct non-Hermitian mechanisms in a deep subwavelength regime. Considering a parity-time symmetric system of one-dimensional subwavelength resonators equipped with two kinds of non-Hermiticity - an imaginary gauge potential and on-site gain and loss - we prove that all but two eigenmodes of the system decouple when going through an exceptional point. By tuning the gain-to-loss ratio, the system changes from a phase with unbroken parity-time symmetry to a phase with broken parity-time symmetry. At the macroscopic level, this is observed as a transition from symmetrical eigenmodes to condensated eigenmodes at one edge of the structure. Mathematically, it arises from a topological state change. The results of this paper open the door to the justification of a variety of phenomena arising from the interplay between non-Hermitian reciprocal and non-reciprocal mechanisms not only in subwavelength wave physics but also in quantum mechanics where the tight binding model coupled with the nearest neighbour approximation can be analysed with the same tools as those developed here.</description>

      <title>Kerr nonlinearity effect on the stability of Wannier-Stark states in active optical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper provides an analytical and numerical investigation of the dynamics of a one-dimensional chain of coupled optical resonators with conservative cubic nonlinearity and the gain saturated by nonlinear losses. The linear dependency of the resonator eigenfrequencies on their indexes makes it possible to use Wannier-Stark states as lasing modes. Numerical simulations have shown that the dependency of the resonant frequencies on the light intensity strongly affects the stability of Wannier-Stark states. To explain the observed destabilization of monochromatic lasing based on Wannier-Stark states a simple perturbation theory has been developed and compared with the data obtained in the numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying media offer a platform to realize novel and exotic wave effects, including photonic time crystals characterized by momentum band gaps with exponential wave amplification. Here we focus on the quantum electrodynamical properties of time-varying media, in particular vacuum amplification and squeezing. For that purpose, we present a theory of photon pair generation in photonic time crystals that unveils the link between the classical and quantum electrodynamical properties of these systems, that is, a direct relation between reflectivity and pair generation through the squeezing parameter. By working within an Hermitian framework, we are able to characterize quantum pair generation processes in photonic time crystals, showing how momentum bandgaps result in a non-resonant exponential enhancement of dynamical Casimir processes.</description>

      <title>Multimode amplitude squeezing through cascaded nonlinear optical processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimode squeezed light is enticing for several applications, from squeezed frequency combs for spectroscopy to signal multiplexing in optical computing. To generate squeezing in multiple frequency modes, optical parametric oscillators have been vital in realizing multimode squeezed vacuum states through second-order nonlinear processes. However, most work has focused on generating multimode squeezed vacua and squeezing in mode superpositions (supermodes). Bright squeezing in multiple discrete frequency modes, if realized, could unlock novel applications in quantum-enhanced spectroscopy and optical quantum computing. Here, we show how $Q$ factor engineering of a multimode nonlinear cavity with cascaded three wave mixing processes creates strong, spectrally tunable single mode output amplitude noise squeezing over 10 dB below the shot noise limit. In addition, we demonstrate squeezing for multiple discrete frequency modes above threshold. This bright squeezing arises from enhancement of the (noiseless) nonlinear rate relative to decay rates in the system due to the cascaded generation of photons in a single idler "bath" mode. A natural consequence of the strong nonlinear coupling in our system is the creation of an effective cavity in the synthetic frequency dimension that sustains Bloch oscillations in the modal energy distribution. Bloch mode engineering could provide an opportunity to better control nonlinear energy flow in the synthetic frequency dimension, with exciting applications in quantum random walks and topological photonics. Lastly, we show evidence of long-range correlations in amplitude noise between discrete frequency modes, pointing towards the potential of long-range entanglement in a synthetic frequency dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics has been at the forefront of the development of quantum science while laying the foundation for modern technology. With the growing capabilities of quantum control of many atoms for engineered many-body states and quantum entanglement, a key question emerges: what critical impact will the second quantum revolution with ubiquitous applications of entanglement bring to bear on fundamental physics?
  In this Essay, we argue that a compelling long-term vision for fundamental physics and novel applications is to harness the rapid development of quantum information science to define and advance the frontiers of measurement physics, with strong potential for fundamental discoveries.
  As quantum technologies, such as fault-tolerant quantum computing and entangled quantum sensor networks, become much more advanced than today's realization, we wonder what doors of basic science can these tools unlock? We anticipate that some of the most intriguing and challenging problems, such as quantum aspects of gravity, fundamental symmetries, or new physics beyond the minimal standard model, will be tackled at the emerging quantum measurement frontier.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of wavelength-sensitive magnons in unconventional compensated semiconducting antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnet is a promising candidate for the next generation spintronic devices, benefiting from its ultrafast dynamics and spontaneous zero stray field. However, the understanding of their ultrafast spin behaviors is lacking due to the challenges of controlling/detecting the quenched net magnetization. Unconventional compensated semiconducting antiferromagnets present strong time-reversal symmetry breaking, spin splitting in the momentum space, and suitable bandgap for optical control/detection. Thus, it is a powerful platform to uncover the ultrafast dynamics of antiferromagnets. Here, we show an exotic wavelength-dependent spin dynamic in the unconventional compensated semiconducting antiferromagnet {\alpha}-MnTe via time-resolved quadratic magneto-optical Kerr effect measurement, where the probing photon energy of the laser matches its bandgap. This direct excitation and detection of distinct magnon modes reveal varying spin behaviors and time characteristics in a broad temperature range. It originates from the spins triggered at different bands of electronic structures and is depicted in an energy transfer model among electrons, phonons, and magnons. Our study of exotic optical properties in this unconventional semiconducting antiferromagnet fulfills the missing information of spin evolution in the time domain and paves the way for its utilization in ultrafast spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Third Harmonic Enhancement Harnessing Photoexcitation Unveils New Nonlinearities in Zinc Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical phenomena are at the heart of various technological domains such as high-speed data transfer, optical logic applications, and emerging fields such as non-reciprocal optics and photonic time crystal design. However, conventional nonlinear materials exhibit inherent limitations in the post-fabrication tailoring of their nonlinear optical properties. Achieving real-time control over optical nonlinearities remains a challenge. In this work, we demonstrate a method to switch third harmonic generation (THG), a commonly occurring nonlinear optical response. Third harmonic generation enhancements up to 50 times are demonstrated in zinc oxide films via the photoexcited state generation and tunable electric field enhancement. More interestingly, the enhanced third harmonic generation follows a quadratic scaling with incident power, as opposed to the conventional cubic scaling, which demonstrates a previously unreported mechanism of third harmonic generation. The THG can also be suppressed by modulating the optical losses in the film. This work shows that the photoexcitation of states can not only enhance nonlinearities, but can create new processes for third harmonic generation. Importantly, the proposed method enables real-time manipulation of the nonlinear response of a medium. The process is switchable and reversible, with the modulations occurring at picosecond timescale. Our study paves the way to boost or suppress the nonlinearities of solid-state media, enabling robust, switchable sources for nonlinear optical applications.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems in Structured Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity quantum materials combine the rich many-body physics of condensed matter systems with strong coupling to the surrounding electromagnetic field, which presents both novel prospects and intricate challenges. One is often interested in the properties of one specific aspect of the material, e.g. the electronic many-body dynamics, subject to a structured bath of phononic and photonic modes. Open quantum systems featuring non-Markovian dynamics are routinely solved using techniques such as the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) but their usage of the system density-matrix renders them intractable for many-body systems. Here, we combine the HEOM with the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy to reach a consistent and rigorous description of open many-body systems and their quantum dynamics. We demonstrate first the strength and limitations of this stacked hierarchy for superradiant emission and spin-squeezing of established quantum optical models before presenting its full potential for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we explicitly simulate the impact of charge noise on the dynamic of the Fermi-Hubbard model subject to a structured bath comprising cavity and vibro-phononic environment. Strong optical coupling not only modifies the dynamic of the many-body system but serves furthermore as measurement channel providing information about the correlated motion imprinted by charge noise. Our work establishes an accessible, yet rigorous, route between condensed matter and quantum optics, fostering the growth of a new domain at their interface.</description>

      <title>Principal Component Analysis for Spatial Phase Reconstruction in Atom Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometers are sensitive to a wide range of forces by encoding their signals in interference patterns of matter waves. To estimate the magnitude of these forces, the underlying phase shifts they imprint on the atoms must be extracted. Up until now, extraction algorithms typically rely on a fixed model of the patterns' spatial structure, which if inaccurate can lead to systematic errors caused by, for example, wavefront aberrations of the used lasers. In this paper we employ an algorithm based on Principal Component Analysis, which is capable of characterizing the spatial phase structure and per image phase offsets of an atom interferometer from a set of images. The algorithm does so without any prior knowledge about the specific spatial pattern as long as this pattern is the same for all images in the set. On simulated images with atom projection noise we show the algorithm's reconstruction performance follows distinct scaling laws, i.e., it is inversely-proportional to the square-root of the number atoms or the number of images respectively, which allows a projection of its performance for experiments. We also successfully extract the spatial phase patterns of two experimental data sets from an atom gravimeter. This algorithm is a first step towards a better understanding and complex spatial phase patterns, e.g., caused by inhomogeneous laser fields in atom interferometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many biological and soft matter processes occur at high speeds in complex 3D environments, and developing imaging techniques capable of elucidating their dynamics is an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, we introduce Fourier Synthesis Optical Diffraction Tomography (FS-ODT), a novel approach for high-speed quantitative phase imaging capable of recording the 3D refractive index at kilohertz rates. FS-ODT introduces new pattern generation and inverse computational strategies that multiplex tens of illumination angles in a single tomogram, dramatically increasing the volumetric imaging rate. We validate FS-ODT performance by imaging samples of known composition and accurately recovering the refractive index for increasing pattern complexity. We further demonstrate the capabilities of FS-ODT for probing complex systems by studying the hindered diffusion of colloids in solution and the motility of single-cellular bacterial swimmers. We believe that FS-ODT is a promising approach for unlocking challenging imaging regimes in biophysics and soft matter that have been little explored, including understanding the physical interactions of colloids and microswimmers with their viscous 3D environment and the interplay between these stimuli and the molecular response of biological systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in metasurface lenses (metalenses) have shown great potential for opening a new era in compact imaging, photography, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) applications. However, the fundamental trade-off between broadband focusing efficiency and operating bandwidth limits the performance of broadband metalenses, resulting in chromatic aberration, angular aberration, and a relatively low efficiency. In this study, a deep-learning-based image restoration framework is proposed to overcome these limitations and realize end-to-end metalens imaging, thereby achieving aberration-free full-color imaging for mass-produced metalenses with 10-mm diameter. Neural-network-assisted metalens imaging achieved a high resolution comparable to that of the ground truth image.</description>

Abstract: Local propagation and energy flux in structured optical fields is often associated with the Poynting vector. However, the local phase gradient (i.e., local wavevector) in monochromatic fields in free space is described by another fundamental quantity: the canonical momentum density. The distributions of the Poynting and canonical momentum densities can differ significantly from each other in structured fields. We examine the role of these quantities in the propagation and diffraction of structured optical fields, exemplified by various circularly-polarized vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum. We describe the canonical and Poynting momentum distributions in such beams, experimentally measure the local transverse momentum density by Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, and investigate fine features of the diffraction of various vortex beams on a knife-edge aperture. In all cases, the measured local momentum density and local beam evolution are consistent with the canonical momentum distribution rather than the Poynting vector. Furthermore, we introduce the local angular velocity in vortex beams and determine the universal integral $\pi$ angle of azimuthal rotation in an arbitrary (yet circularly-symmetric) propagating and diffracting vortex beam. Finally, we discuss the "supermomentum" and "backflow" effects; both of these phenomena are examples of superoscillations and are related to the properties of the canonical momentum. Our results reveal the profound role of the canonical momentum in the evolution of light and demonstrate the importance of distinguishing between it and the Poynting vector in structured light.</description>

      <title>Resonant structure for improved directionality and extraction of single photons</title>

Abstract: Fluorescent atomic defects, especially in dielectric materials, such as diamond are quite promising for several emerging quantum applications. However, efficient light extraction, directional emission, and narrow spectral emission are key challenges. We have designed dielectric metasurface exploiting Mie-resonance and the Kerker condition to address these issues. Our designed diamond metasurface, tailored for nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect centers in diamond, predicts up to 500x improvement in the collection of 637 nm (zero phonon line) photons over that from the bare diamond. Our design achieves highly directional emission, predominantly emitting in a 20 degree lobe in the forward direction. This makes light collection more efficient, including for fiber-based collection. The predicted results are stable against the position of the emitter placed in the metaelement, thus alleviating the challenging fabrication requirement of precise positioning of the defect center. Equally importantly, our design approach can be applied to enhance single photon emission also from other defects such as SiV, other materials such as hBN, and other sources such as quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Nanocavity enhanced photon coherence of solid-state quantum emitters operating up to 30 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-state emitters such as epitaxial quantum dots have emerged as a leading platform for efficient, on-demand sources of indistinguishable photons, a key resource for many optical quantum technologies. To maximise performance, these sources normally operate at liquid helium temperatures ($\sim 4~\mathrm{K}$), introducing significant size, weight and power requirements that can be impractical for proposed applications. Here we experimentally resolve the two distinct temperature-dependent phonon interactions that degrade indistinguishability, allowing us to demonstrate that coupling to a photonic nanocavity can greatly improve photon coherence at elevated temperatures up to $30~\mathrm{K}$ that are compatible with compact cryocoolers. We derive a polaron model that fully captures the temperature-dependent influence of phonons observed in our experiments, providing predictive power to further increase the indistinguishability and operating temperature of future devices through optimised cavity parameters.</description>

      <title>Telling different unravelings apart via nonlinear quantum-trajectory averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation (ME) governs the density matrix of open quantum systems (OQSs). When an OQS is subjected to weak continuous measurement, its state evolves as a stochastic quantum trajectory, whose statistical average solves the ME. The ensemble of such trajectories is termed an unraveling of the ME. We propose a method to operationally distinguish unravelings produced by the same ME in different measurement scenarios, using nonlinear averages of observables over trajectories. We apply the method to the paradigmatic quantum nonlinear system of resonance fluorescence in a two-level atom. We compare the Poisson-type unraveling, induced by direct detection of photons scattered from the two-level emitter, and the Wiener-type unraveling, induced by phase-sensitive detection of the emitted field. We show that a quantum-trajectory-averaged variance is able to distinguish these measurement scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the method, which can be readily extended to more complex OQSs, under a range of realistic experimental conditions.</description>
