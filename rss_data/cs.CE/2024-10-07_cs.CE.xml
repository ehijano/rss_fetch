      <title>Transport-Embedded Neural Architecture: Redefining the Landscape of physics aware neural models in fluid mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a new neural model which follows the transport equation by design. A physical problem, the Taylor-Green vortex, defined on a bi-periodic domain, is used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of both the standard physics-informed neural network and our model (transport-embedded neural network). Results exhibit that while the standard physics-informed neural network fails to predict the solution accurately and merely returns the initial condition for the entire time span, our model successfully captures the temporal changes in the physics, particularly for high Reynolds numbers of the flow. Additionally, the ability of our model to prevent false minima can pave the way for addressing multiphysics problems, which are more prone to false minima, and help them accurately predict complex physics.</description>

      <title>Beyond Language: Applying MLX Transformers to Engineering Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer Neural Networks are driving an explosion of activity and discovery in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs). In contrast, there have been only a few attempts to apply Transformers in engineering physics. Aiming to offer an easy entry point to physics-centric Transformers, we introduce a physics-informed Transformer model for solving the heat conduction problem in a 2D plate with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The model is implemented in the machine learning framework MLX and leverages the unified memory of Apple M-series processors. The use of MLX means that the models can be trained and perform predictions efficiently on personal machines with only modest memory requirements. To train, validate and test the Transformer model we solve the 2D heat conduction problem using central finite differences. Each finite difference solution in these sets is initialized with four random Dirichlet boundary conditions, a uniform but random internal temperature distribution and a randomly selected thermal diffusivity. Validation is performed in-line during training to monitor against over-fitting. The excellent performance of the trained model is demonstrated by predicting the evolution of the temperature field to steady state for the unseen test set of conditions.</description>

      <title>Foil Conductor Model for Efficient Simulation of HTS Coils in Large Scale Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogenization techniques are an appealing approach to reduce computational complexity in systems containing coils with large numbers of high temperature superconductor (HTS) tapes. Resolving all the coated conductor layers and turns in coils is often computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we extend the foil conductor model, well-known in normal conducting applications, to applications with insulated HTS coils. To enhance the numerical performance of the model, the conventional formulation based on A-V is extended to J-A-V. The model is verified to be suitable for simulations of superconductors and to accelerate the calculations compared to resolving all the individual layers. The performance of both the A-V and J-A-V formulated models is examined, and the J-A-V variant is concluded to be advantageous.</description>

      <title>Discovering Message Passing Hierarchies for Mesh-Based Physics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for large-scale mesh-based physics simulation. Existing approaches primarily employ hierarchical, multi-scale message passing to capture long-range dependencies within the graph. However, these graph hierarchies are typically fixed and manually designed, which do not adapt to the evolving dynamics present in complex physical systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel neural network named DHMP, which learns Dynamic Hierarchies for Message Passing networks through a differentiable node selection method. The key component is the anisotropic message passing mechanism, which operates at both intra-level and inter-level interactions. Unlike existing methods, it first supports directionally non-uniform aggregation of dynamic features between adjacent nodes within each graph hierarchy. Second, it determines node selection probabilities for the next hierarchy according to different physical contexts, thereby creating more flexible message shortcuts for learning remote node relations. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DHMP, achieving 22.7% improvement on average compared to recent fixed-hierarchy message passing networks across five classic physics simulation datasets.</description>

      <title>On Long-Term Species Coexistence in Five-Species Evolutionary Spatial Cyclic Games with Ablated and Non-Ablated Dominance Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present a replication and, to some extent, a refutation of key results published by Zhong, Zhang, Li, Dai, &amp; Yang in their 2022 paper "Species coexistence in spatial cyclic game of five species" (Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 156: 111806), where ecosystem species coexistence was explored via simulation studies of the evolutionary spatial cyclic game (ESCG) Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS) with certain predator-prey relationships removed from the game's "interaction structure", i.e. with specific arcs ablated in the ESCG's dominance network, and with the ESCG run for 100,000 Monte Carlo Steps (MCS) to identify its asymptotic behaviors. I replicate the results presented by Zhong et al. for interaction structures with one, two, three, and four arcs ablated from the dominance network. I then empirically demonstrate that the dynamics of the RPSLS ESCG have sufficiently long time constants that the true asymptotic outcomes can often only be identified after running the ablated ESCG for 10,000,000MCS or longer, and that the true long-term outcomes can be markedly less diverse than those reported by Zhong et al. as asymptotic. Finally I demonstrate that, when run for sufficiently many MCS, the original unablated RPSLS system exhibits essentially the same asymptotic outcomes as the ablated RPSLS systems, and in this sense the only causal effect of the ablations is to alter the time required for the system to converge to the long-term asymptotic states that the unablated system eventually settles to anyhow.</description>

      <title>Learning Object Properties Using Robot Proprioception via Differentiable Robot-Object Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiable simulation has become a powerful tool for system identification. While prior work has focused on identifying robot properties using robot-specific data or object properties using object-specific data, our approach calibrates object properties by using information from the robot, without relying on data from the object itself. Specifically, we utilize robot joint encoder information, which is commonly available in standard robotic systems. Our key observation is that by analyzing the robot's reactions to manipulated objects, we can infer properties of those objects, such as inertia and softness. Leveraging this insight, we develop differentiable simulations of robot-object interactions to inversely identify the properties of the manipulated objects. Our approach relies solely on proprioception -- the robot's internal sensing capabilities -- and does not require external measurement tools or vision-based tracking systems. This general method is applicable to any articulated robot and requires only joint position information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a low-cost robotic platform, achieving accurate mass and elastic modulus estimations of manipulated objects with just a few seconds of computation on a laptop.</description>

      <title>Block Vecchia Approximation for Scalable and Efficient Gaussian Process Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are vital for modeling and predicting irregularly-spaced, large geospatial datasets. However, their computations often pose significant challenges in large-scale applications. One popular method to approximate GPs is the Vecchia approximation, which approximates the full likelihood via a series of conditional probabilities. The classical Vecchia approximation uses univariate conditional distributions, which leads to redundant evaluations and memory burdens. To address this challenge, our study introduces block Vecchia, which evaluates each multivariate conditional distribution of a block of observations, with blocks formed using the K-means algorithm. The proposed GPU framework for the block Vecchia uses varying batched linear algebra operations to compute multivariate conditional distributions concurrently, notably diminishing the frequent likelihood evaluations. Diving into the factor affecting the accuracy of the block Vecchia, the neighbor selection criterion is investigated, where we found that the random ordering markedly enhances the approximated quality as the block count becomes large. To verify the scalability and efficiency of the algorithm, we conduct a series of numerical studies and simulations, demonstrating their practical utility and effectiveness compared to the exact GP. Moreover, we tackle large-scale real datasets using the block Vecchia method, i.e., high-resolution 3D profile wind speed with a million points.</description>

      <title>Calculation of Photocarrier Generation from Optical Absorption for Time-domain Simulation of Optoelectronic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photocarrier generation rate in optoelectronic materials is often calculated using the Poynting vector in the frequency domain. However, this approach is not accurate in time-domain simulations of photoconductive devices because the instantaneous Poynting vector does not distinguish between power flux densities of optical and low-frequency electromagnetic fields. The latter is generated by photocurrents and is not supposed to contribute to the photocarrier generation since the corresponding photon energy is smaller than the bandgap energy of the optoelectronic material. In this work, an optical absorption-based model is proposed to accurately calculate the generation rate in time-domain simulations. The proposed approach considers the material dispersion near the optical frequency corresponding to the bandgap energy of the optoelectronic material. The instantaneous optical absorption is calculated from the polarization current density associated with the dispersion model. Then, the optical absorption is used to calculate the generation rate. Numerical examples show that the proposed approach is more accurate than the Poynting vector-based method in calculating the instantaneous optical absorption. The proposed method is further validated against experimental results by modeling a photoconductive device. In the multiphysics simulation, the Poynting vector-based method overestimates the carrier generation rate and even generates divergent carrier densities when the low-frequency fields are strong, while the proposed method produces results that match with experimental measurements well.</description>

      <title>Brain-Like Replay Naturally Emerges in Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Replay is a powerful strategy to promote learning in artificial intelligence and the brain. However, the conditions to generate it and its functional advantages have not been fully recognized. In this study, we develop a modular reinforcement learning model that could generate replay. We prove that replay generated in this way helps complete the task. We also analyze the information contained in the representation and provide a mechanism for how replay makes a difference. Our design avoids complex assumptions and enables replay to emerge naturally within a task-optimized paradigm. Our model also reproduces key phenomena observed in biological agents. This research explores the structural biases in modular ANN to generate replay and its potential utility in developing efficient RL.</description>

      <title>BioDiscoveryAgent: An AI Agent for Designing Genetic Perturbation Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents based on large language models have shown great potential in accelerating scientific discovery by leveraging their rich background knowledge and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce BioDiscoveryAgent, an agent that designs new experiments, reasons about their outcomes, and efficiently navigates the hypothesis space to reach desired solutions. We demonstrate our agent on the problem of designing genetic perturbation experiments, where the aim is to find a small subset out of many possible genes that, when perturbed, result in a specific phenotype (e.g., cell growth). Utilizing its biological knowledge, BioDiscoveryAgent can uniquely design new experiments without the need to train a machine learning model or explicitly design an acquisition function as in Bayesian optimization. Moreover, BioDiscoveryAgent, using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieves an average of 21% improvement in predicting relevant genetic perturbations across six datasets, and a 46% improvement in the harder task of non-essential gene perturbation, compared to existing Bayesian optimization baselines specifically trained for this task. Our evaluation includes one dataset that is unpublished, ensuring it is not part of the language model's training data. Additionally, BioDiscoveryAgent predicts gene combinations to perturb more than twice as accurately as a random baseline, a task so far not explored in the context of closed-loop experiment design. The agent also has access to tools for searching the biomedical literature, executing code to analyze biological datasets, and prompting another agent to critically evaluate its predictions. Overall, BioDiscoveryAgent is interpretable at every stage, representing an accessible new paradigm in the computational design of biological experiments with the potential to augment scientists' efficacy.</description>
