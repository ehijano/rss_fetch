      <title>NV-like Defects More Common Than Four-Leaf Clovers: A Perspective on High-Throughput Point Defect Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects for quantum technologies is an emerging research area, with the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond at the forefront. However, how rare are defects with NV-like properties? In this perspective, I highlight the results of NV-like defects across 17 different materials, revealing that they are more common than finding four-leaf clovers. I also discuss expanding the search criteria to identify other defects relevant to quantum technologies. Utilizing point defect databases will be instrumental in assisting researchers in discovering previously unexplored defects suitable for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Engineering and exploiting self-driven domain wall motion in ferrimagnets for neuromorphic computing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic domain wall motion has recently garnered significant interest as a physical mechanism to enable energy-efficient, next-generation brain-inspired computing architectures. However, realizing all behaviors required for neuromorphic computing within standard material systems remains a significant challenge, as these functionalities often rely on competing interactions. Here, we demonstrate how spontaneous domain wall motion in response to locally engineered lateral exchange coupling in transition metal-rare earth ferrimagnets can be leveraged to achieve numerous neuromorphic computing functionalities in devices with minimal complexity. Through experiments and micromagnetic simulations, we show how tuning the feature size, material composition, and chiral interaction strength controls the speed of self-driven domain wall motion. When integrated with spin-orbit torque, this control gives rise to behaviors essential for neuromorphic computing, including leaky integration and passive resetting of artificial neuron potential. These results establish locally engineered ferrimagnets as a tunable, scalable, and straightforward platform for domain wall-based computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Lattice anharmonicity effects in fluorite oxide single crystals and anomalous increase in phonon lifetime in ceria at elevated temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the temperature dependence of the frequency and linewidth of the triply-degenerate T$_{2g}$ zone-centered optical phonon in flux-grown ceria and hydrothermally-synthesized thoria single crystals from room temperature to 1273 K using Raman spectroscopy. Both crystals exhibit an expected increase in the phonon linewidth with temperature due to enhanced phonon-phonon scattering. However, ceria displays an anomalous linewidth reduction in the temperature range of 1023-1123 K. First-principles phonon linewidth calculations considering cubic and quartic phonon interactions within temperature-independent phonon dispersion fail to describe this anomaly. A parameterization of the temperature-dependent second order interatomic force constants based on previously reported phonon dispersion measured at room and high temperatures, predicts a deviation from the monotonic linewidth increase, albeit at temperatures lower than those observed experimentally for ceria. The qualitative agreement in the trend of temperature-dependent linewidth suggests that lattice anharmonicity-induced phonon renormalization plays a role in phonon lifetime. Specifically, a change in the overlap between softened acoustic and optical branches in the dispersion curve reduces the available phonon scattering phase space of the Raman active mode at the zone center, leading to an increased phonon lifetime within a narrow temperature interval. These findings provide new insights into higher-order anharmonic interactions in ceria and thoria, motivating further investigations into the role of anharmonicity-induced phonon renormalization on phonon lifetimes at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Real-space first-principles approach to orbitronic phenomena in metallic multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a real-space first-principles method based on density functional theory to investigate orbitronic phenomena in complex materials. Using the Real-Space Linear Muffin-Tin Orbital method within the Atomic Sphere Approximation (RS-LMTO-ASA) combined with a Chebyshev polynomial expansion of the Green's functions, we compute orbital (spin) Hall transport and orbital (spin) accumulation directly in real space. The approach scales linearly with system size and naturally incorporates disorder, finite-size effects, and interface roughness. We apply the method to transition-metal-based heterostructures and demonstrate the emergence of substantial orbital (spin) accumulation, even in centrosymmetric systems. Our methodology provides a scalable and flexible framework for realistic simulations of orbital transport phenomena in complex heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning interatomic potentials achieving CCSD(T) accuracy for van-der-Waals-dominated systems via {\Delta}-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable large-scale atomistic simulations at moderate computational cost while retaining ab initio accuracy. However, most MLIPs are trained on density-functional theory (DFT), which often falls short of chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). Conversely, coupled-cluster methods, particularly CCSD(T), which includes single, double, and perturbative triple excitations, are considered the gold standard of computational chemistry but rarely applied to periodic systems due to their huge computational cost. Here we present a $\Delta$-learning workflow to produce interatomic potentials with CCSD(T) accuracy for periodic systems including van der Waals (vdW) interactions. The procedure combines a dispersion-corrected tight-binding baseline with an MLIP trained on the differences of the target CCSD(T) energies from the baseline. This $\Delta$-learning strategy enables training on compact molecular fragments while preserving transferability. The dispersion interactions are captured by including vdW-bound multimers in the training set; together with the vdW-aware tight-binding baseline, the formally local MLIP attains CCSD(T) accuracy for systems governed by long-range vdW forces. The resulting potential yields root-mean-square energy errors below 0.4 meV/atom on both training and test sets and reproduces electronic total atomization energies, bond lengths, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and inter-molecular interaction energies for benchmark molecular systems. We apply the method to a prototypical quasi-two-dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) composed of carbon and hydrogen. The COF structure, inter-layer binding energies, and hydrogen absorption are analyzed at CCSD(T) accuracy. Overall, the developed $\Delta$-learning approach opens a practical route to large-scale atomistic simulations that include vdW interactions with chemical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Modeling of silver transport in cubic SiC: Integrating molecular dynamics, bounds averaging, and uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silver released from TRISO fuel particles can migrate through the SiC layer and deposit on reactor components, posing radiation hazards and operational challenges. Despite numerous proposed mechanisms, the precise pathway of silver transport through intact 3C-SiC remains unresolved. We present a physics-informed model for estimating the effective diffusivity of silver in polycrystalline 3C-SiC. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations yield diffusivities for {\Sigma 3} and {\Sigma 9} grain boundaries (GBs), while literature values are used for other GB types and the bulk. These are combined using a bounds-averaging approach accounting for distinct GB transport properties. Bayesian inference of experimental data provides credible intervals for effective Arrhenius parameters and reveals a correlation between activation energy and pre-exponential factor. Although the homogenized model captures GB-mediated transport mechanisms, it overpredicts silver diffusivity relative to experiments. To resolve this, a multiplicative correction based on reversible trapping at nano-pores is introduced. It is derived from first principles and is shown to reproduce observed transport behavior. Sensitivity analysis identified trap desorption energy and {\Sigma 9} GB diffusivity as dominant factors influencing Ag transport. The resulting framework provides a mechanistic description of Ag transport suitable for integration into higher-scale fuel performance models.</description>

      <title>Modeling oxygen-void interactions in uranium nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen impurities in uranium nitride (UN) are reported to influence its swelling behavior under irradiation, yet the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this work, we develop a first-principles model that quantifies the interaction of oxygen with voids and fission gas bubbles in UN, leading to a reduction in surface energy that can promote swelling. The analysis reveals that segregation of substitutional oxygen at surface nitrogen sites is the primary driver of surface energy reduction, $|\Delta \sigma|$, while oxygen in surface hollow sites plays a minor and sometimes counteracting role. $|\Delta \sigma|$ is most pronounced for small cavities ($R_v$ = 1--10 nm) at intermediate temperatures that coincide with the onset of breakaway swelling in UN. Larger voids require higher temperatures for oxygen adsorption to significantly lower their surface energy. The temperature dependence of $|\Delta \sigma|$ exhibits three regimes: negligible reduction at low temperatures due to sluggish oxygen diffusion, a maximum at intermediate temperatures where oxygen incorporation is optimal, and a decline at high temperatures due to enhanced bulk solubility. A parametric analysis reveals that $|\Delta \sigma|$ depends strongly on both oxygen concentration and cavity size, but is largely insensitive to porosity. Our results suggest that oxygen-induced surface energy reduction is essential for reconciling the mechanistic swelling model of UN with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Vacancy Levels in CsPbCl3 Obey Equilibrium Defect Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14513v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide vacancies are the dominant point defects in perovskites with VCl identified as a detrimental trap for the optoelectronic performance of CsPbCl3, with applications ranging from photodetectors to solar cells. Understanding these defects under operating conditions is key since their electronic levels exhibit large thermal fluctuations that challenge the validity of static 0 K models. However, quantitative modelling of defect processes requires hybrid density functional theory with spin-orbit coupling, which is too expensive for direct molecular dynamic simulations. To address this, we train a multi-task machine learning force field to study VCl in orthorhombic CsPbCl3 at 300 K. While we observe strong oscillations in the optical transition level arising from the soft potential energy surface, neither the non-radiative capture barriers nor the thermodynamic charge transition levels are affected. Our results reveal that VCl is not responsible for the non-radiative losses previously assumed. Instead, its impact on performance arises from other mechanisms, such as limiting the open-circuit voltage and promoting ionic migration. Our findings demonstrate that, despite strong dynamical effects in halide perovskites, the conventional static formalism of defect theory remains valid for predicting thermodynamic behavior, providing a sound basis for the design of high-performance energy materials.</description>

      <title>Electron charge dynamics and charge separation: A response theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study applies response theory to investigate electron charge dynamics, with a particular focus on charge separation. We analytically assess the strengths and limitations of linear and quadratic response theories in describing charge density and current, illustrated by a model that simulates charge transfer systems. While linear response accurately captures optical properties, the quadratic response contains the minimal ingredients required to describe charge dynamics and separation. Notably, it closely matches exact time propagation results in some regime that we identify. We propose and test several approximations to the quadratic response and explore the influence of higher-order terms and the effect of an on-site interaction $U$.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic magnon transport in the \textit{d}-wave altermagnet \ch{LuFeO3}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit a spin-split band structure despite having zero net magnetization, leading to special magnonic properties such as anisotropic magnon lifetimes and field-free spin transport. Here, we present a direct experimental demonstration of non-local magnon transport in the \textit{d}-wave altermagnet \ch{LuFeO3}, using both spin Seebeck and spin Hall effect-based injection and detection. We observe a non-local spin signal at zero magnetic field when the transport is along an altermagnetic direction, but not for transport along other directions. The observed sign reversal between two distinct altermagnetic directions in the spin Seebeck response demonstrates the altermagnetic nature of the magnon transport. In contrast, when transport is aligned along or perpendicular to the easy axis, both the first-harmonic signal and the sign-reversal effect vanish, consistent with symmetry-imposed suppression. These findings are supported by atomistic spin dynamics simulations, as well as linear spin wave theory calculations, which explain how our altermagnetic system hosts anisotropic spin Seebeck transport. Our results provide direct evidence of direction-dependent magnon splitting in altermagnets and highlight their potential for field-free magnonic spin transport, offering a promising pathway for low-power spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Severe plastic deformations, mechanochemistry, and microstructure evolution under high pressure: In Situ Experiments, Four-Scale Theory, New Phenomena, and Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Processes involving severe plastic deformations (SPD) and phase transformations and chemical reactions (PTs/CRs) under high pressures are widespread for obtaining new nanostructured phases and their processing, mechanochemical synthesis, military applications, and nature. SPD strongly reduce the pressure required for PTs/CRs (by one-two orders of magnitude) and PT hysteresis; lead to hidden metastable phases, which cannot be obtained otherwise, and substitute reversible PTs/CRs with irreversible ones. This review is devoted to breakthroughs in understanding multifaceted interactions between high-pressure PTs/CRs, SPD, and microstructure evolution from the viewpoint of advanced mechanics and thermodynamics of materials under stress and plastic strain tensors. A novel concept of plastic strain-induced PTs/CRs under high pressure is explored using four-scale theory and simulations (from atomistic to nano- and scale-free phase-field approaches to macroscale) coupled to in situ experiments in traditional and rotational diamond anvil cells, and their integration. Its development revealed various phenomena and misinterpretations, resolved numerous puzzles, found the first general rules in these fields, and suggested ways for economic defect-induced synthesis of high-pressure phases and nanostructures. Coupled analytical/computational/experimental approaches are developed for complete characterization of occurring processes and finding all heterogeneous scalar and tensorial fields. Applications include high-pressure torsion, surface treatment, high-pressure tribology, PTs/CRs in shear bands leading to severe transformation/reaction-induced plasticity and self-blown-up processes, mechanisms of deep-focus earthquakes, the appearance of microdiamonds in low-pressure-temperature Earth crust, and the mechanochemical origin of life beyond Earth. Unresolved problems and future directions are outlined.</description>

      <title>A practical route to donor binding energies: The DFT-1/2 method for shallow defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately calculating the binding energies of shallow defects requires large supercells to capture the extended nature of their wavefunctions. This makes many beyond-DFT methods, such as hybrid functionals, impractical for direct calculations, often requiring indirect or approximate approaches. However, standard DFT alone fails to provide reliable results due to the well-known band gap underestimation and delocalization errors. In this work, we employ the DFT-1/2 method to address these deficiencies while maintaining computational efficiency allowing us to reach supercells of up to 4096 atoms. We develop a practical procedure for applying DFT-1/2 to shallow defects and demonstrate its effectiveness for group V donors in silicon (P, As, Sb, Bi). By using an extrapolation scheme to infinite supercell size, we obtain accurate binding energies with minimal computational overhead. This approach offers a simple and direct method for calculating donor binding energies.</description>

      <title>Trion polaron problem in bulk and two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theoryof the trion polaron: a bound state of two electrons and one hole, dressed by longitudinal optical (LO) phonons. Starting from the Frohlich Hamiltonian, which describes the interaction of charged particles with LO phonons in three-dimensional (bulk) and two-dimensional (monolayer) polar crystals, we adopt the intermediate coupling variational approximation of Lee, Low, and Pines, and generalize it for the three-body problem. This yields an effective three-particle Hamiltonian with renormalized electron-electron and electron-hole interactions, similar to those obtained for exciton polaron and bipolaron problems. We compute the binding energies for a family of bulk perovskite materials and several atomic monolayer materials characterized by pronounced polar effects, providing quantitative benchmarks for spectroscopic measurements.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the valence transition in solution-grown single crystals of Eu$_2$Pt$_6$Al$_{15}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of Eu intermetallic compounds has allowed the exploration of valence fluctuations and transitions in 4f electron systems. Recently, a Eu$_2$Pt$_6$Al$_{15}$ phase synthesized by arc-melting followed by a thermal treatment was reported [M. Radzieowski \textit{et al.}, J Am Chem Soc 140(28), 8950-8957 (2018)], which undergoes a transition upon cooling below 45~K that was interpreted as a valence transition from Eu$^{2+}$ to Eu$^{3+}$. In this paper, we present the discovery of another polymorph of Eu$_2$Pt$_6$Al$_{15}$ obtained by high-temperature solution growth, that presents different physical properties than the arc-melted polycrystalline sample. Despite the similarities in crystal structure and chemical composition, the Eu valence transition is almost fully suppressed in the solution-grown crystals, allowing the moments associated with the Eu$^{2+}$ state to order antiferromagnetically at around 14~K. A detailed analysis of the crystal structure using single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that, although the solution grown crystals are built from the same constituent layers as the arc-melted samples, these layers present a different stacking. The effect of different thermal treatments is also studied. Different anneal procedures did not result in significant changes of the intrinsic properties, and only by arc-melting and quenching the crystals we were able to convert them into the previously reported polymorph.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed ML Exploration of Structure-Transport Relationships in Hard Carbon</title>

Abstract: Sodium-ion batteries are a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to lithium-ion systems for large-scale energy storage. Hard carbon (HC) anodes, composed of disordered graphitic and amorphous domains, offer high capacity but exhibit complex, poorly understood ion transport behavior. In particular, the relationship between local microstructure and sodium mobility remains unresolved, hindering rational performance optimization. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework that combines machine-learned interatomic potentials with molecular dynamics simulations to systematically investigate sodium diffusion across a broad range of carbon densities and sodium loadings. By computing per-ion structural descriptors, we identify the microscopic factors that govern ion transport. Unsupervised learning uncovers distinct diffusion modes, including hopping, clustering, and void trapping, while supervised analysis highlights tortuosity and NaNa coordination as primary determinants of mobility. Correlation mapping further connects these transport regimes to processing variables such as bulk density and sodium content. This physics-informed approach establishes quantitative structure-transport relationships that capture the heterogeneity of disordered carbon. Our findings deliver mechanistic insights into sodium-ion dynamics and provide actionable design principles for engineering high-performance HC anodes in next-generation battery systems.</description>

      <title>Carrier mobilities and electron-phonon interactions beyond DFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling is a key interaction that governs diverse physical processes such as carrier transport, superconductivity, and optical absorption. Calculating such interactions from first-principles with methods beyond density-functional theory remains a challenge. We introduce here a finite-difference framework for computing electron-phonon couplings for any electronic structure method that provides eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and showcase applications for hybrid and Koopmans functionals, and $GW$ many-body perturbation theory. Our approach introduces a novel projectability scheme based on eigenvalue differences and bypasses many of the limitations of the direct finite difference methods. It also leverages symmetries to reduce the number of independent atomic displacements, thereby keeping computational costs manageable. This approach enables seamless integration with established first-principles codes for generating displaced supercells, performing Wannier interpolations, and evaluating transport properties. Applications to silicon and gallium arsenide show that advanced electronic-structure functionals predict different electron-phonon couplings and modify band curvatures, resulting in much more accurate estimates of intrinsic carrier drift mobilities and effective masses. In general, our method provides a robust and accessible framework for exploring electron-phonon interactions in complex materials with state-of-the-art electronic structure methods.</description>

      <title>Comparison of derivative-free and gradient-based minimization for multi-objective compositional design of shape memory alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target. The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms. Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be made with limited data.</description>

Abstract: The Eu-based EuA$_2$X$_2$ (A = Zn, Cd, In, Sn; X = P, As, Sb) family of compounds has recently attracted significant attention as a promising platform for exploring magnetic topological materials, with several members either predicted or reported to exhibit nontrivial topological properties. We investigate the previously reported topological semimetals, EuZn$_2$As$_2$ and EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$, using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, complemented by various first-principles computational approaches. Through examination of the cleaved surfaces, step-edges, and defect states, we determine the trivial semiconducting behavior in both material systems, with no evidence of topological surface or edge states. These experimental results are consistent with our theoretical analysis revealing the absence of topological band inversion in either system. Our experimental observations also reveal numerous intrinsic defects that trap charge carriers. These defects may facilitate the formation of magnetic polarons, providing a natural explanation for the colossal negative magnetoresistance observed in many of the EuA$_2$X$_2$ material systems.</description>

      <title>New Upper Bounds on Exotic Neutron Spin-Electron Spin Interactions via Neutron Spin Rotation Measurements in a Compensated Ferrimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a search for exotic spin-spin interactions between neutrons and electrons which could signal new physics beyond the Standard Model using slow neutron polarimetric imaging through a dense medium of polarized electrons. Our dense polarized electron target is a ferrimagnet held at its magnetic compensation temperature, which realizes a polarized electron ensemble with zero net magnetization. We sought the spin rotation of transversely polarized neutrons from a neutron spin-electron spin interaction of the form $V_2=-g_A^eg_A^n\frac{\hbar c}{4\pi}\vec\sigma_e\cdot\vec\sigma_n\frac{e^{-r/\lambda_c}}{r}$, where $g_{A}^{e}$ and $g_{A}^{n}$ are the electron and neutron axial couplings, $\vec{\sigma_e}$ and $\vec{\sigma_n}$ are the electron and neutron spin, and $\lambda_c$ is the interaction range for an exotic axial vector interaction from massive spin-1 boson exchange of mass $\hbar c/\lambda_c$. The resulting average neutron spin rotation angle per unit length, $\frac{d\bar{\phi}_{F5}}{dz}=[0.41\pm6.30\ (stat.)\pm4.4\ (sys.)]\times10^{-3}$ rad/m, is consistent with zero. Our novel approach improves the previous upper limits on the coupling constant product $g_A^eg_A^n$ by several orders of magnitude in the poorly explored $10^{-8}\leq\lambda_c\leq10^{-2}$ range.</description>

      <title>Single layer clathrane: A potential superconducting two-dimensional (2D) hydrogenated metal borocarbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new family of two-dimensional (2D) metal-borocarbide clathrane superconductors, derived from three-dimensional (3D) MM$^\prime$B$_6$C$_6$ clathrates. First-principles calculations reveal that hydrogen passivation and surface metal decoration stabilize the M$_2$M$^\prime$B$_8$C$_8$H$_8$ monolayers. These 2D systems exhibit tunable superconductivity governed by hole concentration, structural anisotropy, and electron-phonon coupling. We find that in-plane anisotropy competes with superconductivity, reducing \tc\ despite favorable doping. Biaxial strain mitigates this anisotropy, enhances Fermi surface nesting, and increases \tc\ by an average of 15.5~K. For example, the \tc\ of Sr$_3$B$_8$C$_8$H$_8$ is predicted to increase from 11.3~K to 22.2~K with strain engineering. These findings identify 2D clathranes as promising, strain-tunable superconductors and highlight design principles for optimizing low-dimensional superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Jahn-Teller-like Distortion in a One-dimensional {\pi}-Conjugated Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structurally distorting low-dimensional {\pi}-conjugated systems can profoundly influence their electronic properties, but controlling such behavior in extended-width systems remains challenging. Here we demonstrate that a one-dimensional conjugated polymer, poly-(difluorenoheptalene-ethynylene) (PDFHE), undergoes a pronounced out-of-plane backbone distortion, equivalent to a spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of its mirror symmetry. We synthesized PDFHE on noble metal surfaces and characterized its structure and electronic states using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. Rather than adopting a planar, high-symmetry conformation, PDFHE relaxes into non-planar isomers stabilized by a Jahn-Teller-like mechanism that relieves an electronic instability relative to the gapped planar structure. Density functional theory calculations corroborate these findings, revealing that distortion lowers the total polymer energy and enlarges the bandgap, providing a microscopic explanation for the SSB. Our results show that even in mechanically robust extended {\pi}-systems, subtle electron-lattice coupling can spontaneously drive significant structural rearrangements.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian funneling in anisotropic media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has emerged as a distinctive phenomenon enabling non-Bloch wave manipulation. However, it has been limited to discrete lattices requiring fine-tuned onsite gain/loss or asymmetric couplings. Here, moving beyond these discrete models, we realize novel NHSE in uniform media by leveraging anisotropy of non-Hermitian density tensors. Experiments based on an acoustic anisotropic metamaterial demonstrate that enabled by the NHSE, wave energy can be directed toward and collected at specific boundaries, exhibiting broadband and wide-angle characteristics. This intriguing phenomenon is termed non-Hermitian wave funneling, which, remarkably, occurs under uniform non-Hermitian modulations, free of fine-tuning. Furthermore, we identify a second-order NHSE, enabling wave funneling toward corners. Our work establishes a paradigm for exploring NHSE in uniform media, advancing the fundamental understanding of non-Hermitian physics and providing novel mechanisms for non-Bloch wave control in metamaterials or even natural materials without delicate tuning.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Scalable Kernel Density Approach for Reliable Uncertainty Quantification in Atomistic Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used to predict material properties and accelerate atomistic simulations, but the reliability of their predictions depends on the representativeness of the training data. We present a scalable, GPU-accelerated uncertainty quantification framework based on $k$-nearest-neighbor kernel density estimation (KDE) in a PCA-reduced descriptor space. This method efficiently detects sparsely sampled regions in large, high-dimensional datasets and provides a transferable, model-agnostic uncertainty metric without requiring retraining costly model ensembles. The framework is validated across diverse case studies varying in: i) chemistry, ii) prediction models (including foundational neural network), iii) descriptors used for KDE estimation, and iv) properties whose uncertainty is sought. In all cases, the KDE-based score reliably flags extrapolative configurations, correlates well with conventional ensemble-based uncertainties, and highlights regions of reduced prediction trustworthiness. The approach offers a practical route for improving the interpretability, robustness, and deployment readiness of ML models in materials science.</description>

      <title>Correlated phases in rhombohedral N-layer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of correlated electron phases in rhombohedral $N$-layer graphene due to two-valley Coulomb interactions within a low-energy $k \cdot p$ framework. Analytical expressions for Lindhard susceptibilities in intra- and intervalley channels are derived, and the critical temperatures for phase transitions are estimated using both the random phase approximation (RPA) and the parquet approximation (PA). Within RPA, only Stoner and intervalley coherent (IVC) phases are supported, while the PA reveals a richer phase structure including particle-particle (PP) channel instabilities. We establish a general scaling law for the critical temperature with respect to layer number $N$, highlighting an upper bound as $N \rightarrow \infty$, and demonstrate a non-monotonic decrease of the critical temperature with increasing chemical potential. The PA uncovers the role of interaction symmetry: $SU(4)$-symmetric interactions favor intervalley Stoner order in the density channel, whereas $SU(2) \times SU(2)$-symmetric interactions permit a broader set of phases. A crossover in the dominant instability occurs in the particle-hole channel at a critical layer number, suggesting the emergence of magnetic or IVC phases in thicker systems. We also identify conditions under which pair-density wave (PDW) order could form in the PP channel, though its physical realization may be constrained.</description>

The system dynamics are simulated using the tight-binding approximation, with local phonons approximated as quantum harmonic oscillators. Phononic degrees of freedom significantly expand the Hilbert space dimension. This interaction modifies the eigenenergy spectrum by introducing new states within previously existing gaps, enhancing the harmonic yield through additional allowed transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are naturally competing, while their interplay can give rise to exotic quantum phases, such as triplet pairing, exemplified by heavy-fermion compounds like UTe$_2$, where magnetic fluctuations stabilise multiple superconducting states. However, such phenomena have remained elusive in high-temperature superconductors. Here we report the discovery of robust field-induced re-entrant superconductivity in heavily Eu-doped infinite-layer nickelate Sm$_{0.95-x}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_x$NiO$_2$. In the heavily over-doped regime, we observe a remarkable superconducting state that emerges under high magnetic fields ($&gt;$ 6 Tesla) after the initial suppression of zero-field superconductivity. Both zero-resistance transport and Meissner diamagnetic effect confirm the superconducting nature of this high-field phase, which persists up to at least 45 Tesla. This re-entrant behaviour is featured by the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity on distinct sublattices -- magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions and the Ni-O planes, respectively. Such an exotic state may arise from the compensation between external and internal exchange fields (Jaccarino-Peter effect) combined with magnetic fluctuation-enhanced pairing near quantum criticality. Our findings establish infinite-layer nickelates as a unique platform for high-temperature ferromagnetic superconductivity, opening new avenues for discovering and manipulating unconventional quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Linear Response from Zeeman Quantum Geometry in 2D Unconventional Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unconventional magnets with zero net magnetization yet momentum-dependent spin splitting constitute a newly identified class of materials that provide a rich platform for quantum-geometry-driven transport phenomena. Exploiting the interplay between momentum translation and spin rotation, we uncover a distinct linear transport response governed by a generalized quantum geometric tensor, the Zeeman quantum geometric tensor (ZQGT). We show that the ZQGT drives a linear intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current (IGMC) in the three prototypical two-dimensional unconventional magnets: a time-reversal-broken $d_{x^2 - y^2}$ altermagnet, a time-reversal-symmetric $p$-wave magnet, and a mixed $d$-wave altermagnet. Depending on symmetry, these magnets exhibit longitudinal, transverse, or combined conduction and displacement IGMCs in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. Notably, this response persists even when conventional Berry curvature contributions vanish, offering a unique probe of hidden spin-split band structures of unconventional magnets. In particular, for mixed $d$-wave altermagnets, symmetric Berry curvature and antisymmetric quantum metric respectively generate longitudinal conduction IGMC and transverse displacement IGMC- responses absent in conventional quantum geometry. The predicted signatures, relevant to compounds such as RuO$_2$, CrSb, and MnTe, provide experimentally accessible diagnostics for distinguishing unconventional magnetic phases. These findings position the ZQGT as a powerful framework for probing and controlling transport in next-generation quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: Probing the local structure and chemistry of wide-bandgap amorphous oxide thin films remains challenging due to the limitations of lab-based spectroscopy. This work integrates X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES), molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials, density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, and classical electrostatic modeling of final-state core-ionization effects in Al atoms to uncover the structure and chemistry of amorphous alumina polymorphs made with atomic layer deposition (ALD). DFT calculations using the Delta Kohn-Sham method supported the interpretation of final-state effects and validated electrostatic model assumptions. Shifts in the measured Auger parameter were interpreted as extra-atomic relaxation energies, revealing sensitivity to the local coordination environment. Structural disorder and thermal fluctuations were found to govern the distribution of extra-atomic relaxation energies, suggesting that cryo-XPS can isolate and reveal intrinsic structural building blocks of amorphous oxides. Simulated heating and annealing demonstrated that Auger parameter shifts can serve as indicators of phase decomposition in H-supersaturated ALD amorphous alumina. These findings provide a pathway for comprehensive interpretation and predictive modeling of XPS spectra in amorphous wide-bandgap oxides.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure prediction of medium and high entropy alloys across composition space</title>

Abstract: We propose machine learning (ML) models to predict the electron density -- the fundamental unknown of a material's ground state -- across the composition space of concentrated alloys. From this, other physical properties can be inferred, enabling accelerated exploration. A significant challenge is that the number of sampled compositions and descriptors required to accurately predict fields like the electron density increases rapidly with species. To address this, we employ Bayesian Active Learning (AL), which minimizes training data requirements by leveraging uncertainty quantification capabilities of Bayesian Neural Networks. Compared to strategic tessellation of the composition space, Bayesian-AL reduces the number of training data points by a factor of 2.5 for ternary (SiGeSn) and 1.7 for quaternary (CrFeCoNi) systems. We also introduce easy-to-optimize, body-attached-frame descriptors, which respect physical symmetries and maintain approximately the same descriptor-vector size as alloy elements increase. Our ML models demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability in predicting both electron density and energy across composition space.</description>

      <title>Lateral Exchange Bias for N\'eel-Vector Control in Atomically Thin Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a fascinating platform for the exploration of novel physical phenomena arising from their reduced dimensionality and exceptional material properties. Their single-crystalline nature and ultimate miniaturization position them as leading candidates for next-generation spintronic applications. Antiferromagnetic (AF) vdW magnets are of particular interest, as they combine the advantages of vdW magnets with the functionality of AF spintronics, offering unique opportunities for ultrafast and robust spintronic devices. However, the lack of approaches to locally and deterministically manipulate their order parameter -- the N\'eel-vector -- remains a key limitation. Here, we introduce a fundamentally new paradigm in nanomagnetism, which we term lateral exchange bias (LEB), to achieve N\'eel vector control in bilayers of the vdW AF CrSBr. We exploit the single-crystalline registry formed by terraced CrSBr samples, where the bilayer N\'eel vector is controlled by LEB from neighboring, odd-layered flakes, whose nonzero magnetization we manipulate using magnetic fields. Using this control, we achieve nonvolatile manipulation of magnetic domains and domain walls (DWs) in AF CrSBr bilayers, establishing a powerful toolkit for controlling atomically thin AFs at the nanoscale. Our results challenge conventional views on exchange bias and provide a previously unexplored mechanism for achieving atomic-scale control of AFic order. Our findings pave the way for the development of advanced spintronic architectures and quantum technologies based on vdW magnets.</description>

      <title>Double Helix of atomic displacements in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05017v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of a "dipole spiral" structure in strained freestanding membranes of PbTiO$_3$, suggesting a potential route to enhanced electromechanical responses [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.046802}{PRL \textbf{133}, 046802 (2024)}]. However, its microscopic nature, energetic landscape, and electronic properties remain largely unexplored from a first-principles perspective. Here, using density function theory on PbTiO$_3$ under biaxial tensile strain, we identify a novel form of polar order: a chiral, non-collinear ferroelectric double helix. We find that the Pb- and Ti-cation sublattices form two distinct, intertwined helices, reminiscent of DNA. This topology is stabilized by a collective helical twisting of the oxygen octahedral framework, which gives rise to an electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interaction. The resulting structure, which can be canceptualized as a "self-Moir\'e" crystal, exhibits two coupled functionalities. First, it possesses a rotational pseudo-zero-energy mode that underpins a giant piezoelectric response ($e_{33}\approx$16 C/m$^2$). Second, the long-period potential reconstructs the electronic band structure, leading to a multi-valley electronic topology at the valence band edge. Our work establishes a physical route to designing complex chiral order that supports both giant electromechanical coupling and multi-valley electronics.</description>

      <title>Observation and mitigation of microwave echoes from dielectric defects in Josephson traveling wave amplifiers</title>

Abstract: Amplifying microwave signals with a noise close to the minimum imposed by quantum mechanics is now routinely performed with superconducting quantum devices. In particular, Josephson-based Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (JTWPA) have shown record bandwidth with added noise close to the quantum limit. In this work, we report the appearance of echo signals emitted by JTWPAs driven by trains of high-power pulses exceeding their dynamical range. we explore the case of weak signals generated through high power pulses. By sending a train of such high-power pulses, beyond the 1 dB compression point of such amplifiers, we observe the appearance of echoes, solely due to the JTWPA. These echoes have micro-second coherence and we attribute their origin to microscopic defects in the amplifier dielectric layer. By analyzing the power and the coherence of the echo signal as a function of temperature, we estimate the dielectric loss brought by these defects, and their impact on the JTWPA quantum efficiency. We introduce a mitigation technique (BLAST) to prevent the appearance of these echoes, consisting in an additional high-power tone sent concurrently with each pulse. We demonstrate that it suppresses the spurious defect signals and we recover the typical gain and noise figure within 95% of their low-power values in 300 ns. These results can help to extend the use of JTWPAs in experiments where fast high-power sequences are necessary to generate weak microwave responses from the system under study, and also provide a path towards characterizing in-situ the dielectric losses of these devices.</description>

      <title>Applied-field magnetic structure and spectroscopy shifts of the effective spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, $XY$-like magnet Li$_2$CoCl$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Insulators containing chains of magnetic transition metal cations provide platforms for probing spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ dynamics and quantum critical behavior. Li$_2$CoCl$_4$ contains edge-sharing CoCl$_6$ octahedra that form chains along the crystallographic $c$ axis and orders antiferromagnetically at zero field, but questions remain about its applied-field magnetic structure and the Co$^{2+}$ spin state. Here, we show with neutron diffraction on a polycrystalline sample how the anti-aligned chains of cobalt moments begin to transition to a ferromagnetic state above 1.6 T. Further, using magnetic resonance absorption measurements and noninteracting spin models, we reveal the strongly anisotropic nature of the Co$^{2+}$ ion's $XY$-like magnetic behavior ($g_{\parallel}=2.77$ and $g_{\perp}=5.23$) and its $J=\frac{1}{2}$ ground state. We, therefore, supply the magnetic structures and anisotropic description needed to explore the dynamics of the field-driven magnetic phases, laying the foundation for further experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Superconductivity and Mixed-dimensional Behaviour in Infinite-layer Samarium Nickelate Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth infinite-layer nickelates represent an emerging class of unconventional superconductors, with materials synthesis largely limited to early lanthanide compounds. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of phase-pure superconducting samarium-based infinite-layer nickelate thin films, including the first demonstration of Sm$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$, along with co-doped variants incorporating europium and calcium. These films, grown on LSAT (001) substrates, exhibit coherent lattice structures up to $\sim$ 9 nm thickness with minimal stacking faults. The co-doped compounds achieve a record-small $c$-axis parameter of 3.26 {\AA} and display remarkable superconducting transition temperatures up to 32.5 K. These results establish a clear correlation between decreasing $c$-axis parameter and increasing critical temperature across different rare-earth systems. In addition, angle-dependent magnetoresistance investigations reveal the existence of a hybrid mixture of 2D and 3D superconductivity in this novel system with enhanced coupling between the rare-earth 5d and Ni 3d orbitals, confirmed by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering experiments. As the concentration of Eu increases, the system exhibits a clear tendency towards 3D superconductivity. Furthermore, we observe distinctive negative magnetoresistance in the europium-containing samples. These findings advocate clear materials design principles for higher transition temperatures and exotic physics in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors through structural engineering of the rare-earth site.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Spin-Orbit Torques by Tensorial Spin Hall Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) provides a crucial tool for experimentally studying spin torques. While MR is well established in the device geometry of the spin Hall effect (SHE), as exemplified by the magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures, its role and manifestation beyond the SHE paradigm remain elusive. We propose a hitherto unknown form of MR where the underlying charge-to-spin conversion and its inverse process violate the simple geometry of the SHE, calling for tensorial descriptions. This MR can generate a series of unique harmonic responses essential for the experimental characterization of unconventional spin-orbit torques in non-SHE materials. We demonstrate these harmonic signals with semimetal WTe$_2$ in mind but the results are not restricted to specific materials.</description>
