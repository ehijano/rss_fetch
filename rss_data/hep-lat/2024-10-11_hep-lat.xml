      <title>Influence of center vortices on the overlap quark propagator in dynamical QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is strong evidence supporting center vortices as underpinning confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking -- the two key features of nonperturbative QCD. In our recent letter [ arXiv:2305.18690 ] we find that dynamical mass generation vanishes upon vortex removal in full QCD with a near-physical quark mass. In this work we extend those results and consider the influence of center vortex removal on the overlap Landau-gauge quark propagator at multiple valence quark masses on the same dynamical QCD ensemble, keeping fixed the near-physical sea quark mass. After carefully applying a smoothing process we also find that dynamical mass generation is reproduced on the corresponding vortex-only fields. This vortex-only dynamical mass shows qualitative agreement with the untouched Monte Carlo gauge field results. The results reported herein lend further credence to the important relationship between dynamical fermions and center vortices and the mediation of nonperturbative phenomena in QCD.</description>

      <title>Origin of hadron spin based on Lattice QCD study on the charmed hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first Lattice calculation about the charmed hadron spin decomposition using overlap fermions on a 2+1 flavor RBC/UKQCD domain-wall gauge configurations at 0.083 fm with 300 MeV pion mass. It is found that the contributions of quark spin to the spin of 1S, 1P charmonia and also proton-like triple heavy quark state are comparable with the expectation of non-relativistic quark model. Such an observation provides evidence that the non-triviality of proton spin decomposition mainly arises from the relativistic effects of the light quark. Conversely, the substantial gluon angular momentum contribution in the spin $(1/2)^+$ state with triple heavy quarks at the charm quark mass, remains significant, highlighting the ongoing importance of the gluon in the realm of charmed baryon physics.</description>

      <title>Toward hybrid quantum simulations with qubits and qumodes on trapped-ion platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of hybrid quantum computing using both discrete (qubit) and continuous (qumode) variables on trapped-ion platforms. Trapped-ion systems have demonstrated record one- and two-qubit gate fidelities and long qubit coherence times while qumodes, which can be represented by the collective vibrational modes of the ion chain, have remained relatively unexplored for their use in computing. Using numerical simulations, we show that high-fidelity hybrid gates and measurement operations can be achieved for existing trapped-ion quantum platforms. As an exemplary application, we consider quantum simulations of the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model, which is given by a one-dimensional chain of interacting spin and boson degrees of freedom. Using classical simulations, we study its real-time evolution and we develop a suitable variational quantum algorithm for the ground state preparation. Our results motivate further studies of hybrid quantum computing in this context, which may lead to direct applications in condensed matter and fundamental particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Anomalous $U(1)_A$ couplings and the Columbia plot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the quark masses are lighter than those in QCD, the standard lore is that a chiral transition of first order must emerge for three, light flavors. Recently, however, numerical simulations on the lattice suggest that the chiral transition is of second order in the chiral limit. Using an extended linear sigma model in the mean field approximation, we study the relation between terms which break the anomalous, $U(1)_A$ symmetry and the order of the chiral phase transition, especially how a chiral transition of second order can arise for three, massless flavors. We note that in an (unphysical) region of the "Columbia" phase diagram, when the strange quark mass is light and negative, corresponding to topological angle $\theta=\pi$, the $CP$ symmetry is spontaneously broken.</description>

      <title>Numerical indication that center vortices drive dynamical mass generation in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first calculation of the response of the momentum space quark propagator to center vortices in the ground state fields of QCD is presented. Center vortices are identified on 2+1-flavour dynamical gauge fields with $m_\pi \simeq 156$ MeV to obtain the vortex-removed and vortex-only quark propagator. Dynamical mass generation is found to vanish upon vortex removal, while the vortex-only field is able to generate dynamical mass. These new signatures strengthen the lattice QCD evidence indicating that center vortices underpin both dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement.</description>

      <title>Finite-volume scattering on the left-hand cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-particle finite-volume scattering formalism derived by L\"uscher and generalized in many subsequent works does not hold for energies far enough below the two-particle threshold to reach the nearest left-hand cut. The breakdown of the formalism is signaled by the fact that a real scattering amplitude is predicted in a regime where it should be complex. In this work, we address this limitation by deriving an extended formalism that includes the nearest branch cut, arising from single particle exchange. We focus on two-nucleon ($NN \to NN$) scattering, for which the cut arises from pion exchange, but give expressions for any system with a single channel of identical particles. The new result takes the form of a modified quantization condition that can be used to constrain an intermediate K-matrix in which the cut is removed. In a second step, integral equations, also derived in this work, must be used to convert the K-matrix to the physical scattering amplitude. We also show how the new formalism reduces to the standard approach when the $N \to N \pi$ coupling is set to zero.</description>

      <title>Valence Quark PDFs of the Proton from Two-Current Correlations in Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following previous works on that topic, we consider Euclidean hadronic matrix elements in position space of two spatially separated local currents on the lattice, in order to extract the $x$ dependence of parton distribution functions (PDFs). The corresponding approach is often referred to by the term lattice cross section. In this work we will consider valence quark PDFs of an unpolarized proton. We adapt the previously established formalism to our choice of operators. The calculation of the two-current matrix elements requires the evaluation of four-point functions. The corresponding calculation is carried out on a $n_f = 2+1$ gauge ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.0856~\mathrm{fm}$ and pseudoscalar masses $m_\pi = 355~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $m_K = 441~\mathrm{MeV}$. The four-point functions have been evaluated in a previous project. The lattice data is converted to the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme at a scale $\mu=2~\mathrm{GeV}$ and improved with respect to lattice artifacts. We use a common model as fit ansatz for the lattice data in order to extract the PDFs.</description>

      <title>Charm physics with overlap fermions on 2+1-flavor domain wall fermion configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons $D$, $D_s$, $\eta_c$ and vector mesons $D^*$, $D_s^*$, $J/\psi$ are determined from $N_f=2+1$ lattice QCD at a lattice spacing $a\sim0.08$ fm. For vector mesons, the decay constants defined by tensor currents are given in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme at $2$ GeV. The calculation is performed on domain wall fermion configurations generated by the RBC-UKQCD Collaborations and the overlap fermion action is used for the valence quarks. Comparing the current results with our previous ones at a coarser lattice spacing $a\sim0.11$ fm gives us a better understanding of the discretization error. We obtain $f_{D_s^*}^T(\overline{\rm MS},\text{2 GeV})/f_{D_s^*}=0.907(20)$ with a better precision than our previous result. Combining our $f_{D_s^*}=277(11)$ MeV with the total width of $D_s^*$ determined in a recent work gives a branching fraction $4.26(52)\times10^{-5}$ for $D_s^*$ leptonic decay.</description>

      <title>Neutral pion polarizabilities from four-point functions in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a proof-of-principle lattice QCD simulation of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities for a neutral pion in the four-point function method. The results are based on the same quenched Wilson ensembles on a $24^3\times 48$ lattice at $\beta=6.0$ with pion mass from 1100 to 370 MeV previously used for a charged pion. For electric polarizability, the results are largely consistent with those from the background field method and ChPT. In contrast, there are significant differences for magnetic polarizability among the four-point function method, the background field method, and ChPT. The situation points to the potentially important role of disconnected diagrams for a neutral pion. We elucidate a transparent quark decomposition in the four-point function method that can be used to shed light on the issue.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Simulations of Axion String-Wall Networks: Probing Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves for Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simultaneously study gravitational waves (GWs) and free axions emitted from axionic string-wall networks in the early universe using advanced 3D lattice simulations. Our simulations start before the Peccei-Quinn phase transition and end with the destruction of string-wall networks below the QCD scale. The axion dark matter (DM) relic abundance radiated from string-wall networks are updated and refined for the scenarios of $N_{\rm DW}&gt;1$. In this scenario, we observe that the GW spectrum is almost independent of the bias term and $N_{\rm DW}$, and $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2\propto f^{1.29}(f^{-0.43})$ in the IR and middle-frequency regions. After considering the constraints from DM relic abundance, we found that the QCD axion model predicts undetectable GW emissions, and the axion-like particles model allows for a detectable GW signal in the nano-Hertz to the milli-Hertz frequency range corresponding to axion masses range from KeV to TeV. For $N_{\rm DW}=1$, the GW energy density appears undetectable for QCD axions and axion-like particles.</description>

Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model considering the effects of an effective chiral chemical potential. We offer a new parametrization of the Polyakov-loop potential depending on temperature and the chiral chemical potential which, when used together with a proper regularization scheme of vacuum contributions, predicts results consistent with those from lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantized axial charge of staggered fermions and the chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1+1D ultra-local lattice Hamiltonian for staggered fermions with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, there are two conserved, integer-valued charges that flow in the continuum limit to the vector and axial charges of a massless Dirac fermion with a perturbative anomaly. Each of the two lattice charges generates an ordinary U(1) global symmetry that acts locally on operators and can be gauged individually. Interestingly, they do not commute on a finite lattice and generate the Onsager algebra, but their commutator goes to zero in the continuum limit. The chiral anomaly is matched by this non-abelian algebra, which is consistent with the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We further prove that the presence of these two conserved lattice charges forces the low-energy phase to be gapless, reminiscent of the consequence from perturbative anomalies of continuous global symmetries in continuum field theory. Upon bosonization, these two charges lead to two exact U(1) symmetries in the XX model that flow to the momentum and winding symmetries in the free boson conformal field theory.</description>
