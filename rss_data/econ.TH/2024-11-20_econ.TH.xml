      <title>Quasi-stability notions in two-sided matching models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents weakened notions of corewise stability and setwise stability for matching markets where agents have substitutable choice functions. We introduce the concepts of worker-quasi-core, firm-quasi-core, and worker-quasisetwise stability. We also examine their relationship to established notions in the literature, such as worker-quasi and firm-quasi stability in both many-to-one and many-to-many markets.</description>

      <title>Scoring and Favoritism in Optimal Procurement Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study buyer-optimal procurement mechanisms when quality is contractible. When some costs are borne by every participant of a procurement auction regardless of winning, the classic analysis should be amended. We show that an optimal symmetric mechanism is a scoring auction with a score function that may be either flatter or steeper than classically. This depends on the relative degrees of information asymmetry over the all-pay and winner-pay costs.
  However, the symmetry of the optimal mechanism is not granted due to the presence of all-pay costs. When ex-post efficiency is less important than the duplication of costs, favoritism becomes optimal. We show that, depending on the degree of convexity of costs, the solution takes one of two novel formats with a partially asymmetric treatment of firms, which we call a score floor and a score ceiling auction. Interestingly, these auctions feature side payments from or to the buyer, which has nothing to do with corruption.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning, Collusion, and the Folk Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the behaviour emerging from learning agents repeatedly interacting strategically for a wide range of learning dynamics that includes projected gradient, replicator and log-barrier dynamics. Going beyond the better-understood classes of potential games and zero-sum games, we consider the setting of a general repeated game with finite recall, for different forms of monitoring. We obtain a Folk Theorem-like result and characterise the set of payoff vectors that can be obtained by these dynamics, discovering a wide range of possibilities for the emergence of algorithmic collusion.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Fads in a Changing World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how fads emerge under social learning in a changing environment. We consider a simple sequential social learning model where rational agents arrive in order, each acting only once, and the underlying unknown state constantly evolves. Each agent receives a private signal, observes all past actions of others, and chooses an action to match the current state. Because the state changes over time, cascades cannot last forever, and actions also fluctuate. We show that despite the rise of temporary information cascades, in the long run, actions change more often than the state. This result provides a theoretical foundation for faddish behavior in which people often change their actions more frequently than necessary.</description>

      <title>Competition, Persuasion, and Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An agent engages in sequential search. He does not directly observe the quality of the goods he samples, but he can purchase signals designed by profit maximizing principal(s). We formulate the principal-agent relationship as a repeated contracting problem within a stopping game and characterize the set of equilibrium payoffs. We show that when the agent's search cost falls below a given threshold, competition does not impact how much surplus is generated in equilibrium nor how the surplus is divided. In contrast, competition benefits the agent at the expense of total surplus when the search cost exceeds that threshold. Our results challenge the view that monopoly decreases market efficiency, and moreover, suggest that it generates the highest value of information for the agent.</description>

      <title>Equitable Core Imputations via a New Adaptation of The Primal-Dual Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classic paper of Shapley and Shubik \cite{Shapley1971assignment} characterized the core of the assignment game. We observe that a sub-coalition consisting of one player (or a set of players from the same side of the bipartition) can make zero profit, and therefore its profit under a core imputation can be an arbitrary amount. Hence an arbitrary core imputation makes {\em no fairness guarantee at the level of individual agents}. Can this deficiency be addressed by picking a ``good'' core imputation?
  To arrive at an appropriate solution concept, we give specific criteria for picking a special core imputation, and we undertake a detailed comparison of four solution concepts. Leximin and leximax core imputations come out as clear winners; we define these to be {\em equitable core imputations}. These imputations achieve ``fairness'' in different ways: whereas leximin tries to make poor agents more rich, leximax tries to make rich agents less rich.
  We give combinatorial strongly polynomial algorithms for computing these imputations via a novel adaptation of the classical primal-dual paradigm. It will not be surprising if our work leads to new uses of this powerful technique. Additionally, we expect more work on computing the leximin and leximax core imputations of other natural games, in addition to the recent follow-up work \cite{Leximin-max}.</description>
