      <title>Characterizing the Reliability of a Novel Upright CT for Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate reliability of upright CT for proton dose calculation and feasibility of a simplified phantom configuration for accelerated routine QA. Methods: A calibration phantom was scanned on an upright CT following consensus guidelines for 14 sessions/7 months. CT number repeatability was assessed by standard deviation (SD). Stopping power ratio (SPR) look-up table was derived. Phantom size dependency was assessed. The simplified phantom configuration was scanned for 15 sessions/8 months. Repeatability was assessed. CT numbers and SPR were compared with consensus configuration. Both configurations were scanned on a recumbent CT to validate the findings. An anthropomorphic phantom was scanned on upright and recumbent CT. Targets were drawn mimicking spine and prostate tumor. Proton plans were developed using pencil beam scanning techniques and robust optimization. Equivalence of dose calculation were assessed via controlled comparisons. Results: Simplified configuration measured all CT numbers in 1 scan vs 5 for consensus guidelines. Upright CT demonstrated excellent longitudinal stability (inter- and intrasession SD &lt;4.9 HU and 1.6 HU, respectively). Size dependency was identified with significant (p&lt;.05) differences in CT numbers, propagated to $\Delta$SPR &lt;5.3%. Significant (p&lt;.05) differences were found comparing upright CT numbers measured by 2 configurations ($\Delta$SPR&lt;2.6%). Recumbent CT showed smaller $\Delta$SPR (&lt;0.7%). Both dosimetric comparison showed local differences (&lt;8% of prescription dose) while clinical equivalence was found with target coverage differences &lt;0.2% and gamma pass rates=100% at 3 mm/3% for all controlled comparison of different CT machines and phantom configurations. Conclusions: The upright CT demonstrated reliability to support adaptive proton therapy. The simplified configuration shows feasibility for rapid QA.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Magnetic Particle Imaging System Matrix Recovery Using a Vision Transformer with Residual Feature Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a hybrid deep learning framework, the Vision Transformer with Residual Feature Network (VRF-Net), for recovering high-resolution system matrices in Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI). MPI resolution often suffers from downsampling and coil sensitivity variations. VRF-Net addresses these challenges by combining transformer-based global attention with residual convolutional refinement, enabling recovery of both large-scale structures and fine details. To reflect realistic MPI conditions, the system matrix is degraded using a dual-stage downsampling strategy. Training employed paired-image super-resolution on the public Open MPI dataset and a simulated dataset incorporating variable coil sensitivity profiles. For system matrix recovery on the Open MPI dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 0.403, pSNR = 39.08 dB, and SSIM = 0.835 at 2x scaling, and maintained strong performance even at challenging scale 8x (pSNR = 31.06 dB, SSIM = 0.717). For the simulated dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 4.44, pSNR = 28.52 dB, and SSIM = 0.771 at 2x scaling, with stable performance at higher scales. On average, it reduced nRMSE by 88.2%, increased pSNR by 44.7%, and improved SSIM by 34.3% over interpolation and CNN-based methods. In image reconstruction of Open MPI phantoms, VRF-Net further reduced reconstruction error to nRMSE = 1.79 at 2x scaling, while preserving structural fidelity (pSNR = 41.58 dB, SSIM = 0.960), outperforming existing methods. These findings demonstrate that VRF-Net enables sharper, artifact-free system matrix recovery and robust image reconstruction across multiple scales, offering a promising direction for future in vivo applications.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Risk Assessment in Radiation Oncology via LLM-Powered Root Cause Analysis of Incident Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Modern large language models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning that converts narratives into structured, taxonomy-aligned data, revealing patterns across planning, delivery, and verification. Embedded as agentic tools, LLMs can assist root-cause analysis and risk assessment (e.g., failure mode and effect analysis FMEA), produce auditable rationales, and draft targeted mitigation actions.
  Methods: We developed a data-driven pipeline utilizing an LLM to perform automated root cause analysis on 254 institutional safety incidents. The LLM systematically classified each incident into structured taxonomies for radiotherapy pathway steps and contributory factors. Subsequent quantitative analyses included descriptive statistics, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), multiple Ordinal Logistic Regression (OLR) analyses to identify predictors of event severity, and Association Rule Mining (ARM) to uncover systemic vulnerabilities.
  Results: The high-level Ordinal Logistic Regression (OLR) models identified specific, significant drivers of severity. The Pathway model was statistically significant (Pseudo R2 = 0.033, LR p = 0.015), as was the Responsibility model (Pseudo R2 = 0.028, LR p &lt; 0.001). Association Rule Mining (ARM) identified high-confidence systemic rules, such as "CF5 Teamwork, management and organisational" (n = 8, Conf = 1.0) and the high-frequency link between "(11) Pre-treatment planning process" and "CF2 Procedural" (n = 152, Conf = 0.916).
  Conclusion: The LLM-powered, data-driven framework provides a more objective and powerful methodology for risk assessment than traditional approaches. Our findings empirically demonstrate that interventions focused on fortifying high-risk process steps and mitigating systemic failures are most effective for improving patient safety.</description>

      <title>Towards Continuous-variable Quantum Neural Networks for Biomedical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-variable (CV) quantum computing offers a promising framework for scalable quantum machine learning, leveraging optical systems with infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. While discrete-variable (DV) quantum neural networks have shown remarkable progress in various computer vision tasks, CV quantum models remain comparatively underexplored. In this work, we present a feasibility study of continuous-variable quantum neural networks (CV-QCNNs) applied to biomedical image classification. Utilizing photonic circuit simulation frameworks, we construct CV quantum circuits composed of Gaussian gates, such as displacement, squeezing, rotation, and beamsplitters to emulate convolutional behavior. Our experiments are conducted on the MedMNIST dataset collection, a set of annotated medical image benchmarks for multiple diagnostic tasks. We evaluate CV-QCNN's performance in terms of classification accuracy, model expressiveness, and resilience to Gaussian noise, comparing against classical CNNs and equivalent DV quantum circuits. This study aims to identify trade-offs between DV and CV paradigms for quantum-enhanced medical imaging. Our results highlight the potential of continuous-variable models and their viability for future computer-aided diagnosis systems.</description>

      <title>Large-scale automatic carbon ion treatment planning for head and neck cancers via parallel multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) planning is difficult because multiple critical organs-at-risk (OARs) are close to complex targets. Intensity-modulated carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but remains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading to laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many treatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are limited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We propose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45 TPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE) QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for stable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance efficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2) apply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to uniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed piecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker system interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and accelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10 testing), the method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans comparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score: RL $85.93\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\pm6.92%$), with significant (p-value $&lt;$ 0.05) improvements for five OARs. The framework efficiently explores high-dimensional TPP spaces and generates clinically competitive IMCT plans through direct TPS interaction, notably improving OAR sparing.</description>

      <title>Production of High-Specific-Activity Radioisotopes Using High-Energy Fusion Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that transmutation driven by high-energy neutrons from deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion can produce many medically important radioisotopes-including $^{99}$Mo/${}^{99\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Tc}$, $^{131}$I, $^{177}$Lu, $^{153}$Sm, $^{111}$In, $^{133}$Xe, $^{32}$P, $^{64}$Cu, $^{60}$Co, $^{103}$Pd, $^{89}$Sr, $^{188}$Re, $^{117}$In/$^{117\mathrm{m}1}$Sn, $^{90}$Y, and $^{166}$Ho - and emerging isotopes such as $^{161}$Tb, $^{195\mathrm{m}1}$Ir/$^{195\mathrm{m}}$Pt, $^{47}$Sc, ${}^{103}\mathrm{Ru}/{}^{103\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Rh}$, ${}^{103}\mathrm{Pd}/{}^{103\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Rh}$, and $^{119}$Sb with high specific activity and in large quantities. These reactions involve stable, abundant feedstocks and non-fission transmutation channels that change the proton number, enabling chemical rather than isotopic separation. Fusion-based transmutation could provide a flexible and proliferation-resistant platform for supply of high-purity isotopes. A D-T neutron source operating at a few megawatts of fusion power could meet or exceed global demand for most major radioisotopes. Further research is required to develop tailored approaches for feedstock processing and product extraction.</description>

      <title>Prior-Adapted Progressive Time-Resolved CBCT Reconstruction Using a Dynamic Reconstruction and Motion Estimation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) provides on-board volumetric anatomy for image guidance and treatment adaptation in radiotherapy. To compensate for respiration-induced anatomical motion, time-resolved CBCT is highly desired to capture the spatiotemporal anatomical variations but faces challenges in accuracy and efficiency due to substantial optimization needed in image reconstruction and motion modeling. We proposed a fast time-resolved CBCT reconstruction framework, based on a dynamic reconstruction and motion estimation method with new reconstructions initialized and conditioned on prior reconstructions in an adaptive fashion (DREME-adapt). DREME-adapt reconstructs a time-resolved CBCT sequence from a fractional standard CBCT scan while simultaneously generating a machine learning-based motion model that allows single-projection-driven intra-treatment CBCT estimation and motion tracking. Via DREME-adapt, a virtual fraction is generated from a pre-treatment 4D-CT set of each patient for a clean, 'cold-start' reconstruction. For subsequent fractions of the same patient, DREME-adapt uses pre-derived motion models and reference CBCTs as initializations to drive a 'warm-start' reconstruction, based on a lower-cost refining strategy. Three strategies: DREME-cs which drops the 'warm-start' component, DREME-adapt-vfx which uses a fixed initialization (virtual fraction's reconstruction results), and DREME-adapt-pro which initialize reconstructions through a progressive daisy chain scheme (virtual fraction for fraction 1, fraction 1 for fraction 2, and so on), were evaluated on a digital phantom study and a patient study. DREME-adapt allows fast and accurate time-resolved CBCT reconstruction and enhances the clinical adoption potential of the DREME framework.</description>
