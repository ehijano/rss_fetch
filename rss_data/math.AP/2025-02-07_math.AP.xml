      <title>Inviscid limit on $L^p$-based Sobolev conormal spaces for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations with the Navier boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish uniform bounds and the inviscid limit in $L^p$-based Sobolev conormal spaces for the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with the Navier boundary conditions in the half-space. We extend the vanishing viscosity results of~\cite{BdVC1} and~\cite{AK1} by weakening the normal and the conormal regularity assumptions, respectively. We require the initial data to be Lipschitz with three integrable conormal derivatives. We also assume that the initial normal derivative has one or two integrable conormal derivative depending on the sign of the friction coefficient. Finally, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the Euler equations with a bounded normal derivate, two bounded conormal derivatives, and three integrable conormal derivatives.</description>

      <title>The Lagrangian approach to the compressible primitive equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops the hydrostatic Lagrangian approach to the compressible primitive equations. A fundamental aspect in the analysis is the investigation of the compressible hydrostatic Lam\'{e} and Stokes operators. Local strong well-posedness for large data and global strong well-posedness for small data are established under various assumptions on the pressure law, both in the presence and absence of gravity.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet Problem for elliptic equations with singular drift terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish $L^p$ solvability of the Dirichlet problem, for some finite $p$, in a 1-sided chord-arc domain $\Omega$ (i.e., a uniform domain with Ahlfors-David regular boundary), for elliptic equations of the form \[ Lu=-\text{div}(A\nabla u) + {\bf B}\cdot \nabla u=:L_0 u+ {\bf B}\cdot \nabla u=0, \] given that the analogous result holds (typically with a different value of $p$) for the homogeneous second order operator $L_0$. Essentially, we assume that $|{\bf B}(X)|\lesssim \text{dist}(X,\partial \Omega)^{-1}$, and that $|{\bf B}(X)|^2\text{dist}(X,\partial \Omega) dX$ is a Carleson measure in $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Least energy solutions of two asymptotically cubic Kirchhoff equations on locally finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of least energy solutions for two Kirchhoff equations with the asymptotically cubic nonlinearity $f(u)=\lambda u+\eta|u|^2u$ on a locally weighted and connected finite graph $G=(V,E)$. Such nonlinearity satisfies neither $\frac{F(u)}{u^4}\to +\infty$ as $|u|\to\infty$, where $F(u)=\int_0^uf(s)ds$, nor $\frac{f(u)}{u}\to 0$ as $u\to 0$. By utilizing the constrained variational method, we prove that there exist $\lambda_1\ge 0$ and $\eta_0\ge 0$ ($\lambda_1^*\ge 0$ and $\eta_0^*\ge 0$) such that these two equations have at least a least energy solution if $|\lambda|&lt;a\lambda_1$ ($|\lambda|&lt;a\lambda_1^*$) and $\eta&gt;\eta_0$ ($\eta&gt;\eta_0^*$).</description>

      <title>The Global Existence and Uniqueness of Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Higgs Equation in (2+1) Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the global existence and uniqueness of classical solutions of the Maxwell-Chern-Simmons-Higgs system coupled to a neutral scalar with nontrivial scalar potential on (2+1) dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Our methods rely only on classical existence theorems, including energy estimates, the Sobolev inequality, and the choice of the Coulomb gauge condition. The equations are well-posed for finite initial data and the solution preserves any additional $H^{s}$ regularity for $s&gt;0$ in the data.</description>

      <title>Existence and stability of various models describing behaviour of the thermoviscoelastic-rate type fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscoelastic rate-type fluid models are used to describe the behaviour of many complex materials from engineering up to application in biomaterials and medicine. A classical model that belongs to the category of viscoelastic rate-type fluid models is the Giesekus model. Furthermore, in all these applications, the heat conduction frequently takes place and all material coefficients depend heavily on the temperature, and therefore, we introduce here a thermodynamically compatible model for viscoelastic rate-type and heat-conducting fluid for which we show the existence of global weak solution in two-dimensional setting whenever the initial energy and entropy are controlled in natural norms.</description>

      <title>Exact controllability of anisotropic 1D partial differential equations in spaces of analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove a local controllability result for a general class of 1D partial differential equations on the interval $(0,1)$. The PDEs we consider take the form $\partial_t^N y=\zeta_M \partial_{x}^{M}y+f(x , y , \partial_{x} y,\ldots, \partial_x^{M-1} y)$ where $1\le N &lt; M$, $\zeta_M\in \mathbb{C} ^*$, and $f$ is some linear or nonlinear term of lower order. In this context, we prove a local controllability result between states that are analytic functions. If some boundary conditions are prescribed, a similar local controllability result holds between analytic functions satisfying some compatibility conditions that are natural for the existence of smooth solutions of the considered PDE. The proof is performed by studying a nonlinear Cauchy problem in the spatial variable with data in some spaces of Gevrey functions and by investigating the relationship between the jet of space derivatives and the jet of time derivatives. We give various examples of applications, including the (good and bad) Boussinesq equation, the Ginzburg-Landau equation, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the Korteweg-de Vries equation.</description>

      <title>Runge type approximation results for spaces of smooth Whitney jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Runge type approximation results for linear partial differential operators with constant coefficients on spaces of smooth Whitney jets. Among others, we characterize when for a constant coefficient linear partial differential operator $P(D)$ and for closed subsets $F_1\subset F_2$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ the restrictions to $F_1$ of smooth Whitney jets $f$ on $F_2$ satisfying $P(D)f=0$ on $F_2$ are dense in the space of smooth Whitney jets on $F_1$ satisfying the same partial differential equation on $F_1$. For elliptic operators we give a geometric evaluation of this characterization. Additionally, for differential operators with a single characteristic direction, like parabolic operators, we give a sufficient geometric condition for the above density to hold. Under mild additional assumptions on $\partial F_1$ and for $F_2=\mathbb{R}^d$ this sufficient conditions is also necessary. As an application of our work, we characterize those open subsets $\Omega$ of the complex plane satisfying $\Omega=\operatorname{int}\overline{\Omega}$ for which the set of holomorphic polynomials are dense in $A^\infty(\Omega)$, under the mild additional hypothesis that $\overline{\Omega}$ satisfies the strong regularity condition. Furthermore, for the wave operator in one spatial variable, a simple sufficient geometric condition on $F_1, F_2\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is given for the above density to hold. For the special case of $F_2=\mathbb{R}^2$ this sufficient condition is also necessary under mild additional hypotheses on $F_1$.</description>

      <title>Beyond uniqueness: Relaxation calculus of junction conditions for coercive Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A junction is a particular network given by the collection of $N\ge 1$ half lines $[0,+\infty)$ glued together at the origin. On such a junction, we consider evolutive Hamilton-Jacobi equations with $N$ coercive Hamiltonians. Furthermore,we consider a general desired junction condition at the origin, given by some monotone function $F_0:\R^N\to \R$.There is existence and uniqueness of solutions which only satisfy weakly the junction condition (at the origin, they satisfy either the desired junction condition or the PDE).We show that those solutions satisfy strongly a relaxed junction condition $\frak R F_0$ (that we can recognize as an effective junction condition). It is remarkable that this relaxed condition can be computed in three different but equivalent  ways: 1) using viscosity inequalities, 2) using Godunov fluxes, 3) using Riemann problems.Our result goes beyond uniqueness theory, in the following sense:  solutions to two different desired junction conditions $F_0$ and $F_1$ do coincide if $\frak R F_0=\frak R F_1$.</description>

      <title>Feedback stabilization for a spatial-dependent Sterile Insect Technique model with Allee Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on feedback control strategies for applying the sterile insect technique (SIT) to eliminate pest populations. The presentation is centered on the case of mosquito populations, but most of the results can be extended to other species by adapting the model and selecting appropriate parameter values to describe the reproduction and movement dynamics of the species under consideration. In our study, we address the spatial distribution of the population in a two dimensional bounded domain by extending the temporal SIT model analyzed in [2], thereby obtaining a reaction-diffusion SIT model. After the analysis of the existence and the uniqueness of the solution of this problem, we construct a feedback law that globally asymptotically stabilizes the extinction equilibrium thus yielding a robust strategy to keep the pest population at very low levels in the long term.</description>

      <title>Finite time blow-up for a nonlinear parabolic equation with smooth coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider an n-dimensional parabolic partial differential equation with a smooth coefficient term in the nonlinear gradient term. This equation was first introduced and analyzed in [E. Issoglio, On a non-linear transport-diffusion equation with distributional coefficients, Journal of Differential Equations, Volume 267, Issue 10 (2019)], where one of the main open questions is the possible finite-time blow-up of solutions. Here, leveraging a virial-type estimate, we provide a positive answer to this question within the framework of smooth solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the unconditional well-posedness result for fifth order modified KdV type equations in $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ when $s \geq 3/2$, which includes non-integrable cases. By the conservation laws, we also obtain the global well-posedness result when $s = 2$, which also includes non-integrable cases. The main idea is to employ the normal form reduction and a kind of cancellation properties to deal with the derivative losses.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity for nonlocal elliptic equations over Reifenberg flat domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove sharp boundary regularity of solutions to nonlocal elliptic equations arising from operators comparable to the fractional Laplacian over Reifenberg flat sets and with null exterior condition. More precisely, if the operator has order $2s$ then the solution is $C^{s-\varepsilon}$ regular for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$ provided the flatness parameter is small enough. The proof relies on an induction argument and its main ingredients are the construction of a suitable barrier and the comparison principle.</description>

      <title>Analysis for non-local phase transitions close to the critical exponent $s=\frac12$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the behaviour of double-well energies perturbed by fractional Gagliardo squared seminorms in $H^s$ close to the critical exponent $s=\frac12$. This is done by computing a scaling factor $\lambda(\varepsilon,s)$, continuous in both variables, such that \[ \mathcal{F}^{s_\varepsilon}_\varepsilon(u)=\frac{\lambda(\varepsilon,s_\varepsilon)}{\varepsilon}\int W(u)dt+\lambda(\varepsilon,s_\varepsilon)\varepsilon^{(2s_\varepsilon-1)^+}[u]_{H^{s_\varepsilon}}^2 \] $\Gamma$-converge, for any choice of $s_\varepsilon \to \frac12$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$, to the sharp-interface functional found by Alberti, Bouchitt\'e and Seppecher with the scaling ${|\log\varepsilon|^{-1}}$. Moreover, we prove that all the values $s\in [\frac12,1 )$ are regular points for the functional $\mathcal{F}^{s}_\varepsilon$ in the sense of equivalence by $\Gamma$-convergence introduced by Braides and Truskinovsky, and that the $\Gamma$-limits as $\varepsilon\to 0$ are continuous with respect to $s$. In particular, the corresponding surface tensions, given by suitable non-local optimal-profile problems, are continuous on $[\frac12,1)$.</description>

      <title>Lotka-Volterra-type kinetic equations for competing species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine a kinetic framework for modeling the time evolution of size distribution densities of two populations governed by predator-prey interactions. The model builds upon the classical Boltzmann-type equations, where the dynamics arise from elementary binary interactions between the populations. The model uniquely incorporates a linear redistribution operator to quantify the birth rates in both populations, inspired by wealth redistribution operators. We prove that, under a suitable scaling regime, the Boltzmann formulation transitions to a system of coupled Fokker-Planck-type equations. These equations describe the evolution of the distribution densities and link the macroscopic dynamics of their mean values to a Lotka-Volterra system of ordinary differential equations, with parameters explicitly derived from the microscopic interaction rules. We then determine the local equilibria of the Fokker-Planck system, which are Gamma-type densities, and investigate the problem of relaxation of its solutions toward these kinetic equilibria, in terms of their moments' dynamics. The results establish a bridge between kinetic modeling and classical population dynamics, offering a multiscale perspective on predator-prey systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the nonlocal Cahn Hilliard Brinkman system, which models the phase separation of a binary fluid in a bounded domain and porous media. We focus on a system with a singular potential namely logarithmic form and a degenerate mobility function. The singular potential introduces challenges due to the blow up of its derivatives near pure phases, while the degenerate mobility complicates the analysis. Our main result is the separation property, which ensures that the solution eventually stays away from the pure phases. We adopt a new method, inspired by the De Giorgi iteration, introduced for the two dimensional Cahn Hilliard equation with constant mobility. This work extends previous results and provides a general approach for proving the separation property for similar systems.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Euclidean 3-ball under L2-curvature pinching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider compact Riemannian 3-manifolds with boundary. We prove that if the $L^2$-norm of the curvature is small and if the $H^{1/2}$-norm of the difference of the fundamental forms of the boundary is small, then the manifold is diffeomorphic to the Euclidean ball. Moreover, we obtain that the manifold and the ball are metrically close (uniformly and in $H^2$-norm), with a quantitative, optimal bound. The required smallness assumption only depends on the volumes of the manifold and its boundary and on a trace and Sobolev constant of the manifold. The proof only relies on elementary computations based on the Bochner formula for harmonic functions and tensors, and on the 2-spheres effective uniformisation result of Klainerman-Szeftel.</description>

Abstract: We study the light ray transform acting on tensors on a stationary Lorentzian manifold. Our main result is injectivity up to the natural obstruction as long as the associated magnetic vector field satisfies a finite degree property with respect to the vertical Fourier decomposition on the unit tangent bundle. This is based on an explicit relationship between the geodesic vector field of the Lorentzian manifold and the magnetic vector field.</description>

      <title>Consistency of augmentation graph and network approximability in contrastive learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning leverages data augmentation to develop feature representation without relying on large labeled datasets. However, despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of contrastive learning remain incomplete, with many essential guarantees left unaddressed, particularly the realizability assumption concerning neural approximability of an optimal spectral contrastive loss solution. In this work, we overcome these limitations by analyzing the pointwise and spectral consistency of the augmentation graph Laplacian. We establish that, under specific conditions for data generation and graph connectivity, as the augmented dataset size increases, the augmentation graph Laplacian converges to a weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator on the natural data manifold. These consistency results ensure that the graph Laplacian spectrum effectively captures the manifold geometry. Consequently, they give way to a robust framework for establishing neural approximability, directly resolving the realizability assumption in a current paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.00321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model for elastic dislocations in geophysics. We model a portion of the Earth's crust as a bounded, inhomogeneous elastic body with a buried fault surface, along which slip occurs. We prove well-posedness of the resulting mixed-boundary-value-transmission problem, assuming only bounded elastic moduli. We establish uniqueness in the inverse problem of determining the fault surface and the slip from a unique measurement of the displacement on an open patch at the surface, assuming in addition that the Earth's crust is an isotropic, layered medium with Lam\'e coefficients piecewise Lipschitz on a known partition and that the fault surface is a graph with respect to an arbitrary coordinate system. These results substantially extend those of the authors in {Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal.} {\bf 263} (2020), n. 1, 71--111.</description>

      <title>Stability in Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequalities: flows, regularity and the entropy method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.03674v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to establish a quantitative and constructive stability result for a class of subcritical Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequalities which interpolates between the logarithmic Sobolev inequality and the standard Sobolev inequality (in dimension larger than three), or Onofri's inequality in dimension two. We develop a new strategy, in which the flow of the fast diffusion equation is used as a tool: a stability result in the inequality is equivalent to an improved rate of convergence to equilibrium for the flow. The regularity properties of the parabolic flow allow us to connect an improved entropy - entropy production inequality during an initial time layer to spectral properties of a suitable linearized problem which is relevant for the asymptotic time layer. Altogether, the stability in the inequalities is measured by a deficit which controls in strong norms (a Fisher information which can be interpreted as a generalized Heisenberg uncertainty principle) the distance to the manifold of optimal functions. The method is constructive and, for the first time, quantitative estimates of the stability constant are obtained, including in the critical case of Sobolev's inequality. To build the estimates, we establish a quantitative global Harnack principle and perform a detailed analysis of large time asymptotics by entropy methods.</description>

Abstract: We consider obstacle problems for the Willmore functional in the class of graphs of functions and surfaces of revolution with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We prove the existence of minimisers of the obstacle problems under the assumption that the Willmore energy with the unilateral constraint is below a universal bound. We address the question whether such bounds are necessary in order to ensure the solvability of the obstacle problems. Moreover, we give several instructive examples of obstacles such that minimisers exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the multiscale viscoelastic Doi model for suspensions of Brownian rigid rod-like particles, as well as its generalization by Saintillan and Shelley for self-propelled particles. We consider the regime of a small Weissenberg number, which corresponds to a fast rotational diffusion compared to the fluid velocity gradient, and we analyze the resulting hydrodynamic approximation. More precisely, we show the asymptotic validity of macroscopic nonlinear viscoelastic models, in form of so-called ordered fluid models, as an expansion in the Weissenberg number. The result holds for zero Reynolds number in 3D and for arbitrary Reynolds number in 2D. Along the way, we establish several new well-posedness and regularity results for nonlinear fluid models, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the large-time behavior of global energy class ($H^1$) solutions of the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a general localized potential term and a defocusing nonlinear term. By using a new type of interaction Morawetz estimate localized to an exterior region, we prove that these solutions decompose into a free wave and a weakly localized part which is asymptotically orthogonal to any fixed free wave. We further show that the $L^2$ norm of this weakly localized part is concentrated in the region $|x| \leq t^{1/2+}$, and that the energy ($\dot{H}^1$) norm is concentrated in $|x| \leq t^{1/3+}$. Our results hold for solutions with arbitrarily large initial data.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for a novel nonlocal model for cell-cell adhesion via receptor binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local well-posedness is established for a highly nonlocal nonlinear diffusion-adhesion system for bounded initial values with small support. Macroscopic systems of this kind were previously obtained by the authors through upscaling in [32] and can account for the effect of microscopic receptor binding dynamics in cell-cell adhesion. The system analysed here couples an integro-PDE featuring degenerate diffusion of the porous media type and nonlocal adhesion with a novel nonlinear integral equation. The approach is based on decoupling the system and using Banach's fixed point theorem to solve each of the two equations individually and subsequently the entire system. The main challenge of the implementation lies in selecting a suitable framework. One of the key results is the local well-posedness for the integral equation with a Radon measure as a parameter. The analysis of this equation utilizes the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, marking the first application of this norm in handling a nonlinear integral equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the semilinear wave equation with a power nonlinearity in the radial case. Given $r_0&gt;0$, we construct a blow-up solution such that the solution near $(r_0,T(r_0))$ converges exponentially to a soliton. Moreover, we show that $r_0$ is a non-characteristic point. For that, we translate the question in self-similar variables and use a modulation technique. We will also use energy estimates from the one dimensional case treated by Merle and Zaag in 2007. Of course because of the radial setting, we have an additional gradient term which is delicate to handle. That's precisely the purpose of our paper.</description>

Abstract: We study obstacle problems governed by two distinct types of diffusion operators involving interacting free boundaries. We obtain a somewhat surprising coupling property, leading to a comprehensive analysis of the free boundary. More precisely, we show that near regular points of a coordinate function, the free boundary is analytic, whereas singular points lie on a smooth manifold. Additionally, we prove that uncoupled free boundary points are singular, indicating that regular points lie exclusively on the coupled free boundary. Furthermore, optimal regularity, non-degeneracy, and lower dimensional Hausdorff measure estimates are obtained. Explicit examples illustrate the sharpness of assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove conditional weak-strong uniqueness of the potential Euler solution for external flow around a smooth body in three space dimensions, within the class of viscosity weak solutions with the same initial data. Our sufficient condition is the vanishing of the streamwise component of the skin friction in the inviscid limit, somewhat weaker than the condition of Bardos-Titi in bounded domains. Because global-in-time existence of the smooth potential solution leads back to the d'Alembert paradox, we argue that weak-strong uniqueness is not a valid criterion for "relevant" notions of generalized Euler solution and that our condition is likely to be violated in the inviscid limit. We prove also that the Drivas-Nguyen condition on uniform continuity at the wall of the normal velocity component implies weak-strong uniqueness within the general class of admissible weak Euler solutions in bounded domains.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold whose anticanonical cohomology class is semipositive. Let $L$ be a big and semi-ample line bundle on $X$ and $\alpha$ be the Chern class of $L$. We give a sufficient condition ensuring that the solution of the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations in $\alpha$ with $L^p$ right-hand side ($p&gt;1$) is $\log^M$-continuous for every constant $M&gt;0$. As an application, we show that every singular Ricci-flat metric in a semi-ample integral class in a projective Calabi-Yau surface $X$ is globally $\log^M$-continuous with respect to a smooth metric on $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unify the variational hypocoercivity framework established by D. Albritton, S. Armstrong, J.-C. Mourrat, and M. Novack, with the notion of second-order lifts of reversible diffusion processes, recently introduced by A. Eberle and F. L\"orler. We give an abstract, yet fully constructive, presentation of the theory, so that it can be applied to a large class of linear kinetic equations. As this hypocoercivity technique does not twist the reference norm, we can recover accurate and sharp convergence rates in various models. Among those, adaptive Langevin dynamics (ALD) is discussed in full detail and we show that for near-quadratic potentials, with suitable choices of parameters, it is a near-optimal second-order lift of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. As a further consequence, we observe that the Generalised Langevin Equation (GLE) is a also a second-order lift, as the standard (kinetic) Langevin dynamics are, of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. Then, convergence of (GLE) cannot exceed ballistic speed, i.e. the square root of the rate of the overdamped regime. We illustrate this phenomenon with explicit computations in a benchmark Gaussian case.</description>
