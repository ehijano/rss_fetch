      <title>Integrating Uncertainty Quantification into Computational Fluid Dynamics Models of Coronary Arteries Under Steady Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational models are continuously integrated in the clinical space, where they support clinicians in disease diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention strategies. While assisting in clinical space, these computational models frequently use deterministic approaches, where the inherent (aleatoric) variability of input parameters is ignored. This questions the credibility and often hinders the clinical adoption of these computational models. Therefore, in this study, we introduced uncertainty quantification in the computational fluid dynamics models of the left main coronary artery to analyze the influence of input hemodynamics parameters on wall shear stress (WSS). UncertainSCI was used, where an emulator was built using polynomial chaos expansion between the input parameters and the output quantity of interest, and the output sensitivities and statistics were directly extracted from the emulator. The uncertainty-informed framework was first applied to an analytical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation (Poiseuille flow) and then to a patient-specific model of the left main coronary artery. Different input hemodynamics parameters are considered, such as pressure, viscosity, density, velocity, and radius, whereas wall shear stress was considered as our output quantity of interest. The results suggest that velocity dominated the variability in WSS in the analytical model (~79%), whereas viscosity dominated in the patient-specific model (~59%). The results further suggest that out of all the Sobol indices interactions, unary interactions were the most dominant ones, contributing ~93.2% and ~99% for the analytical and patient-specific model, respectively. This study will enhance confidence in computational models, facilitating their adoption in the clinical space to improve decision-making for coronary artery disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <title>Mastering Preclinical Fast MRSI: From Setup to Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MR experiments are essential for studying brain metabolism, yet preclinical 1H-MRSI remains underdeveloped, with significant limitations in SNR, acquisition speed, and automated data processing. Although recent advances-such as accelerated sequences, denoising strategies, and ultra-high-field systems-have begun to reduce these barriers, preclinical MRSI still lags far behind the human research field in accessibility and routine use. Based on our expertise, we have created this guide that outlines a complete workflow for acquiring and analyzing high-quality fast MRSI data in rodent brains at ultra-high fields (9.4T and 14.1T), enabling novice users to perform reliable experiments using optimized MRSI sequences (FID-MRSI, SE-MRSI, and PRESS-MRSI) and standardized processing pipelines, while also highlighting strategies to further improve acquisition speed, coverage, and reproducibility. Overall, this paper provides a strong foundation for future methodological advances that will expand metabolic imaging capabilities and deepen insights into brain function and disease.</description>

      <title>CTorch: PyTorch-Compatible GPU-Accelerated Auto-Differentiable Projector Toolbox for Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16741v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces CTorch, a PyTorch-compatible, GPU-accelerated, and auto-differentiable projector toolbox designed to handle various CT geometries with configurable projector algorithms. CTorch provides flexible scanner geometry definition, supporting 2D fan-beam, 3D circular cone-beam, and 3D non-circular cone-beam geometries. Each geometry allows view-specific definitions to accommodate variations during scanning. Both flat- and curved-detector models may be specified to accommodate various clinical devices. CTorch implements four projector algorithms: voxel-driven, ray-driven, distance-driven (DD), and separable footprint (SF), allowing users to balance accuracy and computational efficiency based on their needs. All the projectors are primarily built using CUDA C for GPU acceleration, then compiled as Python-callable functions, and wrapped as PyTorch network module. This design allows direct use of PyTorch tensors, enabling seamless integration into PyTorch's auto-differentiation framework. These features make CTorch an flexible and efficient tool for CT imaging research, with potential applications in accurate CT simulations, efficient iterative reconstruction, and advanced deep-learning-based CT reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Noise Characterization and Suppression in Low-Field MRI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Low-field MRI systems operate at single MHz-range frequencies, where signal losses are primarily dominated by thermal noise from the radio-frequency (RF) receive coils. Achieving operation close to this limit is essential for maximizing imaging performance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, electromagnetic interference (EMI) from cabling, electronics, and patient loading often degrades system performance. Our goal is to develop and validate a practical protocol that guides users in identifying and suppressing electromagnetic noise in low-field MRI systems, enabling operation near the thermal noise limit.
  Methods: We present a systematic, stepwise methodology that includes diagnostic measurements, hardware isolation strategies, and good practices for cabling and shielding. Each step is validated with corresponding noise measurements under increasingly complex system configurations, both unloaded and with a human subject present.
  Results: Noise levels were monitored through the incremental assembly of a low-field MRI system, revealing key sources of EMI and quantifying their impact. Final configurations achieved noise within 1.5x the theoretical thermal bound with a subject in the scanner. Image reconstructions illustrate the direct relationship between system noise and image quality.
  Conclusion: The proposed protocol enables low-field MRI systems to operate close to fundamental noise limits in realistic conditions. The framework also provides actionable guidance for the integration of additional system components, such as gradient drivers and automatic tuning networks, without compromising SNR.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of literature T1 mapping methods to the underlying magnetization transfer parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Magnetization transfer (MT) has been identified as the principal source of $T_1$ variability in the MRI literature. This study assesses the sensitivity of established $T_1$ mapping techniques to variations in the underlying MT parameters.
  Methods: For each $T_1$-mapping method, the observed $T_1$ was simulated as a function of the underlying MT parameters $p_i^\text{MT}$, corresponding to different brain regions of interest (ROIs) at 3T. As measures of sensitivity, the derivatives $\partial T_1^\text{observed} / \partial p_i^\text{MT}$ were computed and analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model as a function of $p_i^\text{MT}$, ROI, pulse sequence type (e.g., inversion recovery, variable flip angle), and the individual sequences.
  Results: The analyzed $T_1$-mapping sequences have a considerable sensitivity to changes in the semi-solid spin pool size $m_0^\text{s}$, $T_1^\text{f}$ of the free, $T_1^\text{s}$ of the semi-solid spin pool, and the (inverse) exchange rate $T_\text{x}$. All derivatives vary considerably with the underlying MT parameters and between pulse sequences. In general, the derivatives cannot be determined by the sequence type, but rather depend on the implementation details of the sequence. One notable exception is that variable-flip-angle methods are, in general, more sensitive to the exchange rate than inversion-recovery methods.
  Conclusion: Variations in the observed $T_1$ can be caused by several underlying MT parameters, and the sensitivity to each parameter depends on both the underlying MT parameters and the sequence.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale tissue properties and electric fields in brain stimulation -- bridging the macroscopic and microscopic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16465v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.</description>
