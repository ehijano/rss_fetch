      <title>The Shape of Markets: Machine learning modeling and Prediction Using 2-Manifold Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Geometry Informed Model for financial forecasting by embedding high dimensional market data onto constant curvature 2manifolds. Guided by the uniformization theorem, we model market dynamics as Brownian motion on spherical S2, Euclidean R2, and hyperbolic H2 geometries. We further include the torus T, a compact, flat manifold admissible as a quotient space of the Euclidean plane anticipating its relevance for capturing cyclical dynamics. Manifold learning techniques infer the latent curvature from financial data, revealing the torus as the best performing geometry. We interpret this result through a macroeconomic lens, the torus circular dimensions align with endogenous cycles in output, interest rates, and inflation described by IS LM theory. Our findings demonstrate the value of integrating differential geometry with data-driven inference for financial modeling.</description>

      <title>From sectorial coarse graining to extreme coarse graining of S&amp;P 500 correlation matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the Pearson Correlation Matrix of stock returns and from the desire to obtain a reduced number of parameters relevant for the dynamics of a financial market, we propose to take the idea of a sectorial matrix, which would have a large number of parameters, to the reduced picture of a real symmetric $2 \times 2$ matrix, extreme case, that still conserves the desirable feature that the average correlation can be one of the parameters. This is achieved by averaging the correlation matrix over blocks created by choosing two subsets of stocks for rows and columns and averaging over each of the resulting blocks. Averaging over these blocks, we retain the average of the correlation matrix. We shall use a random selection for two equal block sizes as well as two specific, hopefully relevant, ones that do not produce equal block sizes. The results show that one of the non-random choices has somewhat different properties, whose meaning will have to be analyzed from an economy point of view.</description>

      <title>Insights into Tail-Based and Order Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy-tailed phenomena appear across diverse domains --from wealth and firm sizes in economics to network traffic, biological systems, and physical processes-- characterized by the disproportionate influence of extreme values. These distributions challenge classical statistical models, as their tails decay too slowly for conventional approximations to hold. Among their key descriptive measures are quantile contributions, which quantify the proportion of a total quantity (such as income, energy, or risk) attributed to observations above a given quantile threshold. This paper presents a theoretical study of the quantile contribution statistic and its relationship with order statistics. We derive a closed-form expression for the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) of order statistics and, based on it, obtain an explicit CDF for quantile contributions applicable to small samples. We then investigate the asymptotic behavior of these contributions as the sample size increases, establishing the asymptotic normality of the numerator and characterizing the limiting distribution of the quantile contribution. Finally, simulation studies illustrate the convergence properties and empirical accuracy of the theoretical results, providing a foundation for applying quantile contributions in the analysis of heavy-tailed data.</description>

      <title>RNN(p) for Power Consumption Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An elementary Recurrent Neural Network that operates on p time lags, called an RNN(p), is the natural generalisation of a linear autoregressive model ARX(p). It is a powerful forecasting tool for variables displaying inherent seasonal patterns across multiple time scales, as is often observed in energy, economic, and financial time series. The architecture of RNN(p) models, characterised by structured feedbacks across time lags, enables the design of efficient training strategies. We conduct a comparative study of learning algorithms for these models, providing a rigorous analysis of their computational complexity and training performance. We present two applications of RNN(p) models in power consumption forecasting, a key domain within the energy sector where accurate forecasts inform both operational and financial decisions. Experimental results show that RNN(p) models achieve excellent forecasting accuracy while maintaining a high degree of interpretability. These features make them well-suited for decision-making in energy markets and other fintech applications where reliable predictions play a significant economic role.</description>
