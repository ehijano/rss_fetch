      <title>Observability and State Estimation for Smooth and Nonsmooth Differential Algebraic Equation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the sensitivity-based rank condition (SERC) test for local observability to another class of systems, namely smooth and nonsmooth differential-algebraic equation (DAE) systems of index-1. The newly introduced test for DAEs, which we call the lexicographic SERC (L-SERC) observability test, utilizes the theory of lexicographic differentiation to compute sensitivity information. Moreover, the newly introduced L-SERC observability test is useful in the context of partial observability as it can judge which states are observable and which are not. Additionally, we introduce a novel sensitivity-based extended Kalman filter (S-EKF) algorithm for state estimation, applicable to both smooth and nonsmooth DAE systems. Finally, we apply the newly developed S-EKF to estimate the states of a wind turbine power system model.</description>

      <title>What Do Bouncing Balls Tell Us About the Universe? A Journey into Billiard Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Have you ever played or watched a game of pool? If so, you have already seen a billiard system in action. In mathematics and physics, a billiard system describes a ball that moves in straight lines and bounces off walls. Despite these simple rules, billiard systems can produce remarkably rich behaviors: some table shapes generate regular, periodic patterns, while others give rise to complete chaos. Scientists also study what happens when we shrink the ball down to the size of an electron to a world where quantum effects take over and the familiar reflection rules no longer apply. In this article, we discuss billiard systems in their many forms and show how such a simple setup can reveal fundamental insights into the behavior of nature at both classical and quantum scales.</description>

      <title>Dimension Of Inhomogeneous Sub-Self-Similar Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of Inhomogeneous sub-self-similar (ISSS) sets, building upon the foundations laid by Falconer (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 347 (1995) 3121-3129) in the study of sub-self-similar sets and drawing inspiration from Barnsley's work on inhomogeneous self-similar sets (Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A 399 (1985), no. 1817, 24). We explore a range of examples of ISSS sets and elucidate a method to construct ISSS sets. We also investigate the upper and lower box dimensions of ISSS sets and discuss the continuity of the Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>Correspondences on hyperelliptic surfaces, combination theorems, and Hurwitz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a general class of correspondences on hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus that combine finitely many Fuchsian genus zero orbifold groups and Blaschke products. As an intermediate step, we first construct analytic combinations of these objects as partially defined maps on the Riemann sphere. We then give an algebraic characterization of these analytic combinations in terms of hyperelliptic involutions and meromorphic maps on compact Riemann surfaces. These involutions and meromorphic maps, in turn, give rise to the desired correspondences. The moduli space of such correspondences can be identified with a product of Teichm\"uller spaces and Blaschke spaces. The explicit description of the correspondences then allows us to construct a dynamically natural injection of this product space into appropriate Hurwitz spaces.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation and stability of stationary shear flows of Ericksen-Leslie model for nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, focusing on a critical case for shear flows of nematic liquid crystals, we investigate multiplicity and stability of stationary solutions via the parabolic Ericksen-Leslie system. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of the stationary solutions with the set of solutions of an algebraic equation. The existence of multiple stationary solutions is established through countably many saddle-node bifurcations at critical shear speeds for the algebraic equation. We then establish similar local bifurcations for the stationary solutions; more precisely, (i) for each critical shear speed, there is a unique stationary solution, the stationary solution disappears for smaller shear speed, and two stationary solutions nearby bifurcate for larger shear speed; (ii) more importantly, under a generic condition, there is exactly one zero eigenvalue for the linearization of the shear flow at the critical stationary solution, and the zero eigenvalue bifurcates to a negative eigenvalue for one of the two stationary solutions and to a positive eigenvalue for the other stationary solution. These results extend and are motivated by the works of Dorn and Liu [{\em J. Differential Equations {\bf 253} (2012), 3184-3210}] and of Jiao, et. al. [{\em J. Diff. Dyn. Syst. {\bf 34} (2022), 239-269}].</description>

      <title>Learning Spatio-Temporal Dynamics via Operator-Valued RKHS and Kernel Koopman Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for learning the spatio-temporal dynamics of vector valued functions by combining operator valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (OV-RKHS) with kernel based Koopman operator methods. The approach enables nonparametric and data driven estimation of complex time evolving vector fields while preserving both spatial and temporal structure. We establish representer theorems for time dependent OV-RKHS interpolation, derive Sobolev type approximation bounds for smooth vector fields, and provide spectral convergence guarantees for kernel Koopman operator approximations. This framework supports efficient reduced order modeling and long term prediction of high dimensional nonlinear systems, offering theoretically grounded tools for forecasting, control, and uncertainty quantification in spatio- temporal machine learning.</description>

      <title>Comparing Periodic Point Invariants for Parameterized Families of Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare different periodic point invariants for families of maps parameterized over a compact manifold. Malkiewich and Ponto showed that, in the case of a single map, the Fuller trace is equivalent to the collection of Reidmeister traces of iterates. In this paper, we show that, in contrast to the case of a single map, the fiberwise Fuller trace is a strictly more sensitive invariant than the collection of fiberwise Reidemeister traces of iterates. This resolves a conjecture of Malkiewich and Ponto.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic dynamics of a discrete Painlev\'e equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the orbits of a discrete Painlev\'e equation over finite fields and show that the number of points in such orbits satisfy the Hasse bound. The orbits turn out to lie on algebraic curves, whose defining polynomials are given explicitly. Moreover, these curves are shown to have genus less than or equal to one, which contrasts sharply with the case of discrete Painlev\'e equations over $\mathbb{C}$, whose generic solutions are believed to be more transcendental than elliptic functions.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative Intermediate Factor theorem associated with $W^*$-dynamics of product groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G = G_{1} \times G_{2}$ be a product of two locally compact, second countable groups and $\mu \in \mathrm{Prob}(G)$ be of the form $\mu = \mu_{1} \times \mu_{2}$, where $\mu_{i} \in \mathrm{Prob}(G_{i})$. Let $(B,\nu_B)$ be the associated Poisson boundary. We show that every intermediate $G$-von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}$ with \[ \mathcal{N} \subseteq \mathcal{M} \subseteq \mathcal{N} \,\bar{\otimes}\, L^{\infty}(B,\nu) \] splits as a tensor product of the form $\mathcal{N}\bar{\otimes}L^{\infty}(C,\nu_C)$, where $(C,\nu_C)$ is a $(G,\mu)$-boundary. Here, $\mathcal{N}$ is a tracial von Neumann algebra on which $G$ acts trace-preservingly. This generalizes the Intermediate Factor Theorem proved by Bader--Shalom (\cite[Theorem~1.9]{BS06}) in the measurable setup.
  In addition, we give various other examples of the splitting phenomenon associated with $W^{*}$-dynamics. We also show that certain assumptions are necessary for the intermediate algebras to split, and ideals in the ambient tensor product algebra obstruct the splitting phenomenon. We also use the Master theorem from \cite{glasner2023intermediate} to resolve the second part of \cite[Problem~5.2]{jiangskalski} in the affirmative.</description>

      <title>Echoes of the past: A unified perspective on fading memory and echo states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have become increasingly popular in information processing tasks involving time series and temporal data. A fundamental property of RNNs is their ability to create reliable input/output responses, often linked to how the network handles its memory of the information it processed. Various notions have been proposed to conceptualize the behavior of memory in RNNs, including steady states, echo states, state forgetting, input forgetting, and fading memory. Although these notions are often used interchangeably, their precise relationships remain unclear. This work aims to unify these notions in a common language, derive new implications and equivalences between them, and provide alternative proofs to some existing results. By clarifying the relationships between these concepts, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of RNNs and their temporal information processing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Almost sure limit theorems with applications to non-regular continued fraction algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a conservative ergodic measure-preserving transformation $T$ of the measure space $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ with $\mu$ a $\sigma$-finite measure and $\mu(X)=\infty$. Given an observable $g:X\to \mathbb{R}$, it is well known from results by Aaronson that in general the asymptotic behaviour of the Birkhoff sums $S_Ng(x):= \sum_{j=1}^N\, (g\circ T^{j-1})(x)$ strongly depends on the point $x\in X$, and that there exists no sequence $(d_N)$ for which $S_Ng(x)/d_N \to 1$ for $\mu$-almost every $x\in X$. In this paper we consider the case $g\not\in L^1(X,\mu)$ assuming that there exists $E\in\mathcal{B}$ with $\mu(E)&lt;\infty$ and $\int_E g\,\mathrm{d}\mu=\infty$ and continue the investigation initiated in previous work by the authors. We show that for transformations $T$ with strong mixing assumptions for the induced map on a finite measure set, the almost sure asymptotic behaviour of $S_Ng(x)$ for an unbounded observable $g$ may be obtained using two methods, adding a number of summands depending on $x$ to $S_Ng$ and trimming. The obtained sums are then asymptotic to a scalar multiple of $N$. The results are applied to a couple of non-regular continued fraction algorithms, the backward (or R\'enyi type) continued fraction and the even-integer continued fraction algorithms, to obtain the almost sure asymptotic behaviour of the sums of the digits of the algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12958v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a homeomorphism with the shadowing property to be topologically transitive: to have an invariant subset $A$, dense in the non-wandering set, where the barycenter property holds. To elucidate its dynamical nature, we compare this condition with other properties known to be sufficient for an Anosov diffeomorphism to be topologically transitive. We also describe the $C^1$ interior of the set of diffeomorphisms which comply with this condition, discuss examples with a variety of dynamics and present some applications of interest.</description>

      <title>A pointwise ergodic theorem along return times of rapidly mixing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of sparse sequences that are ergodic and pointwise universally $L^2$-good for ergodic averages. That is, sequences along which the ergodic averages converge almost surely to the projection to invariant functions. These sequences are generated randomly as return or hitting times in systems exhibiting a rapid correlation decay. This can be seen as a natural variant of Bourgain's Return Times Theorem. As an example, we obtain that for any $a\in (0,1/2)$, the sequence $\left\{n\in\mathbb{N}:\ 2^ny\mod{1}\in (0,n^{-a})\right\}$ is ergodic and pointwise universally $L^2$-good for Lebesgue almost every $y\in [0,1]$. Our approach builds on techniques developed by Frantzikinakis, Lesigne, and Wierdl in their study of sequences generated by independent random variables, which we adapt to the non-independent case.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we extend the celebrated result of Avila--Forni~\cite{avila2007weak} on the weak mixing property of interval exchange transformations to the setting of linear involutions, which naturally arise from the study of vertical foliations on half-translation surfaces. Using recent advances on the Kontsevich--Zorich cocycle for quadratic differentials~\cite{belldiagonal, gutierrez2019classification, trevino2013non}, we establish that, for every dynamically irreducible generalized permutation, the associated linear involution is weakly mixing for almost every admissible parameter.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a modified Leslie-Gower type predator-prey model with Holling I functional response and addictive Allee effect in prey. It is shown that the highest codimension of a nilpotent cusp 4, and the model can undergo degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 4. Besides, when the model has a center-type equilibrium, we show that the model can admit five limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation. Our results indicate that addictive Allee effect can induce not only richer dynamics and bifurcations, but also the coextinction of both populations with some positive initial densities. Finally, numerical simulations, including three limit cycles and four limit cycles, are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>An infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov theorem and the construction of almost periodic breathers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov theorems based on nonresonant frequencies of Bourgain's Diophantine type or even weaker conditions. To be more precise, under a nondegenerate condition for an infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system, we prove the persistence of a full-dimensional KAM torus with the universally prescribed frequency that is independent of any spectral asymptotics. As an application, we prove that for a class of perturbed networks with weakly coupled oscillators described by \[\frac{{{{\rm d}^2}{x_n}}}{{{\rm d}{t^2}}} + V'\left( {{x_n}} \right) = \varepsilon_n {W'\left( {{x_{n + 1}} - {x_n}} \right) - \varepsilon_{n-1}W'\left( {{x_n} - {x_{n - 1}}} \right)} ,\;\;n \in \mathbb{Z},\] or even for more general perturbed networks, almost periodic breathers with frequency-preserving do exist, provided that the local potential $ V $ and the coupling potential $ W $ satisfy certain assumptions. In particular, this yields the first frequency-preserving version of the Aubry-MacKay conjecture [8,21].</description>

      <title>Pre-Lagrangian tori transverse to an Anosov flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An Anosov flow on a smooth three-manifold $M$ gives rise to a Liouville structure on $\mathbb{R} \times M$ by a construction of Mitsumatsu. In a recent paper, Cieliebak, Lazarev, Massoni and Moreno ask whether an embedded torus $\Sigma \subseteq M$ transverse to an Anosov flow gives rise to a Lagrangian in $\mathbb{R} \times M$. We show that the answer to this question is in general negative by finding a topological obstruction related to the foliations induced on the torus by the weak stable and unstable bundles of the flow. Going in the opposite direction, we show that the answer is positive if the induced foliations do not admit parallel compact leaves.</description>

      <title>Generic mean curvature flows with cylindrical singularities I: the normal forms and nondegeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the dynamics of mean curvature flow as it approaches a cylindrical singularity. We proved that the rescaled mean curvature flow converging to a smooth generalized cylinder can be written as a graph over the cylinder in a ball of radius $K\sqrt{t}$, and a normal form of the asymptotics. Using the normal form, we can define the nondegeneracy of cylindrical singularities, and we show that nondegenerate cylindrical singularities are isolated in space, have a mean convex neighborhood, and are type-I.</description>

      <title>Bushfires and Balance: Proactive versus Reactive Policies in Prescribed Burning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new mathematical model to explore the dynamic relationship between prescribed burning and bushfire occurrence, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations. The model admits a unique steady-state, and its stability is shown to depend critically on the policy framework governing prescribed burning. In particular, reactive policies, where prescribed burning is increased in response to bushfire events, can lead to system instability unless augmented with appropriate feedback control. Conversely, proactive policies that implement moderate, consistent prescribed burning are more effective at stabilizing the system and mitigating the frequency of bushfires. Additionally, higher vegetation regeneration rates contribute positively to equilibrium stability. While this model does not capture the full complexity of fire management, it highlights the potential risks of emotionally driven, reactive responses and underscores the value of preventive, stability-focused strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mathematical analysis of preventive burning strategies and their long-term impact on bushfire mitigation.</description>

      <title>Learning the Simplest Neural ODE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of the ``Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE)'' paper, learning ODEs with deep learning has been applied to system identification, time-series forecasting, and related areas. Exploiting the diffeomorphic nature of ODE solution maps, neural ODEs has also enabled their use in generative modeling. Despite the rich potential to incorporate various kinds of physical information, training Neural ODEs remains challenging in practice. This study demonstrates, through the simplest one-dimensional linear model, why training Neural ODEs is difficult. We then propose a new stabilization method and provide an analytical convergence analysis. The insights and techniques presented here serve as a concise tutorial for researchers beginning work on Neural ODEs.</description>

      <title>Reduced Subgrid Scale Terms in Three-Dimensional Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large eddy simulation (LES) has become a central technique for simulating turbulent flows in engineering and applied sciences, offering a compromise between accuracy and computational cost by resolving large scale motions and modeling the effects of smaller, unresolved scales through a subgrid scale (SGS) model. The fidelity and robustness of LES depends critically on the SGS model, particularly in coarse simulations where much of the turbulence spectrum remains unresolved.
  In this work, we extend the tau-orthogonal (TO) method, a data-driven SGS modeling framework, to three-dimensional turbulent flows. The method reformulates the high-dimensional SGS closure problem as a low-dimensional prediction task focused on scale-aware quantities of interest (QoIs). We extend the model to incorporate QoI-state dependence and temporal correlations by combining regularized least-squares regression with a multivariate Gaussian residual model. This yields a simple yet effective stochastic time-series prediction model (the LRS model), with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters than typical deep learning approaches which try to directly learn the high-dimensional SGS closure.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the TO LRS model in three-dimensional forced isotropic turbulence and turbulent channel flow. The model achieves accurate long-term QoI distributions, robust performance across hyperparameter settings, and good reproduction of key flow features such as kinetic energy spectra and coherent structures, despite being trained solely on QoI trajectories. Comparisons against classical SGS models, including Smagorinsky and WALE formulations, highlight the TO LRS model's balance of accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Nonstandard Finite Difference Scheme for an SEIQR Epidemiological PDE Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) approach to a reaction-diffusion SEIQR epidemiological model, which captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Formulated as a system of semilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), the model extends classical compartmental models by incorporating spatial diffusion to account for population movement and spatial heterogeneity. The proposed NSFD discretization is designed to preserve the continuous model's essential qualitative features, such as positivity, boundedness, and stability, which are often compromised by standard finite difference methods. We rigorously analyze the model's well-posedness, construct a structure-preserving NSFD scheme for the PDE system, and study its convergence and local truncation error. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the scheme's effectiveness in preserving biologically consistent dynamics.</description>
