      <title>Robust Controller Synthesis under Markovian Mode Switching with Periodic LTV Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose novel LMI-based controller synthesis frameworks for periodically time-varying Markov-jump linear systems. We first discuss the necessary conditions for mean square stability and derive Lyapunov-like conditions for stability assurance. To relax strict stability requirements, we introduce a new criterion that doesn't require the Lyapunov function to decrease at each time step. Further, we incorporate these stability theorems in LMI-based controller synthesis frameworks while considering two separate problems: minimizing a quadratic cost, and maximizing the region of attraction. Numerical simulations verify the controllers' stability and showcase its applicability to fault-tolerant control.</description>

      <title>Multi-stage stochastic linear programming for shared autonomous vehicle system operation and design with on-demand and pre-booked requests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents optimization problems to jointly determine long-term network design, mid-term fleet sizing strategy, and short-term routing and ridesharing matching in shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) systems with pre-booked and on-demand trip requests. Based on the dynamic traffic assignment framework, multi-stage stochastic linear programming is formulated for joint optimization of SAV system design and operations. Leveraging the linearity of the proposed problem, we can tackle the computational complexity due to multiple objectives and dynamic stochasticity through the weighted sum method and stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP). Our numerical examples verify that the solution to the proposed problem obtained through SDDP is close enough to the optimal solution. We also demonstrate the effect of introducing pre-booking options on optimized infrastructure planning and fleet sizing strategies. Furthermore, dedicated vehicles to pick-up and drop-off only pre-booked travelers can lead to incentives to reserve in advance instead of on-demand requests with little reduction in system performance.</description>

      <title>Long-Time Behaviors of Stochastic Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of the solution to a linear-quadratic stochastic optimal control problems. The so-called probability cell problem is introduced the first time. It serves as the probability interpretation of the well-known cell problem in the homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations. By establishing a connection between this problem and the ergodic cost problem, we reveal the turnpike properties of the linear-quadratic stochastic optimal control problems from various perspectives.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Constrained Dynamic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an overview, analysis, and comparison of second-order dynamic optimization algorithms, i.e., constrained Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). Although a variety of these algorithms has been proposed and used successfully, there exists a gap in understanding the key differences and advantages, which we aim to provide in this work. For constrained DDP, we choose methods that incorporate nolinear programming techniques to handle state and control constraints, including Augmented Lagrangian (AL), Interior Point, Primal Dual Augmented Lagrangian (PDAL), and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Both DDP and SQP are provided in single- and multiple-shooting formulations, where constraints that arise from dynamics are encoded implicitly and explicitly, respectively. In addition to reviewing these methods, we propose a single-shooting PDAL DDP. As a byproduct of the review, we also propose a single-shooting PDAL DDP which is robust to the growth of penalty parameters and performs better than the normal AL variant. We perform extensive numerical experiments on a variety of systems with increasing complexity towards investigating the quality of the solutions, the levels of constraint violation, iterations for convergence, and the sensitivity of final solutions with respect to initialization. The results show that DDP often has the advantage of finding better local minima, while SQP tends to achieve better constraint satisfaction. For multiple-shooting formulation, both DDP and SQP can enjoy informed initial guesses, while the latter appears to be more advantageous in complex systems. It is also worth highlighting that DDP provides favorable computational complexity and feedback gains as a byproduct of optimization.</description>

      <title>From exponential to finite/fixed-time stability: Applications to optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of finite/fixed-time stable optimization algorithms typically involves study of specific problem instances. The lack of a unified framework hinders understanding of more sophisticated algorithms, e.g., primal-dual gradient flow dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to address the following question: Given an exponentially stable optimization algorithm, can it be modified to obtain a finite/fixed-time stable algorithm? We provide an affirmative answer, demonstrate how the solution can be computed on a finite-time interval via a simple scaling of the right-hand-side of the original dynamics, and certify the desired properties of the modified algorithm using the Lyapunov function that proves exponential stability of the original system. Finally, we examine nonsmooth composite optimization problems and smooth problems with linear constraints to demonstrate the merits of our approach.</description>

      <title>On the control of LTI systems with rough control laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of linear time invariant systems is well established and allows, among other things, to formulate and solve control problems in finite time. In this context the control laws are typically taken in a space of the form L^p(0,T;U). In this paper we consider the possibility of taking control laws in (H^1(0,T;U))* , which induces non-trivial issues. We overcome these difficulties by adapting the functional setting, notably by considering a generalized final state for the systems under consideration. In addition we collect time regularity properties and we pretend that in general it is not possible to consider control laws in H^{-1}(0,T;U). Then, we apply our results to propose an interpretation of the inifinite order of defect for an observability inequality, in terms of controllability properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and optimizing the design of helical micro-swimmers is crucial for advancing their application in various fields. This study presents an innovative approach combining Free-Form Deformation with Bayesian Optimization to enhance the shape of these swimmers. Our method facilitates the computation of generic swimmer shapes that achieve optimal average speed and efficiency. Applied to both monoflagellated and biflagellated swimmers, our optimization framework has led to the identification of new optimal shapes. These shapes are compared with biological counterparts, highlighting a diverse range of swimmers, including both pushers and pullers.</description>

      <title>Minmax regret maximal covering location problems with edge demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a version of the single-facility Maximal Covering Location Problem on a network where the demand is: (i) distributed along the edges and (ii) uncertain with only a known interval estimation. To deal with this problem, we propose a minmax regret model where the service facility can be located anywhere along the network. This problem is called Minmax Regret Maximal Covering Location Problem with demand distributed along the edges (MMR-EMCLP). Furthermore, we present two polynomial algorithms for finding the location that minimises the maximal regret assuming that the demand realisation is an unknown constant or linear function on each edge. We also include two illustrative examples as well as a computational study for the unknown constant demand case to illustrate the potential and limits of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Upgrading edges in the maximal covering location problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the upgrading version of the maximal covering location problem with edge length modifications on networks. This problem aims at locating p facilities on the vertices (of the network) so as to maximise coverage, considering that the length of the edges can be reduced at a cost, subject to a given budget. Hence, we have to decide on: the optimal location of p facilities and the optimal edge length reductions.
  This problem is NP-hard on general graphs. To solve it, we propose three different mixed-integer formulations and a preprocessing phase for fixing variables and removing some of the constraints. Moreover, we strengthen the proposed formulations including valid inequalities. Finally, we compare the three formulations and their corresponding improvements by testing their performance over different datasets.</description>

      <title>Differential dynamic programming with stagewise equality and inequality constraints using interior point method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) is one of the indirect methods for solving an optimal control problem. Several extensions to DDP have been proposed to add stagewise state and control constraints, which can mainly be classified as augmented lagrangian methods, active set methods, and barrier methods. In this paper, we use an interior point method, which is a type of barrier method, to incorporate arbitrary stagewise equality and inequality state and control constraints. We also provide explicit update formulas for all the involved variables. Finally, we apply this algorithm to example systems such as the inverted pendulum, a continuously stirred tank reactor, car parking, and obstacle avoidance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study generalized versions of the k-center problem, which involves finding k circles of the smallest possible equal radius that cover a finite set of points in the plane. By utilizing the Minkowski gauge function, we extend this problem to generalized balls induced by various convex sets in finite dimensions, rather than limiting it to circles in the plane. First, we establish several fundamental properties of the global optimal solutions to this problem. We then introduce the notion of local optimal solutions and provide a sufficient condition for their existence. We also provide several illustrative examples to clarify the proposed problems.</description>

      <title>Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal execution and battery storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and constraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity markets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general propagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal control is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers and their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic Fredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on the dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically via a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least-squares Monte Carlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We illustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic signals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law decaying transient impact, with either a `no-shorting' constraint in the presence of a `sell' signal, a `no-buying' constraint in the presence of a `buy' signal or a stochastic `stop-trading' constraint whenever the exogenous price drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem with instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on both the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.</description>

      <title>Balancing Optimality and Diversity: Human-Centered Decision Making through Generative Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surge in data availability has inundated decision-makers with an overwhelming array of choices. While existing approaches focus on optimizing decisions based on quantifiable metrics, practical decision-making often requires balancing measurable quantitative criteria with unmeasurable qualitative factors embedded in the broader context. In such cases, algorithms can generate high-quality recommendations, but the final decision rests with the human, who must weigh both dimensions. We define the process of selecting the optimal set of algorithmic recommendations in this context as human-centered decision making. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework called generative curation, which optimizes the true desirability of decision options by integrating both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Our framework uses a Gaussian process to model unknown qualitative factors and derives a diversity metric that balances quantitative optimality with qualitative diversity. This trade-off enables the generation of a manageable subset of diverse, near-optimal actions that are robust to unknown qualitative preferences. To operationalize this framework, we propose two implementation approaches: a generative neural network architecture that produces a distribution $\pi$ to efficiently sample a diverse set of near-optimal actions, and a sequential optimization method to iteratively generates solutions that can be easily incorporated into complex optimization formulations. We validate our approach with extensive datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing decision-making processes across a range of complex environments, with significant implications for policy and management.</description>

      <title>Optimal Investment with Costly Expert Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Merton problem of optimizing expected power utility of terminal wealth in the case of an unobservable Markov-modulated drift. What makes the model special is that the agent is allowed to purchase costly expert opinions of varying quality on the current state of the drift, leading to a mixed stochastic control problem with regular and impulse controls involving random consequences. Using ideas from filtering theory, we first embed the original problem with unobservable drift into a full information problem on a larger state space. The value function of the full information problem is characterized as the unique viscosity solution of the dynamic programming PDE. This characterization is achieved by a new variant of the stochastic Perron's method, which additionally allows us to show that, in between purchases of expert opinions, the problem reduces to an exit time control problem which is known to admit an optimal feedback control. Under the assumption of sufficient regularity of this feedback map, we are able to construct optimal trading and expert opinion strategies.</description>

      <title>Local large deviations for randomly forced nonlinear wave equations with localized damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the large deviation principle (LDP) for locally damped nonlinear wave equations perturbed by a bounded noise. When the noise is sufficiently non-degenerate, we establish the LDP for empirical distributions with lower bound of a local type. The primary challenge is the lack of compactness due to the absence of smoothing effect. This is overcome by exploiting the asymptotic compactness for the dynamics of waves, introducing the concept of asymptotic exponential tightness for random measures, and establishing a new LDP approach for random dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a simple $C^{1,1}$ approximation of the squared Wasserstein distance on R^d when one of the two measures is fixed. This approximation converges locally uniformly. More importantly, at points where the differential of the squared Wasserstein distance exists, it attracts the differentials of the approximations at nearby points. Our method relies on the Hilbertian lifting of PL Lions and on the regularization in Hilbert spaces of Lasry and Lions. We then provide an application of this result by using it to establish a comparison principle for an Hamilton-Jacobi equation on the set of probability measures.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of the upgrading version of the maximal covering location problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the complexity of the upgrading version of the maximal covering location problem with edge length modifications on networks. This problem is NP-hard on general networks. However, in some particular cases, we prove that this problem is solvable in polynomial time. The cases of star and path networks combined with different assumptions for the model parameters are analysed. In particular, we obtain that the problem on star networks is solvable in O(nlogn) time for uniform weights and NP-hard for non-uniform weights. On paths, the single facility problem is solvable in O(n^3) time, while the p-facility problem is NP-hard even with uniform costs and upper bounds (maximal upgrading per edge), as well as, integer parameter values. Furthermore, a pseudo-polynomial algorithm is developed for the single facility problem on trees with integer parameters.</description>

      <title>ReLU Surrogates in Mixed-Integer MPC for Irrigation Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the growing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex scheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational complexity of mixed-integer MPC still poses a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale applications. This study proposes an approach to enhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation schedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture dynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed-integer linear representation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the mixed-integer MPC-based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a mixed-integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global optimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through comparative studies conducted on a large-scale agricultural field across two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used triggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU-based approach significantly reduces solution times -- by up to 99.5\% -- while achieving comparable performance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water Use Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU-based approach maintains enhanced performance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the widely-used triggered irrigation scheduling method.</description>

      <title>ROOT-SGD: Sharp Nonasymptotics and Near-Optimal Asymptotics in a Single Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.12690v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of solving strongly convex and smooth unconstrained optimization problems using stochastic first-order algorithms. We devise a novel algorithm, referred to as Recursive One-Over-T SGD (ROOT-SGD), based on an easily implementable, recursive averaging of past stochastic gradients. We prove that it simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance in both a finite-sample, nonasymptotic sense and an asymptotic sense. On the non-asymptotic side, we prove risk bounds on the last iterate of ROOT-SGD with leading-order terms that match the optimal statistical risk with a unity pre-factor, along with a higher-order term that scales at the sharp rate of $O(n^{-3/2})$ under the Lipschitz condition on the Hessian matrix. On the asymptotic side, we show that when a mild, one-point Hessian continuity condition is imposed, the rescaled last iterate of (multi-epoch) ROOT-SGD converges asymptotically to a Gaussian limit with the Cram\'er-Rao optimal asymptotic covariance, for a broad range of step-size choices.</description>

      <title>Rank-sparsity decomposition for planted quasi clique recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the Rank-Sparsity Matrix Decomposition to the planted Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem (MQCP). This problem has the planted Maximum Clique Problem (MCP) as a special case. The maximum clique problem is NP-hard. A Quasi-clique or $\gamma$-clique is a dense graph with the edge density of at least $\gamma$, where $\gamma \in (0, 1]$. The maximum quasi-clique problem seeks to find such a subgraph with the largest cardinality in a given graph. Our method of choice is the low-rank plus sparse matrix splitting technique. We present a theoretical basis for when our convex relaxation problem recovers the planted maximum quasi-clique. We derived a new bound on the norm of the dual matrix that certifies the recovery using $l_{\infty,2} norm. We showed that when certain conditions are met, our convex formulation recovers the planted quasi-clique exactly. The numerical experiments we performed corroborated our theory.</description>

Abstract: We study Markov decision processes (MDPs) with a countably infinite number of states. The $\limsup$ (resp. $\liminf$) threshold objective is to maximize the probability that the $\limsup$ (resp. $\liminf$) of the infinite sequence of directly seen rewards is non-negative. We establish the complete picture of the strategy complexity of these objectives, i.e., the upper and lower bounds on the memory required by $\varepsilon$-optimal (resp. optimal) strategies. We then apply these results to solve two open problems from (Sudderth, Decisions in Economics and Finance, 2020) about the strategy complexity of optimal strategies for the expected $\limsup$ (resp. $\liminf$) payoff.</description>

      <title>An entropy penalized approach for stochastic control problems. Complete version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an original approach to stochastic control problems. We consider a weak formulation that is written as an optimization (minimization) problem on the space of probability measures. We then introduce a penalized version of this problem obtained by splitting the minimization variables and penalizing the discrepancy   between the two variables via an  entropy term.  We show that the penalized problem provides a good approximation of  the original problem when the weight of the entropy  penalization term is large enough. Moreover, the penalized problem  has the advantage of giving rise to two optimization subproblems that are easy to solve in each of the two optimization  variables when the other is fixed. We take advantage of this property to propose an alternating optimization procedure that converges to the infimum of the penalized problem with a rate $O(1/k)$, where $k$ is the number of iterations.  The relevance of this approach is illustrated by solving a high-dimensional stochastic control problem aimed at controlling consumption in electrical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptive step sizes in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by utilizing quantities that we have identified as numerically traceable -- the Lipschitz constant for gradients and a concept of the local variance in search directions. Our findings yield a nearly hyperparameter-free algorithm for stochastic optimization, which has provable convergence properties and exhibits truly problem adaptive behavior on classical image classification tasks. Our framework is set in a general Hilbert space and thus enables the potential inclusion of a preconditioner through the choice of the inner product.</description>

      <title>Accurate Linear Cutting-Plane Relaxations for ACOPF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a pure linear cutting-plane relaxation approach for rapidly proving tight and accurate lower bounds for the Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow Problem (ACOPF) and its multi-period extension with ramping constraints. Our method leverages outer-envelope linear cuts for well-known second-order cone relaxations for ACOPF together with modern cut management techniques and reformulations to attain numerical stability. These techniques prove effective on a broad family of ACOPF instances, including the largest ones publicly available, quickly and robustly yielding tight bounds. Additionally, we consider the (frequent) case where an ACOPF instance is handled following a small or moderate change in problem data, e.g., load changes and generator or branch shut-offs. We provide significant computational evidence, on single and multi-period ACOPF instances, that the cuts computed on the prior instance provide very good lower bounds when warm-starting our algorithm on the perturbed instance.</description>

      <title>Problem-Driven Scenario Reduction Framework for Power System Stochastic Operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scenario reduction (SR) aims to identify a small yet representative scenario set to depict the underlying uncertainty, which is critical to scenario-based stochastic optimization (SBSO) of power systems. Existing SR techniques commonly aim to achieve statistical approximation to the original scenario set. However, SR and SBSO are commonly considered into two distinct and decoupled process, which cannot guarantee a superior approximation of the original optimality. Instead, this paper incorporates the SBSO problem structure into the SR process and introduces a novel problem-driven scenario reduction framework. Specifically, we project the original scenario set in distribution space into the mutual decision applicability between scenarios in problem space. Subsequently, the SR process, embedded by a distinctive problem-driven distance metric, is rendered as a mixed-integer linear programming formulation to obtain the representative scenario set while minimizing the optimality gap. Furthermore, ex-ante and ex-post problem-driven evaluation indices are proposed to evaluate the SR performance. Numerical experiments on two two-stage stochastic economic dispatch problems validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, and demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing SR methods by identifying salient (e.g., worst-case) scenarios, and achieving an optimality gap of less than 0.1% within acceptable computation time.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Two-Sided Sketching Method for Large-Scale Tensor Decomposition Based on Transformed Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large tensors are frequently encountered in various fields such as computer vision, scientific simulations, sensor networks, and data mining. However, these tensors are often too large for convenient processing, transfer, or storage. Fortunately, they typically exhibit a low-rank structure that can be leveraged through tensor decomposition. However, performing large-scale tensor decomposition can be time-consuming. Sketching is a useful technique to reduce the dimensionality of the data. In this paper, we propose a novel two-sided sketching method based on the $\star_{L}$-product decomposition and transformed domains like the discrete cosine transformation. A rigorous theoretical analysis is also conducted to assess the approximation error of the proposed method. Specifically, we improve our method with power iteration to achieve more precise approximate solutions. Extensive numerical experiments and comparisons on low-rank approximation of synthetic large tensors and real-world data like color images and grayscale videos illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of both CPU time and approximation accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaging tasks are typically tackled using a structured optimization framework. This paper delves into a class of algorithms for difference-of-convex (DC) structured optimization, focusing on minimizing a DC function along with a possibly nonconvex function. Existing DC algorithm (DCA) versions often fail to effectively handle nonconvex functions or exhibit slow convergence rates. We propose a novel inertial proximal DC algorithm in Bregman geometry, named iBPDCA, designed to address nonconvex terms and enhance convergence speed through inertial techniques. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis, establishing both subsequential and global convergence of iBPDCA via the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property. Additionally, we introduce a Plug-and-Play variant, PnP-iBPDCA, which employs a deep neural network-based prior for greater flexibility and robustness while ensuring theoretical convergence. We also establish that the Gaussian gradient step denoiser used in our method is equivalent to evaluating the Bregman proximal operator for an implicitly weakly convex functional. We extensively validate our method on Rician noise and phase retrieval. We demonstrate that iBPDCA surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equilibrium selection problem in the generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) has recently been studied as an optimization problem, defined over the set of all variational equilibria achievable first through a non-cooperative game among players. However, to make such a selection fairly for all players, we have to rely on an unrealistic assumption, that is, the availability of a reliable center not possible to cause any bias for all players. In this paper, we propose a new equilibrium selection achievable by solving a further GNEP, named the hierarchical Nash equilibrium problem (HNEP), within only the players. The HNEP covers existing optimization-based equilibrium selections as its simplest cases, while the general style of the HNEP can ensure a fair equilibrium selection without assuming any trusted center or randomness. We also propose an iterative algorithm for the HNEP as an application of the hybrid steepest descent method to a variational inequality newly defined over the fixed point set of a quasi-nonexpansive operator. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed equilibrium selection via the HNEP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.10142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the infinite-horizon reach-avoid zero-sum game problem, where the goal is to find a set in the state space, referred to as the reach-avoid set, such that the system starting at a state therein could be controlled to reach a given target set without violating constraints under the worst-case disturbance. We address this problem by designing a new value function with a contracting Bellman backup, where the super-zero level set, i.e., the set of states where the value function is evaluated to be non-negative, recovers the reach-avoid set. Building upon this, we prove that the proposed method can be adapted to compute the viability kernel, or the set of states which could be controlled to satisfy given constraints, and the backward reachable set, or the set of states that could be driven towards a given target set. Finally, we propose to alleviate the curse of dimensionality issue in high-dimensional problems by extending Conservative Q-Learning, a deep reinforcement learning technique, to learn a value function such that the super-zero level set of the learned value function serves as a (conservative) approximation to the reach-avoid set. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest that the proposed method could learn reliably the reach-avoid set and the optimal control policy even with neural network approximation.</description>

      <title>The Bayan Algorithm: Detecting Communities in Networks Through Exact and Approximate Optimization of Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04562v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection is a classic network problem with extensive applications in various fields. Its most common method is using modularity maximization heuristics which rarely return an optimal partition or anything similar. Partitions with globally optimal modularity are difficult to compute, and therefore have been underexplored. Using structurally diverse networks, we compare 30 community detection methods including our proposed algorithm that offers optimality and approximation guarantees: the Bayan algorithm. Unlike existing methods, Bayan globally maximizes modularity or approximates it within a factor. Our results show the distinctive accuracy and stability of maximum-modularity partitions in retrieving planted partitions at rates higher than most alternatives for a wide range of parameter settings in two standard benchmarks. Compared to the partitions from 29 other algorithms, maximum-modularity partitions have the best medians for description length, coverage, performance, average conductance, and well clusteredness. These advantages come at the cost of additional computations which Bayan makes possible for small networks (networks that have up to 3000 edges in their largest connected component). Bayan is several times faster than using open-source and commercial solvers for modularity maximization, making it capable of finding optimal partitions for instances that cannot be optimized by any other existing method. Our results point to a few well performing algorithms, among which Bayan stands out as the most reliable method for small networks. A Python implementation of the Bayan algorithm (bayanpy) is publicly available through the package installer for Python (pip).</description>

      <title>A geometric view on probabilistically robust learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although deep neural networks have achieved super-human performance on many classification tasks, they often exhibit a worrying lack of robustness towards adversarially generated examples. Thus, considerable effort has been invested into reformulating standard Risk Minimization (RM) into an adversarially robust framework. Recently, attention has shifted towards approaches which interpolate between the robustness offered by adversarial training and the higher clean accuracy and faster training times of RM. In this paper, we take a fresh and geometric view on one such method -- Probabilistically Robust Learning (PRL). We propose a mathematical framework for understanding PRL, which allows us to identify geometric pathologies in its original formulation and to introduce a family of probabilistic nonlocal perimeter functionals to rectify them. We prove existence of solutions to the original and modified problems using novel relaxation methods and also study properties, as well as local limits, of the introduced perimeters. We also clarify, through a suitable $\Gamma$-convergence analysis, the way in which the original and modified PRL models interpolate between risk minimization and adversarial training.</description>

      <title>Quantum Markov Decision Processes: General Theory, Approximations, and Classes of Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the aim is to develop a quantum counterpart to classical Markov decision processes (MDPs). Firstly, we provide a very general formulation of quantum MDPs with state and action spaces in the quantum domain, quantum transitions, and cost functions. Once we formulate the quantum MDP (q-MDP), our focus shifts to establishing the verification theorem that proves the sufficiency of Markovian quantum control policies and provides a dynamic programming principle. Subsequently, a comparison is drawn between our q-MDP model and previously established quantum MDP models (referred to as QOMDPs) found in the literature. Furthermore, approximations of q-MDPs are obtained via finite-action models, which can be formulated as QOMDPs. Finally, classes of open-loop and classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies for q-MDPs are introduced, along with structural results for these policies. In summary, we present a novel quantum MDP model aiming to introduce a new framework, algorithms, and future research avenues. We hope that our approach will pave the way for a new research direction in discrete-time quantum control.</description>

      <title>From Maximum Cut to Maximum Independent Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Maximum Cut (Max-Cut) problem could be naturally expressed either in a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation, or as an Ising model. It has long been known that the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem could also be related to a specific Ising model. Therefore, it would be natural to attack MIS with various Max-Cut/Ising solvers. It turns out that this strategy greatly improves the approximation for the independence number of random Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs. It also exhibits perfect performance on a benchmark arising from coding theory. These results pave the way for further development of approximate quantum algorithms on MIS, and specifically on the corresponding coding problems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Solving Rare MIP Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) has been extensively applied in areas requiring mathematical solvers to address complex instances within tight time constraints. However, as the problem scale increases, the complexity of model formulation and finding feasible solutions escalates significantly. In contrast, the model-building cost for end-to-end models, such as large language models (LLMs), remains largely unaffected by problem scale due to their pattern recognition capabilities. While LLMs, like GPT-4, without fine-tuning, can handle some traditional medium-scale MIP problems, they struggle with uncommon or highly specialized MIP scenarios. Fine-tuning LLMs can yield some feasible solutions for medium-scale MIP instances, but these models typically fail to explore diverse solutions when constrained by a low and constant temperature, limiting their performance. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a recursively dynamic temperature method integrated with a chain-of-thought approach. Our findings show that starting with a high temperature and gradually lowering it leads to better feasible solutions compared to other dynamic temperature strategies. Additionally, by comparing results generated by the LLM with those from Gurobi, we demonstrate that the LLM can produce solutions that complement traditional solvers by accelerating the pruning process and improving overall efficiency.</description>
