      <title>Supersymmetric Analysis of Spinning Cosmic String Spacetime Within External fields with Aharonov-Bohm interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supersymmetric analysis of spinning cosmic string spacetime, involving an electron in magnetic fields, has been conducted. We examined the Dirac system within extended special functions known as exceptional orthogonal polynomials. Corresponding Dirac system is transformed to a relativistic system with a nonlinear isotonic oscillator. Furthermore, new potential models that extend the radial oscillator by adding rational terms are expressed in terms of the exceptional orthogonal Laguerre $X_{m}$ polynomial. The necessary analyses of the potential, energy levels, and probability density graphs are introduced for various cosmic string topological defects and Aharonov-Bohm interaction parameters.</description>

      <title>Fock space of local fields of the discrete GFF and its scaling limit bosonic CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To connect conformal field theories (CFT) to probabilistic lattice models, recent works [HKV22, Ada23] have introduced a novel definition of local fields of the lattice models. Local fields in this picture are probabilistically concrete: they are built from random variables in the model. The key insight is that discrete complex analysis ideas allow to equip the space of local fields with the main structure of a CFT: a representation of the Virasoro algebra.
  In this article, for the first time, we fully analyze the structure of the space of local fields of a lattice model as a representation, and use this to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the local fields of a lattice model and those of a conformal field theory. The CFT we consider is probabilistically realized in terms of the gradient of the Gaussian Free Field (GFF). Its space of local fields is just a bosonic Fock space for two chiral symmetry algebras. The corresponding lattice model is the discrete Gaussian Free Field. Our first main result is that the space of local fields of polynomials in the gradient of the discrete GFF is isomorphic to the Fock space. Notably, local fields in this setup make sense with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Our second main result is that with the appropriate renormalization, correlation functions of local fields of the discrete GFF converge in the scaling limit to the correlation functions of the CFT. The renormalization needed is, conceptually correctly, according to the eigenvalue of the Virasoro generator $L_0 + \bar{L}_0$ on the local field.</description>

      <title>Truncated quantum observables and their semiclassical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For quantum observables $H$ truncated on the range of orthogonal projections $\Pi_N$ of rank $N$, we study the corresponding Weyl symbol in the phase space in the semiclassical limit of vanishing Planck constant $\hbar\to0$ and large quantum number $N\to\infty$, with $\hbar N$ fixed. Under certain assumptions, we prove the $L^2$- convergence of the Weyl symbols to a symbol truncated (hence, in general discontinuous) on the classically permitted region in phase space. As an illustration of the general theorems we analyse truncated observables for the harmonic oscillator and for a free particle in a one-dimensional box. In the latter case, we also compute the microscopic pointwise limit of the symbols near the boundary of the classically permitted region.</description>

      <title>Depletion of nonlinearity in space-analytic space-periodic solutions to equations of diffusive magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider solenoidal space-periodic space-analytic solutions to the equations of magnetohydrodynamics. An elementary bound shows that due to the special structure of the nonlinear terms in the equations for modified solutions, effectively they lack a half of the spatial gradient, which appears to be a novel mechanism for depletion of nonlinearity. We present a two-phase iterative procedure yielding an expanded bound for the guaranteed time of the space analyticity of the hydrodynamic solutions. Each iteration involves two regimes: In phase 1, the enstrophy of the modified solution and the bound for the radius of the analyticity of the original solution simultaneously increase (the bound is proportional to the elapsed time since the beginning of phase 1). In phase 2, the enstrophy and bound simultaneously decrease. It is straightforward to generalize this construction for the equations of magnetohydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Motivic classes of irregular Higgs bundles and irregular connections on a curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over a field of characteristic zero and let $\mathcal D$ be an effective divisor on $X$. We calculate motivic classes of various moduli stacks of parabolic vector bundles with irregular connections on $X$ and of irregular parabolic Higgs bundles on $X$ with poles bounded by $\mathcal D$ and with fully or partially fixed formal normal forms. Along the way, we obtain several results about irregular connections and irregular parabolic Higgs bundles. In particular, we give a criterion for the existence of a connection on a higher level parabolic bundle and also develop homological algebra for irregular connections and irregular parabolic Higgs bundles. We also simplify our previous results in the regular case by re-writing the formulas for motivic classes in terms of the HLV generating function.</description>

      <title>Proof of a Universal Speed Limit on Fast Scrambling in Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the time required for sustained information scrambling in any Hamiltonian quantum system is universally at least logarithmic in the entanglement entropy of scrambled states. This addresses two foundational problems in nonequilibrium quantum dynamics. (1) It sets the earliest possible time for the applicability of equilibrium statistical mechanics in a quantum system coupled to a bath at a finite temperature. (2) It proves a version of the fast scrambling conjecture, originally motivated in models associated with black holes, as a fundamental property of quantum mechanics itself. Our result builds on a refinement of the energy-time uncertainty principle in terms of the infinite temperature spectral form factor in quantum chaos. We generalize this formulation to arbitrary initial states of the bath, including finite temperature states, by mapping Hamiltonian dynamics with any initial state to nonunitary dynamics at infinite temperature. A regularized spectral form factor emerges naturally from this procedure, whose decay is universally constrained by analyticity in complex time. This establishes an exact speed limit on information scrambling by the most general quantum mechanical Hamiltonian, without any restrictions on locality or the nature of interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider steady surface waves in an infinitely deep two--dimensional ideal fluid with potential flow, focusing on high-amplitude waves near the steepest wave with a 120 degree corner at the crest. The stability of these solutions with respect to coperiodic and subharmonic perturbations is studied, using new matrix-free numerical methods. We provide evidence for a plethora of conjectures on the nature of the instabilities as the steepest wave is approached, especially with regards to the self-similar recurrence of the stability spectrum near the origin of the spectral plane.</description>

      <title>Casimir energy on the sphere and 6D CFT trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the dependence of the Casimir energy on the trace anomaly coefficients for a six-dimensional CFT on $R\times S^5$. This extends the universal dependence on the central charge in 2D and the relation by Cappelli and Coste in 4D, unveiling the role of the trivial total derivatives in the anomaly that renders the Casimir energy scheme dependent. We obtain
  $$E_o=-\frac{15}{8}\,a_6 -\frac{5}{12}\,\left(g_5+\frac{1}{4}\,g_7+\frac{1}{2}\,g_8-10\, g_9+g_{10}\right),$$
with $a_6$ being the type A central charge and the $g$'s, the coefficients of five out of six terms that form a basis for trivial total derivatives. The derivation is based on the Polyakov formulas (conformal primitive) resulting from the integration of the trace anomaly.
  Alternatively, on a 6D conformally flat background the above basis is redundant and one can simplify further to get, in terms of the Schouten scalar $J$ and the Schouten tensor $V$, Branson's basis for trivial total derivatives $\nabla^2\nabla^2 J$, $\nabla^2J^2$ and $\nabla^2|V|^2+2\nabla\cdot(V\cdot\nabla\,J)$ with coefficients $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3$, respectively, \begin{equation} \nonumber
  E_o=-\frac{15}{8}a_6-\frac{1}{24}\left(\gamma_1-\gamma_2 -\frac{1}{8}\gamma_3\right)~. \end{equation}</description>

      <title>Sampling from Spherical Spin Glasses in Total Variation via Algorithmic Stochastic Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of algorithmically sampling from the Gibbs measure of a mixed $p$-spin spherical spin glass. We give a polynomial-time algorithm that samples from the Gibbs measure up to vanishing total variation error, for any model whose mixture satisfies $$\xi''(s) &lt; \frac{1}{(1-s)^2}, \qquad \forall s\in [0,1).$$ This includes the pure $p$-spin glasses above a critical temperature that is within an absolute ($p$-independent) constant of the so-called shattering phase transition. Our algorithm follows the algorithmic stochastic localization approach introduced in (Alaoui, Montanari, Sellke, 20022). A key step of this approach is to estimate the mean of a sequence of tilted measures. We produce an improved estimator for this task by identifying a suitable correction to the TAP fixed point selected by approximate message passing (AMP). As a consequence, we improve the algorithm's guarantee over previous work, from normalized Wasserstein to total variation error. In particular, the new algorithm and analysis opens the way to perform inference about one-dimensional projections of the measure.</description>

      <title>Inverse modified scattering and polyhomogeneous expansions for the Vlasov--Poisson system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof of well posedness of the inverse modified scattering problem for the Vlasov--Poisson system: for every suitable scattering profile there exists a solution of Vlasov--Poisson which disperses and scatters, in a modified sense, to this profile. Further, as a consequence of the proof, the solutions are shown to admit a polyhomogeneous expansion, to any finite but arbitrarily high order, with coefficients given explicitly in terms of the scattering profile. The proof does not exploit the full ellipticity of the Poisson equation.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper we consider two related problems, i.e. the description of geodesics and the calculation of the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a flag manifold. We show that there exists a family of invariant metrics such that both problems can be solved simply and explicitly. In order to determine the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, we construct natural, finite-dimensional approximations (of spin chain type) to the Hilbert space of functions on a flag manifold.</description>

      <title>Complex Stochastic Optimal Control Foundation of Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have expanded the use of the stochastic Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equation to include complex variables for deriving quantum mechanical equations. However, these studies typically assume that it is valid to apply the HJB equation directly to complex numbers, an approach that overlooks the fundamental problem of comparing complex numbers to find optimal controls. This paper addresses how to properly apply the HJB equation in the context of complex variables. Our findings significantly reevaluate the stochastic movement of quantum particles, directly influenced by the Cauchy Riemann theorem. These insights not only deepen our understanding of quantum dynamics but also enhance the mathematical rigor of the framework for applying stochastic optimal control in quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We use the theory of abstract Wiener spaces to construct a probabilistic model for Berezin-Toeplitz quantization on a complete Hermitian complex manifold endowed with a positive line bundle. We associate to a function with compact support (a classical observable) a family of square-integrable Gaussian holomorphic sections. Our focus then is on the asymptotic distributions of their zeros in the semiclassical limit, in particular, we prove equidistribution results, large deviation estimates, and central limit theorems of the random zeros on the support of the given function. One of the key ingredients of our approach is the local asymptotic expansions of Berezin-Toeplitz kernels with non-smooth symbols.</description>

Abstract: We study extensions of the mappings arising in usual Channel-State duality to the case of Hilbert spaces with a direct sum structure. This setting arises in representations of algebras with centers, which are commonly associated with constraints, and it has many physical applications from quantum many-body theory to holography and quantum gravity. We establish that there is a general relationship between non-separability of the state and the isometric properties of the induced channel. We also provide a generalisation of our approach to algebras of trace-class operators on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study Lagrangian correspondences between Hilbert spaces. A main focus is the question when the composition of two Lagrangian correspondences is again Lagrangian. Our answer leads in particular to a well-defined composition law in a category of Lagrangian correspondences respecting given polarizations of the Hilbert spaces involved. As an application, we construct a functorial field theory on geometric spin manifolds with values in this category of Lagrangian correspondences, which can be viewed as a formal Wick rotation of the theory associated to a free fermionic particle in a curved spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework to study local gauge theories on manifolds with boundaries and asymptotic symmetries, which is based on representing them as so-called gauge PDEs. These objects extend the conventional BV-AKSZ sigma-models to the case of not necessarily topological and diffeomorphism invariant systems and are known to behave well with respect to restrictions to submanifolds and boundaries. We introduce the notion of gauge PDE with boundaries, which takes into account generic boundary conditions, and apply the framework to asymptotically flat gravity. In so doing we start with a suitable representation of gravity as a gauge PDE with boundaries which implements the Penrose's description of asymptotically simple spacetimes. We then derive the minimal model of the gauge PDE induced on the boundary and observe that it provides the Cartan (frame-like) description of a (curved) conformal Carollian structure on the boundary. Furthermore, imposing a suitable version of the familiar boundary conditions in the induced boundary gauge PDE immediately leads to the conventional BMS algebra of asymptotic symmetries. Finally, we briefly sketch the construction in the case of asymptotically (A)dS gravity.</description>

It arises as the $q\to 0$ limit of the $q$-state random cluster model with $p=\beta q$. We prove that in dimensions $d\geq 3$ the arboreal gas undergoes a percolation phase transition. This contrasts with the case of $d=2$ where no percolation transition occurs.
  The starting point for our analysis is an exact relationship between the arboreal gas and a non-linear sigma model with target space the fermionic hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^{0|2}$. This latter model can be thought of as the $0$-state Potts model, with the arboreal gas being its random cluster representation. Unlike the standard Potts models, the $\mathbb{H}^{0|2}$ model has continuous symmetries. By combining a renormalisation group analysis with Ward identities we prove that this symmetry is spontaneously broken at low temperatures. In terms of the arboreal gas, this symmetry breaking translates into the existence of infinite trees in the thermodynamic limit. Our analysis also establishes massless free field correlations at low temperatures and the existence of a macroscopic tree on finite tori.</description>

      <title>Zero mode-soliton duality and pKdV kinks in Boussinesq system for non-linear shallow water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Boussinesq system for a non-linear shallow water is considered. The nonlinear and topological effects are examined through an associated matrix spectral problem. It is shown an equivalence relationship between the bound states and topological soliton charge densities which resembles a formula of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer-type index theorem. The zero mode components describe a topologically protected Kelvin wave of KdV-type and a novel Boussinesq-type field. We show that either the $1+1$ dimensional pKdV kink or the Kelvin mode can be mapped to the bulk velocity potential in $2+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Proof of $A_{n}$ AGT conjecture at $\beta=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AGT conjecture reveals a connection between 4D $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theory and 2D conformal field theory. Though some special instances have been proven, others remain elusive and the attempts on its full proof never stop. When the $\Omega$ background parameters satisfy $-\epsilon_1/\epsilon_2\equiv \beta =1$, the story simplifies a bit. A proof of the correspondence in the case of $A_{1}$ gauge group was given in 2010 by Mironov et al., while the $A_{n}$ extension is verified by Matsuo and Zhang in 2011, with an assumption on the Selberg integral of $n+1$ Schur polynomials. Then in 2020, Albion et al. obtained the rigorous result of this formula. In this paper, we show that their result is equivalent to the conjecture on Selberg integral of Schur polynomials, thus leading to the proof of the $A_{n}$ case at $\beta=1$. To perform a double check, we also directly start from this formula, and manage to show the identification between the two sides of AGT correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This introduction surveys a renormalisation group perspective on log-Sobolev inequalities and related properties of stochastic dynamics. We also explain the relationship of this approach to related recent and less recent developments such as Eldan's stochastic localisation and the F\"ollmer process, the Bou\'e--Dupuis variational formula and the Barashkov--Gubinelli approach, the transportation of measure perspective, and the classical analogues of these ideas for Hamilton--Jacobi equations which arise in mean-field limits.</description>

      <title>Classifying fermionic states via many-body correlation measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of quantum correlations in a many-body system is key to its computational treatment. For fermionic systems, correlations can be defined as deviations from Slater determinant states. The link between fermionic correlations and efficient computational physics methods is actively studied but remains ambiguous. We make progress in establishing this connection mathematically. In particular, we find a rigorous classification of states relative to $k$-fermion correlations, which admits a computational physics interpretation. Correlations are captured by a measure $\omega_k$, a function of $k$-fermion reduced density matrix that we call twisted purity. Vanishing of $\omega_k$ for a given $k$ puts the state in a class $G_k$ of correlated states. Sets $G_k$ are nested in $k$, Slater determinants correspond to $k = 1$. Various physically relevant states are in or close to $G_{k=O(1)}$, including truncated configuration-interaction states, perturbation series around Slater determinants, and some nonperturbative eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model. For each $k = O(1)$, we give an explicit ansatz with a polynomial number of parameters that covers all states in $G_k$. Potential applications of this ansatz and its connections to the coupled-cluster wavefunction are discussed.</description>

      <title>Counting $\mathcal{N} = 8$ Black Holes as Algebraic Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the helicity trace index $B_{14}$ for $\mathcal{N} = 8$ pure D-brane black holes using various techniques of computational algebraic geometry and find perfect agreement with the existing results in the literature. For these black holes, microstate counting is equivalent to finding the number of supersymmetric vacua of a multi-variable supersymmetric quantum mechanics which in turn is equivalent to solving a set of multi-variable polynomial equations with syzygies. We explore four different techniques to solve a set of polynomial equations, namely Newton Polytopes, Homotopy continuation, Monodromy and Hilbert series. Unlike other schemes, these methods are almost exact with a very high success rate for finding all solutions. A gauge invariant analysis is also possible using the symbolic Hilbert series. Furthermore, exploiting various exchange symmetries, we show the non-existence of a quartic and(or) higher order terms in the potential which if present would have spoiled the counting. Incorporating recent developments in mathematics, algorithms and multi-threading, we have extended the scope of one of the author's previous works to other charges and presented a new perspective for the microstate counting problem. This further establishes the pure D-brane system as a consistent model, bringing us a step closer to $\mathcal{N} = 2$ black hole counting.</description>

      <title>The harmonic oscillator on the Moyal-Groenewold plane: an approach via Lie groups and twisted Weyl tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the functional calculus of the harmonic oscillator on each Moyal-Groenewold plane, the noncommutative phase space which is a fundamental object in quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show that the harmonic oscillator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\omega)$ functional calculus for any angle $0 &lt; \omega &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$ and even a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus on the associated noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces, where $\Sigma_\omega=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt;\omega \}$. To achieve these results, we develop a connection with the theory of 2-step nilpotent Lie groups by introducing a notion of twisted Weyl tuple and connecting it to some semigroups of operators previously investigated by Robinson via group representations. Along the way, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{L}^p$-square-max decompositions lead to new insights between noncommutative ergodic theory and $R$-boundedness, and we prove a twisted transference principle, which is of independent interest. Our approach accommodate the presence of a constant magnetic field and they are indeed new even in the framework of magnetic Weyl calculus on classical $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. Our results contribute to the understanding of functional calculi on noncommutative spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the most basic evolution equations associated to the harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Quantum reversal: a general theory of coherent quantum absorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fascinating concept of coherent quantum absorber - which can absorb any photon emitted by another system while maintaining entanglement with that system - has found diverse implications in open quantum system theory and quantum metrology. This work generalizes the concept by proposing the so-called reversal conditions for the two systems, in which a "reverser" coherently reverses any effect of the other system on a field. The reversal conditions are rigorously boiled down to concise formulas involving the Petz recovery map and Kraus operators, thereby generalizing as well as streamlining the existing treatments of coherent absorbers.</description>

      <title>Hook-Lengths, Symplectic/Orthogonal Contents and Amdeberhan's Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symplectic/orthogonal contents of partitions are related to the dimensions of irreducible representations of symplectic/orthogonal groups. In 2012, motivated by Nekrasov-Okounkov's hook-length formula and Stanley's hook-content formula, Amdeberhan proposed several conjectures about infinite product formulas for certain generating functions of hook-lengths and symplectic/orthogonal contents. Some special cases of his conjectures were recently proved by Amdeberhan, Andrews and Ballantine. In this paper, we prove the general cases of Amdeberhan's conjectures.</description>
