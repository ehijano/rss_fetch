      <title>Further Results on Rendering Geometric Intersection Graphs Sparse by Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Removing overlaps is a central task in domains such as scheduling, visibility, and map labelling. This task can be modelled using graphs, where overlap removals correspond to enforcing a certain sparsity constraint on the graph structure. We continue the study of the problem Geometric Graph Edit Distance, where the aim is to minimise the total cost of editing a geometric intersection graph to obtain a graph contained in a specific graph class. For us, the edit operation is the movement of objects, and the cost is the movement distance. We present an algorithm for rendering the intersection graph of a set of unit circular arcs (i)~edgeless, (ii)~acyclic, and (iii)~$k$-clique-free in $O(n\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the number of arcs. We also show that the problem remains strongly NP-hard on unweighted interval graphs, solving an open problem of [Honorato-Droguett et al., WADS 2025]. We complement this result by showing that the problem is strongly NP-hard on tuples of $d$-balls and $d$-cubes, for any $d\ge 2$. Finally, we present an XP algorithm (parameterised by the number of maximal cliques) for rendering the intersection graph of a set of weighted unit intervals edgeless.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis Of Heuristic and Approximation Algorithms for the The Mutual-Visibility Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem currently lacks empirical analysis on its practical behaviour despite theoretical studies. This paper addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating three distinct algorithms -- a direct random heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic algorithm -- on diverse synthetic graph datasets, including those with analytically known $\mu(G)$ values and general graph models. Our results demonstrate that for smaller graphs, the algorithms consistently achieve MV set sizes aligning with theoretical bounds. However, for larger instances, achieved solution sizes notably diverge from theoretical limits; this, combined with the absence of tight bounds, complicates absolute quality assessment. Nevertheless, validation on known optimal graphs showed the Genetic Algorithm and other heuristics empirically performing best among tested methods.</description>
