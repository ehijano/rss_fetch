      <title>Turing chemotactic instability in an HIV model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A ternary reaction-diffusion model for early HIV infection dynamics, incorporating logistic growth of target cells, is introduced. According to in vitro and in vivo studies, random movement of target cells, infected cells, and virions and a chemotactic attraction of target cells by cytokines, are included. The research explores the existence of disease-free and coexistence equilibria, conducting linear stability analyses for homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. Specifically, conditions for chemotactic-self diffusion instability of the endemic equilibrium are found, indicating that Turing patterns may emerge when the chemotactic effect surpasses a critical threshold. This threshold is lower than in models without logistic growth of target cells, suggesting that the logistic model provides better insights into infection hot spots in the early stages. The location and shape of these patterns, crucial for developing infection control strategies, are investigated using weakly nonlinear analysis and demonstrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Epidemic waves for a two-group SIRS model with double nonlocal effects in a patchy environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a lattice dynamical system that arises in a discrete diffusive two-group epidemic model with latency in a patchy environment. The model considers the SIS form and latency of the disease in group 1, while the SIR form without latency of the disease in group 2. The system includes double nonlocal effects, one effect is the nonlocal diffusion of individuals in isolated patches or niches, while the other effect is the distributed transmission delay representing the incubation of the disease. We demonstrate that there is a threshold value $c^*$ that can determine the persistence or disappearance of the disease. If $c\geq c^*$, then there is an epidemic wave connecting the disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium. In this case, the disease will evolve to endemic. If $0&lt;c&lt;c^*$, then the disease will die out.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory equilibrium in asymmetric evolutionary games: Generalizing evolutionarily stable strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of evolutionarily stability and its relation with the fixed points of the replicator equation are important aspects of evolutionary game dynamics. In the light of the fact that oscillating state of a population and individuals (or players) of different roles are quite natural occurrences, we ask the question how the concept of evolutionarily stability can be generalized so as to associate game-theoretic meaning to oscillatory behaviours of players asymmetrically interacting, i.e., if there are both intraspecific and interspecific interactions between two subpopulations in the population. We guide our scheme of generalization such that the evolutionary stability is related to the dynamic stability of the corresponding periodic orbits of a time-discrete replicator dynamics. We name the generalization of evolutionarily stable state as two-species heterogeneity stable orbit. Furthermore, we invoke the principle of decrease of relative entropy in order to associate the generalization of evolutionary stability with an information-theoretic meaning. This particular generalization is aptly termed as two-species information stable orbit.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modelling to inform outbreak response vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical models are established tools to assist in outbreak response. They help characterise complex patterns in disease spread, simulate control options to assist public health authorities in decision-making, and longer-term operational and financial planning. In the context of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), vaccines are one of the most-cost effective outbreak response interventions, with the potential to avert significant morbidity and mortality through timely delivery. Models can contribute to the design of vaccine response by investigating the importance of timeliness, identifying high-risk areas, prioritising the use of limited vaccine supply, highlighting surveillance gaps and reporting, and determining the short- and long-term benefits. In this review, we examine how models have been used to inform vaccine response for 10 VPDs, and provide additional insights into the challenges of outbreak response modelling, such as data gaps, key vaccine-specific considerations, and communication between modellers and stakeholders. We illustrate that while models are key to policy-oriented outbreak vaccine response, they can only be as good as the surveillance data that inform them.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation in networks with well-connected cooperators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.05923v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative behavior constitutes a key aspect of human society and non-human animal systems, but explaining how cooperation evolves represents a major scientific challenge. It is now well established that social network structure plays a central role for the viability of cooperation. However, not much is known about the importance of the positions of cooperators in the networks for the evolution of cooperation. Here, we investigate how the spread of cooperation is affected by correlations between cooperativeness and individual social connectedness (such that cooperators occupy well-connected network positions). Using simulation models, we find that these correlations enhance cooperation in standard scale-free networks but not in standard Poisson networks. In contrast, when degree assortativity is increased such that individuals cluster with others of similar social connectedness, we find that Poisson networks can maintain high levels of cooperation, which can even exceed those of scale-free networks. We show that this is due to dynamics where bridge areas between social clusters act as barriers to the spread of defection. We also find that this positive effect on cooperation is sensitive to the presence of Trojan horses (defectors placed within cooperator clusters), which allow defection to invade. The results provide new knowledge about the conditions under which cooperation may evolve, and are also relevant to consider in regard to the design of cooperation studies.</description>
