      <title>Analyticity for Double Wall Carbon Nanotubes Modeled as Timoshenko Beams with Kelvin-Voigt and Intermediate Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript studies a model of double-walled carbon nanotubes using two Timoshenko beams which are coupled by the Van der Walls force $(y-u)$. Kelvin-Voigt type dampings $(u_x-v)_{xt}$ and $(y_x-z)_{xt}$ and fractional dampings $(-\partial_{xx})^\alpha v_t$ and $(-\partial_{xx})^\beta z_t$ in both beams have been considered. We show that our proposed model is well established and that the semigroup associated is exponentially stable and analytical for any $(\alpha, \beta) \in [0, 1]^2$. As a consequence of this, a result on the analyticity of a Timoshenko System is obtained.</description>

      <title>A no-contact result for a plate-fluid interaction system in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the fluid-structure interaction between a viscous incompressible fluid and an elastic plate forming its moving upper boundary in three dimensions. The fluid is described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a free upper boundary that evolves according to the motion of the structure, coupled via the velocity- and stress-matching conditions. Under the natural energy bounds and additional regularity assumptions on the weak solutions, we prove a non-contact property with a uniform separation of the plate from the rigid boundary. The result does not require damping in the plate equation.</description>

      <title>The eigentheory for nonlocal cooperative-advective system and its role in the study of free boundary system for directional epidemic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a nonlocal cooperative reaction--diffusion system with free boundaries and drift terms, motivated by directional epidemic spread. Lacking a variational structure but requiring sharper regularity of solutions, the model poses substantial analytical challenges compared with previous works~\cite{Du,Berestycki2016a,Berestycki2016b,Cao2019,NguyenVo2022,Tang2024a,Tang2024b}. We first establish the well-posedness of the local problem and the global existence and uniqueness of classical solutions in $C^1$ space.
  We then study the associated nonlocal eigenvalue problem, proving the existence, simplicity, qualitative properties, and asymptotic behavior of the principal eigenvalue. The analysis employs Fredholm theory, the Crandall--Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem, and Hadamard-type derivative formulas to describe its parameter dependence and connection with the basic reproduction number~$R_0$.
  Building on this spectral characterization, we show that the system admits a \emph{sharp vanishing--spreading dichotomy} in its long-term dynamics. When $R_0\le1$, all solutions vanish; for $R_0&gt;1$, the outcome depends on the initial domain size~$h_0$ and the free-boundary expansion rate~$\mu$. There exists a critical habitat length~$\mathcal L^\ast$ such that if $h_0&lt;\mathcal L^\ast$, a threshold $\widehat{\mu}&gt;0$ separates vanishing ($\mu\in(0,\widehat{\mu}]$) from spreading ($\mu&gt;\widehat{\mu}$). In the spreading regime, solutions converge to the unique positive steady state, while in the vanishing regime they decay uniformly to zero. These results provide a rigorous framework for the threshold dynamics of cooperative--advective nonlocal systems and offer mathematical insight for further studies in epidemic modeling, ecological invasion, and population dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Profile of Singularity Formation for the Incompressible Hydrostatic Boussinesq system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primitive equations (PEs) model planetary large-scale oceanic and atmospheric dynamics. While it has been shown that there are smooth solutions to the inviscid PEs (also called the hydrostatic Euler equations) with constant temperature (isothermal) that develop stable singularities in finite time, the effect of non-constant temperature on the singularity formation has not been established yet. This paper studies the stability of singularity formation for non-constant temperature in two scenarios: when there is no diffusion in the temperature, or when a vertical diffusivity is added to the temperature dynamics. For both scenarios, our results indicate that the variation of temperature affects neither the formation of singularity, nor its stability, in the velocity field, respectively.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions and weak-strong uniqueness for a compressible power-law-Oldroyd--B fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model of a viscoelastic compressible flow in $R^{3}$ which is additionally shear thickening (the stress tensor corresponds to the power law model, however, the divergence of the velocity is due to the model bounded). We prove existence of a weak solution to this model provided the growth in the power law model is larger or equal than $\frac 52$. We also prove that any sufficiently smooth solution of this model is unique in the class of weak solution, provided extra integrability of the initial value for the extra stress tensor is assumed.</description>

      <title>Multiple sign-changing solutions for semilinear subelliptic Dirichlet problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following perturbation from symmetry problem for the semilinear subelliptic equation \[ \left\{
  \begin{array}{cc}
  -\triangle_{X} u=f(x,u)+g(x,u) &amp; \mbox{in}~\Omega, \\[2mm]
  u\in H_{X,0}^{1}(\Omega),\hfill
  \end{array}
  \right. \] where $\triangle_{X}=-\sum_{i=1}^{m}X_{i}^{*}X_{i}$ is the self-adjoint sub-elliptic operator associated with H\"{o}rmander vector fields $X=(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{m})$, $\Omega$ is an open bounded subset in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $H_{X,0}^{1}(\Omega)$ denotes the weighted Sobolev space. We establish multiplicity results for sign-changing solutions using a perturbation method alongside refined techniques for invariant sets. The pivotal aspect lies in the estimation of the lower bounds of min-max values associated with sign-changing critical points. In this paper, we construct two distinct lower bounds of these min-max values. The first one is derived from the lower bound of Dirichlet eigenvalues of $-\triangle_{X}$, while the second one is based on the Morse-type estimates and Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum type inequality in degenerate cases. These lower bounds provide different sufficient conditions for multiplicity results, each with unique advantages and are not mutually inclusive, particularly in the general non-equiregular case. This novel observation suggests that in some sense, the situation for sub-elliptic equations would have essential difference from the classical elliptic framework.</description>

      <title>Abstract second-order boundary control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider abstract second order systems of the form $\ddot{x}(t) + D \dot{x}(t) + Sx(t)=0$, which are typically analyzed via the operator matrix $\mathcal{A}=\left[\begin{smallmatrix}
  0 &amp; I \\ -S &amp; -D
  \end{smallmatrix}\right]$ governing the free dynamics of the corresponding first-order in time formulation. While previous work (e.g. on spectral properties of) $\mathcal{A}$ has focused on self-adjoint uniformly positive $S$, we consider the more general case which comprises the situation where $S^*$ is symmetric, i.e., $S^*\subset S$. As we will show, this relaxation allows for a large freedom in view of boundary conditions. Our main contribution is the construction of a boundary triplet for the operator $\mathcal{A}$ and the definition of an associated boundary control system. We fully characterize the cases in which the latter is impedance resp. scattering passive in terms of the associated trace operators. Furthermore, based on a non-standard factorization of $S$ we introduce an equivalence transform of $\mathcal{A}$ that maps the abstract second-order system (e.g., $\mathcal{A} = \left[\begin{smallmatrix}
  0 &amp; I \\ \Delta &amp; -D
  \end{smallmatrix}\right]$ for the wave equation in position-momentum formulation) into widely-used alternative representation involving lower-order spatial derivatives on the jet space (i.e., $\left[\begin{smallmatrix}
  0 &amp; \nabla \\ \operatorname{div} &amp; -D
  \end{smallmatrix}\right]$ corresponding to the wave equation in strain-momentum formulation). We illustrate the suggested approach on the example of a $n$-dimensional wave equation and a Maxwell equation.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity and local uniqueness for an isotropic nonlocal elliptic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend monotonicity-based inversion methods to an inverse coefficient problem for the isotropic nonlocal elliptic equation
  \[
  (-\nabla \cdot \sigma \nabla)^s u = 0 \quad \text{in } \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n,
  \]
  where $0 &lt; s &lt; 1$, $n \geq 3$, and $\Omega$ is a bounded open set. We establish a monotonicity relation between the leading coefficient $\sigma$ and the (partial) exterior Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map. Our main result shows that a monotonicity ordering of the coefficients implies a corresponding ordering of the DN maps. Furthermore, we construct localized potentials for the nonlocal equation, which yield a local uniqueness result for the fractional inverse problem.</description>

      <title>On the existence of self-similar solutions to the steady Navier-Stokes equations in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with any given $(-3)$-homogeneous, locally Lipschitz external force on $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\}$, $4\leq n\leq 16$, have at least one $(-1)$-homogeneous solution which is scale-invariant and regular away from the origin. The global uniqueness of the self-similar solution is obtained as long as the external force is small. The key observation is to exploit a nice relation between the radial component of the velocity and the total head pressure under the self-similarity assumption. It plays an essential role in establishing the energy estimates. If the external force has only the nonnegative radial component, we can prove the existence of $(-1)$-homogeneous solutions for all $n\geq 4$. The regularity of the solution follows from integral estimates of the positive part of the total head pressure, which is due to the maximum principle and a ``dimension-reduction" effect arising from the self-similarity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the polyatomic Boltzmann equation based on continuous internal energy, focusing on physically relevant collision kernels of the hard potentials type with integrable angular part. We establish three main results: smoothing effects of the gain collision operator, propagation of velocity and internal energy first-order derivatives of solutions, and exponential decay estimates for singularities of the initial data. These results ultimately lead to a decomposition theorem, showing that any solution splits into a smooth part and a rapidly decaying rough component.</description>

      <title>Determining nonlinear balance laws in product-type domains by a single local passive boundary observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-theoretic paradigm for solving inverse problems in nonlinear balance laws, shifting the focus from identifying specific functional forms to recovering the input-output actions of the associated flux and source operators. It is established that a single local passive boundary observation suffices to uniquely determine realizations of these operators for systems posed on product-type domains. This framework, which encompasses dynamical regimes, reveals a holographic-type principle where macroscopic boundary data encodes microscopic dynamical information, with broad implications for fluid dynamics and reaction-diffusion systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal gradient estimates for conductivity problems with imperfect low-conductivity interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies field concentration between two nearly touching conductors separated by imperfect low-conductivity interfaces, modeled by Robin boundary conditions. It is known that for any sufficiently small interfacial bonding parameter $\gamma &gt; 0$, the gradient remains uniformly bounded with respect to the separation distance $\varepsilon$. In contrast, for the perfect bonding case ($\gamma = 0$, corresponding to the perfect conductivity problem), the gradient may blow up as $\varepsilon \to 0$ at a rate depending on the dimension. In this work, we establish optimal pointwise gradient estimates that explicitly depend on both $\gamma$ and $\varepsilon$ in the regime where these parameters are small. These estimates provide a unified framework that encompasses both the previously known bounded case ($\gamma &gt; 0$) and the singular blow-up scenario ($\gamma = 0$), thus furnishing a complete and continuous characterization of the gradient behavior throughout the transition in $\gamma$. The key technical achievement is the derivation of new regularity results for elliptic equations as $\gamma\to0$, along with a case dichotomy based on the relative sizes of $\gamma$ and a distance function $\delta(x')$. Our results hold for strictly relatively convex conductors in all dimensions $n \geq 2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fine properties of bounded weak solutions to the incompressible Euler equations whose first derivatives, or only some combinations of them, are Radon measures. As consequences we obtain elementary proofs of the local energy conservation for solutions in BV and BD, without relying on the freedom in choosing the convolution kernel appearing in the approximation of the dissipation. The argument heavily exploits the form of the Euler nonlinearity and it does not apply to the linear transport equations, where the renormalization property for BD vector fields is an open problem. The methods also yields to nontrivial conclusions when only the vorticity is assumed to be a measure.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of degenerate Fermi gases on spherical Fermi surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the description of a Fermi gas of free electrons given by the Boltzmann--Fermi--Dirac equation, and aim at providing a precise mathematical understanding of the Fermi ground state and its first-order approximation of excited states on the Fermi sphere.
  In order to achieve that, using the framework of hydrodynamic limits in collisional kinetic theory, we identify the low-temperature regimes in which charge-density fluctuations concentrate on the Fermi sphere. In three spatial dimensions or higher, we also characterize the thermodynamic equilibra and energy spectra of fluctuations. This allows us to derive the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations describing how charge densities flow and propagate in metals, thereby providing a precise description of plasma oscillations in conductors. The two-dimensional case is fundamentally different and is handled in a companion article.
  Remarkably, our results establish that excited electrons and their energy can be distributed on the Fermi sphere anisotropically, which deviates from the common intuitive assumption that electrons and their energy should be distributed uniformly in all directions.
  The hydrodynamic regimes featured in this work are akin to the acoustic limit of the classical Boltzmann equation. However, we emphasize that our derivation holds for arbitrarily fast rates of convergence of the Knudsen number, which significantly extends the applicability of the known proofs of the classical acoustic limit. This suggest that low-temperature limits of Fermi gases provide a promising avenue of research toward a complete understanding of the compressible Euler limit.</description>

      <title>$L^2$ normal velocity implies strong solution for graphical Brakke flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a one-parameter family of varifolds has an $L^2$ normal velocity $v$ in the sense of Brakke, and if the family is represented as the graph of a continuous function $f$ with continuous spatial derivative $\nabla f$, then $f$ has weak derivatives $\partial_t f, \nabla^2 f \in L^2$, and $v$ coincides with the usual normal velocity of the graph. Moreover, by combining this result with parabolic regularity theory, we show that graphical Brakke flows with forcing term in $L^{p,q}$ and $C^{0,\alpha}$ are strong and classical solutions to the forced mean curvature flow equation, respectively.</description>

      <title>Global-in-time Discontinuous Solutions for the Two-Phase Model of Compressible Fluids with Density-Dependent Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with a model describing the motion of two compressible, immiscible fluids with density-dependent viscosity in the whole $\mathbb R^3$. The phases of the flow may have different pressure and viscosity laws and are separated by a sharp interface, across which the (total) density is discontinuous. Our goal is to study the persistence of the regularity of this sharp interface over time. More precisely, the dynamics of the flow are governed by three coupled equations: two hyperbolic equations (for the volume fraction of one phase and for the density) and a parabolic equation for the velocity field. We assume that, at the initial time, the density is $\alpha$-H\"older continuous on both sides of a $\mathscr C^{1+\alpha}$-regular surface across which it may be discontinuous. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a global-in-time weak solution in an intermediate regularity class that ensures the persistence of the piecewise H\"older regularity of the density and the $\mathscr C^{1+\alpha}$ regularity of the sharp interface.</description>

      <title>Introduction to quantitative De Giorgi methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of De Giorgi (1958) and Nash (1959) solves Hilbert's 19th problem and constitutes a major advance in the analysis of PDEs in the 20th century. This theory concerns the H\"older regularity of solutions to elliptic and parabolic equations with non-regular coefficients, and it was extended by Moser (1960) to include the Harnack inequality. This course reviews the classical De Giorgi method in the elliptic and parabolic cases and introduces its recent extension to hypoelliptic equations which appear naturally in kinetic theory. The simplest case is the Kolmogorov equation with a rough diffusion coefficients matrix in the kinetic variable. We present compactness arguments but emphasize the recently developed quantitative methods based on the construction of trajectories. These lecture notes are self-contained and can be used as a general introduction to the topic.</description>

      <title>Gaussian beam interactions and inverse source problems for nonlinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inverse source problem for the semilinear wave equation \[ (\Box_g + q_1)u + q_2 u^2 = F, \] on a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold. We demonstrate that the coefficients $q_1$ and $q_2$, as well as the source term $F$, can be recovered up to a natural gauge symmetry inherent in the problem from local measurements. Furthermore, if $q_1$ is known, we establish the unique recovery of the source $F$, which is in a striking contrast to inverse source problems for linear equations where unique recovery is not possible. Our results also generalize previous works by eliminating the assumption that $u= 0$ is a solution, and by accommodating quadratic nonlinearities.
  A key contribution is the development of a calculus for nonlinear interactions of Gaussian beams. This framework provides an explicit representation for waves that correspond to sources involving products of two or more Gaussian beams. We anticipate this calculus will serve as a versatile tool in related problems, offering a concrete alternative to Fourier integral operator methods.</description>

      <title>An inverse problem for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the study of inverse boundary value problems to the setting of fully nonlinear PDEs by considering an inverse source problem for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation
  \[
  \det D^2 u = F.
  \]
  We prove that, on a convex Euclidean domain in the plane, the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map uniquely determines a positive source function $F$. The proof relies on recovering the Hessian of a solution to the equation, which is interpreted as a Riemannian metric $g$. Interestingly, although the equation is posed on a Euclidean domain, the inverse problem becomes anisotropic since the metric $g$ appears as a coefficient matrix in the linearized equation.
  As an intermediate step, we prove that the DN map of the non-divergence form equation
  \[
  g^{ab} \partial_{ab} v = 0
  \]
  uniquely determines the conformal class of the metric $g$ on a simply connected planar domain, without the usual diffeomorphism invariance.
  To address the challenges of full nonlinearity, we develop asymptotic expansions for complex geometric optics solutions in the planar setting and solve a resulting nonlocal
  $\overline{\partial}$-equation by proving a unique continuation principle for it. These techniques are expected to be applicable to a wide range of inverse problems for nonlinear equations.</description>

      <title>Fujita-type results for parabolic equations with Hartree-type nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the critical behavior of global solutions to a parabolic equation with a Hartree-type nonlinearity of the form $$\left\{\begin{array}{ll} u_{t}+(-\Delta)^{\frac{\beta}{2}} u= (\mathcal{K}\ast |u|^{p})|u|^{q},&amp;\qquad x\in \mathbb{R}^n,\,\,\,t&gt;0,
  u(x,0)=u_{0}(x),&amp; \qquad x\in \mathbb{R}^n,\end{array}
  \right.$$ where $\beta\in(0,2]$, $n\geq1$, $p&gt;1$, $q\geq 1$, $(-\Delta)^{\frac{\beta}{2}},\,\beta\in(0,2)$ denotes the fractional Laplacian, the symbol $\ast$ denotes the convolution operation in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $\mathcal{K}:(0,\infty)\rightarrow(0,\infty)$ is a continuous function such that $\mathcal{K}(|\cdotp|)\in L^1_{{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and is monotonically decreasing in a neighborhood of infinity. We establish conditions for the global nonexistence of solutions to the problem under consideration, thereby partially improving some results of Filippucci and Ghergu in [Discrete Contin. Dyn. Syst. A, 42 (2022) 1817-1833] and [Nonlinear Anal., 221 (2022) 112881]. In addition, we establish local and global existence results in the case where the convolution term corresponds to the Riesz potential. Our methodology relies on the nonlinear capacity method and the fixed-point principle, combined with the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality.</description>

      <title>A family of interaction energy minimizers supported on two intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the one-dimensional interaction energy $\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}(W*\rho)(x)d\rho(x) + \int_{\mathbb{R}}U(x)d\rho(x)$ where the interaction potential $W(x)= -\frac{|x|^b}{b},\,1\le b \le 2$ and the external potential $U(x)=\frac{|x|^4}{4}$, and $\rho$ is a compactly supported probability measure on the real line. Our main result shows that the minimizer is supported on two intervals when $1&lt;b&lt;2$, showing in particular how the support of the minimizer transits from an interval (when $b=1$) to two points (when $b=2$) as $b$ increases. As a crucial part of the proof, we develop a new version of the iterated balayage algorithm, the original version of which was designed by Benko, Damelin, Dragnev and Kuijlaars for logarithmic potentials in one dimension. We expect the methodology in this paper can be generalized to study minimizers of interaction energies in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose support is possibly an annulus.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Homogenization of the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article establishes a stochastic homogenization result for the first order Hamilton-Jacobi equation on a Riemannian manifold $M$, in the context of a stationary ergodic random environment. The setting involves a finitely generated abelian group $ \mathtt{G}$ of rank $b$ acting on $M$ by isometries in a free, totally discontinuous, and co-compact manner, and a family of Hamiltonians $H: T^*M \times \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$, parametrized over a probability space $(\Omega, \mathbb{P})$, which are stationary with respect to a $\mathbb{P}$-ergodic action of $\mathtt{G}$ on $\Omega$. Under standard assumptions, including strict convexity and coercivity in the momentum variable, we prove that as the scaling parameter $\varepsilon$ goes to $0$, the viscosity solutions to the rescaled equation converge almost surely and locally uniformly to the solution to a deterministic homogenized Hamilton-Jacobi equation posed on $\mathbb{R}^b$, which corresponds to the asymptotic cone of $\mathtt{G}$. In particular, this approach sheds light on the relation between the limit problem, the limit space, and the complexity of the acting group. The classical periodic case corresponds to a randomness set $\Omega$ that reduces to a singleton; other interesting examples of this setting are also described.
  We remark that the effective Hamiltonian $\overline{H}$ is obtained as the convex conjugate of an effective Lagrangian $\overline{L}$, which generalizes Mather's $\beta$-function to the stochastic setting; this represents a first step towards the development of a stationary-ergodic version of Aubry-Mather theory. As a geometric application, we introduce a notion of stable-like norm for stationary ergodic families of Riemannian metrics on $M$, which generalizes the classical Federer-Gromov's stable norm for closed manifolds.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study Young functions, a measure-theoretic model for multiple-valued functions, and the convergence of pairs of measures and Young functions via their associated graph measures. This setting allows us to study the convergence of pairs of surfaces and functions thereon, and a compactness theorem is immediate. To develop notions of differentiability of Young functions in the upcoming papers, we also introduce and investigate several test function spaces.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the wave equation with Dirac damping on a compact star graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the wave equation with a distributional Dirac damping and Dirichlet boundary conditions on a compact interval. It is shown that the spectrum of the corresponding wave operator is fully determined by zeroes of an entire function. Consequently, a considerable change of spectral properties is shown for certain critical values of the damping parameter. We also derive a definitive criterion for the Riesz basis property of the root vectors for an arbitrary placement of a complex-valued Dirac damping. Finally, we consider a generalisation of the problem for compact star graphs and provide insight into the essence of the critical damping constant.</description>

      <title>Local Rigidity of Quasi--Lie Brackets on Quaternionic Banach Modules and Applications to Nonlinear PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a local rigidity theorem for quasi--Lie brackets on quaternionic Banach right modules. Under quantitative control of antisymmetry and Jacobi defects, we construct an explicit bilinear correction that preserves right $\mathbb{H}$--linearity and restores the exact Lie property. The approach combines a radial homotopy operator, a controlled Neumann-series inversion, and a finite-rank adjustment, all with explicit operator estimates. This constructive framework bridges quaternionic functional analysis with rigidity theory and yields concrete applications to nonlinear PDEs, including local well-posedness and Beale--Kato--Majda continuation criteria with explicit thresholds.</description>

      <title>A continued fraction approximation for the effective elasticity tensor of two-dimensional polycrystals as a function of the crystal elasticity tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For two-dimensional polycrystals the effective elasticity tensor $C_*$ as a function $C_*(C_0)$ of the elasticity tensor $C_0$ of the constituent crystal is considered. It is shown that this function can be approximated by one with a continued fraction expansion resembling that associated with a class of microstructure known as sequential laminates. These are hierarchical microstructures defined inductively. Rank 0 sequential laminates are simply rotations of the pure crystal. Rank $j$ sequential laminates are obtained by laminating together, on a length scale much larger that the existing microstructure and with interfaces perpendicular to some direction $n_j$, rank $j-1$ sequential laminates with a rotation of the pure crystal. The continued fraction approximation for arbitrary polycrystal microstructures typically takes a more general form than that of sequential laminates, but has some free parameters. It is an open question as to whether these free parameters can always be adjusted so the continued fraction approximation matches exactly that of a sequential laminate. If so, one would have established that the elastic response of two-dimensional polycrystals can always be mimicked by that of sequential laminates. Our analysis carries over to the more general case where the strain is replaced by a field $E(x)$ that is the gradient of a vector potential $u(x)$, i.e. $E=\nabla u$ and the stress is replaced by a matrix valued field $J(x)$ that need not be symmetric but has zero divergence $\nabla\cdot J=0$. The tensor $L(x)$ entering the constitutive relation $J=L E$ is locally a rotation of the tensor $L_0$ of the pure crystal that need not have any special symmetries and has 16 independent tensor elements.</description>

      <title>Construction of harmonic coordinates for weak immersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any weak immersion in the critical Sobolev space $W^{\frac{n}{2}+1,2}(\mathbb{R}^n;\mathbb{R}^d)$ in even dimension $n\geq 4$, has global harmonic coordinates if its second fundamental form is small in the Sobolev space $W^{\frac{n}{2}-1,2}(\mathbb{R}^n;\mathbb{R}^d)$. This is a generalization to arbitrary even dimension $n\ge 4$ of a famous result of M\"uller--Sverak \cite{muller1995} for $n=2$. The existence of such coordinates is a key tool used by the authors in \cite{MarRiv20252} for the analysis of scale-invariant Lagrangians of immersions, such as the Graham--Reichert functional. From a purely intrinsic perspective, the proof of the main result leads to a general local existence theorem of harmonic coordinates for general metrics with Riemann tensor in $L^p$ for any $p&gt;n/2$ in any dimension $n\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Dynamical Analysis of Fractional Discrete Laplacians on the Half-Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate discrete fractional Laplacians defined on the half-lattice in several dimensions, allowing possibly different fractional orders along each coordinate direction. By expressing the half-lattice operator as a boundary restriction of the full-lattice one plus a bounded correction that is relatively compact with respect to it, we show that both operators share the same essential spectrum and the same interior threshold structure. For perturbations by a decaying potential, the conjugate-operator method provides a strict Mourre estimate on any compact energy window inside the continuous spectrum, excluding threshold points. As a consequence, a localized Limiting Absorption Principle holds, ensuring the absence of singular continuous spectrum, the finiteness of eigenvalues, and weighted propagation (transport) bounds. The form-theoretic construction also extends naturally to negative fractional orders. Overall, the relative compactness of the boundary correction guarantees that the interior-energy spectral and dynamical results obtained on the full lattice remain valid on the half-lattice without modification.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear stability problem for black hole solutions of the Einstein equations critically depends on choosing an appropriate geometric gauge. In the vacuum setting, the use of Generally Covariant Modulated (GCM) spheres and hypersurfaces has played a central role in the proof of stability for slowly rotating Kerr spacetime. In this work, we develop an alternative GCM framework, that we call mass-centered, designed to overcome the breakdown of the standard GCM construction in the charged case, where electromagnetic-gravitational coupling destroys the exceptional behavior of the $\ell=1$ mode of the center-of-mass quantity used in the vacuum analysis. This construction is aimed at the nonlinear stability of Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr-Newman spacetimes. Our approach replaces transport-based control of the center-of-mass quantity with a sphere-wise vanishing condition on a renormalized $\ell=1$ mode, yielding mass-centered GCM hypersurfaces with modified gauge constraints. The resulting elliptic-transport system remains determined once an $\ell=1$ basis is fixed via effective uniformization and provides an alternative construction in vacuum in the uncharged limit.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Maxwell Equations on Mass-Centered GCM Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resolution of the nonlinear stability of black holes as solutions to the Einstein equations relies crucially on imposing the right geometric gauge conditions. In the vacuum case, the use of Generally Covariant Modulated (GCM) spheres and hypersurfaces has been successful in the proof of stability for slowly rotating Kerr spacetime. For the charged setting, our companion paper introduced an alternative mass-centered GCM framework, adapted to the additional difficulties of the Einstein-Maxwell system.
  In this work, we solve the Einstein-Maxwell equations on such a mass-centered spacelike GCM hypersurface, which is equivalent to solving the constraint equations there. We control all geometric quantities of the solution in terms of some seed data, corresponding to the gauge-invariant fields describing coupled gravitational-electromagnetic radiation in perturbations of Reissner-Nordstr\"om or Kerr-Newman, first identified by the second author and expected to be governed by favorable hyperbolic equations. This provides the first step toward controlling gauge-dependent quantities in the nonlinear stability analysis of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr-Newman families.</description>

      <title>Existence and numerical approximation of a one-dimensional Boussinesq system with variable coefficients on a finite interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the well-posedness of a nonlinear dispersive model with variable coefficients that describes the evolution of surface waves propagating through a one-dimensional shallow water channel of finite length with irregular bottom topography. To complement the theoretical analysis, we utilize the numerical solver developed by the authors in \cite{PizoMunoz} to approximate solutions of the model on a finite spatial interval, considering various parameter values and forms of the variable coefficients in the Boussinesq system under study. Additionally, we present preliminary numerical experiments addressing an inverse problem: the reconstruction of the initial wave elevation and fluid velocity from measurements taken at a final time. This is achieved by formulating an optimization problem in which the initial conditions are estimated as minimizers of a functional that quantifies the discrepancy between the observed final state and the numerical solution evolved from a trial initial state.</description>

      <title>An efficient iteration method to reconstruct the drift term from the final measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the inverse drift problem in the one-dimensional parabolic equation with the final time data. The authors construct an operator first, whose fixed points are the unknown drift, and then apply it to prove the uniqueness. The proof of uniqueness contains an iteration converging to the drift, which inspires the numerical algorithm. To handle the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, the authors add the mollification on the data first in the iterative algorithm, and then provide some numerical results.</description>

      <title>On the boundedness of dilation operators in the context of Triebel-Lizorkin-Morrey spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the behavior of dilation operators $ D_\lambda \colon f \mapsto f(\lambda\,\cdot) $ with $ \lambda &gt; 1 $ in the context of Triebel-Lizorkin-Morrey spaces $\mathcal{E}^{s}_{u,p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. For that purpose we prove upper and lower bounds for the operator (quasi-)norm $\| D_\lambda \,|\, \mathcal{L}\big(\mathcal{E}^s_{u,p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)\big) \| $. We show that for $s&gt;\sigma_p $ the operator (quasi-)norm $\| D_\lambda \,|\, \mathcal{L}\big(\mathcal{E}^s_{u,p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)\big) \| $ up to constants behaves as $\lambda^{s - \frac{d}{u}} $. For the borderline case $ s = \sigma_{p} $ we observe a behavior of the form $\lambda^{\sigma_p- \frac{d}{u}}$, multiplied with logarithmic terms of $\lambda$ that also depend on the fine index $q$. For $s &lt; \sigma_{p}$ and $p \geq 1$ we find the relation $\| D_\lambda \,|\, \mathcal{L}\big(\mathcal{E}^s_{u,p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)\big) \| \sim \lambda^{ - \frac{d}{u}}$. The case $s &lt; \sigma_{p}$ and $p &lt; 1$ is investigated as well. Our proofs are mainly based on the Fourier analytic approach to Triebel-Lizorkin-Morrey spaces. As byproducts we show an advanced Fourier multiplier theorem for band-limited functions in the context of Morrey spaces and derive some new equivalent (quasi-)norms and characterizations of $\mathcal{E}^{s}_{u,p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$.

Abstract: We show the validity of Nachman's procedure (\textit{Ann. Math.} 128(3):531--576, 1988) for reconstructing a conductivity $\gamma$ from its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map $\Lambda_\gamma$ for less regular conductivities, specifically $\gamma \in W^{3/2,2n}(\Omega)$ such that $\gamma \equiv 1$ near $\partial \Omega$. We also obtain a log-type stability estimate for the inverse problem when $\gamma$ has slightly higher regularity, i.e., $\gamma \in W^{2-s,n/s}(\Omega)$ for $0 &lt; s &lt;1/2$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that if $L_p$ Gaussian surface area measure is proportional to the spherical Lebesgue measure, then the corresponding convex body has to be a centered disk when $p\in[0,1)$. Moreover, we investigate $C^0$ estimate of the corresponding convex bodies when the density function of their Gaussian surface area measures have the uniform upper and lower bound. We obtain convex bodies' uniform upper and lower bound when $p=0$ in asymmetric situation and $p\in(0,1)$ in symmetric situation. In fact, for $p\in(0,1)$ , there is a counterexample to claim the uniform bound does not exist in asymmetric situation.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of aggregation-diffusion systems with irregular kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider aggregation-diffusion equations with merely bounded nonlocal interaction potential $K$. We are interested in establishing their well-posedness theory when the nonlocal interaction potential $K$ is neither differentiable nor positive (semi-)definite, thus preventing application of classical arguments. We prove the existence of weak solutions in two cases: if the mass of the initial data is sufficiently small, or if the interaction potential is symmetric and of bounded variation without any smallness assumption. The latter allows one to exploit the dissipation of the free energy in an optimal way, which is an entirely new approach. Remarkably, in both cases, under the additional condition that $\nabla K\ast K$ is in $L^2$, we can prove that the solution is smooth and unique. When $K$ is a characteristic function of a ball, we construct the classical unique solution. Under additional structural conditions we extend these results to the $n$-species system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the construction and usage of mimetic operators in curvilinear staggered grids. Specifically, we extend the Corbino-Castillo operators so they can be utilized to solve problems in non-trivial geometries. We prove that the resulting curvilinear operators satisfy the discrete analog of the extended Gauss-Divergence theorem. In addition, we demonstrate energy and mass conservation in curvilinear coordinates for the acoustic wave equation. These findings are illustrated in two-dimensional and three-dimensional elliptic/hyperbolic equations and can be extended to other partial differential equations as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the higher integrability of Green's functions associated with the second-order elliptic equation $a^{ij}D_{ij}u + b^i D_iu = f$ in a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, and establish an enhanced version of Aleksandrov's maximum principle. In particular, we consider the drift term $b=(b^1, \ldots, b^d)$ in $L_d$ and the source term $f \in L_p$ for some $p &lt; d$. This provides an alternative and analytic proof of a result by N. V. Krylov (\textit{Ann. Probab.}, 2021) concerning $L_d$ drifts. The key step involves deriving a Gehring-type inequality for Green's functions by using the Fabes-Stroock approach (\textit{Duke Math.

Abstract: We study fine P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} rearrangement inequalities into weighted intervals for Sobolev functions and functions of bounded variation defined on metric measure spaces supporting an isoperimetric inequality. We then specialize this theory to spaces with synthetic Ricci lower bounds and characterize equality cases under minimal assumptions. As applications of our theory, we show new results around geometric and functional inequalities under Ricci lower bounds answering also questions raised in the literature. Finally, we study further settings and deduce a Faber-Krahn theorem on Euclidean spaces with radial log-convex densities, a boosted P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality with asymmetry reminder on weighted convex cones, the rigidity of Sobolev inequalities on Euclidean spaces outside a convex set and a general lower bound for Neumann eigenvalues on open sets in metric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05410v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of small and large solutions to a broad class of nonlinear Dirac-type equations. Our results are classified in 1D massless and massive cases, 3D general and $n$ dimensional in generality. In the 1D massless case we prove that any globally defined solution converges to zero as time tends to infinity, within a spatial region expanding at a rate proportional to $ t \log^{-2} t$. This result holds without assumptions on the smallness of initial data or specific power of nonlinearity, ruling out the existence of standing breather-like or solitary wave structures in this regime. In the 1D massive case, solitary waves are known to exist. Introducing new virial identities adapted to the Dirac's distinctive algebra, we prove that there are ``holomorphic'' odd nonlinearities under which globally defined small odd solutions decay to zero on spatial compact sets as time tends to infinity. This result is extended to the 3D case under boundedness of the $H^1$ norm but without requiring the parity condition on the data, giving decay proofs for an important class of nonlinear Dirac models, and opening the door to the future use of virial identities to prove asymptotic stability of well-chosen Dirac solitary waves.
  Finally, in higher dimensions $ n \geq 1$, we prove the $L^2$ decay for global solutions of nonlinear Dirac equations in the ``exterior light-cone'' region. This confirms the non-existence of breathers and other solutions propagating faster than the speed of light. Our proofs rely on carefully constructed weighted virial identities.</description>

Math. 434 (2023)) where the case of quadratically growing Lagrangians was treated.</description>

      <title>Essentials of Real Analysis and Morrey-Sobolev spaces for second-order elliptic and parabolic PDEs with singular first-order coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14863v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years we witness growing interest in using Real Analysis methods and results in the theory of nondivergence form partial differential equations (PDEs) and the goal of this article is to give a brief and concise introduction into the applications of several results in Real Analysis to the theory of elliptic and parabolic equations in Sobolev and Morrey-Sobolev spaces. In particular, we concentrate on such results as Hardy-Littlewood maximal function theorem, Fefferman-Stein theorem, theory of Muckenhoupt weights, and Rubio de Francia extrapolation theorem and their role in Sobolev or Morrey-Sobolev space theory of parabolic equations with mixed norms.
  In our exposition we do not try to give the strongest known results for particular equations in particular spaces. We only show how the Real Analysis results, we present with all proofs, can be used in model cases such as the Laplace and the heat equations with singular first order terms. The only exception is the last section where we present new results.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of 3D focusing, energy-critical wave equation with radial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we discuss the long-time dynamics of the radial solutions to the energy-critical wave equation in 3-dimensional space. Given a solution defined for all time $t\geq 0$, we show that the soliton resolution phenomenon happens at all times $t&gt;0$ except for a few relatively short time intervals. The main tool is the radiation theory of wave equations and the major observation of this work is a correspondence between the energy radiation and the soliton resolution/collision behaviour of solutions. We also give a few applications of the main observation on the type II blow-up solutions and ``one pass'' theory near pure mutli-solitons.</description>

      <title>Long-time behaviour and bifurcation analysis of a two-species aggregation-diffusion system on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate stationary states, including their existence and stability, in a class of nonlocal aggregation-diffusion equations with linear diffusion and symmetric nonlocal interactions. For the scalar case, we extend previous results by showing that key model features, such as existence, regularity, bifurcation structure, and stability exchange, continue to hold under a mere bounded variation hypothesis. For the corresponding two-species system, we carry out a fully rigorous bifurcation analysis using the bifurcation theory of Crandall &amp; Rabinowitz. This framework allows us to classify all solution branches from homogeneous states, with particular attention given to those arising from the self-interaction strength and the cross-interaction strength, as well as the stability of the branch at a point of critical stability. The analysis relies on an equivalent classification of solutions through fixed points of a nonlinear map, followed by a careful derivation of Fr\'echet derivatives up to third order. An interesting application to cell-cell adhesion arises from our analysis, yielding stable segregation patterns that appear at the onset of cell sorting in a modelling regime where all interactions are purely attractive.</description>

      <title>Classification of entire and ancient solutions of the diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the diffusive HJ eq. with Dirichlet conditions, which arises in stochastic control as well as in KPZ type models of surface growth. It is known that, for $p&gt;2$ and suitably large, smooth initial data, the sol. undergoes finite time gradient blowup on the boundary. On the other hand, Liouville type rigidity or classif. ppties play a central role in the study of qualitative behavior in nonlinear elliptic and parabolic problems, and notably appear in the famous BCN conjecture about one-dimensionality of solutions in a half-space. With this motivation, we study the Liouville type classif. and symmetry ppties for entire and ancient sol. in $\R^n$ and in a half-space with Dirichlet B.C.
  - First, we show that any ancient sol. in $\R^n$ with sublinear upper growth at infinity is necessarily constant. This result is {\it optimal}, in view of explicit examples and solves a long standing open problem.
  - Next we turn to the half-space problem for $p&gt;2$ and we completely classify entire solutions: any entire sol. is stationary and one-dimensional. The assumption is sharp in view of explicit examples for $p=2$.
  - Then we show that the situation is also completely different for ancient sol. in a half-space: there exist nonstationary ancient sol. for all $p&gt;1$.
  Nevertheless, we show that any ancient sol. is necessarily positive, and that stationarity and one-dimensionality are recovered provided a -- close to optimal -- polynomial growth restriction is imposed on the sol.
  - In addition we establish new and optimal, local estimates of Bernstein and Li-Yau type.
  The proofs of the Liouville and classif. results are delicate, based on integral estimates, a translation-compactness procedure and comparison arguments, combined with our Bernstein and Li-Yau type estimates.</description>

      <title>Mean-field approximation, Gibbs relaxation, and cross estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the propagation of chaos and relaxation to Gibbs equilibrium for a system of $N$ classical Brownian particles with weak mean-field interactions. It is well known that propagation of chaos holds uniformly in time with rate $O(N^{-1})$ and that Gibbs relaxation holds uniformly in $N$ with exponential rate $O(e^{-ct})$. We go one step further by establishing a cross estimate that simultaneously captures both effects: the joint deviation between chaos propagation and Gibbs relaxation is of order $O(N^{-1}e^{-ct})$. In particular, for translation-invariant systems, this yields an accelerated propagation of chaos, with the mean-field approximation error at the level of the one-particle density improving from $O(N^{-1})$ to $O(N^{-1}e^{-ct})$. Our approach relies on a detailed analysis of the BBGKY hierarchy for correlation functions, and applies to both underdamped and overdamped Langevin dynamics with merely bounded interaction forces. In addition, we obtain new quantitative results on Gibbs relaxation and provide partial extensions beyond the weak interaction regime.</description>

      <title>Weighted estimates for the Stokes semigroup in the half-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the initial-boundary value problem for the Stokes system in the half-space, within the framework of weighted Lebesgue spaces. Introducing a new weight function defined via a product of powers of distances from fixed points, we establish existence, uniqueness, and regularity results for strong solutions to the Stokes problem in the half space. Our analysis generalizes previous results for the Stokes system in radial-weighted spaces (Galdi and Maremonti, J. Math. Fluid Mech. 25:7,2023; Maremonti and Pane, J. Math. Fluid Mech. 27:2,2025) and extends the theory to our setting. These results represent a first step toward the analysis of the Navier-Stokes system in weighted spaces, with applications in both half-space and exterior domain configurations.</description>

      <title>Global existence of the irrotational Euler-Nordstr\"om equations with a positive cosmological constant: The gravitational field equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our objective is to demonstrate the global existence of classical solutions for the nonlinear irrotational Euler-Nordstr\"om system, which includes a linear equation of state and a cosmological constant. In this framework, the gravitational field is represented by a single scalar function that satisfies a specific semi-linear wave equation. We focus on spatially periodic deviations from the background metric, which is why we study the semi-linear wave equation on the three-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ within the Sobolev spaces $H^m(\mathbb{T}^3)$. This work is divided into two parts. First, we examine the Nordstr\"om equation with a source term generated by an irrotational fluid governed by a linear equation of state. In the second part, we analyze the full coupled system. One reason for this separation is that an irrotational fluid with a linear equation of state introduces a source term for the Nordstr\"om equation containing a nonlinear term of fractional order. This nonlinearity precludes the direct application of the techniques used in our earlier work \cite{Brauer_Karp_23}, where we relied on symmetric hyperbolic systems, energy estimates, and homogeneous Sobolev spaces. Instead, we develop an appropriate energy functional and establish the corresponding energy estimates tailored to the wave equation under consideration.</description>

      <title>Non-degeneracy and uniqueness of ground states to nonlinear elliptic equations with mixed local and nonlocal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the non-degeneracy and uniqueness of ground states to the following nonlinear elliptic equation with mixed local and nonlocal operators, $$ -\Delta u +(-\Delta)^s u + \lambda u=|u|^{p-2}u \quad \mbox{in} \,\,\, B, \quad u=0 \quad \mbox{in} \,\,\, \R^N \backslash {B}, $$ where $N \geq 2$, $0&lt;s&lt;1$, $2&lt;p&lt;2^*:=\frac{2N}{(N-2)^+}$, $\lambda &gt; -\lambda_1$, $(-\Delta)^s$ denotes the fractional Laplacian, $\lambda_1&gt;0$ denotes the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the operator $-\Delta +(-\Delta)^s$ in $B$ and $B$ denotes the unit ball in $\R^N$. We prove that the second eigenvalue to the linearized operator $-\Delta +(-\Delta)^s -(p-1)u^{p-2}$ in the space of radially symmetric functions is simple, the corresponding eigenfunction changes sign precisely once in the radial direction, where $u$ is a ground state. By deriving a new Hopf type lemma, we then get that $-\lambda$ cannot be an eigenvalue of the linearized operator, which in turns leads to the non-degeneracy of ground states. Moreover, by establishing a Picone type identity with respect to antisymmetric functions, we then derive the non-degeneracy of ground states in the space of non-radially symmetric functions. Relying on the non-degeneracy of ground states and adapting a blow-up argument together with a continuation argument, we then obtain the uniqueness of ground states.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of energy equality for weak solutions of the 3D incompressible fractional Navier-Stokes / MHD equations. With the help of the technique of symmetrization and interpolation method, we obtain some new sufficient conditions including the Sobolev multiplier spaces, which insures the validity of the energy equality of the weak solution to fractional MHD equations. Correspondingly, the results of fractional Navier-Stokes equations are obtained. And these energy equations are usually related to the uniqueness of solutions to the corresponding fractional Navier-Stokes / MHD equations.</description>

Abstract: We consider dynamic boundary conditions involving non-local operators. Our analysis includes a detailed description of such operators together with their relations with random times and random (additive) functionals. We provide some new characterizations for the boundary behaviour of the Brownian motion based on the interplay between non-local operators and boundary value problems. Our main focus is on Feller-Wentzell diffusions with jumps (resetting/restart). We first consider the instructive case of the real line, then we extend our results on star graphs with trapping points or repulsive vertices.</description>

      <title>Sharp local propagation of chaos for mean field particles with $W^{-1,\infty}$ kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two methods to obtain $O(1/N^2)$ local propagation of chaos bounds for $N$ diffusive particles in $W^{-1,\infty}$ mean field interaction. This extends the recent finding of Lacker [Probab. Math. Phys., 4(2):377-432, 2023] to the case of singular interactions. The first method is based on a hierarchy of relative entropies and Fisher informations, and applies to the 2D viscous vortex model in the high temperature regime. Time-uniform local chaos bounds are also shown in this case. In the second method, we work on a hierarchy of $L^2$ distances and Dirichlet energies, and derive the desired sharp estimates for the same model in short time without restrictions on the temperature.</description>

      <title>Weyl Law and convergence in the classical limit for min-max nonlocal minimal surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12162v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonlocal minimal surfaces as a new approximation theory for the area functional, and more specifically in the context of Yau's conjecture on the existence of minimal surfaces in closed three-dimensional manifolds. This programme offers an alternative to the Almgren--Pitts and Allen--Cahn approaches, with advantageous features both from the existence and regularity viewpoints.
  We build on recent work in which the author and collaborators constructed infinitely many nonlocal $s$-minimal hypersurfaces (via min-max methods) on any closed $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$, establishing a full analogue of Yau's conjecture for $s\in(0,1)$.
  The present article first proves a Weyl-type Law for the fractional perimeters of these hypersurfaces. The rest -- and main part -- of the article is devoted to obtaining uniform estimates (in the classical limit $s\to 1$) for min-max $s$-minimal surfaces in closed three-manifolds, eventually establishing their convergence to smooth, classical minimal surfaces. We recover in particular recent results on existence, generic density and equidistribution of minimal surfaces, which are a strong form of Yau's conjecture in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce an original hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on a variational quantum algorithm for solving systems of differential equations. The algorithm relies on a spectral decomposition of the trial functions that are encoded directly in the quantum states generated by different parametrized circuits, and transforms the task of solving the differential equations into an optimization problem. We first describe the principle of the algorithm from a theoretical point of view. We provide a detailed pseudo-code of the algorithm, on which we elaborate preliminary elements for a complexity analysis to highlight some of its scaling properties. We apply our algorithm to a set of examples, running on emulators and real hardware showcasing its applicability across diverse sets of differential equations. We discuss the advantages of our method and potential avenues for further exploration and refinement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a primal-dual dynamical formulation of the multi-marginal optimal transport problem for (semi-)convex cost functions. Even in the two-marginal setting, this formulation applies to cost functions not covered by the classical dynamical approach of Benamou-Brenier. Our dynamical formulation yields a convex optimization problem, enabling the use of convex optimization tools to find quasi-Monge solutions of the static multi-marginal problem for translation-invariant costs. We illustrate our results numerically with proximal splitting methods.</description>
