      <title>Kinetic data-driven approach to turbulence subgrid modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent flows are well known to pose extreme computational challenges due to the huge number of dynamical degrees of freedom required to correctly describe the complex multi-scale statistical correlations of the velocity. On the other hand, kinetic mesoscale approaches based on the Boltzmann equation, have the potential to describe a broad range of flows, stretching well beyond the special case of gases close to equilibrium, which results in the ordinary Navier-Stokes dynamics. Here we demonstrate that, by properly tuning, a kinetic approach can statistically reproduce the quantitative dynamics of the larger scales in turbulence, thereby providing an alternative, computationally efficient and physically rooted approach towards subgrid scale (SGS) modeling in turbulence. More specifically we show that by leveraging on data from fully resolved Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data we can learn a collision operator for the discretized Boltzmann equation solver (the lattice Boltzmann method), which effectively implies a turbulence subgrid closure model. The mesoscopic nature of our formulation makes the learning problem fully local in both space and time, leading to reduced computational costs and enhanced generalization capabilities. We show that the model offers superior performance compared to traditional methods, such as the Smagorinsky model, being less dissipative and, therefore, being able to more closely capture the intermittency of higher-order velocity correlations.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in a vertical channel. Part 2. Oblique solutions and global bifurcations in a spanwise-extended domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical thermal convection is a non-equilibrium system in which both buoyancy and shear forces play a role in driving the convective flow. Beyond the onset of convection, the driven dissipative system exhibits chaotic dynamics and turbulence. In a three-dimensional domain extended in both the vertical and the transverse dimensions, Gao et al. (2018) have observed a variety of convection patterns which are not described by linear stability analysis. We investigate the fully non-linear dynamics of vertical convection using a dynamical-systems approach based on the Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations. We compute the invariant solutions of these equations and the bifurcations that are responsible for the creation and termination of various branches. We map out a sequence of local bifurcations from the laminar base state, including simultaneous bifurcations involving patterned steady states with different symmetries. This atypical phenomenon of multiple branches simultaneously bifurcating from a single parent branch is explained by the role of D4 symmetry. In addition, two global bifurcations are identified: first, a homoclinic cycle from modulated transverse rolls and second, a robust heteroclinic cycle linking two symmetry-related diamond-roll patterns. These are confirmed by phase space projections as well as the functional form of the divergence of the period close to the bifurcation points. The intricacy of this bifurcation diagram highlights the essential role played by dynamical systems theory and computation in hydrodynamic configurations.</description>

      <title>Deep polytopic autoencoders for low-dimensional linear parameter-varying approximations and nonlinear feedback design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polytopic autoencoders provide low-dimensional parametrizations of states in a polytope. For nonlinear PDEs, this is readily applied to low-dimensional linear parameter-varying (LPV) approximations as they have been exploited for efficient nonlinear controller design via series expansions of the solution to the state-dependent Riccati equation. In this work, we develop a polytopic autoencoder for control applications and show how it outperforms standard linear approaches in view of LPV approximations of nonlinear systems and how the particular architecture enables higher order series expansions at little extra computational effort. We illustrate the properties and potentials of this approach to computational nonlinear controller design for large-scale systems with a thorough numerical study.</description>

      <title>Properties and baroclinic instability of stratified thermal upper-ocean flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of, and perform a stability analysis of a baroclinic zonal current in, a thermal rotating shallow-water model, sometimes called \emph{Ripa's model}, featuring stratification for quasigeostrophic upper-ocean dynamics. The model has Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure. In addition to Casimirs, the model supports integrals of motion that neither form the kernel of the bracket nor are related to explicit symmetries. The model sustains Rossby waves and a neutral model, whose spurious growth is prevented by a positive-definite integral, quadratic on the deviation from the motionless state. A baroclinic zonal jet with vertical curvature is found to be spectrally stable for specific configurations of the gradients of layer thickness, vertically averaged buoyancy, and buoyancy frequency. Only a subset of such states was found Lyapunov stable using the available integrals, except the newly reported ones, whose role in constraining stratified thermal flow remains elusive. The existence of Lyapunov-stable states enabled bounding the nonlinear growth of perturbations to spectrally unstable states. Our results do not support the generality of earlier numerical evidence on the suppression of submesoscale wave activity as a result of the inclusion of stratification in thermal shallow-water theory, which we supported with direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Discretize first, filter next: learning divergence-consistent closure models for large-eddy simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new neural network based large eddy simulation framework for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations based on the paradigm "discretize first, filter and close next". This leads to full model-data consistency and allows for employing neural closure models in the same environment as where they have been trained. Since the LES discretization error is included in the learning process, the closure models can learn to account for the discretization.
  Furthermore, we introduce a new divergence-consistent discrete filter defined through face-averaging. The new filter preserves the discrete divergence-free constraint by construction, unlike general discrete filters such as volume-averaging filters. We show that using a divergence-consistent LES formulation coupled with a convolutional neural closure model produces stable and accurate results for both a-priori and a-posteriori training, while a general (divergence-inconsistent) LES model requires a-posteriori training or other stability-enforcing measures.</description>

      <title>Simulation of flow induced vibration of a cylinder in an expansion tube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.01820v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, a series of simulations are conducted to investigate the motion of a small cylinder in an expansion tube, focusing on two-dimensional dynamics. These simulations are performed on the FLUENT platform employing the Overset function. The collision between the cylinder and the tube wall is modeled as a positive rigid body collision without losing energy. Two key parameters, the dimensionless gravity (Mg*) and the Reynolds number (Re), were explored within the ranges of 4.9-79.4 and 1-300, respectively. Two types of inflow are considered: the invariable inflow or superimposed a sinusoidal inflow of periodical fluctuation. For invariable inflow, three motion modes (drainage mode, balance mode and vibration mode) are found in the phase diagrams of (Mg*, Re). For an invariable inflow, the high-amplitude vibrations of a cylinder is proved to be widespread in the Reynolds number range from 5 to 40. Additionally, the scenario involving Re =300, Mg* =39.25 with sinusoidal periodic fluctuation incoming flow demonstrated intense vibrations of the cylinder. The behavior of the two-dimensional cylinder can be approximated as a simplified version of a three-dimensional sphere when the spherical motion is disregarded. Our research may help to understand this ancient flow problem.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic wetting: Cox-Voinov theory with normal stress effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Cox-Voinov theory of contact line motion provides a relation between the macroscopically observable contact angle, and the microscopic wetting angle as a function of contact line velocity. Here we investigate how viscoelasticity, specifically the normal stress effect, modifies wetting dynamics. Using the thin film equation for the second-order fluid, it is found that the normal stress effect is dominant at small scales. We show that the effect can be incorporated in the Cox-Voinov theory through an apparent microscopic angle, which differs from the true microscopic angle. The theory is applied to the classical problems of drop spreading and dip-coating, which shows how normal stress facilitates (inhibits) the motion of advancing (receding) contact lines. For rapid advancing motion, the apparent microscopic angle can tend to zero in which case the dynamics is described by a new regime that was already anticipated in Boudaoud (2007).</description>

      <title>Two-relaxation-time regularized lattice Boltzmann model for Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel two-relaxation-time regularized lattice Boltzmann (TRT-RLB) model for simulating weakly compressible isothermal flows. A free relaxation parameter, $\tau_{s,2}$, is employed to relax the regularized non-equilibrium third-order terms. Chapman-Enskog analysis reveals that our model can accurately recover the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs). Theoretical analysis of the Poiseuille flow problem demonstrates that the slip velocity magnitude in the proposed model is controlled by a magic parameter, which can be entirely eliminated under specific values, consistent with the classical TRT model. Our simulations of the double shear layer problem, Taylor-Green vortex flow, and force-driven Poiseuille flow confirm that the stability and accuracy of our model significantly surpass those of both the regularized lattice Boltzmann (RLB) and two-relaxation-time (TRT) models, even under super-high Reynolds numbers as $Re=10^7$. Concurrently, the TRT-RLB model exhibits superior performance in very high viscosity scenarios. The simulations of creeping flow around a square cylinder demonstrates the model's capability to accurately compute ultra-low Reynolds numbers as $Re=10^{-7}$. This study establishes the TRT-RLB model as a flexible and robust tool in computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of dynamic wetting behavior through curved microchannels with automated image analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preventing fluid penetration poses a challenging reliability concern in the context of power electronics, which is usually caused by unforeseen microfractures along the sealing joints. A better and more reliable product design heavily depends on the understanding of the dynamic wetting processes happening inside these complex microfractures, i.e. microchannels. A novel automated image processing procedure is proposed in this work for analyzing the moving interface and the dynamic contact angle in microchannels. In particular, the developed method is advantageous for experiments involving non-transparent samples, where extracting the fluid interface geometry poses a significant challenge. The developed method is validated with theoretical values and manual measurements and exhibits high accuracy. The implementation is made publicly available. The developed method is validated and applied to experimental investigations of forced wetting with two working fluids (water and 50 wt% glycerin/water mixture) in four distinct microchannels characterized by different dimensions and curvature. The comparison between the experimental results and molecular kinetic theory (MKT) reveals that the dynamic wetting behavior can be described well by MKT, even in highly curved microchannels. The dynamic wetting behavior shows a strong dependency on the channel geometry and curvature.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann model for containerless freezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a lattice Boltzmann model is proposed to simulate solid-liquid phase change phenomena in multiphase systems. The model couples the thermal properties of the solidification front with the dynamics of the liquid droplet interface, which enables the description of the complex interfacial changes during solid-liquid phase change process. The model treats the interfaces of gas, liquid, and solid phases using the phase field order parameter and the solid fraction. The volume expansion or contraction caused by the change of properties such as density during phase change is represented by adding a mass source term to the continuum equation. The proposed model is first validated by the three-phase Stefan problem and the droplet solidification on a cold surface, and the numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical and experimental results. Then it is used to model the solidification problem with bubbles. The results show that the model is able to accurately capture the effect of bubbles on the solidification process, which is in good agreement with previous work. In addition, a parametric study is carried out to examine the dependence of the sessile droplet solidification on different physical and numerical parameters. The results show that the droplet solidification time increases with increasing droplet volume and contact angle.</description>

      <title>Strong Bow Shocks: Turbulence and An Exact Self-Similar Asymptotic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.18080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that strong bow shocks are turbulent and non-universal near the head, but asymptote to a universal steady, self-similar, and analytically solvable flow in the downstream. The turbulence is essentially 3D, and has been confirmed by a 3D simulation. The asymptotic behavior is confirmed with high resolution 2D and 3D simulations of a cold uniform wind encountering both a solid spherical obstacle and stellar wind. This solution is relevant in the context of: (i) probing the kinematic properties of observed high-velocity compact bodies -- e.g., runaway stars and/or supernova ejecta blobs -- flying through the interstellar medium; and (ii) constraining stellar bow shock luminosities invoked by some quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) models.</description>

      <title>Neural Downscaling for Complex Systems: from Large-scale to Small-scale by Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting and understanding the chaotic dynamics in complex systems is essential in various applications. However, conventional approaches, whether full-scale simulations or small-scale omissions, fail to offer a comprehensive solution. This instigates exploration into whether modeling or omitting small-scale dynamics could benefit from the well-captured large-scale dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology called Neural Downscaling (ND), which integrates neural operator techniques with the principles of inertial manifold and nonlinear Galerkin theory. ND effectively infers small-scale dynamics within a complementary subspace from corresponding large-scale dynamics well-represented in a low-dimensional space. The effectiveness and generalization of the method are demonstrated on the complex systems governed by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Navier-Stokes equations. As the first comprehensive deterministic model targeting small-scale dynamics, ND sheds light on the intricate spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics of complex systems, revealing how small-scale dynamics are intricately linked with and influenced by large-scale dynamics.</description>
