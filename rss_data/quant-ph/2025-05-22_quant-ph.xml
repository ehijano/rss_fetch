      <title>Performance analysis of GKP error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes are particularly effective at correcting continuous noise, such as Gaussian noise and loss, and can significantly reduce overhead when concatenated with qubit error-correcting codes like surface codes. GKP error correction can be implemented using either a teleportation-based method, known as Knill error correction, or a quantum non-demolition-based approach, known as Steane error correction. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive performance analysis of these established GKP error correction schemes, deriving an analytical expression for the post-correction GKP squeezing and displacement errors. Our results show that there is flexibility in choosing the entangling gate used with the teleportation-based Knill approach. Furthermore, when implemented using the recently introduced qunaught states, the Knill approach not only achieves superior GKP squeezing compared to other variants but is also the simplest to realize experimentally in the optical domain.</description>

      <title>Solving MNIST with a globally trained Mixture of Quantum Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new quantum neural network for image classification, which is able to classify the parity of the MNIST dataset with full resolution with a test accuracy of up to 97.5% without any classical pre-processing or post-processing. Our architecture is based on a mixture of experts whose model function is the sum of the model functions of each expert. We encode the input with amplitude encoding, which allows us to encode full-resolution MNIST images with 10 qubits and to implement a convolution on the whole image with just a single one-qubit gate. Our training algorithm is based on training all the experts together, which significantly improves trainability with respect to training each expert independently. In fact, in the limit of infinitely many experts, our training algorithm can perfectly fit the training data. Our results demonstrate the potential of our quantum neural network to achieve high-accuracy image classification with minimal quantum resources, paving the way for more scalable and efficient quantum machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Bell sampling in Quantum Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are essential for the numerical study of large-scale quantum many-body systems, yet their utility has been significantly hampered by the difficulty in computing key quantities such as off-diagonal operators and entanglement. This work introduces Bell-QMC, a novel QMC framework leveraging Bell sampling, a two-copy measurement protocol in the transversal Bell basis. We demonstrate that Bell-QMC enables an efficient and unbiased estimation of both challenging classes of observables, offering a significant advantage over previous QMC approaches. Notably, the entanglement across all system partitions can be computed in a single Bell-QMC simulation. We implement this method within the stochastic series expansion (SSE), where we design an efficient update scheme for sampling the configurations in the Bell basis. We demonstrate our algorithm in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, extracting universal quantum features using only simple diagonal measurements. This work establishes Bell-QMC as a powerful framework that significantly expands the accessible quantum properties in QMC simulations, providing an exponential advantage over conventional QMC.</description>

      <title>Enhanced frequency estimation by non-Gaussianity of Fock states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the unique quantum properties of non-Gaussian states is crucial for advancing continuous variable quantum technologies. Recent experimental advancements in generating non-Gaussian states, coupled with theoretical findings of their superior performance in quantum information protocols compared to Gaussian states, motivate this investigation. This work investigates the impact of non-Gaussianity on the precision of frequency estimation using a quantum probe. We analyze a single bosonic mode and its non-Gaussian excited states as a system, while the frequency estimation is investigated by explicitly computing the quantum Fisher information. Our results demonstrate a significant enhancement in the quantum Fisher information for non-Gaussian states compared to Gaussian states with equivalent second-order moments. Importantly, we find that the increased quantum Fisher information achieved with non-Gaussian states outweighs their higher energetic cost compared to the Gaussian ground state. We also briefly discuss two photonic non-Gaussian state generation schemes: interaction with an ancillary system and the use of photon number measurement on the photonic probe.</description>

      <title>Improved Classical Shadow Tomography Using Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography (CST) involves obtaining enough classical descriptions of an unknown state via quantum measurements to predict the outcome of a set of quantum observables. CST has numerous applications, particularly in algorithms that utilize quantum data for tasks such as learning, detection, and optimization. This paper introduces a new CST procedure that exponentially reduces the space complexity and quadratically improves the running time of CST with single-copy measurements. The approach utilizes a quantum-to-classical-to-quantum process to prepare quantum states that represent shadow snapshots, which can then be directly measured by the observables of interest. With that, calculating large matrix traces is avoided, resulting in improvements in running time and space complexity. The paper presents analyses of the proposed methods for CST, with Pauli measurements and Clifford circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of two-photon cooperative emission in systems of two-level atoms. Two physically distinct regimes are analyzed. First, we investigate the case of a small number of atoms. We study the evolution of two-photon super- and sub-radiant states and associated two-photon spectra. Second, we investigate the problem of a constant density of atoms confined to a spherical volume. We analyze separately the cases in which the radius is small or large in comparison to the resonant wavelength.</description>

      <title>Characterizing errors in parameter estimation by local measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The indirect estimation of couplings in quantum dynamics relies on the measurement of the spectrum and the overlap of eigenvectors with some reference states. This data can be obtained by local measurements on some sites and eliminates the need for full Hamiltonian tomography. For a 1D chain, access to only one edge site is sufficient to compute all the couplings between the adjacent sites, and consequently to reconstruct the full Hamiltonian. However, its robustness in the presence of perturbations remains a critical question, particularly when sites interact with other lattice sites beyond nearest neighbors.
  Our work studies the applicability of schemes designed for 1D chains to topologies with interactions beyond nearest-neighbour. We treat interactions between the next-nearest sites as perturbation of strength $\varepsilon$ and show that the error in estimation of couplings scales linearly with $\varepsilon$ in the presence of such interactions. Further, we show that on average, the existence of couplings between sites beyond the next-nearest neighbour results in higher error. We also study the length of the chain that can be estimated (up to a fixed precision) as a function of $\varepsilon$, in the presence of next-nearest neighbour interactions. Typically, for weak interactions, chains of 40 sites can be estimated within reasonable error. Thus, we study the robustness of estimation scheme designed for a 1D chain when exposed to such multi-site perturbations, offering valuable insights into its applicability and limitations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Delocalization of Dark States in a Multimode Optical Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong coupling between molecules and photonic modes in a Fabry-P\'{e}rot optical cavity, which forms hybrid light-matter states called polaritons, has been demonstrated as a promising route to control the rates of chemical reactions. However, theoretical studies, which largely employ models with a single cavity mode, cannot explain the experimentally observed kinetic changes. While simplified multimode models with one spatial dimension can capture experimental features involving the polariton states, it is unclear whether they can also describe the dark states. Here, we study the delocalization of dark states for molecules in a multimode cavity, accounting for the three-dimensional nature of experimental setups. Accounting for energetic and orientational disorder, but fixing Rabi splitting and intermolecular distances (i.e., no positional disorder), we find that the delocalization of the dark states scales linearly with the number of molecules in the plane parallel to the cavity mirrors, in contrast to one-dimensional multimode models. Adding layers of molecules along the axis normal to the mirrors increases the delocalization much less. Similar to the one-dimensional models, the dark-state delocalization is enhanced for smaller values of molecular energetic disorder, relative to the light-matter coupling, and cavities with longer longitudinal length. Our work indicates that for certain phenomena, understanding the dark states under strong light-matter coupling might require a proper multimode description of the optical cavity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research article, we design a quantum hash function model from hybrid quantum walks on finite path graph. The hybrid evolution operator consisting of integrated framework of continuous time quantum walks and lackadaisical quantum walks as per choice of bits in binary input message, acts on initial quantum state and generate quantum hash values from probability distribution of final quantum state. The quantum hash values generated through the proposed method is showing strong cryptographic properties in sensitivity analysis, collision analysis, statistical features analysis, birthday attack and uniform analysis. Our proposed framework is showing successful results utilizing mathematically well defined structure of hybrid quantum walks based on quantum mechanics phenomena.</description>

      <title>Direct reconstruction of the quantum density matrix elements with classical shadow tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a direct estimation framework for reconstructing multiple density matrix elements of an unknown quantum state using classical shadow tomography. Traditional direct measurement protocols (DMPs), while effective for individual elements, suffer from poor scalability due to post-selection losses and the need for element-specific measurement configurations. In contrast, our method, DMP-ST, leverages random Clifford or biased mutually unbiased basis measurements to enable global estimation: a single dataset suffices to estimate arbitrary off-diagonal entries with high accuracy. We prove that estimating \(K\) off-diagonal matrix elements up to additive error \(\epsilon\) requires only \(\mathcal{O}(\log K/\epsilon^2)\) samples, achieving exponential improvement over conventional DMPs. The number of required measurement configurations can also be exponentially reduced for large K. When extended to full state tomography, DMP-ST attains trace distance error \(\le \epsilon\) with sample complexity \(\mathcal{O}(d^3 \log d/\epsilon^2)\), which is closed to the optimal scaling for single-copy measurements. Moreover, biased MUB measurements reduce sample complexity by a constant factor than random Clifford measurements. This work provides both theoretical guarantees and explicit protocols for efficient, entrywise quantum state reconstruction. It significantly advances the practicality of direct tomography, especially for high-dimensional systems and near-term quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Quantum Contraction and Correlation Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical information theory, the maximal correlation coefficient is used to establish strong limits on distributed processing. Through its relation to the $\chi^{2}$-contraction coefficient, it also establishes fundamental bounds on sequential processing. Two distinct quantum extensions of the maximal correlation coefficient have been introduced to recover these two scenarios, but they do not recover the entire classical framework. We introduce a family of non-commutative $L^{2}(p)$ spaces induced by operator monotone functions from which families of quantum maximal correlation coefficients and the quantum $\chi^{2}$-divergences can be identified. Through this framework, we lift the classical results to the quantum setting. For distributed processing, using our quantum maximal correlation coefficients, we establish strong limits on converting quantum states under local operations. For sequential processing, we clarify the relation between the data processing inequality of quantum maximal correlation coefficients, $\chi^{2}$-contraction coefficients, and $f$-divergences. Moreover, we establish the quantum maximal correlation coefficients and $\chi^{2}$-contraction coefficients are often computable via linear algebraic methods, which in particular implies a method for obtaining rigorous, computable upper bounds for time-homogeneous quantum Markov chains with a unique, full rank fixed point.</description>

      <title>Robust and compact single-lens crossed-beam optical dipole trap for Bose-Einstein condensation in microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel concept for a compact and robust crossed-beam optical dipole trap (cODT) based on a single lens, designed for the efficient generation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) under dynamic conditions. The system employs two independent two-dimensional acousto-optical deflectors (AODs) in combination with a single high-numerical-aperture lens to provide three-dimensional control over the trap geometry, minimizing potential misalignments and ensuring long-term operational stability. By leveraging time-averaged potentials, rapid and efficient evaporative cooling sequences toward BECs are enabled. The functionality of the cODT under microgravity conditions has been successfully demonstrated in the Einstein-Elevator in Hannover, Germany, where the beam intersection was shown to remain stable throughout the microgravity phase of the flight. In addition, the system has been implemented in the sensor head of the INTENTAS project to verify BEC generation. Additional realization of one- and two-dimensional control of arrays of condensates through dynamic trap shaping was achieved. This versatile approach allows for advanced quantum sensing applications in mobile and space-based environments based on all- optical BECs.</description>

      <title>Depth-Efficient Quantum Circuit Synthesis for Deterministic Dicke State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $n$-qubit $k$-weight Dicke states $|D^n_k\rangle$, defined as the uniform superposition of all computational basis states with exactly $k$ qubits in state $|1\rangle$, form a basis of the symmetric subspace and represent an important class of entangled quantum states with broad applications in quantum computing. We propose deterministic quantum circuits for Dicke state preparation under two commonly seen qubit connectivity constraints: 1. All-to-all qubit connectivity: our circuit has depth $O(\log(k)\log(n/k)+k)$, which improves the previous best bound of $O(k\log(n/k))$. 2. Grid qubit connectivity ($(n_1\times n_2)$-grid, $n_1\le n_2$): (a) For $k\ge n_2/n_1$, we design a circuit with depth $O(k\log(n/k)+n_2)$, surpassing the prior $O(\sqrt{nk})$ bound. (b) For $k&lt; n_2/n_1$, we design an optimal-depth circuit with depth $O(n_2)$. Furthermore, we establish the depth lower bounds of $\Omega(\log(n))$ for all-to-all qubit connectivity and $\Omega(n_2)$ for $(n_1\times n_2)$-grid connectivity constraints, demonstrating the near-optimality of our constructions.</description>

      <title>Fast and robust detection of single Rydberg excitations in mesoscopic ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel non-destructive method for the detection of single Rydberg excitations in a mesoscopic ensemble. The protocol achieves high fidelities on a microsecond timescale and is robust against changes in the probe laser frequency. The technique relies on optical pumping in Autler Townes configuration, whose efficiency is controlled by the presence/absence of a Rydberg excitation. Taking rubidium atoms as an example, we give realistic estimates for the achievable fidelities and parameters. However, our protocol can be transferred to any other atomic species which features multiple stable states. Our protocol is applicable in quantum simulation and quantum information processing with mesoscopic ensembles requiring fast and high fidelity Rydberg state detection.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Quantum Search for Arbitrary Initial Success Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unstructured search remains as one of the significant challenges in computer science, as classical search algorithms become increasingly impractical for large-scale systems due to their linear time complexity. Quantum algorithms, notably Grover's algorithm, leverages quantum parallelism to achieve quadratic speedup over classical approaches. Its generalization, the amplitude amplification algorithm, extends this advantage to a broader class of search problems. However, both algorithms are inherently probabilistic and fail to guarantee success with certainty, also they offer no quantum advantage when the initial success probability exceeds 0.5. This work presents a deterministic quantum search algorithm that operates effectively for arbitrary initial success probabilities, providing guaranteed success in searching target states. The proposed approach introduces at most one additional iteration beyond the optimal count required by probabilistic quantum search algorithms. The algorithm preserves the quadratic speedup characteristic of quantum search methods. Additionally, an approach is proposed for the exact search of multiple target states within a bounded number of steps. A complete circuit-level implementation of the proposed algorithm is also presented.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization, shadowing breakdown, and the absence of Trotterization transition in quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of premier utilities of present day noisy quantum computers is simulation of many-body quantum systems. We study how long in time is such a discrete-time simulation representative of a continuous time Hamiltonian evolution, namely, a finite time-step introduces so-called Trotterization errors. We show that the truncated operator propagator (Ruelle-Pollicott resonances) is a powerful tool to that end, as well as to study prethermalization and discrete time crystals, including finding those phenomena at large gate duration, and can be used to calculate diffusion constant. We show that the effective energy is more stable than suggested by Trotter errors -- a manifestation of prethermalization -- while all other observables are not. Even such the most stable observable though deteriorates in the thermodynamic limit. Different than in classical systems with the strongest chaos, where the faithfulness time (the shadowing time) can be infinite, in quantum many-body chaotic systems it is finite. A corollary of our results is also that, opposite to previous claims, there is no Trotterization transition in non-integrable many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The Landau-Feynman transiently open quantum system: entanglement and density operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Users of quantum mechanics, both in physics and in the field of quantum information, are familiar with the concept of a statistical mixture as introduced by von Neumann, and with the use of a density operator in that context. A density operator may also be used in another situation, introduced by Landau, with a transient coupling between the two parts of a quantum bipartite system. But more than fifty years after a clarifying work by Feynman on the subject, a confusion still persists about what we call the Landau-Feynman situation. This is specifically testified by the development of controversies around that subject. The aim of this paper is to stress that, when facing the Landau-Feynman situation, the right concept to be used is not the one of a mixed state (or statistical mixture) - be it qualified as proper or improper -, but the one of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Device-Independent Ternary Quantum Key Distribution Protocol Based on the Impossible Colouring Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Ternary Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (TDIQKD) protocol based on the two-party Impossible Colouring pseudo-telepathy game, using maximally entangled qutrit states to enable secure key generation between distant parties. The protocol makes use of contextuality from the Kochen-Specker theorem, providing a quantum advantage in a task that is classically unachievable, and eliminates reliance on assumptions about the internal workings of quantum devices. A specially designed qutrit quantum circuit is employed for state preparation, and security is rigorously analyzed through a composable framework using smooth minimum entropy, von Neumann entropy, and Shannon entropy. The protocol achieves optimal key rate in the ideal case and maintains security under significant noise, with a finite-key analysis supporting practical deployment. The protocol is secure within an adequate security framework and demonstrates a higher key generation rate compared to standard QKD protocols, emphasizing the potential of high-dimensional quantum systems for secure communication.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning is a new computational tool that combines the quantum properties from quantum computing with the pattern recognition from machine learning. In this paper, we apply the Variational Quantum Classifier algorithm to the problem of pulsar classification of candidates from the High Time Resolution Universe 2 dataset. We use Qiskit Machine Learning circuits to compare the performance of the model using different feature selection methods, various number of features and training data size. Comparisons on the model from changing the data encoding and ansatz options are also reported. Keywords: Quantum Computing, Quantum Machine Learning, Astrophysics, Pulsars</description>

      <title>Uhlmann and scalar Wilczek-Zee phases of degenerate quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wilczek-Zee (WZ) holonomy arises in degenerate states while the Uhlmann holonomy characterizes finite-temperature topology. We investigate possible relationships between the Uhlmann phase and the scalar WZ phase, which reflects the Uhlmann and WZ holonomy respectively, in an exemplary four-level model with two doubly degenerate subspaces. Through exactly solutions, we contrast the behavior of the Uhlmann and WZ connections and their associated phases. In the zero-temperature limit, the Uhlmann phase may or may not agree with the scalar WZ phase of the degenerate ground states due to the underlying topology. Some conditions are derived in an analytic analysis, under which the Uhlmann phase in the zero-temperature limit converges to the scalar WZ phase. We also briefly discuss possible realizations or simulations of the phenomena as well as their implications.</description>

      <title>Simple Sufficient Criteria for Optimality of Entanglement Witnesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If one wants to establish optimality of a given bipartite entanglement witness, the current standard approach is to check whether it has the spanning property. Although this is not necessary for optimality, it is most often satisfied in practice, and for small enough dimensions or sufficiently structured witnesses this criterion can be checked by hand. In this work we introduce a novel characterization of the spanning property via entanglement-breaking channels, which in turn leads to a new sufficient criterion for optimality. This criterion amounts to just checking the kernel of some bipartite state. It is slightly weaker than the spanning property, but it is a lot easier to test for -- by hand as well as numerically -- and it applies to almost all witnesses which are known to have the spanning property. A second criterion is derived from this, where one can simply compute the expectation value of the given witness on a maximally entangled state. Finally, this approach implies new spectral constraints on witnesses as well as on positive maps.</description>

      <title>Relative phase and dynamical phase sensing in a Hamiltonian model of the optical SU(1,1) interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SU(1,1) interferometer introduced by Yurke, McCall, Klauder is reformulated starting from the Hamiltonian of two identical optical downconversion processes with opposite pump phases. From the four optical modes, two are singled out up to a relative phase by the assumption of exact alignment of the interferometer (i.e., mode indistinguishability). The state of the two resulting modes is parametrized by the nonlinearity $g$, the relative phase $\phi$, and a dynamical phase $\theta$ resulting from the interaction time. The optimal operating point for sensing the relative phase (dynamical phase) is found to be $\phi = \pi$ ($\theta=0$) with quantum Fisher information exhibiting Heisenberg scaling $E^{2}$ (logarithmically modified Heisenberg scaling $\left({E\over \ln E}\right)^{2}$). Compared to the predictions of the circuit-based model, we find in that in the Hamiltonian model: 1. the optimal operating points occur for a non-vacuum state inside the interferometer, and 2. measurement of the total photon number operator does not provide an estimate of the relative or dynamical phase with precision that saturates the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, whereas an observable based on weighted shift operators becomes optimal as $g$ increases. The results indicate a first-principles approach for describing general optical quantum sensors containing multiple optical downconversion processes.</description>

      <title>Neural Quantum Digital Twins for Optimizing Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealers have shown potential in addressing certain combinatorial optimization problems, though their performance is often limited by scalability and errors rates. In this work, we propose a Neural Quantum Digital Twin (NQDT) framework that reconstructs the energy landscape of quantum many-body systems relevant to quantum annealing. The digital twin models both ground and excited state dynamics, enabling detailed simulation of the adiabatic evolution process. We benchmark NQDT on systems with known analytical solutions and demonstrate that it accurately captures key quantum phenomena, including quantum criticality and phase transitions. Leveraging this framework, one can identify optimal annealing schedules that minimize excitation-related errors. These findings highlight the utility of neural network-based digital twins as a diagnostic and optimization tool for improving the performance of quantum annealers.</description>

      <title>Measurement-free quantum error correction optimized for biased noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive optimized measurement-free protocols for quantum error correction and the implementation of a universal gate set optimized for an error model that is noise biased . The noise bias is adapted for neutral atom platforms, where two- and multi-qubit gates are realized with Rydberg interactions and are thus expected to be the dominating source of noise. Careful design of the gates allows to further reduce the noise model to Pauli-Z errors. In addition, the presented circuits are robust to arbitrary single-qubit gate errors, and we demonstrate that the break-even point can be significantly improved compared to fully fault-tolerant measurement-free schemes. The obtained logical qubits with their suppressed error rates on logical gate operations can then be used as building blocks in a first step of error correction in order to push the effective error rates below the threshold of a fully fault-tolerant and scalable quantum error correction scheme.</description>

      <title>Distillation of multipartite entangled states for arbitrary subsets of parties in noisy quantum networks of increasing size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum network states are multipartite states built from distributing pairwise entanglement among parties and underpin the paradigm of quantum networks for quantum information processing. In this work we introduce the problem of partial distillability in noisy quantum networks. This corresponds to the possibility of creating locally starting from a single copy of a quantum network state with mixed entangled links supporting a constant amount of noise an arbitrary pure state for an arbitrary subset of parties with fidelity as close to 1 as desired as the size of the network increases. While we prove an obstruction to multipartite distillation protocols after teleportation with channels with constant noise, we show that partial distillability is indeed possible if certain well-established graph-theoretic parameters that measure the connectivity in the network grow fast enough with its size. We give necessary as well as sufficient conditions for partial distillability in terms of these parameters and we moreover provide explicit constructions of networks with partial distillability and a relatively slow connectivity growth.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an interacting fermionic chain in the presence of non-reciprocal gain and loss processes obtained via reservoir engineering. The interplay between unitary evolution and the two dissipative processes leads to distinct non-reciprocal signatures in the transient dynamics and the steady state. These include a transition from exponential to power-law relaxation towards a finite-density steady-state, a nonzero particle current from breaking inversion symmetry, and dynamics under open boundary conditions showing directionality and charge accumulation. Weak interactions preserve the main signatures of non-reciprocity, enriching the interacting many-body non-reciprocal phase with volume law entanglement of quantum trajectories. Upon increasing the interaction above a critical value, we find a dissipative phase transition where reciprocity is dynamically restored.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable quantum technologies demand entanglement between many distant quantum emitters (QEs), for which we propose using high-$Q$, spatially extended bound states in the continuum (BICs) in all-dielectric metasurfaces. We show that QE-BIC coupling efficiencies ($\beta$-factors) can exceed $80\%$, comparable to waveguides even without further mode engineering, but within a 2D geometry that naturally accommodates large QE arrays and relaxes strict emitter placement. Inter-QE entanglement is generated faster than in free space, is significantly amplified, and persists over several resonant wavelengths. Optimality requires large $\beta$-factors but moderately small Purcell factors. Our results establish all-dielectric metasurfaces as a practical, scalable platform for leading-edge quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>A partition function framework for estimating logical error curves in stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the mapping between stabilizer quantum error correcting codes and disordered statistical mechanics models, we define a ratio of partition functions that measures the success probability for maximum partition function decoding, which at the Nishimori temperature corresponds to maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. We show that this ratio differs from the similarly defined order probability and describe the decoding strategy whose success rate is described by the order probability. We refer to the latter as a probabilistic partition function decoding and show that it is the strategy that at zero temperature corresponds to maximum probability (MP) decoding. Based on the difference between the two decoders, we discuss the possibility of a maximum partition function decodability boundary outside the order-disorder phase boundary. At zero temperature, the difference between the two ratios measures to what degree MP decoding can be improved by accounting for degeneracy among maximum probability errors, through methods such as ensembling. We consider in detail the example of the toric code under bitflip noise, which maps to the Random Bond Ising Model. We demonstrate that estimation of logical performance through decoding probability and order probability is more sample efficient than estimation by counting failures of the corresponding decoders. We consider both uniform noise and noise where qubits are given individual error rates. The latter noise model lifts the degeneracy among maximum probability errors, but we show that ensembling remains useful as long as it also samples less probable errors.</description>

      <title>The abelian state hidden subgroup problem: Learning stabilizer groups and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the symmetry properties of quantum states is a central theme in quantum information theory and quantum many-body physics. In this work, we investigate quantum learning problems in which the goal is to identify a hidden symmetry of an unknown quantum state. Building on the recent formulation of the state hidden subgroup problem (StateHSP), we focus on abelian groups and develop a quantum algorithmic approach to efficiently learn any hidden symmetry subgroup in this case. We showcase the versatility of the approach in three concrete applications: These are learning (i) qubit and qudit stabilizer groups, (ii) cuts along which a state is unentangled, and (iii) hidden translation symmetries. Taken together, our results underscore the potential of the StateHSP framework as a foundation for broader symmetry-based quantum learning tasks.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging field with growing implications across science and industry, making early educational exposure increasingly important. This paper examines how quantum computing concepts can be introduced into high-school STEM curricula within existing structures to enhance foundational learning in mathematics, computer science, and physics. We outline a modular integration strategy introducing key quantum ideas into standard courses, leveraging open-source educational resources to ensure global accessibility. Emphasis is placed on educational opportunity and equity: the approach is designed to be inclusive and to bridge current curricular gaps so that students worldwide can develop basic quantum literacy. Our analysis demonstrates that integrating quantum topics at the secondary level is feasible and can enrich STEM learning.</description>

      <title>RISC-Q: A Generator for Real-Time Quantum Control System-on-Chips Compatible with RISC-V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing imposes stringent requirements for the precise control of large-scale qubit systems, including, for example, microsecond-latency feedback and nanosecond-precision timing of gigahertz signals -- demands that far exceed the capabilities of conventional real-time systems. The rapidly evolving and highly diverse nature of quantum control necessitates the development of specialized hardware accelerators. While a few custom real-time systems have been developed to meet the tight timing constraints of specific quantum platforms, they face major challenges in scaling and adapting to increasingly complex control demands -- largely due to fragmented toolchains and limited support for design automation.
  To address these limitations, we present RISC-Q -- an open-source flexible generator for Quantum Control System-on-Chip (QCSoC) designs, featuring a programming interface compatible with the RISC-V ecosystem. Developed using SpinalHDL, RISC-Q enables efficient automation of highly parameterized and modular QCSoC architectures, supporting agile and iterative development to meet the evolving demands of quantum control. We demonstrate that RISC-Q can replicate the performance of existing QCSoCs with significantly reduced development effort, facilitating efficient exploration of the hardware-software co-design space for rapid prototyping and customization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multisetting protocol for the detection of two-body Bell correlations, and apply it to spin-nematic squeezed states realized in $f$ pairs of SU(2) subsystems within spin-$f$ atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Experimental data for $f=1$, alongside with numerical simulations using the truncated Wigner method for $f=1,\,2,\,3$, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol. Our findings extend the reach of multisetting Bell tests in ultracold atomic system, paving the way for extended quantum information processing in high-spin ensemble platforms.</description>

      <title>Procedure of tuning up a three-site artificial Kitaev chain based on transmon measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains (AKCs), formed of quantum dot-superconductor linear arrays, provide a promising platform for hosting Majorana bound states (MBSs) and implementing topological quantum computing. The main challenges along this research direction would include the tuning up of AKCs for hosting MBSs and the readout of the parity of the chains. In this work, we present a step-by-step procedure for tuning up a three-site AKC to its sweet spots based on the spectra of a transmon circuit which is integrated with the chain for the purpose of reading out the parity of the chain. The signatures of the transmon's plasma modes in each step, particular those related to the appearance of MBSs in the chain, will be given. We find that the sweet spots in a three-site AKC can be classified into three types based on the relative strengths of elastic cotunneling (ECT) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR): ECT-dominated sweet spots, genuine sweet spots and CAR-dominated sweet spots. We show that the ECT-dominated and CAR-dominated sweet spots can be more conveniently accessed and utilized in transmon-based measurements.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the butterfly velocity in holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study quantum chaos in a variety of holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potentials. This includes the 1 R-Charge black hole (1RCBH) model, the 2 R-Charge black hole (2RCBH) model, a potential reconstruction-based analytic bottom-up model, and a numerical bottom-up model. All these models are different avatars of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity action, distinguished by their specific choices of dilaton potentials and gauge-kinetic coupling functions. We focus on computing the chaos parameter, the butterfly velocity, using three distinct methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and pole-skipping. We show that all three methods yield identical results for the butterfly velocity across all the holographic QCD models considered, further establishing the equivalence between the three approaches. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of the butterfly velocity as a function of chemical potential and temperature. Interestingly, a universal trend emerges across all models: the butterfly velocity increases/decreases with temperature/chemical potential for thermodynamically stable phases. Additionally, in the high-temperature limit, the butterfly velocity in all models approaches that of the chargeless plasma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By formulating the renormalization group as a quantum channel acting on density matrices in Quantum Field Theories (QFTs), we show that ground-state expectation values of observables supported on slow momentum modes can be approximated by their averages on the fixed-point theories to which the QFTs flow. This is done by studying the fidelity between ground states of different QFTs and arriving at certain hyperscaling relations satisfied at criticality. Our results allow for a clear identification of cases in which one can replace a QFT by its scale-invariant limit in the calculation of expectation values, opening the way for the application of numerical and analytical methods to as of yet difficult computer simulation of critical models.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ground-state entanglement entropy in inhomogeneous free-boson models in one spatial dimension. We develop a powerful method to extract the leading term in the entanglement scaling, based on the analytic properties of the inhomogeneous potential. This method is applicable to a broad class of models with smooth spatial inhomogeneities. As a case study, we apply this approach for a family of exactly-solvable models characterized by orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme, finding a perfect match between the numerical and analytical results.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Photon Dark Matter of a Mass around $36.1\text{ }\mathrm{\mu}\mathrm{eV}$ Using a Frequency-tunable Cavity Controlled through a Coupled Superconducting Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of a search for dark photon dark matter using a cavity that employs a transmon qubit as a frequency tuning component. The tuning mechanism utilizes the energy level shift (Lamb shift) arising from the mode mixing between the qubit and the cavity mode. This method offers several advantages: (i) it does not introduce physical thermal noise from the tuning mechanism itself, (ii) it avoids electromagnetic leakage typically associated with cavity seams, and (iii) its implementation is straightforward. We excluded the dark photon parameter region for a dark photon mass around $36.1 \ \mathrm{\mu eV} $with a peak sensitivity of $\chi \sim 10^{-12}$ over the mass range $[36.0791, 36.1765] \ \mathrm{\mu eV}$, surpassing the existing cosmological bounds.</description>

Abstract: This chapter acknowledges a gap between the ``non-individuals'' interpretation of quantum mechanics and our world of experience, and begins to bridge it. Section 1 states the problem with Abner Shimony's ``Phenomenological principle''; section 2 briefly presents the interpretation with connection to standard quantum mechanics; section 3 presents the measurement problem in connection with the Phenomenological principle, the standard way out of it, and why the ``non-individuals'' interpretation of quantum mechanics should not follow it; section 4 finally shows two closed venues for such an interpretation (Bohmian mechanics and the Modal-Hamiltonian Interpretation), and two alternatives for such it (Everettian quantum mechanics and spontaneous collapse theories).</description>

      <title>Detector Based Evaluation of Extractable Entanglement in Flat spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy (EE) is widely used to quantify quantum correlations in field theory, with the well-known result in two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) predicting a logarithmic divergence with the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff. However, this expression lacks operational meaning: it remains unclear how much of the entanglement is physically extractable via local measurements. In this work, we investigate the operationally accessible entanglement by employing a pair of Unruh-DeWitt detectors, each interacting with complementary regions of a quantum field. We derive an upper bound on the entanglement that can be harvested by such detectors and show that it scales as a double logarithm with respect to the UV cutoff-significantly weaker than the single-logarithmic divergence of the standard CFT result. This work provides an operational perspective on field-theoretic entanglement and sets fundamental limits on its extractability.</description>

      <title>Energy transfer between localized emitters in photonic cavities from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative and nonradiative resonant couplings between defects are ubiquitous phenomena in photonic devices used in classical and quantum information technology applications. In this work we present a first principles approach to enable quantitative predictions of the energy transfer between defects in photonic cavities, beyond the dipole-dipole approximation and including the many-body nature of the electronic states. As an example, we discuss the energy transfer from a dipole like emitter to an F center in MgO in a spherical cavity. We show that the cavity can be used to controllably enhance or suppress specific spin flip and spin conserving transitions. Specifically, we predict that a ~10 to 100 enhancement in the non-radiative resonant energy transfer rate can be gained in the case of the F center in MgO by a rather moderate cavity with Q~400, and equal suppression in the rate can be achieved by incorporating a significant energy mismatch between the electronic excitation and the cavity mode. Our framework is general and readily applicable to a wide range of devices where localized emitters are embedded in micro-spheres, core-shell nanoparticles, and dielectric Mie resonators. Hence, our approach paves the way to predict how to control energy transfer in quantum memories and in ultra-high density optical memories, and in a variety of quantum information platforms.</description>

Abstract: Quantum-mechanical constraints on information transfer in measuring systems and their influence on
  measurement results studied. As the example, measurement of binary observable $S_z$ of object $\cal S$ by measuring apparatus $\cal A$ considered.
  It's shown that during the measurement these constraints obstacle
  the acquisition of information by $\cal A$, characterizing purity of $\cal S$ ensemble.
  Due to it, $\cal A$ can't discriminate
  pure and mixed $\cal S$ ensembles with the same $S_z$ expectation value. In algebraic measurement ansatz by Emch such information loss results in stochastic
  $S_z$ measurement outcomes for pure $\cal S$ ensemble,
  their probabilities obey to Born postulate, i.e. it corresponds to quantum state collapse. Account of $\cal A$ state decoherence doesn't change obtained results principally.</description>

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) and their applications in the field of quantum machine learning through parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) are thought to be one major way of leveraging noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing devices. However, differences in the performance of certain VQA architectures are often unclear since established best practices, as well as detailed studies, are missing. In this paper, we build upon the work by Schuld et al. [Phys. Rev. A 103, 032430 (2021)] and Vidal et al. [Front. Phys. 8, 297 (2020)] by comparing how well popular ans\"atze for PQCs learn different one-dimensional truncated Fourier series. We also examine dissipative quantum neural networks (dQNN) as introduced by Beer et al. [Nat. Commun. 11, 808 (2020)] and propose a data reupload structure for dQNNs to increase their capability for this regression task. By comparing the results for different PQC architectures, we can provide guidelines for designing efficient PQCs.</description>

      <title>Tensor Factorized Hamiltonian Downfolding To Optimize The Scaling Complexity Of The Electronic Correlations Problem on Classical and Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07051v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving chemical accuracy for strongly correlated molecules is a defining milestone for first-generation, fault-tolerant quantum computers, yet the factorial growth of three, four, and six-index tensor contractions in coupled-cluster CCSD(T), full configuration interaction (FCI), and multireference CI (MRCI) makes current classical and quantum approaches prohibitive. We introduce tensor-factorized Hamiltonian downfolding (TFHD) and its quantum analogue, qubitized downfolding (QD)- a hybrid classical-quantum framework that collapses every high-rank object to rank-2 networks executed in depth-optimal, block-encoded circuits. The complexity of these operations scales exponentially with the system size. We aim to find properties of chemical systems by optimizing this scaling through mathematical transformations on the Hamiltonian and the state space. By defining a bi-partition of the many-body Hilbert space into electronoccupied and electron-unoccupied blocks for a given orbital, we perform a downfolding transformation that decouples the electron-occupied block from its complement. We factorize high-rank electronic integrals and cluster amplitude tensors into low-rank tensor factors of a downfolding transformation, mapping the full many-body Hamiltonian into a smaller dimensional block-Hamiltonians. This reduces the computational complexity of solving the residual equations for Hamiltonian downfolding from O(N7) for CCSD(T) and O(N9) - O(N10) for CI and MRCI to O(N3). This operations can be implemented as a family of tensor networks solely made from two-rank tensors. Additionally, we create block-encoding quantum circuits of the tensor networks, generating circuits of O(N2) depth with O(logN) qubits. We demonstrate super-quadratic speedups of expensive quantum chemistry algorithms on both classical and quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: The fidelity of quantum circuits (QC) is influenced by several factors, including hardware characteristics, calibration status, and the transpilation process, all of which impact their susceptibility to noise. However, existing methods struggle to estimate and compare the noise performance of different circuit layouts due to fluctuating error rates and the absence of a standardized fidelity metric. In this work, Q-fid is introduced, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based fidelity prediction system accompanied by a novel metric designed to quantify the fidelity of quantum circuits. Q-fid provides an intuitive way to predict the noise performance of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits. This approach frames fidelity prediction as a Time Series Forecasting problem to analyze the tokenized circuits, capturing the causal dependence of the gate sequences and their impact on overall fidelity. Additionally, the model is capable of dynamically adapting to changes in hardware characteristics, ensuring accurate fidelity predictions under varying conditions.

      <title>Learning the Complexity of Weakly Noisy Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17813v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the complexity of quantum states is a longstanding key problem in various subfields of science, ranging from quantum computing to the black-hole theory. The lower bound on quantum pure state complexity has been shown to grow linearly with system size [Haferkamp et al., 2022]. However, extending this result to noisy circuit environments, which better reflect real quantum devices, remains an open challenge. In this paper, we explore the complexity of weakly noisy quantum states via the quantum learning method. We present an efficient learning algorithm, that leverages the classical shadow representation of target quantum states, to predict the circuit complexity of weakly noisy quantum states. Our algorithm is proved to be optimal in terms of sample complexity accompanied with polynomial classical processing time. Our result builds a bridge between the learning algorithm and quantum state complexity, meanwhile highlighting the power of learning algorithm in characterizing intrinsic properties of quantum states.</description>

      <title>Review: Quantum Architecture Search with Unsupervised Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11576v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning presents new opportunities for advancing Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QAS is designed to optimize quantum circuits for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs). Most QAS algorithms tightly couple the search space and search algorithm, typically requiring the evaluation of numerous quantum circuits, resulting in high computational costs and limiting scalability to larger quantum circuits. Predictor-based QAS algorithms mitigate this issue by estimating circuit performance based on structure or embedding. However, these methods often demand time-intensive labeling to optimize gate parameters across many circuits, which is crucial for training accurate predictors. Inspired by the classical neural architecture search algorithm Arch2vec, we investigate the potential of unsupervised representation learning for QAS without relying on predictors. Our framework decouples unsupervised architecture representation learning from the search process, enabling the learned representations to be applied across various downstream tasks. Additionally, it integrates an improved quantum circuit graph encoding scheme, addressing the limitations of existing representations and enhancing search efficiency. This predictor-free approach removes the need for large labeled datasets. During the search, we employ REINFORCE and Bayesian Optimization to explore the latent representation space and compare their performance against baseline methods. We further validate our approach by executing the best-discovered MaxCut circuits on IBM's ibm_sherbrooke quantum processor, confirming that the architectures retain optimal performance even under real hardware noise. Our results demonstrate that the framework efficiently identifies high-performing quantum circuits with fewer search iterations.</description>

Abstract: The quantum state discrimination problem has Alice sending a quantum state to Bob who wins if he correctly identifies the state. The pretty good measurement, also known as the square root measurement, performs pretty well at this task. We study the version of this problem where Bob tries to lose with the greatest probability possible (which is harder than it sounds). We define the pretty bad measurement which performs pretty well at this task, or in other words, pretty poorly for the original task. We show that both the pretty good measurement and the pretty bad measurement are always no worse than blind guessing at their respective tasks. As an application, we apply the pretty bad measurement to the quantum state anomaly detection problem and show how to avoid pretty bad qubits.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling laws for correlated decay of many-body quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum systems are open, continually exchanging energy and information with the surrounding environment. This interaction leads to decoherence and decay of quantum states. In complex systems, formed by many particles, decay can become correlated and enhanced. A fundamental question then arises: what is the maximal decay rate of a large quantum system, and how does it scale with its size? In this work, we address these issues by reformulating the problem into finding the ground state energy of a generic spin Hamiltonian. Inspired by recent work in Hamiltonian complexity theory, we establish rigorous and general upper and lower bounds on the maximal decay rate. These bounds are universal, as they hold for a broad class of Markovian many-body quantum systems. For many physically-relevant systems, the bounds are asymptotically tight, resulting in exact scaling laws with system size. Specifically, for large atomic arrays in free space, these scalings depend only on the arrays' dimensionality and are insensitive to details at short length-scales. The scaling laws set fundamental limits on the decay rates of all quantum states, shed light on the behavior of generic driven-dissipative systems, and may ultimately constrain the scalability of quantum processors and simulators based on atom arrays.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Product State Model for Simultaneous Classification and Generation</title>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly expanding field that merges the principles of quantum computing with the techniques of machine learning. One of the powerful mathematical frameworks in this domain is tensor networks. These networks are used to approximate high-order tensors by contracting tensors with lower ranks. Initially developed for simulating quantum systems, tensor networks have become integral to quantum computing and, by extension, to QML. Drawing inspiration from these quantum methods, specifically the Matrix Product States (MPS), we apply them in a classical machine learning setting. Their ability to efficiently represent and manipulate complex, high-dimensional data makes them effective in a supervised learning framework. Here, we present an MPS model, in which the MPS functions as both a classifier and a generator. The dual functionality of this novel MPS model permits a strategy that enhances the traditional training of supervised MPS models. This framework is inspired by generative adversarial networks and is geared towards generating more realistic samples by reducing outliers. In addition, our contributions offer insights into the mechanics of tensor network methods for generation tasks. Specifically, we discuss alternative embedding functions and a new sampling method from non-normalized MPSs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike most classical algorithms that take an input and give the solution directly as an output, quantum algorithms produce a quantum circuit that works as an indirect solution to computationally hard problems. In the full quantum computing workflow, most data processing remains in the classical domain except for running the quantum circuit in the quantum processor. This leaves massive opportunities for classical automation and optimization toward future utilization of quantum computing. We kickstart the first step in this direction by introducing Q-gen, a high-level, parameterized quantum circuit generator incorporating 15 realistic quantum algorithms. Each customized generation function comes with algorithmspecific parameters beyond the number of qubits, providing a large generation volume with high circuit variability. To demonstrate the functionality of Q-gen, we organize the algorithms into 5 hierarchical systems and generate a quantum circuit dataset accompanied by their measurement histograms and state vectors. This dataset enables researchers to statistically analyze the structure, complexity, and performance of large-scale quantum circuits, or quickly train novel machine learning models without worrying about the exponentially growing simulation time. Q-gen is an open-source and multipurpose project that serves as the entrance for users with a classical computer science background to dive into the world of quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) provides a promising avenue toward enabling quantum chemistry calculations, which are classically impossible due to a computational complexity that increases exponentially with system size. As fully fault-tolerant algorithms and hardware, for which an exponential speedup is predicted, are currently out of reach, recent research efforts are dedicated to developing and scaling algorithms for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices to showcase the practical utility of such machines. To demonstrate the utility of NISQ devices in the field of chemistry, we apply our recently developed FAST-VQE algorithm and a novel quantum gate reduction strategy based on propositional satisfiability together with standard optimization tools for the simulation of the rate-determining proton transfer step for CO2 hydration catalysed by carbonic anhydrase resulting in the first application of a quantum computing device for the simulation of an enzymatic reaction. To this end, we have combined classical force field simulations with quantum mechanical methods on classical and quantum computers in a hybrid calculation approach. The presented technique significantly enhances the accuracy and capabilities of QC-based molecular modeling and finally pushes it into compelling and realistic applications. The framework is general and can be applied beyond the case of computational enzymology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the growth and saturation of Krylov spread (K-) complexity under random quantum circuits. In Haar-random unitary evolution, we show that, for large system sizes, K-complexity grows linearly before saturating at a late-time value of $D/2$, where $D$ is the Hilbert space dimension, at timescales $\sim D$. Our numerical analysis encompasses two classes of random circuits: brick-wall random unitary circuits and Floquet random circuits. In brick-wall case, K-complexity exhibits dynamics consistent with Haar-random unitary evolution, while the inclusion of measurements significantly slows its growth down. For Floquet random circuits, we show that localized phases lead to reduced late-time saturation values of K-complexity, forbye we utilize these saturation values to probe the transition between thermal and many-body localized phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Being able to study the dynamics of quantum systems interacting with several environments is important in many settings ranging from quantum chemistry to quantum thermodynamics, through out-of-equilibrium systems. For such problems tensor network-based methods are state-of-the-art approaches for performing numerically exact simulations. However, to be used efficiently in this multi-environment and non-perturbative context, these methods require an optimized choice of the topology of the wave-function Ans\"atze. This is often done by analysing cross-correlations between different system and environment degrees of freedom. Here, we show for canonical model Hamiltonians that simple orderings of bosonic environmental modes, which enable the joint {System + Environments} state to be written as a matrix product state, considerably reduce the bond dimension required for convergence despite introducing long-ranged interactions. These results suggest that complex correlation analyses for tweaking tensor networks topology (e.g. entanglement renormalization) are usually not necessary and that tree tensor network states are sub-optimal compared to simple matrix product states in many important models of physical open systems.</description>

      <title>Resource Management and Circuit Scheduling for Distributed Quantum Computing Interconnect Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the scalability limitations of monolithic quantum processors in terms of computing capability. However, realising the full potential of DQC requires effective resource management and circuit scheduling. This involves efficiently assigning each circuit to an optimal subset of quantum processing units (QPUs), based on factors such as their computational power and connectivity. In heterogeneous DQC networks with arbitrary topologies and non-identical QPUs, this becomes a complex challenge. This paper addresses resource management in such settings, with a focus on computing resource allocation in a quantum data center. We propose circuit scheduling and resource allocation algorithms that combine heuristic methods with a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation. Our MILP model accounts for infidelities arising from inter-QPU communication. The algorithms consider key factors including network topology, QPU characteristics, and quantum circuit structure to make efficient scheduling and allocation decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves circuit execution time and resource utilisation, measured by makespan, throughput, and QPU usage, while also reducing inter-QPU communication, compared to a baseline random allocation strategy. This work provides valuable insights into resource management strategies for scalable and heterogeneous DQC systems.</description>

Abstract: The existence of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) -- efficient quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries -- has been a central open question, with significant implications for cryptography, complexity theory, and fundamental physics. In this work, we close this question by proving that PRUs exist, assuming that any quantum-secure one-way function exists. We establish this result for both (1) the standard notion of PRUs, which are secure against any efficient adversary that makes queries to the unitary $U$, and (2) a stronger notion of PRUs, which are secure even against adversaries that can query both the unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$. In the process, we prove that any algorithm that makes queries to a Haar-random unitary can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, up to inverse-exponential trace distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16630v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways, which can be used to isolate purely bright state contributions. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to model a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of symmetries can lead to nontrivial dynamics of operator entanglement in open quantum many-body systems, which characterizes the cost of an matrix product density operator (MPDO) representation of the density matrix in the tensor-network methods and provides a measure for the corresponding classical simulability. One example is the $\mathrm{U}(1)$-symmetric open quantum systems with dephasing, in which the operator entanglement increases logarithmically at late times instead of being suppressed by the dephasing. Here we numerically study the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of operator entanglement in a dissipative quantum many-body system with the more complicated $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry and dissipations beyond dephasing. We show that after the initial rise and fall, the operator entanglement also increases again in a logarithmic manner at late times in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-symmetric case. We find that this behavior can be fully understood from the corresponding $\mathrm{U}(1)$ subsymmetry by considering the symmetry-resolved operator entanglement. But unlike the $\mathrm{U}(1)$-symmetric case with dephasing, both the classical Shannon entropy associated with the probabilities for the half system being in different symmetry sectors and the corresponding symmetry-resolved operator entanglement have nontrivial contributions to the late time logarithmic growth of operator entanglement. Our results show evidence that the logarithmic growth of operator entanglement at long times is a generic behavior of dissipative quantum many-body dynamics with $\mathrm{U}(1)$ as the symmetry or subsymmetry and for more broad dissipations beyond dephasing. We show that the latter is valid even for open quantum systems with only $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry by breaking the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry of our quantum dynamics to $\mathrm{U}(1)$.</description>

Abstract: We present a protocol to implement a spin-1 chain in Rydberg systems using three Rydberg states close to a F\"orster resonance. In addition to dipole-dipole interactions, strong van der Waals interactions naturally appear due to the presence of the F\"orster resonance and give rise to a highly tunable Hamiltonian. The resulting phase diagram is studied using the infinite density-matrix renormalization group and reveals a highly robust Haldane phase -- a prime example of a symmetry protected topological phase. We find experimentally accessible parameters to probe the Haldane phase in current Rydberg systems, and demonstrate an efficient adiabatic preparation scheme. This paves the way to probe the remarkable properties of spin fractionalization in the Haldane phase.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the microscopic to macroscopic crossover using superconducting quantum impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite being a pillar of quantum mechanics, little attention has been paid to the onset of Fermi's golden rule as a discrete microscopic bath of modes approaches the macroscopic thermodynamic limit and forms a continuum. Motivated by recent experiments in circuit quantum electrodynamics, we tackle this question through the lens of single-photon decay in a finite transmission line coupled to a qubit ("quantum impurity"). We consider a single-photon state, coupled via the nonlinear impurity to several baths formed by multi-photon states with different number of photons, which are inherently discrete due to the finite size of the line. We focus on the late-time dynamics of the single-photon, and uncover the conditions under which the photon's decoherence rate approaches the decay rate predicted by Fermi's golden rule. We show that it is necessary to keep a small but finite escape rate (unrelated to the impurity) for each single-photon mode to obtain a finite long-time decay rate. We analyze the contribution of the baths formed by many-body states with different number of photons, and illustrate how the decay rate induced by some bath of $n$ photon states is enhanced by the presence of other baths of $m \neq n$ photon states, highlighting the contribution of cascade photon decay processes. Our formalism could be used to analyze recent experiments in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Synchronous manipulation of nuclear spins via boron vacancy centers in hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method for entangling operations on nuclear spins surrounding a negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-center) point defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). To this end, we propose to employ the electron spin of a VB-center as a control qubit. We show that in the presence of a background magnetic field and by applying control pulses, one can collectively manipulate the state of the nuclei with $\hat{U}_z$ and $\hat{U}_x$ rotations. These rotations can serve for implementing the synchronous three-qubit $X$, $Z$, and the Hadamard gates. Through our numerical analyses considering realistic system parameters and the decoherence effects, we demonstrate that these gates can be executed with high fidelities. Furthermore, as an example for the application of our toolbox, we utilize these collective gates to prepare the highly entangled GHZ states among the three nuclear spins with a fidelity of $0.99$. By including the electron decoherence effects, we find that the relative deviations of the gate fidelities from the noisy terms are negligibly small, proving the noise-resilience of our protocols. Our work can serve as the foundation for exploiting the nuclear spins in hBN in future quantum technological applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the eigenfunctions of the classical Liouville operator and investigate the conditions they must obey to be separable as a product state. We point out that the conditions for separability are equivalent to requirements of Liouville's integrability theorem, this is, the eigenfunctions are separable if and only if the system is integrable. On the other hand, if the classical system is not integrable, then the eigenfunctions are entangled in all canonical coordinates. This results in a link between the classical notions of chaos and integrability with mathematical concepts that are usually restricted to quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Improved entanglement entropy estimates from filtered bitstring probabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the bitstring probabilities of ground states of bipartitioned ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the mutual information which is a lower bound on the corresponding bipartite von Neumann quantum entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. We show that in many cases, these lower bounds can be improved by removing the bitstrings with a probability lower than some value $p_{min}$ and renormalizing the remaining probabilities (filtering). We propose a heuristic based on the change of the conditional entropy under filtering that very effectively improves the estimate of $S^{vN}_A$. We consider various sizes, lattice spacings and bipartitions. Our numerical investigation suggest that the filtered mutual information obtained with samples having just a few thousand bitstrings can provide reasonably close estimates of $S^{vN}_A$. We briefly discuss practical implementations with the QuEra's Aquila device.</description>

      <title>Encodings of the weighted MAX k-CUT on qubit systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08594v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weighted MAX k-CUT problem involves partitioning a weighted undirected graph into k subsets, or colors, to maximize the sum of the weights of edges between vertices in different subsets. This problem has significant applications across multiple domains. This paper explores encoding methods for MAX k-CUT on qubit systems, utilizing quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA) and addressing the challenge of encoding integer values on quantum devices with binary variables. We examine various encoding schemes and evaluate the efficiency of these approaches. The paper presents a systematic and resource efficient method to implement phase separation for diagonal square binary matrices. When encoding the problem into the full Hilbert space, we show the importance of encoding the colors in a balanced way. We also explore the option to encode the problem into a suitable subspace, by designing suitable state preparations and constrained mixers (LX- and Grover-mixer). Numerical simulations on weighted and unweighted graph instances demonstrate the effectiveness of these encoding schemes, particularly in optimizing circuit depth, approximation ratios, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Correlations and Entanglement Generation in Electron-Molecule Inelastic Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics and processes involved in particle-molecule scattering, including nuclear dynamics, are described and analyzed using various quantum information quantities throughout the different stages of the scattering. The main process studied and characterized with the information quantities is the interatomic coulombic electronic capture (ICEC), an inelastic process that can lead to dissociation of the target molecule. The analysis focuses on a one-dimensional transversely confined $\text{NeHe}$ molecule model used to simulate the scattering between an electron $\text{e}^-$(particle) and a $\text{NeHe}^+$ ion (molecule). The time-independent Schr\"odinger equation (TISE) is solved using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with a self-developed Julia package \hyperlink{https://github.com/mendzmartin/FEMTISE.jl}{FEMTISE} to compute potential energy curves (PECs) and the parameters of the interactions between particles. The time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) is solved using the Multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) algorithm. The time dependent electronic and nuclear probability densities are calculated for different electron incoming energies, evidencing elastic and inelastic processes that can be correlated to changes in von Neumann entropy, von Neumann mutual information and Shannon mutual information. The expectation value of the position of the particles, as well as their standard deviations, are analyzed along the whole dynamics and related to the entanglement during the collision and after the process is over, thus highlighting the dynamics of entanglement generation. It is shown that the correlations generated in the collision are partially retained only when the inelastic process is active.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communication over a fully quantum relay channel is considered. We establish three bounds based on different coding strategies, i.e., partial decode-forward, measure-forward, and assist-forward. Using the partial-decode forward strategy, the relay decodes part of the information, while the other part is decoded without the relay's help. The result by Savov et al. (2012) for a classical-quantum relay channel is obtained as a special case. Based on our partial-decode forward bound, the capacity is determined for Hadamard relay channels. In the measure-forward coding scheme, the relay performs a sequence of measurements and then sends a compressed representation of the measurement outcome to the destination receiver. The measure-forward strategy can be viewed as a generalization of the classical compress-forward bound. At last, we consider quantum relay channels with orthogonal receiver components. The assist-forward bound is based on a new approach, whereby the transmitter sends the message to the relay and simultaneously generates entanglement assistance between the relay and the destination receiver. Subsequently, the relay can transmit the message to the destination receiver with rate-limited entanglement assistance.</description>

      <title>Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD): An Informational Ontology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics has transformed our understanding of reality, yet deep philosophical puzzles remain unresolved. Is there a consistent way to describe quantum measurement, the emergence of space and time, and the role of observers within one coherent ontology? This paper introduces Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD), an interpretation that places relationships and information, not isolated objects, at the foundation of physics. Unlike traditional views, such as the Copenhagen interpretation, Everett's many-worlds theory, or hidden-variable approaches, RQD denies a single observer-independent reality, instead proposing that facts only become definite within specific observational contexts. It explicitly addresses foundational no-go results, including Bell's theorem, the Kochen-Specker theorem, and the Frauchiger-Renner paradox, by replacing absolute facts with relational, context-dependent truths. RQD rests on five interlocking principles: (1) quantum states are contextual and observer-relative, (2) time emerges from quantum interactions rather than existing as an external parameter, (3) space is constructed from patterns of quantum entanglement, (4) observers emerge as systems with highly integrated information, and (5) classical reality appears through quantum decoherence without special wavefunction collapse. Philosophically, RQD aligns with ontic structural realism, proposing that the fundamental ontology of the universe consists entirely of informational relations. It avoids collapsing into relativism or solipsism by ensuring intersubjective agreement through physical interactions. Ultimately, RQD may offer a unified picture in which quantum mechanics, spacetime, and observers are no longer separate domains but aspects of one interconnected informational web.</description>

Abstract: The properties of interfaces are key to understand the physics of matter. However, the study of quantum interface dynamics has remained an outstanding challenge. Here, we use large-scale Tree Tensor Network simulations to identify the dynamical signature of an interface roughening transition within the ferromagnetic phase of the 2D quantum Ising model. For initial domain wall profiles we find extended prethermal plateaus for smooth interfaces, whereas above the roughening transition the domain wall decays quickly. Our results can be readily explored experimentally in Rydberg atomic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement of qudit pairs, with single particle Hilbert space dimension $d$, has important potential for quantum information processing, with applications in cryptography, algorithms, and error correction. For a pair of qudits of arbitrary even dimension $d$, we introduce a generalized Bell basis with definite symmetry under exchange of internal states between the two particles. We show that no complete exchange-symmetrized basis can exist for odd $d$. This framework extends prior work on exchange-symmetrized hyperentangled qubit bases, where $d$ is a power of two. For our exchange-symmetrized basis we show that measurement devices restricted to linear evolution and local measurement (LELM) can unambiguously distinguish $2d-1$ qudit Bell states for any even $d$. This achieves the upper bound in general for reliable Bell-state distinguishability via LELM and augments previously known limits for $d = 2^n$ and $d=3$. This result is relevant to near-term realizations of quantum communication protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introducing a controlled and strong anharmonicity in mechanical systems is a present challenge of nanomechanics. In cavity optomechanics a mechanical oscillator may be made anharmonic by ponderomotively coupling its motion to the light field of a laser-driven cavity. In the regime where the mechanical resonating frequency and the single-photon coupling constant are small compared to the decay rate of the cavity field, it turns out that the quantum electromagnetic fluctuations of the laser field drive the oscillator into a high-temperature thermal state. The motional state may however be highly non-Gaussian; we show that a precise tuning of system parameters may even lead to a purely quartic effective potential for the mechanical oscillator. We present a theory that predicts the measurable signatures left by the mechanical anharmonicity. In particular, we obtain analytically and numerically the mechanical displacement spectrum, and explore the imprints of the mechanical anharmonicity on the cavity light field.</description>

Abstract: Benchmarking and establishing proper statistical validation metrics for reinforcement learning (RL) remain ongoing challenges, where no consensus has been established yet. The emergence of quantum computing and its potential applications in quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) further complicate benchmarking efforts. To enable valid performance comparisons and to streamline current research in this area, we propose a novel benchmarking methodology, which is based on a statistical estimator for sample complexity and a definition of statistical outperformance. Furthermore, considering QRL, our methodology casts doubt on some previous claims regarding its superiority. We conducted experiments on a novel benchmarking environment with flexible levels of complexity. While we still identify possible advantages, our findings are more nuanced overall. We discuss the potential limitations of these results and explore their implications for empirical research on quantum advantage in QRL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Squeezed vacuum, a fundamental resource for continuous-variable quantum information processing, has been used to demonstrate quantum advantages in sensing, communication, and computation. While most experiments use homodyne detection to characterize squeezing and are therefore limited to electronic bandwidths, recent experiments have shown optical parametric amplification (OPA) to be a viable measurement strategy. Here, we realize OPA-based quantum state tomography in integrated photonics and demonstrate the generation and all-optical Wigner tomography of squeezed vacuum in a nanophotonic circuit. We employ dispersion-engineering to enable the distortion-free propagation of femtosecond pulses and achieve ultrabroad operation bandwidths, effectively lifting the speed restrictions imposed by traditional electronics on quantum measurements with a theoretical maximum clock speed of 6.5 THz. We implement our circuit on thin-film lithium niobate, a platform compatible with a wide variety of active and passive photonic components. Our results chart a course for realizing all-optical ultrafast quantum information processing in an integrated room-temperature platform.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Eigen- and Singular-value Transformation Oracles: From Algorithmic Applications to Hardware Compilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To showcase the oracle's representation-theoretic power, and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. In doing so, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancilla qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of eigenstate preparation in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation -- applicable in both near-term and large-scale quantum processors -- expressing high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system, and we provide details for 1D and 2D examples.

      <title>Entropic Diagram Characterization of Quantum Coherence: Degenerate Distillation and the Maximum Eigenvalue Uncertainty Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a rigorous framework for quantifying quantum coherence in finite-dimensional systems by applying the Schur-Horn majorization theorem to relate eigenvalue distributions and diagonal entries of density matrices. Building on this foundation, we introduce a versatile suite of coherence measures, including the relative cross-entropy of coherence and its partial variants, that satisfy all resource theoretic axioms under incoherent operations. This unifying approach clarifies the geometric boundaries of physically realizable states in von Neumann-Tsallis entropy space and uncovers the phenomenon of degenerate coherence distillation where symmetry in the eigenvalue spectrum enables enhanced coherence extraction in higher-dimensional systems. In addition, we strengthen the entropy-based uncertainty relation by refining the Maassen-Uffink bound to account for the largest eigenvalues across distinct measurement bases. This refinement forges a deeper connection between entropy and uncertainty, which yields operationally meaningful constraints for quantum information tasks. Altogether, our findings illustrate the power of majorization in resource-theoretic analyses of quantum coherence, which offer valuable tools for both fundamental research and real-world applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Dynamics in the presence of local symmetry-breaking impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous symmetries lead to universal slow relaxation of correlation functions in quantum many-body systems. In this work, we study how local symmetry-breaking impurities affect the dynamics of these correlation functions using Brownian quantum circuits, which we expect to apply to generic non-integrable systems with the same symmetries. While explicitly breaking the symmetry is generally expected to lead to eventual restoration of full ergodicity, we find that approximately conserved quantities that survive under such circumstances can still induce slow relaxation. This can be understood using a super-Hamiltonian formulation, where low-lying excitations determine the late-time dynamics and exact ground states correspond to conserved quantities. We show that in one dimension, symmetry-breaking impurities modify diffusive and subdiffusive behaviors associated with U$(1)$ and dipole conservation at late-times, e.g., by increasing power-law decay exponents of the decay of autocorrelation functions. This stems from the fact that for these symmetries, impurities are relevant in the renormalization group sense, e.g., bulk impurities effectively disconnect the system, completely modifying both temporal and spatial correlations. On the other hand, for an impurity that disrupts strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the super-Hamiltonian only acquires an exponentially small gap, leading to prethermal plateaus in autocorrelation functions which extend for times that scale exponentially with the distance to the impurity. Overall, our approach systematically characterizes how symmetry breaking impurities affect relaxation dynamics in symmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Maxwell's Demon Is Foiled by the Entropy Cost of Measurement, Not Erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I dispute the conventional claim that the second law of thermodynamics is saved from a "Maxwell's Demon" by the entropy cost of information erasure, and show that instead it is measurement that incurs the entropy cost. Thus Brillouin, who identified measurement as savior of the second law, was essentially correct, and putative refutations of his view, such as Bennett's claim to measure without entropy cost, are seen to fail when the applicable physics is taken into account. I argue that the tradition of attributing the defeat of Maxwell's Demon to erasure rather than to measurement arose from unphysical classical idealizations that do not hold for real gas molecules, as well as a physically ungrounded recasting of physical thermodynamical processes into computational and information-theoretic conceptualizations. I argue that the fundamental principle that saves the second law is the quantum uncertainty principle applying to the need to localize physical states to precise values of observables in order to effect the desired disequilibria aimed at violating the second law. I obtain the specific entropy cost for localizing a molecule in the Szilard engine and show that it coincides with the quantity attributed to Landauer's principle. I also note that an experiment characterized as upholding an entropy cost of erasure in a "quantum Maxwell's Demon" actually demonstrates an entropy cost of measurement.</description>

      <title>Compact Circuits for Constrained Quantum Evolutions of Sparse Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for constructing compact quantum circuits that implement the real-time evolution of Hamiltonians of the form $H = \sigma P_B$, where $\sigma$ is a Pauli string commuting with a projection operator $P_B$ onto a subspace of the computational basis. Such Hamiltonians frequently arise in quantum algorithms, including constrained mixers in QAOA, fermionic and excitation operators in VQE, and lattice gauge theory applications. Additionally, we construct transposition gates, widely used in quantum computing, that scale more efficiently than the best known constructions in literature. Our method emphasizes the minimization of non-transversal gates, particularly T-gates, critical for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We construct circuits requiring $\mathcal{O}(n|B|)$ CX gates and $\mathcal{O}(n |B| + \log(|B|) \log (1/\epsilon))$ T-gates, where $n$ is the number of qubits, $|B|$ the dimension of the projected subspace, and $\epsilon$ the desired approximation precision. For subspaces that are generated by Pauli X-orbits we further reduce complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n \log |B|)$ CX gates and $\mathcal{O}(n+\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ T gates. Our constructive proofs yield explicit algorithms and include several applications, such as improved transposition circuits, efficient implementations of fermionic excitations, and oracle operators for combinatorial optimization. In the sparse case, i.e. when $|B|$ is small, the proposed algorithms scale favourably when compared to direct Pauli evolution.</description>

      <title>On the Efficient Extraction of Entangled Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Quantum Internet, multipartite entanglement enables a rich and dynamic overlay topology, referred to as artificial topology, upon the physical one, that can be exploited for communication purposes. In fact, the ability to extract $n$-qubits GHZ states and EPR pairs from the original multipartite entangled state constitutes the resource primitives for end-to-end and on-demand quantum communications. Thus, in this paper, we theoretically determine upper and lower bounds for the number of extractable $n$-qubits GHZ states and EPR pairs involving nodes remote in the artificial topology, as well as the achievable size $n$ of remote GHZ states. The theoretical analysis is then complemented by the proposal of a novel algorithm, which provides in polynomial-time a heuristic solution to the above problem. This is remarkable, since the theoretical problem is NP-complete. The performance analysis demonstrates the proposed algorithm is able to effectively manipulate the original and arbitrary graph state for extracting entanglement resources across remote nodes.</description>

      <title>Magnetic noise in macroscopic quantum spatial superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we will show how random fluctuations in the magnetic field will jitter the paths of a matter-wave interferometer randomly, hence, decohere the quantum superposition. To create a large spatial superposition with nanoparticles, we envisage embedding a spin in a nanoparticle as a defect and applying an inhomogeneous magnetic field as in a Stern-Gerlach type experiment to create a macroscopic quantum superposition. Such matter-wave interferometers are the cornerstone for many new fundamental advancements in physics; particularly, adjacent matter-wave interferometers can use entanglement features to test physics beyond the Standard Model, test the equivalence principle, improve quantum sensors, and test the quantum nature of spacetime in a lab. In particular, we will use white and flicker noise to study the decoherence and constrain the parameters keeping in mind ambient temperatures suitable for superconducting wires embedded on a chip. We will show that to obtain a tiny spatial superposition of a nanometer separation, $\Delta x \sim {\cal O} (10^{-9})$m and to minimize decoherence, $\Gamma\leq {\cal O}(\frac{\omega_0}{2\pi})$, where $\Gamma$ is the decoherence and $\omega_0$ is the frequency of the oscillator, we will need current fluctuations to be $\delta I/I\leq {\cal O}(10^{-8})$, which is not impossible to obtain in superconducting wire arrangements. For such tiny fluctuations, we demonstrate that the Humpty-Dumpty problem in a matter-wave interferometer arising from a mismatch in position and momentum does not cause a loss in contrast.</description>

      <title>The DKP Equation in Presence of a Woods-Saxon Potential: Transmission Resonances and Bound States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we solve the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) equation in the presence of the Woods-Saxon potential barrier and well for spin-one particles. We derive the scattering solution in terms of the Gaussian hypergeometric function ${}_2F_1(a, b; c; z)$, the regularized Gaussian hypergeometric function ${}_2\tilde{F}_1(a, b; c; z)$, and the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$. Our analysis reveals the presence of transmission resonances. To observe these resonances, we calculate and plot the transmission $T$ and reflection $R$ coefficients for various parameters of the Woods-Saxon potential barrier. Our results are compared with those obtained for the square potential barrier and the cusp potential barrier, which represent limiting cases of the Woods-Saxon potential barrier. Furthermore, we investigate the bound state solutions, determining the critical turning point $V_{cr}$ to study particle-antiparticle creation and compute the norm $N$. Finally, we also compare our results with those obtained for the square potential well and the cusp potential well, confirming that pair creation occurs in both potential wells.</description>

      <title>Integrability and Chaos via fractal analysis of Spectral Form Factors: Gaussian approximations and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the mathematical equivalence between the spectral form factor, a quantity used to identify the onset of quantum chaos and scrambling in quantum many-body systems, and the classical problem of statistical characterization of planar random walks. We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random process on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such random process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the associated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This leads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for quantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low temperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the distribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the spectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation. Assuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical problem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk, defined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement, approaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk approaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the fractal dimension $4/3$. Additionally, we numerically show that Bethe Ansatz walkers fall into a category similar to the non-integrable walkers.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Toll Framework: A Thermodynamic Model of Collapse and Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamic rendering model in which the traditional quantum observer is reframed as a special case of a coherence-constrained interface. Collapse is treated not as an interpretive postulate but as a structural threshold - reached when the energetic cost of sustaining coherence exceeds a system's available budget. The Quantum Toll Framework (QTF) formalizes this by recasting observation as a bounded rendering process, governed by entropy, energy, and discrete action. Extending Landauer's principle, we show that the thermodynamic cost of observation includes not only information erasure but also the stabilization of rendered states. Collapse is thus redefined as a solvable, testable transition. This model accounts for classical emergence, time asymmetry, and measurement without invoking consciousness or symbolic cognition. Empirical consequences are discussed, including confirmation of a quantized collapse floor in historical cloud chamber data.</description>

      <title>Pursuit and Review of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) based Quantum Computing -- Qubit Generation, Spin Purification, Tailored RF Pulses and MRI Sequences for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) technique based quantum bit (qubit) generation with water proton NMR (1H-NMR), distinct from previously proposed NMR chemical shift or spectroscopic techniques based qubit generation. We briefly review prior NMR-based techniques in the context of quantum computing, focusing on MRI-related methods. The proposed technique utilizes MRI-based gradient methods combined with set of local reverse gradients to generate multiple qubits. This configuration enables the creation of multiple localized constant magnetic fields, each producing a qubit with highly homogeneous field, therefore, a unique single frequency. The RF electronics and signal processing techniques are analogous to those used in conventional MRI scanners, allowing operation at room temperature, with the exception of the main magnet, which remains identical to that of standard MRI systems. Additional advantages of this method include the ability to leverage the extensive pulse techniques and hardware developed for MRI scanners over the past 50 years. Furthermore, the wide array of MRI pulse sequences enables highly sophisticated signal processing for quantum computing applications, such as the spin purification.</description>

      <title>Versatile Quantum-Safe Hybrid Key Exchange and Its Application to MACsec</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in quantum computing pose a significant threat to most of the cryptography currently deployed. Fortunately, cryptographic building blocks to mitigate the threat are already available; mostly based on post-quantum and quantum cryptography, but also on symmetric cryptography techniques. Notably, quantum-safe building blocks must be deployed as soon as possible due to the ``harvest-now decrypt-later'' attack scenario, which is already challenging our sensitive and encrypted data today.
  Following an agile defense-in-depth approach, Hybrid Authenticated Key Exchange (HAKE) protocols have recently been gaining significant attention. Such protocols modularly combine conventional, post-quantum, and quantum cryptography to achieve confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity guarantees for network channels. Unfortunately, only a few protocols have yet been proposed (mainly Muckle and Muckle+) with different flexibility guarantees.
  Looking at available standards in the network domain (especially at the Media Access Control Security (MACsec) standard), we believe that HAKE protocols could already bring strong security benefits to MACsec today. MACsec is a standard designed to secure communication at the data link layer in Ethernet networks by providing security for all traffic between adjacent entities. In addition, MACsec establishes secure channels within a Local Area Network (LAN), ensuring that data remain protected from eavesdropping, tampering, and unauthorized access, while operating transparently to higher layer protocols. Currently, MACsec does not offer enough protection in the event of cryptographically relevant quantum computers.
  In this work, we tackle the challenge and propose a new versatile HAKE protocol, dubbed VMuckle, which is sufficiently flexible for the use in MACsec to provide LAN participants with hybrid key material ensuring secure communication.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the generalized moment membership problem for matrices, a formulation equivalent to Skolem's problem for linear recurrence sequences. We show decidability for orthogonal, unitary, and real eigenvalue matrices, and undecidability for matrices over certain commutative and non-commutative polynomial rings. As consequences, we deduce that positivity is decidable for simple unitary linear recurrence sequences and undecidable for linear recurrence sequences over commutative polynomial rings. As a byproduct, we also prove a free version of Polya's theorem.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Metal-Organic Frameworks Using Quantum Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the potential of using quantum natural language processing (QNLP) to inverse design metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with targeted properties. Specifically, by analyzing 450 hypothetical MOF structures consisting of 3 topologies, 10 metal nodes and 15 organic ligands, we categorize these structures into four distinct classes for pore volume and $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant values. We then compare various QNLP models (i.e. the bag-of-words, DisCoCat (Distributional Compositional Categorical), and sequence-based models) to identify the most effective approach to process the MOF dataset. Using a classical simulator provided by the IBM Qiskit, the bag-of-words model is identified to be the optimum model, achieving validation accuracies of 88.6% and 78.0% for binary classification tasks on pore volume and $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant, respectively. Further, we developed multi-class classification models tailored to the probabilistic nature of quantum circuits, with average test accuracies of 92% and 80% across different classes for pore volume and $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant datasets. Finally, the performance of generating MOF with target properties showed accuracies of 93.5% for pore volume and 87% for $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant, respectively. Although our investigation covers only a fraction of the vast MOF search space, it marks a promising first step towards using quantum computing for materials design, offering a new perspective through which to explore the complex landscape of MOFs.</description>

Abstract: Having in mind the significance of parity (reflection) in various areas of physics, the single-mode and two-mode Wigner algebras are considered adding to them a reflection operator. The associated deformed $sl(2, R)$ algebra, $sl_{\nu}(2,R)$ and the deformed $so(3)$ algebra, $so_{\nu}(3)$, are constructed for the widely used Jordan-Schwinger and Holstein-Primakoff realizations, commenting on various aspects and ingredients of the formalism for both single-mode and two-mode cases. Finally, due to its potential application in the study of qubit and qutrit systems, the parity-deformed $so_{\nu}(3)$ representation is analyzed based on the isomorphy of $so(3)$ and $su(2)$. Related applications are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Messenger Search for Exotic Field Emission with a Global Magnetometer Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensor networks in combination with traditional astronomical observations are emerging as a novel modality for multi-messenger astronomy. Here we develop a generic analysis framework that uses a data-driven approach to model the sensitivity of a quantum sensor network to astrophysical signals as a consequence of beyond-the-Standard Model (BSM) physics. The analysis method evaluates correlations between sensors to search for BSM signals coincident with astrophysical triggers such as black hole mergers, supernovae, or fast radio bursts. Complementary to astroparticle approaches that search for particlelike signals (e.g. WIMPs), quantum sensors are sensitive to wavelike signals from exotic quantum fields. This analysis method can be applied to networks of different types of quantum sensors, such as atomic clocks, matter-wave interferometers, and nuclear clocks, which can probe many types of interactions between BSM fields and standard model particles.
  We use this analysis method to carry out the first direct search utilizing a terrestrial network of precision quantum sensors for BSM fields emitted during a black hole merger. Specifically we use the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics (GNOME) to perform a search for exotic low-mass field (ELF) bursts generated in coincidence with a gravitational wave signal from a binary black hole merger (GW200311 115853) detected by LIGO/Virgo on the 11th of March 2020. The associated gravitational wave heralds the arrival of the ELF burst that interacts with the spins of fermions in the magnetometers. This enables GNOME to serve as a tool for multi-messenger astronomy. Our search found no significant events, and consequently we place the first lab-based limits on combinations of ELF production and coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>Self-distributive structures, braces &amp; the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation is reviewed from a purely algebraic point of view. We recall certain algebraic structures called shelves, racks and quandles. These objects satisfy a self-distributivity condition and lead to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. The quantum algebra as well as the integrability associated to Baxterized involutive set-theoretic solutions is briefly discussed. We then present the theory of the universal algebras associated to rack and general set-theoretic solutions. We show that these are quasi-triangular Hopf algebras and we derive the universal set-theoretic Drinfel'd twist. It is shown that this is an admissible twist allowing the derivation of the universal set-theoretic R-matrix.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Order Interface Propagating over the Ferromagnetic Ground State in the Transverse Field Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider time evolution of order parameters and entanglement asymmetries in the ferromagnetic phase of the transverse-field Ising chain. One side of the system is prepared in a ferromagnetic ground state and the other side either in equilibrium at higher temperature or out of equilibrium. We focus on the disorder-order interface in which the order parameter attains a nonzero value, different from the ground state one. In that region, correlations follow a universal behaviour. We analytically compute the asymptotic scaling functions of the one- and two-point equal time correlations of the order parameter and provide numerical evidence that also the non-equal time correlations are universal. We analyze the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetries of subsystems and obtain a prediction that is expected to hold also in the von Neumann limit. Finally, we show that the Wigner-Yanase skew information of the order paramerter in subsystems within the interfacial region scales as their length squared. We propose a semiclassical approximation that is particularly effective close to the edge of the lightcone.</description>

      <title>Impact of Fixing Spins in a Quantum Annealer with Energy Rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, various hardware restrictions significantly impede its efficient performance. Size-reduction methods provide an effective approach for addressing large-scale problems but often introduce additional challenges. A notable hardware restriction is the limited number of decision variables quantum annealing can handle compared to the size of the problem. Moreover, when employing size-reduction methods, the interactions and local magnetic fields in the Ising model--used to represent the combinatorial optimization problem--can become excessively large, making them difficult to implement on hardware. Although prior studies suggest that energy rescaling impacts the performance of quantum annealing, its interplay with size-reduction methods remains unexplored. This study examines the relationship between fixing spins, a promising size-reduction method, and the effects of energy rescaling. Numerical simulations and experiments conducted on a quantum annealer demonstrate that the fixing spins method enhances quantum annealing performance while preserving the spin-chain embedding for a homogeneous, fully connected ferromagnetic Ising model.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomalous Hall domains in a Quenched Topological Mott Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an interacting spinless quadratic band touching model that realizes a topological Mott insulating state. We quench the interaction from a value corresponding to the nematic insulator to that of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) ordered phase. We perform time-dependent Hartree-Fock simulations and show that after the quench the system realizes an excited Dirac semimetal state, which is however unstable and spontaneously evolves to a state with inhomogeneous nematic and QAH order parameters. The modulations form a stripe pattern that grows exponentially with time until the local Chern marker reaches unity. The alternating QAH order defines a domain structure with boundaries that host chiral sublattice currents.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide local field enhancement to be used as efficiency-boosting tools in fluorescence-based applications. For photostable quantum dots (QDs) to have enhanced emission, their size and exact location in the proximity of plasmonic nanostructure become key parameters while constructing light emitting devices. However, plasmonic nanostructures mostly suffer from non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which hinders the ultimate performance of fluorophores. In this work, we provided critical interparticle distances through finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, where the radiative decay rate is equalized to the non-radiative counterpart for light emitting QD-based technologies. To show the promises of the QD placement at a critical distance, we demonstrate an optical switch for the fluorescence efficiency of a CdSe/ZnS core-shell QD (CSQD) by optically exciting the silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance. While the provided single particle spectroscopy allows for the observation of heterogeneity in CSQD-AgNP coupling that is often masked in ensemble measurements, our benchmark study serves as a base reference for the development of QD-based light emitting technologies by resolving the optically switchable active tuning of radiative decay rates.</description>

      <title>Quantum emitters in silicon: Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation as a probe of local refractive index changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters embedded in silicon photonic cavities offer a powerful and scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a novel sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). In contrast to traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach exploits the lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, and CMOS-compatible sensing modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance operation regime, where the lifetime response becomes linear and maximally sensitive to small perturbations. Parametric evaluation of the analytical expressions shows that, for moderate-quality photonic cavities (Q = 10^5 to 10^7), this method enables refractive index detection limits as low as 10^{-9} RIU, competitive with or even outperforming state-of-the-art plasmonic and microresonator sensors, yet requiring significantly simpler instrumentation. Furthermore, we show that long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon provide a unique advantage, allowing sub-nanosecond lifetime shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of quantum emitters in silicon has yet to be demonstrated, our results lay the theoretical foundation for scalable, room-temperature, quantum-enabled sensing of refractive index changes, eliminating the need for spectral resolution and cryogenic infrastructure.</description>
