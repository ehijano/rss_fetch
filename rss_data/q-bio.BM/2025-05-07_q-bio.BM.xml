      <title>CreoPep: A Universal Deep Learning Framework for Target-Specific Peptide Design and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target-specific peptides, such as conotoxins, exhibit exceptional binding affinity and selectivity toward ion channels and receptors. However, their therapeutic potential remains underutilized due to the limited diversity of natural variants and the labor-intensive nature of traditional optimization strategies. Here, we present CreoPep, a deep learning-based conditional generative framework that integrates masked language modeling with a progressive masking scheme to design high-affinity peptide mutants while uncovering novel structural motifs. CreoPep employs an integrative augmentation pipeline, combining FoldX-based energy screening with temperature-controlled multinomial sampling, to generate structurally and functionally diverse peptides that retain key pharmacological properties. We validate this approach by designing conotoxin inhibitors targeting the $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, achieving submicromolar potency in electrophysiological assays. Structural analysis reveals that CreoPep-generated variants engage in both conserved and novel binding modes, including disulfide-deficient forms, thus expanding beyond conventional design paradigms. Overall, CreoPep offers a robust and generalizable platform that bridges computational peptide design with experimental validation, accelerating the discovery of next-generation peptide therapeutics.</description>

      <title>AutoLoop: a novel autoregressive deep learning method for protein loop prediction with high accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein structure prediction is a critical and longstanding challenge in biology, garnering widespread interest due to its significance in understanding biological processes. A particular area of focus is the prediction of missing loops in proteins, which are vital in determining protein function and activity. To address this challenge, we propose AutoLoop, a novel computational model designed to automatically generate accurate loop backbone conformations that closely resemble their natural structures. AutoLoop employs a bidirectional training approach while merging atom- and residue-level embedding, thus improving robustness and precision. We compared AutoLoop with twelve established methods, including FREAD, NGK, AlphaFold2, and AlphaFold3. AutoLoop consistently outperforms other methods, achieving a median RMSD of 1.12 Angstrom and a 2-Angstrom success rate of 73.23% on the CASP15 dataset, while maintaining strong performance on the HOMSTARD dataset. It demonstrates the best performance across nearly all loop lengths and secondary structural types. Beyond accuracy, AutoLoop is computationally efficient, requiring only 0.10 s per generation. A post-processing module for side-chain packing and energy minimization further improves results slightly, confirming the reliability of the predicted backbone. A case study also highlights AutoLoop's potential for precise predictions based on dominant loop conformations. These advances hold promise for protein engineering and drug discovery.</description>

      <title>MAP Format for Representing Chemical Modifications, Annotations, and Mutations in Protein Sequences: An Extension of the FASTA Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several formats, including FASTA, PIR, GenBank, EMBL, and GCG, have been developed for representing protein sequences composed of natural amino acids. Among these, FASTA remains the most widely used due to its simplicity and human readability. However, FASTA lacks the capability to represent chemically modified or non-natural residues, as well as structural annotations and mutations in protein variants. To address some of these limitations, the PEFF format was recently introduced as an extension of FASTA. Additionally, formats such as HELM and BILN have been proposed to represent amino acids and their modifications at the atomic level. Despite their advancements, these formats have not achieved widespread adoption within the bioinformatics community due to their complexity. To complement existing formats and overcome current challenges, we propose a new format called MAP (Modification and Annotation in Proteins), which enables comprehensive annotation of protein sequences. MAP introduces meta tags in the header for protein-level annotations and inline tags within the sequence for residue-level modifications. In this format, standard one-letter amino acid codes are augmented with curly-brace tags to denote various modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, non-natural residues, cyclization, and other residue-specific features. The header metadata also captures information such as organism, function, and sequence variants. We describe the structure, objectives, and capabilities of the MAP format and demonstrate its application in bioinformatics, particularly in the domain of protein therapeutics. To facilitate community adoption, we are developing a comprehensive suite of MAP-format resources, including a detailed manual, annotated datasets, and conversion tools, available at http://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/maprepo/.</description>

      <title>A review of DNA restriction-free overlapping sequence cloning techniques for synthetic biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA cloning methods are fundamental tools in molecular biology, synthetic biology, and genetic engineering that enable precise DNA manipulation for various scientific and biotechnological applications. This review systematically summarizes the major restriction-free overlapping sequence cloning (RFOSC) techniques currently used in synthetic biology and examines their development, efficiency, practicality, and specific applications. In vitro methods, including Gibson Assembly, Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning (CPEC), Polymerase Incomplete Primer Extension (PIPE), Overlap Extension Cloning (OEC), Flap Endonuclease Cloning (FEN-Cloning), and commercially available techniques such as TOPO and In-Fusion, have been discussed alongside hybrid approaches such as Ligation-Independent Cloning (LIC), Sequence-Independent Cloning (SLIC), and T5 Exonuclease-Dependent Assembly (TEDA). Additionally, in vivo methods leveraging host recombination machinery, including Yeast Homologous Recombination (YHR), In Vivo Assembly (IVA), Transformation-Associated Recombination (TAR), and innovative approaches such as Multiple-Round In Vivo Site-Specific Assembly (MISSA) and Phage Enzyme-Assisted Direct Assembly (PEDA), are critically evaluated. The review highlights that method selection should consider the scale, complexity, cost, and specific needs of individual research projects, noting that no single technique is universally optimal. Future trends suggest the increased integration of enzymatic efficiency, host versatility, and automation, broadening the accessibility and capabilities of DNA assembly technologies.</description>
