      <title>Geometrically constrained sine-Gordon field: BPS solitons and their collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an enlarged $(1+1)$-dimensional model with two real scalar fields, $\phi$ and $\chi$ whose scalar potential $V(\phi,\chi)$ has a standard $\chi^4$ sector and a sine-Gordon one for $\phi$. These fields are coupled through a generalizing function $f(\chi)$ that appears in the scalar potential and controls the nontrivial dynamics of $\phi$. We minimize the effective energy via the implementation of the BPS technique. We then obtain the Bogomol'nyi bound for the energy and the first-order equations whose solutions saturate that bound. We solve these equations for a nontrivial $f(\chi)$. As the result, BPS kinks with internal structures emerge. They exhibit a two-kink profile. i.e. an effect due to geometrical constrictions. We consider the linear stability of these new configurations. In this sense, we study the existence of internal modes that play an important role during the scattering process. We then investigate the kink-antikink collisions, and present the numerical results for the most interesting cases. We also comment about their most relevant features.</description>

      <title>Can vortex quantum droplets be realized experimentally?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current state of research on vortices carried by quantum droplets (QDs) has predicted their existence, in the stable form, in two- and three-dimensional free-space binary Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and dipolar BECs. These theoretical results suggest that QDs may be excellent carriers of self-trapped vortex states. Given that the experimental creation of QDs has already been firmly established, the observation of embedded vortices in them becomes a key question for the next phase of the development in the field.</description>

      <title>Chimera state in neural network with the Proportional-Integrative-Derivative coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study delves into the emergence of collective behaviors within a network comprising interacting cells. Each cell integrates a fixed number of neurons governed by an activation gradient based on Hopfield's model. The intra-cell interactions among neurons are local and directed, while inter-cell connections are facilitated through a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) coupling mechanism. This coupling introduces an adaptable environmental variable, influencing the network dynamics significantly. Numerical simulations employing three neurons per cell across a network of fifty cells reveal diverse dynamics, including incoherence, coherence, synchronization, chimera states, and traveling wave. These phenomena are quantitatively assessed using statistical measures such as the order parameter, strength of incoherence, and discontinuity measure. Variations of the resistive, inductive, or capacitive couplings of the inter-cell environment are explored and their effects are analysed. Furthermore, the study identifies multistability in network dynamics, characterized by the coexistence of multiple stable states for the same set of parameters but with different initial conditions. A linear augmentation strategy is employed for its control.</description>
