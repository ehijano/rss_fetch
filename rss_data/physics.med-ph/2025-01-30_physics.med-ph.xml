      <title>Fine-Tuning Open-Source Large Language Models to Improve Their Performance on Radiation Oncology Tasks: A Feasibility Study to Investigate Their Potential Clinical Applications in Radiation Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The radiation oncology clinical practice involves many steps relying on the dynamic interplay of abundant text data. Large language models have displayed remarkable capabilities in processing complex text information. But their direct applications in specific fields like radiation oncology remain underexplored.
  Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether fine-tuning LLMs with domain knowledge can improve the performance on Task (1) treatment regimen generation, Task (2) treatment modality selection (photon, proton, electron, or brachytherapy), and Task (3) ICD-10 code prediction in radiation oncology.
  Methods: Data for 15,724 patient cases were extracted. Cases where patients had a single diagnostic record, and a clearly identifiable primary treatment plan were selected for preprocessing and manual annotation to have 7,903 cases of the patient diagnosis, treatment plan, treatment modality, and ICD-10 code. Each case was used to construct a pair consisting of patient diagnostics details and an answer (treatment regimen, treatment modality, or ICD-10 code respectively) for the supervised fine-tuning of these three tasks. Open source LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B models were utilized for the fine-tuning with the Low-Rank Approximations method. Accuracy and ROUGE-1 score were reported for the fine-tuned models and original models. Clinical evaluation was performed on Task (1) by radiation oncologists, while precision, recall, and F-1 score were evaluated for Task (2) and (3). One-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to statistically analyze the results.
  Results: Fine-tuned LLMs outperformed original LLMs across all tasks with p-value &lt;= 0.001. Clinical evaluation demonstrated that over 60% of the fine-tuned LLMs-generated treatment regimens were clinically acceptable. Precision, recall, and F1-score showed improved performance of fine-tuned LLMs.</description>

      <title>LET measurements and simulation modelling of the charged particle field for the Clatterbridge ocular proton therapy beamline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton therapy can achieve a highly targeted treatment by utilising the advantageous dosimetric characteristics of the Bragg Peak. Protons traversing through a material will deposit their maximum energy at the Bragg Peak through ionisation and other interactions, transferring minimal excess dose to surrounding tissue and organs. This rate of energy loss is also quantified by the linear energy transfer (LET), which is indicative of radiation quality and radiobiological effects. However it is a challenging physical quantity to measure, as characterisation of radiation fields and the impact of LET on treatment requires advanced tools and technology. The MiniPIX-Timepix is a miniaturised, hybrid semiconductor pixel detector capable of high resolution spectrometric tracking, enabling wide-range detection of the deposited energy, position and direction of single particles. Experimental measurements were performed at a clinical facility, the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre which houses a 60 MeV ocular proton therapy beamline. A realistic end-to-end model of the facility was developed in the Monte Carlo code TOPAS (TOol for PArticle Simulation) and was used to simulate the experimental conditions. The detector was held at 45$^{\circ}$ and 60$^{\circ}$ perpendicular to the beam, and placed downstream of various thickness Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blocks to acquire data along the dose deposition depth. Empirical cluster data providing track length and the energy deposition distributions were used to obtain the LET spectra. The determined values for the LET in silicon and dose averaged LET across the BP show general agreement with simulated results, supporting the applicability of the TOPAS CCC model. This work explores the capability of the MiniPIX detector to measure physical quantities to resolve the LET, and discusses experimental considerations and further possibilities.</description>

      <title>Neutron relative effectiveness factors in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy: estimation of their values from the secondary charged particles and evaluation of weighted kerma factors for a standard tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The average Relative Biological effectiveness (RBE) factors for neutron irradiation in the context of a BNCT treatment are studied. This research considers the various interactions and secondary particles of each process and estimates the RBE based on the damage induced in tissues by all of these particles. A novel concept of estimating the biological dose by means of weighted kerma factors is introduced. These weighted kerma factors include the RBE of each energy deposition based on an RBE-LET relationship for secondary charged particles and can be directly incorporated in weighted dose calculations from Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the dependence of the neutron weighting factor on neutron energy for standard soft tissue is discussed.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy image-to-image translation: evaluating uncertainty calibration in unpaired training scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mammographic screening is an effective method for detecting breast cancer, facilitating early diagnosis. However, the current need to manually inspect images places a heavy burden on healthcare systems, spurring a desire for automated diagnostic protocols. Techniques based on deep neural networks have been shown effective in some studies, but their tendency to overfit leaves considerable risk for poor generalisation and misdiagnosis, preventing their widespread adoption in clinical settings. Data augmentation schemes based on unpaired neural style transfer models have been proposed that improve generalisability by diversifying the representations of training image features in the absence of paired training data (images of the same tissue in either image style). But these models are similarly prone to various pathologies, and evaluating their performance is challenging without ground truths/large datasets (as is often the case in medical imaging). Here, we consider two frameworks/architectures: a GAN-based cycleGAN, and the more recently developed diffusion-based SynDiff. We evaluate their performance when trained on image patches parsed from three open access mammography datasets and one non-medical image dataset. We consider the use of uncertainty quantification to assess model trustworthiness, and propose a scheme to evaluate calibration quality in unpaired training scenarios. This ultimately helps facilitate the trustworthy use of image-to-image translation models in domains where ground truths are not typically available.</description>

      <title>Mesh-Informed Reduced Order Models for Aneurysm Rupture Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complexity of the cardiovascular system needs to be accurately reproduced in order to promptly acknowledge health conditions; to this aim, advanced multifidelity and multiphysics numerical models are crucial. On one side, Full Order Models (FOMs) deliver accurate hemodynamic assessments, but their high computational demands hinder their real-time clinical application. In contrast, ROMs provide more efficient yet accurate solutions, essential for personalized healthcare and timely clinical decision-making. In this work, we explore the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in cardiovascular medicine by integrating FOMs with ROMs for predicting the risk of aortic aneurysm growth and rupture. Wall Shear Stress (WSS) and the Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), sampled at different growth stages of the thoracic aortic aneurysm, are predicted by means of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs exploit the natural graph structure of the mesh obtained by the Finite Volume (FV) discretization, taking into account the spatial local information, regardless of the dimension of the input graph. Our experimental validation framework yields promising results, confirming our method as a valid alternative that overcomes the curse of dimensionality.</description>
