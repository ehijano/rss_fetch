      <title>Near-field Target Localization: Effect of Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prior works on near-field target localization have mostly assumed ideal hardware models and thus suffer from two limitations in practice. First, extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) usually face a variety of hardware impairments (HIs) that may introduce unknown phase and/or amplitude errors. Second, the existing block coordinate descent (BCD)-based methods for joint estimation of the HI indicator, channel gain, angle, and range may induce considerable target localization error when the target is very close to the XL-array. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a new three-phase HI-aware near-field localization method, by efficiently detecting faulty antennas and estimating the positions of targets. Specifically, we first determine faulty antennas by using compressed sensing (CS) methods and improve detection accuracy based on coarse target localization. Then, a dedicated phase calibration method is designed to correct phase errors induced by detected faulty antennas. Subsequently, an efficient near-field localization method is devised to accurately estimate the positions of targets based on the full XL-array with phase calibration. Additionally, we resort to the misspecified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) to quantify the performance loss caused by HIs. Last, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces the localization errors as compared to various benchmark schemes, especially for the case with a short target range and/or a high fault probability.</description>

      <title>When the Base Station Flies: Rethinking Security for UAV-Based 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) into 6G systems is crucial for achieving seamless global coverage, particularly in underserved and disaster-prone regions. Among NTN platforms, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are especially promising due to their rapid deployability. However, this shift from fixed, wired base stations (BSs) to mobile, wireless, energy-constrained UAV-BSs introduces unique security challenges. Their central role in emergency communications makes them attractive candidates for emergency alert spoofing. Their limited computing and energy resources make them more vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and their dependence on wireless backhaul links and GNSS navigation exposes them to jamming, interception, and spoofing. Furthermore, UAV mobility opens new attack vectors such as malicious handover manipulation. This paper identifies several attack surfaces of UAV-BS systems and outlines principles for mitigating their threats.</description>

      <title>Pinching Antenna-aided NOMA Systems with Internal Eavesdropping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a novel member of flexible antennas, the pinching antenna (PA) is realized by integrating small dielectric particles on a waveguide, offering unique regulatory capabilities on constructing line-of-sight (LoS) links and enhancing transceiver channels, reducing path loss and signal blockage. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has become a potential technology of next-generation communications due to its remarkable advantages in spectrum efficiency and user access capability. The integration of PA and NOMA enables synergistic leveraging of PA's channel regulation capability and NOMA's multi-user multiplexing advantage, forming a complementary technical framework to deliver high-performance communication solutions. However, the use of successive interference cancellation (SIC) introduces significant security risks to power-domain NOMA systems when internal eavesdropping is present. To this end, this paper investigates the physical layer security of a PA-aided NOMA system where a nearby user is considered as an internal eavesdropper. We enhance the security of the NOMA system through optimizing the radiated power of PAs and analyze the secrecy performance by deriving the closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP). Furthermore, we extend the characterization of PA flexibility beyond deployment and scale adjustment to include flexible regulation of PA coupling length. Based on two conventional PA power models, i.e., the equal power model and the proportional power model, we propose a flexible power strategy to achieve secure transmission. The results highlight the potential of the PA-aided NOMA system in mitigating internal eavesdropping risks, and provide an effective strategy for optimizing power allocation and cell range of user activity.</description>

      <title>Integrating Low-Altitude SAR Imaging into UAV Data Backhaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) deployed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is expected to provide burgeoning imaging services for low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), thereby enabling large-scale environmental sensing and timely situational awareness. Conventional SAR systems typically leverages a deterministic radar waveform, while it conflicts with the integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) paradigm by discarding signaling randomness, in whole or in part. In fact, this approach reduces to the uplink pilot sensing in 5G New Radio (NR) with sounding reference signals (SRS), underutilizing data symbols. To explore the potential of data-aided imaging, we develop a low-altitude SAR imaging framework that sufficiently leverages data symbols carried by the native orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication waveform. The randomness of modulated data in the temporal-frequency (TF) domain, introduced by non-constant modulus constellations such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), may however severely degrade the imaging quality. To mitigate this effect, we incorporate several TF-domain filtering schemes within a rangeDoppler (RD) imaging framework and evaluate their impact. We further propose using the normalized mean square error (NMSE) of a reference point target's profile as an imaging performance metric. Simulation results with 5G NR parameters demonstrate that data-aided imaging substantially outperforms pilot-only counterpart, accordingly validating the effectiveness of the proposed OFDM-SAR imaging approach in LAWNs.</description>

      <title>A Light Weight Neural Network for Automatic Modulation Classification in OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a vital component in the development of intelligent and adaptive transceivers for future wireless communication systems. Existing statistically-based blind modulation classification methods for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) often fail to achieve the required accuracy and performance. Consequently, the modulation classification research community has shifted its focus toward deep learning techniques, which demonstrate promising performance, but come with increased computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight subcarrier-based modulation classification method for OFDM systems. In the proposed approach, a selected set of subcarriers in an OFDM frame is classified first, followed by the prediction of the modulation types for the remaining subcarriers based on the initial results. A Lightweight Neural Network (LWNN) is employed to identify the initially selected set of subcarriers, and its output is fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as an embedded vector to predict the modulation schemes of the remaining subcarriers in the OFDM frame.</description>

      <title>Phase-Coherent D-MIMO ISAC: Multi-Target Estimation and Spectral Efficiency Trade-Offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, in which multiple phase-synchronized access points (APs) jointly serve user equipments (UEs) while cooperatively detecting and estimating multiple static targets. To achieve high-accuracy multi-target estimation, we propose a two-stage sensing framework combining non-coherent and coherent maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation. In parallel, adaptive AP mode-selection strategies are introduced to balance communication and sensing performance: a communication-centric scheme that maximizes downlink spectral efficiency (SE) and a sensing-centric scheme that selects geometrically diverse receive APs to enhance sensing coverage. Simulation results confirm the SE-sensing trade-off, where appropriate power allocation between communication and sensing and larger array apertures alleviate performance degradation, achieving high SE with millimeter-level sensing precision. We further demonstrate that the proposed AP-selection strategy reveals an optimal number of receive APs that maximizes sensing coverage without significantly sacrificing SE.</description>

      <title>Multi-Satellite Multi-Stream Beamspace Massive MIMO Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies multi-satellite multi-stream (MSMS) beamspace transmission, where multiple satellites cooperate to form a distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system and jointly deliver multiple data streams to multi-antenna user terminals (UTs), and beamspace transmission combines earth-moving beamforming with beam-domain precoding. For the first time, we formulate the signal model for MSMS beamspace MIMO transmission. Under synchronization errors, multi-antenna UTs enable the distributed MIMO channel to exhibit higher rank, supporting multiple data streams. Beamspace MIMO retains conventional codebook based beamforming while providing the performance gains of precoding. Based on the signal model, we propose statistical channel state information (sCSI)-based optimization of satellite clustering, beam selection, and transmit precoding, using a sum-rate upper-bound approximation. With given satellite clustering and beam selection, we cast precoder design as an equivalent covariance decomposition-based weighted minimum mean square error (CDWMMSE) problem. To obtain tractable algorithms, we develop a closed-form covariance decomposition required by CDWMMSE and derive an iterative MSMS beam-domain precoder under sCSI. Following this, we further propose several heuristic closed-form precoders to avoid iterative cost. For satellite clustering, we enhance a competition-based algorithm by introducing a mechanism to regulate the number of satellites serving certain UT. Furthermore, we design a two-stage low-complexity beam selection algorithm focused on enhancing the effective channel power. Simulations under practical configurations validate the proposed methods across the number of data streams, receive antennas, serving satellites, and active beams, and show that beamspace transmission approaches conventional MIMO performance at lower complexity.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning for Joint Resource Allocation in Multi-Active RIS-Aided Uplink Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are a promising technology for 6G wireless networks. This paper investigates a novel hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for resource allocation in a multi-user uplink system assisted by multiple active RISs. The objective is to maximize the minimum user rate by jointly optimizing user transmit powers, active RIS configurations, and base station (BS) beamforming. We derive a closed-form solution for optimal beamforming and employ DRL algorithms: Soft actor-critic (SAC), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and twin delayed DDPG (TD3) to solve the high-dimensional, non-convex power and RIS optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that SAC achieves superior performance with high learning rate leading to faster convergence and lower computational cost compared to DDPG and TD3. Furthermore, the closed-form of optimally beamforming enhances the minimum rate effectively.</description>

      <title>Learning to Reconfigure: Using Device Status to Select the Right Constrained Coding Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the age of data revolution, a modern storage~or transmission system typically requires different levels of protection. For example, the coding technique used to fortify data in a modern storage system when the device is fresh cannot be the same as that used when the device ages. Therefore, providing reconfigurable coding schemes and devising an effective way to perform this reconfiguration are key to extending the device lifetime. We focus on constrained coding schemes for the emerging two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) technology. Recently, we have designed efficient lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) coding schemes for various stages of the TDMR device lifetime, focusing on the elimination of isolation patterns, and demonstrated remarkable gains by using them. LOCO codes are naturally reconfigurable, and we exploit this feature in our work. Reconfiguration based on predetermined time stamps, which is what the industry adopts, neglects the actual device status. Instead, we propose offline and online learning methods to perform this task based on the device status. In offline learning, training data is assumed to be available throughout the time span of interest, while in online learning, we only use training data at specific time intervals to make consequential decisions. We fit the training data to polynomial equations that give the bit error rate in terms of TD density, then design an optimization problem in order to reach the optimal reconfiguration decisions to switch from a coding scheme to another. The objective is to maximize the storage capacity and/or minimize the decoding complexity. The problem reduces to a linear programming problem. We show that our solution is the global optimal based on problem characteristics, and we offer various experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in TDMR systems.</description>

      <title>When Bayesian Tensor Completion Meets Multioutput Gaussian Processes: Functional Universality and Rank Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional tensor decomposition can analyze multi-dimensional data with real-valued indices, paving the path for applications in machine learning and signal processing. A limitation of existing approaches is the assumption that the tensor rank-a critical parameter governing model complexity-is known. However, determining the optimal rank is a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) task and there is a limited understanding regarding the expressive power of functional low-rank tensor models for continuous signals. We propose a rank-revealing functional Bayesian tensor completion (RR-FBTC) method. Modeling the latent functions through carefully designed multioutput Gaussian processes, RR-FBTC handles tensors with real-valued indices while enabling automatic tensor rank determination during the inference process. We establish the universal approximation property of the model for continuous multi-dimensional signals, demonstrating its expressive power in a concise format. To learn this model, we employ the variational inference framework and derive an efficient algorithm with closed-form updates. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the RR-FBTC over state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/OceanSTARLab/RR-FBTC.</description>

      <title>RefineBridge: Generative Bridge Models Improve Financial Forecasting by Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is particularly challenging for transformer-based time series foundation models (TSFMs) due to non-stationarity, heavy-tailed distributions, and high-frequency noise present in data. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient method for adapting pre-trained TSFMs to downstream data domains. However, it still underperforms in financial data, as it preserves the network architecture and training objective of TSFMs rather than complementing the foundation model. To further enhance TSFMs, we propose a novel refinement module, RefineBridge, built upon a tractable Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) generative framework. Given the forecasts of TSFM as generative prior and the observed ground truths as targets, RefineBridge learns context-conditioned stochastic transport maps to improve TSFM predictions, iteratively approaching the ground-truth target from even a low-quality prior. Simulations on multiple financial benchmarks demonstrate that RefineBridge consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art TSFMs across different prediction horizons.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Communication with Massive Movable Antennas: An Electrostatic Equilibrium Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale position-reconfigurable antennas have opened up new dimensions to effectively utilize the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) of wireless channels. However, the deployment of existing antenna placement schemes is primarily hindered by their limited scalability and frequently overlooked near-field effects in large-scale antenna systems. In this paper, we propose a novel antenna placement approach tailored for near-field massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, which effectively exploits the spatial DoFs to enhance spectral efficiency. For that purpose, we first reformulate the antenna placement problem in the angular domain, resulting in a weighted Fekete problem. We then derive the optimality condition and reveal that the {optimal} antenna placement is in principle an electrostatic equilibrium problem. To further reduce the computational complexity of numerical optimization, we propose an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based framework to efficiently solve the equilibrium problem. In particular, the optimal antenna positions are characterized by the roots of the polynomial solutions to specific ODEs in the normalized angular domain. By simply adopting a two-step eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) approach, the optimal antenna positions can be efficiently obtained. Furthermore, we perform an asymptotic analysis when the antenna size tends to infinity, which yields a closed-form solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently harnesses the spatial DoFs of near-field channels with prominent gains in spectral efficiency and maintains robustness against system parameter mismatches. In addition, the derived asymptotic closed-form {solution} closely approaches the theoretical optimum across a wide range of practical scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Directly modulated lasers (DMLs) are an attractive technology for short-reach intensity modulation and direct detection communication systems. However, their complex nonlinear dynamics make the modeling and optimization of DML-based systems challenging. In this paper, we study the end-to-end optimization of DML-based systems based on a data-driven surrogate model trained on experimental data. The end-to-end optimization includes the pulse shaping and equalizer filters, the bias current and the modulation radio-frequency (RF) power applied to the laser. The performance of the end-to-end optimization scheme is tested on the experimental setup and compared to 4 different benchmark schemes based on linear and nonlinear receiver-side equalization. The results show that the proposed end-to-end scheme is able to deliver better performance throughout the studied symbol rates and transmission distances while employing lower modulation RF power, fewer filter taps and utilizing a smaller signal bandwidth.</description>

Abstract: The widespread use of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) has propelled the development of advanced techniques on countering unauthorized UAV flights. However, the resistance of legal UAVs to illegal interference remains under-addressed. This paper proposes radiation pattern reconfigurable fluid antenna systems (RPR-FAS)-empowered interference-resilient UAV communication scheme. This scheme integrates the reconfigurable pixel antenna technology, which provides each antenna with an adjustable radiation pattern. Therefore, RPR-FAS can enhance the angular resolution of a UAV with a limited number of antennas, thereby improving spectral efficiency (SE) and interference resilience. Specifically, we first design dedicated radiation pattern adapted from 3GPP-TR-38.901, where the beam direction and half power beamwidth are tailored for UAV communications. Furthermore, we propose a low-storage-overhead orthogonal matching pursuit multiple measurement vectors algorithm, which accurately estimates the angle-of-arrival (AoA) of the communication link, even in the single antenna case. Particularly, by utilizing the Fourier transform to the radiation pattern gain matrix, we design a dimension-reduction technique to achieve 1--2 order-of-magnitude reduction in storage requirements. Meanwhile, we propose a maximum likelihood interference AoA estimation method based on the law of large numbers, so that the SE can be further improved. Finally, alternating optimization is employed to obtain the optimal uplink radiation pattern and combiner, while an exhaustive search is applied to determine the optimal downlink pattern, complemented by the water-filling algorithm for beamforming. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes outperform traditional methods in terms of angular sensing precision and spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced Real-Time Wi-Fi Sensing Through Single Transceiver Pair</title>

Abstract: The advancement of next-generation Wi-Fi technology heavily relies on sensing capabilities, which play a pivotal role in enabling sophisticated applications. In response to the growing demand for large-scale deployments, contemporary Wi-Fi sensing systems strive to achieve high-precision perception while maintaining minimal bandwidth consumption and antenna count requirements. Remarkably, various AI-driven perception technologies have demonstrated the ability to surpass the traditional resolution limitations imposed by radar theory. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon have not been thoroughly investigated in existing research. In this study, we found that under hardware-constrained conditions, the performance gains brought by AI to Wi-Fi sensing systems primarily originate from two aspects: prior information and temporal correlation. Prior information enables the AI to generate plausible details based on vague input, while temporal correlation helps reduce the upper bound of sensing error. Building on these insights, we developed a real-time, AI-based Wi-Fi sensing and visualization system using a single transceiver pair, and designed experiments focusing on human pose estimation and indoor localization. The system operates in real time on commodity hardware, and experimental results confirm our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Streamable Generative Speech Restoration with Flow Matching</title>

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have greatly impacted the speech processing field in recent years, exhibiting high speech naturalness and spawning a new research direction. Their application in real-time communication is, however, still lagging behind due to their computation-heavy nature involving multiple calls of large DNNs.
  Here, we present Stream$.$FM, a frame-causal flow-based generative model with an algorithmic latency of 32 milliseconds (ms) and a total latency of 48 ms, paving the way for generative speech processing in real-time communication. We propose a buffered streaming inference scheme and an optimized DNN architecture, show how learned few-step numerical solvers can boost output quality at a fixed compute budget, explore model weight compression to find favorable points along a compute/quality tradeoff, and contribute a model variant with 24 ms total latency for the speech enhancement task.
  Our work looks beyond theoretical latencies, showing that high-quality streaming generative speech processing can be realized on consumer GPUs available today. Stream$.$FM can solve a variety of speech processing tasks in a streaming fashion: speech enhancement, dereverberation, codec post-filtering, bandwidth extension, STFT phase retrieval, and Mel vocoding. As we verify through comprehensive evaluations and a MUSHRA listening test, Stream$.$FM establishes a state-of-the-art for generative streaming speech restoration, exhibits only a reasonable reduction in quality compared to a non-streaming variant, and outperforms our recent work (Diffusion Buffer) on generative streaming speech enhancement while operating at a lower latency.</description>

      <title>Transforming Indoor Localization: Advanced Transformer Architecture for NLOS Dominated Wireless Environments with Distributed Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indoor localization in challenging non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments often leads to poor accuracy with traditional approaches. Deep learning (DL) has been applied to tackle these challenges; however, many DL approaches overlook computational complexity, especially for floating-point operations (FLOPs), making them unsuitable for resource-limited devices. Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks, motivating their use in wireless applications. However, their use in indoor localization remains nascent, and directly applying Transformers for indoor localization can be both computationally intensive and exhibit limitations in accuracy. To address these challenges, in this work, we introduce a novel tokenization approach, referred to as Sensor Snapshot Tokenization (SST), which preserves variable-specific representations of power delay profile (PDP) and enhances attention mechanisms by effectively capturing multi-variate correlation. Complementing this, we propose a lightweight Swish-Gated Linear Unit-based Transformer (L-SwiGLU-T) model, designed to reduce computational complexity without compromising localization accuracy. Together, these contributions mitigate the computational burden and dependency on large datasets, making Transformer models more efficient and suitable for resource-constrained scenarios. Experimental results on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that SST and L-SwiGLU-T achieve substantial accuracy and efficiency gains, outperforming larger Transformer and CNN baselines by over 40% while using significantly fewer FLOPs and training samples.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Framework for Receiver Quantization in Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate information-theoretic limits and design of communication under receiver quantization. Unlike most existing studies, this work is more focused on the impact of resolution reduction from high to low. We consider a standard transceiver architecture, which includes i.i.d. complex Gaussian codebook at the transmitter, and a symmetric quantizer cascaded with a nearest neighbor decoder at the receiver. Employing the generalized mutual information (GMI), an achievable rate under general quantization rules is obtained in an analytical form, which shows that the rate loss due to quantization is $\log\left(1+\gamma\mathsf{SNR}\right)$, where $\gamma$ is determined by thresholds and levels of the quantizer. Based on this result, the performance under uniform receiver quantization is analyzed comprehensively. We show that the front-end gain control, which determines the loading factor of quantization, has an increasing impact on performance as the resolution decreases. In particular, we prove that the unique loading factor that minimizes the MSE also maximizes the GMI, and the corresponding irreducible rate loss is given by $\log\left(1+\mathsf {mmse}\cdot\mathsf{SNR}\right)$, where mmse is the minimum MSE normalized by the variance of quantizer input, and is equal to the minimum of $\gamma$. A geometrical interpretation for the optimal uniform quantization at the receiver is further established. Moreover, by asymptotic analysis, we characterize the impact of biased gain control, showing how small rate losses decay to zero and providing rate approximations under large bias. From asymptotic expressions of the optimal loading factor and mmse, approximations and several per-bit rules for performance are also provided. Finally we discuss more types of receiver quantization and show that the consistency between achievable rate maximization and MSE minimization does not hold in general.</description>
