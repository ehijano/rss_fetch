      <title>Resolving Discrepancies in Wood Micromechanics: Strain-Mapped Compression of Tracheid Wall Micropillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wood's increasing role as a structural resource in sustainable materials selection demands accurate characterization of its mechanical behavior. Its performance arises from a hierarchical structure, where the dominant load-bearing component is the S2 layer of tracheid cell walls-a thick, fiber-reinforced composite of cellulose microfibrils embedded in hemicelluloses and lignin. Due to the small dimensions and anisotropic nature of the S2 layer, mechanical testing presents significant challenges, particularly in producing homogeneous stress and strain fields. In this study, we apply micropillar compression (MPC) combined with digital image correlation (DIC) to Norway spruce tracheids, enabling direct and model-free strain measurements at the cell wall scale. Micropillars were oriented at different microfibril angles (MFAs), confirming the expected dependence of stiffness and yield stress on ultrastructural alignment, with higher stiffness and yield stress at low MFAs. For these under compression fibril-aligned kink bands occurred, while shear related failure was observed at higher angles. A parameter study on the acceleration voltage of the Scanning Electron Microscope revealed that electron beam exposure significantly degrades pillar integrity, which could explain data scatter and mechanical underestimation in earlier MPC studies. By controlling imaging protocols and using DIC-based strain measurements, we report the highest direct measurements of wood cell wall stiffness to date-up to 42 GPa for MFA=0{\deg}-closer matching micromechanical model predictions compared to previous results. Findings are compared with Finite Element Method-based displacement corrections to establish a robust protocol for probing soft, anisotropic biological composites' mechanical behavior while clarifying longstanding inconsistencies in reported results of wood MPC measurements.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Constrained Noise Yields Superdiffusive Dynamics in Axonal Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a coarse-grained stochastic model for axonal extension on periodic arrays of parallel micropatterns that integrates three key biophysical mechanisms: (i) the molecular clutch that couples actin retrograde flow to substrate adhesions, (ii) an active biopolymer-based mechanism generating traction-force fluctuations, and (iii) the mechanical interaction of the growth cone with the micropatterned substrate. Using the Shannon-Jaynes maximum entropy principle with constraints derived from experimental observations, we derive a unique probability distribution for the colored acceleration noise that enters the Langevin equation. The resulting stationary process exhibits power-law temporal correlations with negative exponent, which accounts for the observed superdiffusive dynamics of axons. For biologically relevant parameters the model predicts this exponent to be -1/2, in close quantitative agreement with measurements of cortical neurons cultured on patterned substrates.</description>

      <title>Recent advances in DNA origami-engineered nanomaterials and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA nanotechnology is a unique field, where physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, engineering, and materials science can elegantly converge. Since the original proposal of Nadrian Seeman, significant advances have been achieved in the past four decades. During this glory time, the DNA origami technique developed by Paul Rothemund further pushed the field forward with a vigorous momentum, fostering a plethora of concepts, models, methodologies, and applications that were not thought of before. This review focuses on the recent progress in DNA origami-engineered nanomaterials in the past five years, outlining the exciting achievements as well as the unexplored research avenues. We believe that the spirits and asset that Seeman left for scientists will continue to bring inter-disciplinary innovations and useful applications to this field in the next decade.</description>

      <title>Modulating lipid membrane morphology by dynamic DNA origami networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membrane morphology and its dynamic adaptation regulate many cellular functions, which are often mediated by membrane proteins. Advances in DNA nanotechnology have enabled the realization of various protein-inspired structures and functions with precise control at the nanometer level, suggesting a viable tool to artificially engineer the membrane morphology. In this work, we demonstrate a DNA origami cross (DOC) structure that can be anchored onto giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and subsequently polymerized into micron-scale reconfigurable one-dimensional (1D) chains or two-dimensional (2D) lattices. Such DNA origami-based networks can be switched between left-handed (LH) and right-handed (RH) conformations by DNA fuels and exhibit potent efficacy in remodeling the membrane curvatures of GUVs. This work sheds light on designing hierarchically-assembled dynamic DNA systems for the programmable modulation of synthetic cells for useful applications.</description>

      <title>Transformable Plasmonic Helix with Swinging Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control over multiple optical elements that can be dynamically rearranged to yield substantial three-dimensional structural transformations is of great importance to realize reconfigurable plasmonic nanoarchitectures with sensitive and distinct optical feedback. In this work, we demonstrate a transformable plasmonic helix system, in which multiple gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be directly transported by DNA swingarms to target positions without undergoing consecutive stepwise movements. The swingarms allow for programmable AuNP translocations in large leaps within plasmonic nanoarchitectures, giving rise to tailored circular dichroism spectra. Our work provides an instructive bottom-up solution to building complex dynamic plasmonic systems, which can exhibit prominent optical responses through cooperative rearrangements of the constituent optical elements with high fidelity and programmability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The framework of bipartite stochastic thermodynamics is a powerful tool to analyze a composite system's internal thermodynamics. It has been used to study the components of different molecular machines such as ATP synthase. However, this approach has not yet been used to describe ion-transporting proteins despite their high-level functional similarity. Here we study the bipartite thermodynamics of the sodium-potassium pump in the nonequilibrium steady state. Using a physically intuitive partition between the ATP-consuming subsystem and the ion-transporting subsystem, we find considerable information flow comparable to other molecular machines, and Maxwell-demon behavior in the ATP-consuming subsystem. We vary ion concentrations and transmembrane voltage in a range including the neuronal action potential, and find that the information flow inverts during depolarization.</description>

      <title>Metallization of leaf-derived lignocellulose scaffolds for high performance flexible electronics and oligodynamic disinfection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vascular tubules in natural leaves form quasi-fractal networks that can be metallized. Traditional metallization techniques for these lignocellulose structures are complex, involving metal sputtering, nanoparticle solutions, or multiple chemical pretreatments. Here we present a novel, facile, and reliable method for metallizing leaf-derived lignocellulose scaffolds using silver microparticles. The method achieves properties on-par with the state-of-the-art, such as broadband optical transmittance of over 80%, sheet resistances below 1 Ohm/sq., and a current-carrying capacity exceeding 6 A over a 2.5 x 2.5 cm^2 quasi-fractal electrode. We also demonstrate copper electrodeposition as a cost-effective approach towards fabricating such conductive, biomimetic quasi-fractals. Additionally, we show that these metallized structures can effectively eliminate pathogenic microorganisms like fecal coliforms and E. coli, which are bacterial indicators of microbiological contamination of water. We finally show that these oligodynamic properties can be significantly enhanced with a small externally applied voltage, indicating the noteworthy potential of such structures for water purification and pollution control.</description>

      <title>Modelling Mosquito Population Dynamics using PINN-derived Empirical Parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector-borne diseases continue to pose a significant health threat globally with more than 3 billion people at risk each year. Despite some limitations, mechanistic dynamic models are a popular approach to representing biological processes using ordinary differential equations where the parameters describe the different development and survival rates. Recent advances in population modelling have seen the combination of these mechanistic models with machine learning. One approach is physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) whereby the machine learning framework embeds physical, biological, or chemical laws into neural networks trained on observed or measured data. This enables forward simulations, predicting system behaviour from given parameters and inputs, and inverse modelling, improving parameterisation of existing parameters and estimating unknown or latent variables. In this paper, we focus on improving the parameterisation of biological processes in mechanistic models using PINNs to determine inverse parameters. In comparing mechanistic and PINN models, our experiments offer important insights into the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches but demonstrated that the PINN approach generally outperforms the dynamic model. For a deeper understanding of the performance of PINN models, a final validation was used to investigate how modifications to PINN architectures affect the performance of the framework. By varying only a single component at a time and keeping all other factors constant, we are able to observe the effect of each change.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Abiogenesis: Thermodynamic Selection and the Emergence of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17975v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of life is often approached through the lens of replication, heredity, or molecular specificity. This paper proposes a thermodynamic framework in which the emergence of life is driven by the persistence of reaction pathways that align energetically with fluctuating environmental inputs. We define a reaction viability inequality based on energy input, return, resilience, and expenditure, which selects for persistent chemical configurations without invoking heredity or genetic encoding.
  We further incorporate entropic dynamics and spatial constraints into an augmented persistence function, showing that systems far from equilibrium can simultaneously increase global entropy while supporting localized chemical order. These refinements lead to the development of the Thermodynamic Abiogenesis Likelihood Model (TALM), a probabilistic extension that estimates the likelihood of persistence-driven selection under various prebiotic and planetary scenarios.
  This framework redefines the conditions under which life-like organization may emerge and provides a testable, general theory for abiogenesis grounded in physical law.</description>

      <title>Tensor formalism for predicting synaptic connections with ensemble modeling or optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical neuroscientists often try to understand how the structure of a neural network relates to its function by focusing on structural features that would either follow from optimization or occur consistently across possible implementations. Both optimization theories and ensemble modeling approaches have repeatedly proven their worth, and it would simplify theory building considerably if predictions from both theory types could be derived and tested simultaneously. Here we show how tensor formalism from theoretical physics can be used to unify and solve many optimization and ensemble modeling approaches to predicting synaptic connectivity from neuronal responses. We specifically focus on analyzing the solution space of synaptic weights that allow a threshold-linear neural network to respond in a prescribed way to a limited number of input conditions. For optimization purposes, we compute the synaptic weight vector that minimizes an arbitrary quadratic loss function. For ensemble modeling, we identify synaptic weight features that occur consistently across all solutions bounded by an arbitrary ellipsoid. We derive a common solution to this suite of nonlinear problems by showing how each of them reduces to an equivalent linear problem that can be solved analytically. Although identifying the equivalent linear problem is nontrivial, our tensor formalism provides an elegant geometrical perspective that allows us to solve the problem approximately in an analytical way or exactly using numeric methods. The final algorithm is applicable to a wide range of interesting neuroscience problems, and the associated geometric insights may carry over to other scientific problems that require constrained optimization. We conclude by applying and testing our ensemble modeling framework to whole-brain recordings of larval zebrafish performing optomotor and optokinetic responses.</description>

      <title>Existence of three distinct scaling regimes in self-propelled rigid pitching airfoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of imposed kinematics on the self-propulsion of the NACA0015 symmetric airfoil section subject to sinusoidal pitching. We employ a rotary apparatus capable of achieving self-propulsion. A power-spring-based crank-rocker mechanism actuates the airfoil. Three distinct scaling relations emerge, which relate the self-propulsion Reynolds number $Re_s$ to the frequency Reynolds number $Re_f$, the amplitude of pitching $\theta_0$, and the location of the pitching point, $p$. When pitched near the center, a \textit{linear} scaling emerges with $Re_s \sim Re_f \theta_0$. When pitched near the leading edge, a \textit{power} scaling emerges with $Re_s \sim (1-2p)(Re_f \theta_0)^{3/2}$ for low amplitude pitching and a \textit{separable} scaling emerges with $Re_s \sim (1-2p)^{1/2}Re_f\theta_0^{1/2}$ for moderate to high amplitude pitching. These relations are consistent with the scaling relations derived from balancing inviscid thrust with viscous drag, pressure drag, and enhanced pressure drag for the \textit{power}, \textit{separable}, and \textit{linear} regimes, respectively. We find that different vortical patterns in the wake are directly correlated to the airfoil's self-propulsion speed which essentially determines the spatial separation between the shed vortices. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the self-propulsion of rigid pitching airfoils across a wide range of parameters validated experimentally.</description>

      <title>Censor-Aware Semi-Supervised Survival Time Prediction in Lung Cancer Using Clinical and Radiomics Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01661v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objectives: Lung cancer poses a significant global health challenge, necessitating improved prognostic methods for personalized treatment. This study introduces a censor-aware semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework that integrates clinical and imaging data, addressing biases in traditional models handling censored data. Methods: We analyzed clinical, PET and CT data from 199 lung cancer patients from public and local data respositories, focusing on overall survival (OS) time as the primary outcome. Handcrafted (HRF) and Deep Radiomics features (DRF) were extracted after preprocessing using ViSERA software and were combined with clinical features (CF). Feature dimensions were optimized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), followed by the application of supervised learning (SL) and SSL. SSL incorporated pseudo-labeling of censored data to improve performance. Seven regressors and three hazard ratio survival analysis (HRSA) algorithms were optimized using five-fold cross-validation, grid search and external test bootstrapping. Results: For PET HRFs, SSL reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) by 26.5%, achieving 1.55 years with PCA+decision tree regression, compared to SL's 2.11 years with PCA+KNNR (p&lt;0.05). Combining HRFs (CT_HRF) and DRFs from CT images using SSL+PCA+KNNR achieved an MAE of 2.08 years, outperforming SL's 2.26 years by 7.96% (p&lt;0.05). In HRSA, CT_HRF applied to PCA+Component Wise Gradient Boosting Survival Analysis achieved an external c-index of 0.65, effectively differentiating high- and low-risk groups. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the SSL strategy significantly outperforms SL across PET, CT, and CF. As such, censor-aware SSL applied to HRFs from PET images significantly improved survival prediction performance by 26.5% compared to the SL approach.</description>

      <title>Stochastic elastohydrodynamics of contact and coarsening during membrane adhesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contact between fluctuating, fluid-lubricated soft surfaces is prevalent in engineering and biological systems, a process starting with adhesive contact, which can give rise to complex coarsening dynamics. One representation of such a system, which is relevant to biological membrane adhesion, is a fluctuating elastic interface covered by adhesive molecules that bind and unbind to a solid substrate across a narrow gap filled with a viscous fluid. This flow is described by the stochastic elastohydrodynamics thin-film equation, which combines the effects of viscous nanometric thin film flow, elastic membrane properties, adhesive springs, and thermal fluctuations. The average time it takes the fluctuating elastic membrane to adhere is predicted by the rare event theory, increasing exponentially with the square of the initial gap height. Numerical simulations reveal a phase separation of membrane domains driven by the binding and unbinding of adhesive molecules. The coarsening process displays close similarities to classical Ostwald ripening; however, the inclusion of hydrodynamics affects power-law growth. In particular, we identify a new bending-dominated coarsening regime, which is slower than the well-known tension-dominated case.</description>
