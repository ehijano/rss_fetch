      <title>Mutual entropy and thermal area law in C*-algebraic quantum lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general definition of quantum mutual entropy for infinitely extended quantum spin and fermion lattice systems. Using this, we establish a thermal area law in these infinitely extended quantum systems. The proof is based on the local thermodynamical stability (LTS), a variational principle in terms of the conditional free energy. Our thermal area law in quasi-local C*-systems applies to general interactions with well-defined surface energies. We also examine the quantum mutual entropy between the left- and right-sided infinite regions of one-dimensional lattice systems. For general translation-invariant finite-range interactions on such systems, the thermal equilibrium state at any temperature exhibits a finite mutual entropy between these infinite disjoint regions. This further implies that the infinitely large quantum entanglement characteristic of critical ground states in one-dimensional systems is drastically destroyed by even a small positive temperature.</description>

      <title>Analog and Symbolic Computation through the Koopman Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Koopman operator framework for studying the {computational properties} of dynamical systems. Specifically, we show that the resolvent of the Koopman operator provides a natural abstraction of halting, yielding a ``Koopman halting problem that is recursively enumerable in general. For symbolic systems, such as those defined on Cantor space, this operator formulation captures the reachability between clopen sets, while for equicontinuous systems we prove that the Koopman halting problem is decidable. Our framework demonstrates that absorbing (halting) states {in finite automata} correspond to Koopman eigenfunctions with eigenvalue one, while cycles in the transition graph impose algebraic constraints on spectral properties. These results provide a unifying perspective on computation in symbolic and analog systems, showing how computational universality is reflected in operator spectra, invariant subspaces, and algebraic structures. Beyond symbolic dynamics, this operator-theoretic lens opens pathways to analyze {computational power of} a broader class of dynamical systems, including polynomial and analog models, and suggests that computational hardness may admit dynamical signatures in terms of Koopman spectral structure.</description>

      <title>Simplification of nonlinear equations for a field operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study different properties of the motion equations of interacting fields. In the second section, we prove that "Wightman's" fields (we use only a subset of Wightman's axioms) are unitarily equivalent to some operators on the vector space ${\cal F}$ (with one mathematical assumption). In the third section, we introduce $L^{\infty}$ and $DL$ Hilbert spaces, which are convenient for analyzing field equations, particularly the equations for $\phi^3$ theory. Remarkably, we have managed to reduce the equation of motion for $\phi^3$ to a quadratic matrix equation with matrices over a separable Hilbert space in the fourth section. Also, in the appendix, we have done the same for QCD. Furthermore, we prove the existence of solution to the motion equations of one toy model non-renormalizable theory in the fifth section.</description>

      <title>Self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with transversal Clifford gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Analysis for a Class of Stochastic Copolymerization Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a stochastic model of a copolymerization process that has been extensively investigated in the physics literature. The main questions of interest include: (i) what are the criteria for transience, null recurrence, and positive recurrence in terms of the system parameters; (ii) in the transient regime, what are the limiting fractions of the different monomer types; and (iii) in the transient regime, what is the speed of growth of the polymer? Previous studies in the physics literature have addressed these questions using heuristic methods. Here, we utilize rigorous mathematical arguments to derive the results from the physics literature. Moreover, the techniques developed allow us to generalize to the copolymerization process with finitely many monomer types. We expect that the mathematical methods used and developed in this work will also enable the study of even more complex models in the future.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry for singular double cover Calabi--Yau varieties: quantum test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our study on the pairs of singular Calabi--Yau varieties arising from double covers over semi-Fano toric manifolds. In this paper, we first investigate singular CY double covers of \(\mathbb{P}^{3}\) branched along (1) a union of eight hyperplanes in general position, and (2) a union of four hyperplanes and a quartic in generation. Our previous construction produces hypothetical singular mirror partners. We prove that they are mirror pairs in the sense that the \(B\)-model of one (variation of Hodge structure) is equivalent to the \(A\)-model of another (the untwisted part of the genus zero orbifold Gromov--Witten invariants). The technique can be generalized and applied to the case when the nef-partition is trivial. As a byproduct, we also verify Morrison's conjecture in certain circumstances.</description>

      <title>Relevant Deformations, Brane Brick Models and Triality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the study of relevant deformations connecting 2d (0,2) gauge theories on D1-branes probing toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds beyond pure mass deformations. The underlying geometry provides powerful insights when field-theoretic tools are still lacking. We observe that the volume of the Sasaki-Einstein base of the Calabi-Yau 4-fold grows towards the IR, signaling the relevance of deformations. We exploit the map between gauge theory fields and GLSM fields to compute scaling dimensions directly from divisor volumes, allowing for a sharper determination of whether terms in the Lagrangian are relevant or irrelevant. Moreover, this map provides a systematic way to determine the precise set of terms needed to realize a given deformation. We also explore the interplay between general relevant deformations and triality, studying cases where non-mass deformations are mapped to mass deformations in a dual theory, and resolving puzzles that seem to require non-holomorphic couplings in one of the dual phases. Finally, we present evidence that when the Hilbert series of the mesonic moduli space is refined only under the U(1) R-symmetry, it becomes invariant even under non-mass relevant deformations of the brane brick models corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds related by a birational transformation, extending previous results to a broader class of deformations.</description>

      <title>Volume functions and boundary data of 3-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent progress on two closely related sets of questions concerning convex co-compact hyperbolic manifolds, or convex domains in those manifolds, such as their convex core. The first set of questions is to what extent the hyperbolic metric on such a manifold is uniquely determined by either of two possible geometric data on their boundary. The second aspect is the ``volume'' associated to such a manifold, such as the renormalized volume of a convex co-compact hyperbolic manifold. The relation between the two is provided by the first variation of the volume functions, which involves the two kinds of boundary data as ``conjugate'' variables.
  While progress has recently been made on some questions, others remain open. New connections have recently emerged, with physics (and in particular the AdS/CFT correspondence) as well as with probability theory (the Loewner energy).</description>

      <title>Quantitative Gaffney and Korn inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a homogeneous, quantitative version of Ehrling's inequality for the function spaces $H^1(\Omega)\subset\subset L^2(\partial\Omega)$, $H^1(\Omega)\hookrightarrow L^2(\Omega)$ which reflects geometric properties of a given $C^{1,1}$-domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$.
  We use this result to derive quantitative homogeneous versions of Gaffney's inequality, of relevance in electromagnetism as well as Korn's inequality, of relevance in elasticity theory.
  The main difference to the corresponding classical results is that the constants appearing in our inequalities turn out to be dimensional constants. We provide explicit upper bounds for these constants and show that in the case of the tangential homogeneous Korn inequality our upper bound is asymptotically sharp as $n\rightarrow \infty$.
  Lastly, we raise the question of the optimal values of these dimensional constants.</description>

      <title>Radially weighted Backus- and Childress-type bounds for spherical dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In MHD dynamo theory well-known necessary criteria for dynamo action are formulated in terms of lower bounds either on the maximum modulus of the velocity field (Childress-type) or the maximum strain of the velocity field (Backus-type). We generalize these criteria for spherical dynamos by introducing a radially varying weight $f(r)$. The corresponding {\em l}ower {\em b}ound Reynolds numbers $R_{lb}^C [f]$ (based on velocity) and $R_{lb}^B [f]$ (based on strain) are determined for two types of such weights: a power law profile $f(r) = r^\alpha$, $0\leq \alpha \leq 2$ and an optimal radial profile $f_v$ depending on the velocity field $\bf{v}$ in question.
  To assess the quality of these lower bounds we compare them with weighted critical Reynolds numbers $R_c^C$ (Childress-type) and $R_c^B$ (Backus-type), respectively, for the onset of dynamo action of the well known efficient $s_2t_2$ velocity field (Dudley \&amp; James 1989) and a recently determined ``most efficient'' velocity field (Chen et al.\ 2018). For the latter field we find a Backus-type ratio $R^B_c /R^B_{lb}$ of about $6.4$ with the optimal profile compared to a ratio of about $16.3$ without weight.</description>

      <title>A Geometrical Acoustics based Focusing Algorithm for Layered Media in Medical Ultrasound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a widely used, non-invasive diagnostic tool in modern medicine. A crucial assumption is a constant sound speed in the observed medium. For large scale sound speed variations, this assumption leads to blurred and distorted images. In this paper, we present a Geometrical Acoustics based Focusing Algorithm (GOAT) which is able to correct for these aberrations, given a known layered medium setting with continuously differentiable medium boundaries. Existence and uniqueness conditions for a solution to the underlying system of equations are given. Using numerical simulations, the precision of our method is evaluated. Finally, the resulting image quality improvements are demonstrated in a phantom-based experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Estimates of a possible gap related to the energy equality for a class of non-Newtonian fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the 3D-initial value problem for power-law fluids with shear dependent viscosity in a spatially periodic domain. The goal is the construction of a weak solution enjoying an energy equality. The results hold assuming an initial data $v_0\in J^2(\Omega)$ and for $p\in \left(\frac 95,2\right)$. It is interesting to observe that the result is in complete agreement with the one known for the Navier-Stokes equations. Further, in both cases, the additional dissipation, which measures the possible gap with the classical energy equality, is only expressed in terms of energy quantities.</description>

      <title>Self-concordant Schr\"odinger operators: spectral gaps and optimization without condition numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral gaps play a fundamental role in many areas of mathematics, computer science, and physics. In quantum mechanics, the spectral gap of Schr\"odinger operators has a long history of study due to its physical relevance, while in quantum computing spectral gaps are an important proxy for efficiency, such as in the quantum adiabatic algorithm. Motivated by convex optimization, we study Schr\"odinger operators associated with self-concordant barriers over convex domains and prove non-asymptotic lower bounds on the spectral gap for this class of operators. Significantly, we find that the spectral gap does not display any condition-number dependence when the usual Laplacian is replaced by the Laplace--Beltrami operator, which uses second-order information of the barrier and hence can take the curvature of the barrier into account. As an algorithmic application, we construct a novel quantum interior point method that applies to arbitrary self-concordant barriers and shows no condition-number dependence. To achieve this we combine techniques from semiclassical analysis, convex optimization, and quantum annealing.</description>

      <title>Operator level hard edge to bulk transition in $\beta$-ensembles via canonical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hard edge and bulk scaling limits of $\beta$-ensembles are described by the stochastic Bessel and sine operators, which are respectively a random Sturm-Liouville operator and a random Dirac operator. By representing both operators as canonical systems, we show that in a suitable high-energy scaling limit, the stochastic Bessel operator converges in law to the stochastic sine operator. This is first done in the vague topology of canonical systems' coefficient matrices, and then extended to the convergence of the associated Weyl-Titchmarsh functions and spectral measures. The proof relies on a coupling between the Brownian motions that drive the two operators, under which the convergence holds in probability.</description>

      <title>Quantum $f$-divergences and Their Local Behaviour: An Analysis via Relative Expansion Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any reasonable measure of distinguishability of quantum states must satisfy a data processing inequality, that is, it must not increase under the action of a quantum channel. We can ask about the proportion of information lost or preserved and this leads us to study contraction and expansion coefficients respectively, which can be combined into a single \emph{relative expansion coefficient} for study. We focus on two prominent families: (i) standard quantum $f$ divergences and (ii) their local (second-order) behaviour, which induces a monotone Riemannian semi-norm (that is linked to the $\chi^2$ divergence). Building on prior work, we identify new families of $f$ for which the global ($f$ divergence) and local (Riemannian) relative expansion coefficients coincide for every pair of channels, and we clarify how exceptional such exact coincidences are. Beyond equality, we introduce an \emph{equivalence} framework that transfers qualitative properties such as strict positivity uniformly across different relative expansion coefficients.
  Leveraging the link between equality in the data processing inequality (DPI) and channel reversibility, we apply our framework of relative expansion coefficients to approximate recoverability of quantum information. Using our relative expansion results for primitive channels, we prove a reverse quantum Markov convergence theorem, converting positive expansion coefficients into quantitative lower bounds on the convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rates for the Trotter Splitting for Unbounded Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study convergence rates of the Trotter splitting $e^{A+L} = \lim_{n \to \infty} (e^{L/n} e^{A/n})^n$ in the strong operator topology. In the first part, we use complex interpolation theory to treat generators $L$ and $A$ of contraction semigroups on Banach spaces, with $L$ relatively $A$-bounded. In the second part, we study unitary dynamics on Hilbert spaces and develop a new technique based on the concept of energy constraints. Our results provide a complete picture of the convergence rates for the Trotter splitting for all common types of Schr\"odinger and Dirac operators, including singular, confining and magnetic vector potentials, as well as molecular many-body Hamiltonians in dimension $d=3$. Using the Brezis-Mironescu inequality, we derive convergence rates for the Schr\"odinger operator with $V(x)=\pm |x|^{-a}$ potential. In each case, our conditions are fully explicit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We locally classify all possible cosmological homogeneous and isotropic Landsberg-type Finsler structures, in 4-dimensions. Among them, we identify viable non-stationary Finsler spacetimes, i.e. those geometries leading to a physical causal structure and a dynamical universe. Noting that any non-stationary Landsberg metric must be actually non-Berwaldian (i.e., it should be a so-called 'unicorn'), we construct the unique Finsler, non-Berwaldian Landsberg generalization of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution for Two $\delta$-Interacting Bosons on a Ring in the Presence of a $\delta$-Barrier: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz for Spatially Odd States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering for $N$-body time-decaying harmonic oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the previous study (Ishida, 2025), the author proved the uniqueness of short-range potential functions using the Enss-Weder time-dependent method (Enss and Weder, 1995) for a two-body quantum system described by time-decaying harmonic oscillators. In this study, we extend the result of Ishida (2025) to the $N$-body case. We use the approaches developed in Enss and Weder (1995), Weder (1996), and Valencia and Weder (2012) to prove that the high-velocity limit of the scattering operator uniquely determines all the pairwise interaction potentials among the $N$ particles, focusing respectively on each fixed pair of particles.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of topological order parameter in SU($N$) spin models, $N$-ality transformation and ingappabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the ground-state expectation value of twisting operator is a topological order parameter for $\text{U}(1)$- and $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in one-dimensional "spin" systems -- it is quantized in the thermodynamic limit and can be used to identify different SPT phases and to diagnose phase transitions among them. We prove that this (non-local) order parameter must take values in $N$-th roots of unity, and its value can be changed by a generalized lattice translation acting as an $N$-ality transformation connecting distinct phases. This result also implies the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis ingappability for SU($N$) spins if we further impose a general translation symmetry. Furthermore, our exact result for the order parameter of SPT phases can predict a large number of LSM ingappabilities by the general lattice translation. We also apply the $N$-ality property to provide an efficient way to construct possible multi-critical phase transitions starting from a single Hamiltonian with a unique gapped ground state.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-timelike loops in signature changing semi-Riemannian manifolds with a transverse radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1983, Hartle and Hawking proposed the no-boundary proposal, suggesting that the universe has no beginning in the sense of a spacetime singularity or boundary. Nevertheless, there is an origin of time. Mathematically, this involves signature-type changing manifolds in which a Riemannian region smoothly transitions to a Lorentzian region across the hypersurface $\mathcal{H}$ where time begins.
  We develop a coherent framework for signature changing manifolds with a degenerate yet smooth metric. Established Lorentzian tools and results are then adapted to this setting, and new definitions are introduced that carry unforeseen causal implications. A noteworthy consequence is the presence of locally time-reversing loops through every point on the hypersurface. Imposing global hyperbolicity on the Lorentzian region, we prove that for every point $p \in M$ there exists a pseudo-timelike loop self-intersecting at $p$. Equivalently, $M$ always admits a closed pseudo-timelike path around which the time direction reverses, preventing any consistent distinction between future- and past-directed vectors. To an observer near $\mathcal{H}$, such loops may appear as the creation of a particle-antiparticle pair at two distinct points.</description>

      <title>Letting the tiger out of its cage: bosonic coding without concatenation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous-variable cat codes are encodings into a single photonic or phononic mode that offer a promising avenue for hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation. Protecting information in a cat code requires measuring the mode's occupation number modulo two, but this can be relaxed to a linear occupation-number constraint using the alternative two-mode pair-cat encoding. We construct multimode codes with similar linear constraints using any two integer matrices satisfying a CSS-like homological condition of a quantum rotor code. Just like the pair-cat code, syndrome extraction can be performed in tandem with stabilizing dissipation using current superconducting-circuit designs. The framework includes codes with various finite- or infinite-dimensional codespaces, and codes with finite or infinite Fock-state support. It encompasses two-component cat, pair-cat, dual-rail, two-mode binomial, various bosonic repetition codes, and aspects of chi-squared encodings while also yielding codes from homological products, lattices, generalized coherent states, and algebraic varieties. Among our examples are analogues of repetition codes, the Shor code, and a surface-like code that is not a concatenation of a known cat code with the qubit surface code. Codewords are coherent states projected into a Fock-state subspace defined by an integer matrix, and their overlaps are governed by Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <title>Notions of Adiabatic Drift in the Quantized Harper model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a quantized, discrete and drifting version of the Harper Hamiltonian, also called the finite almost Mathieu operator, which resembles the pendulum Hamiltonian but in phase space is confined to a torus. Spacing between pairs of eigenvalues of the operator spans many orders of magnitude, with nearly degenerate pairs of states at energies that are associated with circulating orbits in the associated classical system. When parameters of the system slowly vary, both adiabatic and diabatic transitions can take place at drift rates that span many orders of magnitude. Only under an extremely negligible drift rate would all transitions into superposition states be suppressed. The wide range of energy level spacings could be a common property of quantum systems with non-local potentials that are related to resonant classical dynamical systems. Notions for adiabatic drift are discussed for quantum systems that are associated with classical ones with divided phase space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real and regular soliton solutions of the KP hierarchy have been classified in terms of the totally nonnegative (TNN) Grassmannians. These solitons are referred to as KP solitons, and they are expressed as singular (tropical) limits of shifted Riemann theta functions. In this talk, for each element of the TNN Grassmannian, we construct a Schottky group, which uniformizes the Riemann surface associated with a real finite-gap solution. Then we show that the KP solitons are obtained by degenerating these finite-gap solutions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a class of random Schr\"odinger cocycles showing that, for random cocycles with non-compact support, the presence of certain finite moment conditions is essential for establishing a specific modulus of continuity of the Lyapunov exponent. In particular, H\"older continuity of the Lyapunov exponent requires an exponential moment condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of global higher-form symmetries has received much attention, but leaves room for a more systematic mathematical formulation. In this article, we highlight the concept of higher automorphism bundles from the field of higher categorical differential geometry and higher gauge theory, and we demonstrate that this neatly reproduces and clarifies many examples and phenomena discussed in the literature. We rigorously construct the higher-form symmetries of pure gauge theory of a general strict Lie $2$-group, featuring center higher-form symmetries. We then apply this explicitly to several physically-relevant examples, such as $U(1)$ bundles, bundle gerbes, and certain string $2$-groups related to $SU(n)$ instanton restriction, and $5d$ supergravity. We elaborate on the nontrivial interplay between global higher-form symmetries, connection data, and symmetry gauging.</description>

      <title>Residual Symmetries and BRST Cohomology of Schwarzschild in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24112v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kerr-Schild (KS) double copy is celebrated for producing exact gravitational spacetimes from gauge fields, yet the preservation of symmetry content remains largely unexplored. We investigate the fate of residual symmetries in the KS double copy, focusing on the Schwarzschild solution. On the gauge theory side, we derive the residual transformations that preserve the Abelian and non-Abelian KS ansatz\"e, finding they both form an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra parameterized by arbitrary null functions. On the gravity side, we analyze the resulting residual diffeomorphisms of the KS Schwarzschild metric. Restricting our focus to the Killing vector class of solutions, we find that the only surviving diffeomorphisms are the finite-dimensional global isometries of Schwarzschild, reducing the residual gauge algebra to the subalgebra generated by time translations and spatial rotations. This finding reveals a fundamental structural mismatch: the infinite-dimensional algebra of the gauge side admits no simple counterpart in this constrained gravitational sector. We formalize this by showing that the BRST operator for the residual symmetry is trivialized under the Killing condition. This result serves as a crucial consistency check, validating the kinematic algebraic collapse within a quantum field theoretic framework. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In the second paper, we complete this analysis by examining the more complex proper conformal Killing vector (CKV) class of solutions and formulating a unified BRST framework to definitively test the structural obstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a family of radially symmetric Coulomb gas systems at inverse temperature $\beta = 2$. The family is characterised by the property that the density of the equilibrium measure vanishes on a ring at radius $r_*$, which lies strictly inside the droplet. The large $n$ expansion of the logarithm of the partition function is obtained up to a novel $n^{1/4}$ term. We perform a double scaling limit of the correlation kernel at the $n^{1/4}$ scale and obtain a new limiting kernel in the bulk, which differs from the well-known Ginibre kernel.</description>
