      <title>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) as a tool in literature reviews: an LLM automated systematic review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: This study aims to summarize the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the process of creating a scientific review. We look at the range of stages in a review that can be automated and assess the current state-of-the-art research projects in the field. Materials and Methods: The search was conducted in June 2024 in PubMed, Scopus, Dimensions, and Google Scholar databases by human reviewers. Screening and extraction process took place in Covidence with the help of LLM add-on which uses OpenAI gpt-4o model. ChatGPT was used to clean extracted data and generate code for figures in this manuscript, ChatGPT and Scite.ai were used in drafting all components of the manuscript, except the methods and discussion sections. Results: 3,788 articles were retrieved, and 172 studies were deemed eligible for the final review. ChatGPT and GPT-based LLM emerged as the most dominant architecture for review automation (n=126, 73.2%). A significant number of review automation projects were found, but only a limited number of papers (n=26, 15.1%) were actual reviews that used LLM during their creation. Most citations focused on automation of a particular stage of review, such as Searching for publications (n=60, 34.9%), and Data extraction (n=54, 31.4%). When comparing pooled performance of GPT-based and BERT-based models, the former were better in data extraction with mean precision 83.0% (SD=10.4), and recall 86.0% (SD=9.8), while being slightly less accurate in title and abstract screening stage (Maccuracy=77.3%, SD=13.0). Discussion/Conclusion: Our LLM-assisted systematic review revealed a significant number of research projects related to review automation using LLMs. The results looked promising, and we anticipate that LLMs will change in the near future the way the scientific reviews are conducted.</description>

      <title>3D Data Long-Term Preservation in Cultural Heritage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The report explores the challenges and strategies for preserving 3D digital data in cultural heritage. It discusses the issue of technological obsolescence, emphasising the need for ustainable storage solutions and ongoing data management strategies. Key topics include understanding technological obsolescence, the lifecycle of digital content, digital continuity, data management plans (DMP), FAIR principles, and the use of public repositories. The report also covers the importance of metadata in long-term digital preservation, including types of metadata and strategies for building valuable metadata. It examines the evolving standards and interoperability in 3D format preservation and the importance of managing metadata and paradata. The document provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges and solutions for preserving 3D cultural heritage data in the long term.</description>

      <title>DatAasee -- A Metadata-Lake as Metadata Catalog for a Virtual Data-Lake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metadata management for distributed data sources is a long-standing but ever-growing problem. To counter this challenge in a research-data and library-oriented setting, this work constructs a data architecture, derived from the data-lake: the metadata-lake. A proof-of-concept implementation of this proposed metadata system is presented and evaluated as well.</description>

      <title>Mapping Literacies in the Tourism Labor Market: A Cross-Database Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book chapter conducts a comparative bibliometric analysis of literacies in the tourism labor market, drawing from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. The objective is to assess scientific outputs and identify key patterns of scientific collaboration. Findings suggest a statistically significant difference between the two databases with an overlap level of 35.71%. However, there is a gradual and correlated increase in the number of publications over time. Scopus stands out for its broader impact and enduring citation relevance, suggesting its academic contributions have a longer-lasting effect. Conversely, WoS is characterized by a focus on more recent influential publications and exhibits a marginally more intense collaboration network.</description>

      <title>Top Research Performance Over Three Decades: A Multidimensional Micro-Data Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research, the contributions of a highly productive minority of scientists to the national Polish research output over the past three decades (1992-2021) is explored. In almost all previous research, the approaches to high research productivity are missing the time component. Cross-sectional studies were not complemented by longitudinal studies: Scientists comprising the classes of top performers have not been tracked over time. Three classes of top performers (the upper 1%, 5%, and 10%) are examined, and a surprising temporal stability of productivity patterns is found. The 1/10 and 10/50 rules consistently apply across the three decades: The upper 1% of scientists, on average, account for 10% of the national output, and the upper 10% account for almost 50% of total output, with significant disciplinary variations. The Relative Presence Index (RPI) we constructed shows that men are overrepresented and women underrepresented in all top performers classes. Top performers are studied longitudinally through their detailed publishing histories, with micro-data coming from the raw Scopus dataset. Econometric models identify the three most important predictors that change the odds ratio estimates of membership in the top performance classes: gender, academic age, and research collaboration. The downward trend in fixed effects over successive six-year periods indicates increasing competition in academia. A large population of all internationally visible Polish scientists (N=152,043) with their 587,558 articles is studied.</description>

      <title>Are Scientists Changing their Research Productivity Classes When They Move Up the Academic Ladder?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04200v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We approach productivity in science in a longitudinal fashion: We track careers over time, up to 40 years. We first allocate scientists to decile-based publishing productivity classes, from the bottom 10% to the top 10%. Then, we seek patterns of mobility between the classes in two career stages: assistant professorship and associate professorship. Our findings confirm that radically changing publishing productivity levels (upward or downward) almost never happens. Scientists with a very weak past track record in publications emerge as having marginal chances of becoming scientists with a very strong future track record across all science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields. Hence, our research shows a long-term character of careers in science, with publishing productivity during the apprenticeship period of assistant professorship heavily influencing productivity during the more independent period of associate professorship. We use individual-level microdata on academic careers (from a national registry of scientists) and individual-level metadata on publications (from the Scopus raw dataset). Polish associate professors tend to be stuck in their productivity classes for years: High performers tend to remain high performers, and low performers tend to remain low performers over their careers. Logistic regression analysis powerfully supports our two-dimensional results. We examine all internationally visible Polish associate professors in five fields of science in STEMM fields (N = 4,165 with N art = 71,841 articles).</description>
