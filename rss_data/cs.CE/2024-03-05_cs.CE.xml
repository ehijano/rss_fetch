      <title>Theory and Computation of Substructure Characteristic Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of substructure characteristic modes is reformulated using a scattering matrix-based formulation, generalizing subregion characteristic mode decomposition to arbitrary computational tools. It is shown that the scattering formulation is identical to the classical formulation based on the background Green's function for lossless systems. The scattering formulation, however, opens a variety of new subregion scenarios unavailable within previous formulations, including cases with lumped or wave ports or subregions in circuits. Thanks to its scattering nature, the formulation is solver-agnostic with the possibility to utilize an arbitrary full-wave method.</description>

      <title>Advancing parabolic operators in thermodynamic MHD models II: Evaluating a Practical Time Step Limit for Unconditionally Stable Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconditionally stable time stepping schemes are useful and often practically necessary for advancing parabolic operators in multi-scale systems. However, serious accuracy problems may emerge when taking time steps that far exceed the explicit stability limits. In our previous work, we compared the accuracy and performance of advancing parabolic operators in a thermodynamic MHD model using an implicit method and an explicit super time-stepping (STS) method. We found that while the STS method outperformed the implicit one with overall good results, it was not able to damp oscillatory behavior in the solution efficiently, hindering its practical use. In this follow-up work, we evaluate an easy-to-implement method for selecting a practical time step limit (PTL) for unconditionally stable schemes. This time step is used to `cycle' the operator-split thermal conduction and viscosity parabolic operators. We test the new time step with both an implicit and STS scheme for accuracy, performance, and scaling. We find that, for our test cases here, the PTL dramatically improves the STS solution, matching or improving the solution of the original implicit scheme, while retaining most of its performance and scaling advantages. The PTL shows promise to allow more accurate use of unconditionally stable schemes for parabolic operators and reliable use of STS methods.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Hydrodynamic Fabrication of Microstructures using Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manufacturing of microstructures using a microfluidic device is a largely empirical effort due to the multi-physical nature of the fabrication process. As such, models are desired that will predict microstructure performance characteristics (e.g., size, porosity, and stiffness) based on known inputs, such as sheath and core fluid flow rates. Potentially more useful is the prospect of inputting desired performance characteristics into a design model to extract appropriate manufacturing parameters. In this study, we demonstrate that deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with sparse datasets augmented by synthetic data can produce accurate predictive and design models. For our predictive model with known sheath and core flow rates and bath solution percentage, calculated solid microfiber dimensions are shown to be greater than 95% accurate, with porosity and Young's modulus exhibiting greater than 90% accuracy for a majority of conditions. Likewise, the design model is able to recover sheath and core flow rates with 95% accuracy when provided values for microfiber dimensions, porosity, and Young's modulus. As a result, DNN-based modeling of the microfiber fabrication process demonstrates high potential for reducing time to manufacture of microstructures with desired characteristics.</description>

      <title>Optimization decision model of vegetable stock and pricing based on TCN-Attention and genetic algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the expansion of operational scale of supermarkets in China, the vegetable market has grown considerably. The decision-making related to procurement costs and allocation quantities of vegetables has become a pivotal factor in determining the profitability of supermarkets. This paper analyzes the relationship between pricing and allocation faced by supermarkets in vegetable operations. Optimization algorithms are employed to determine replenishment and pricing strategies. Linear regression is utilized to model the historical data of various products, establishing the relationship between sale prices and sales volumes for 61 products. By integrating historical data on vegetable costs with time information based on the 24 solar terms, a cost prediction model is trained using TCN-Attention. The Topis evaluation model identifies the 32 most market-demanded products. A genetic algorithm is then used to search for the globally optimized vegetable product allocation-pricing decision.</description>

      <title>BrainMass: Advancing Brain Network Analysis for Diagnosis with Large-scale Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets via self-supervised learning demonstrate exceptional versatility across various tasks. Due to the heterogeneity and hard-to-collect medical data, this approach is especially beneficial for medical image analysis and neuroscience research, as it streamlines broad downstream tasks without the need for numerous costly annotations. However, there has been limited investigation into brain network foundation models, limiting their adaptability and generalizability for broad neuroscience studies. In this study, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, (1) we curated a comprehensive dataset by collating images from 30 datasets, which comprises 70,781 samples of 46,686 participants. Moreover, we introduce pseudo-functional connectivity (pFC) to further generates millions of augmented brain networks by randomly dropping certain timepoints of the BOLD signal. (2) We propose the BrainMass framework for brain network self-supervised learning via mask modeling and feature alignment. BrainMass employs Mask-ROI Modeling (MRM) to bolster intra-network dependencies and regional specificity. Furthermore, Latent Representation Alignment (LRA) module is utilized to regularize augmented brain networks of the same participant with similar topological properties to yield similar latent representations by aligning their latent embeddings. Extensive experiments on eight internal tasks and seven external brain disorder diagnosis tasks show BrainMass's superior performance, highlighting its significant generalizability and adaptability. Nonetheless, BrainMass demonstrates powerful few/zero-shot learning abilities and exhibits meaningful interpretation to various diseases, showcasing its potential use for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>An Authentic Algorithm for Ciphering and Deciphering Called Latin Djokovic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question that is a motivation of writing is how many devote themselves to discovering something in the world of science where much is discerned and revealed, but at the same time, much is unknown. The insightful elements of this algorithm are the ciphering and deciphering algorithms of Playfair, Caesar, and Vigenere. Only a few of their main properties are taken and modified, with the aim of forming a specific functionality of the algorithm called Latin Djokovic. Specifically, a string is entered as input data. A key k is given, with a random value between the values a and b = a + 3. The obtained value is stored in a variable with the aim of being constant during the run of the algorithm. In correlation to the given key, the string is divided into several groups of substrings, and each substring has a length of k characters. The next step involves encoding each substring from the list of existing substrings. Encoding is performed using the basis of the Caesar algorithm, i.e., shifting with k characters. However, that k is incremented by 1 when moving to the next substring in that list. When the value of k becomes greater than b + 1, it will return to its initial value. The algorithm is executed, following the same procedure, until the last substring in the list is traversed. Using this polyalphabetic method, ciphering and deciphering of strings are achieved. The algorithm also works for a 100-character string. The x character is not used when the number of characters in a substring is incompatible with the expected length. The algorithm is simple to implement, but it is questionable if it works better than the other methods from the point of view of execution time and storage space.</description>

      <title>Monitoring the Seismic Behavior of a Scaled RC Frame with Intermediate Ductility in a Shaking Table Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the commonly used seismic force-resisting systems in structures is Reinforced Concrete (RC) Intermediate Moment Frames (IMF). Although using the IMF is not allowed in high seismic hazard zones according to ASCE 7-10, it is permitted in both Iran's 2800 Seismic Standard and New Zealand's Seismic Code. This study investigates the seismic behavior of a reinforced concrete IMF subjected to earthquake excitations using shaking table tests on a 2D RC structural model which is designed under the regulations of ACI318-19. The scale factor of 1/2.78 is selected for the frame fabrication due to the size limit of the shaking table. The constructed model has three stories with a height as 115 cm for each story, the clear length of beams as 151 cm, and cross-sectional dimensions of columns and beams as 11 $\times$ 11 cm and 12 $\times$ 11 cm, respectively. The whole structure is supported by a foundation that is 173 cm long, 52 cm wide, and 22 cm deep. Columns and beams are reinforced with 8 mm diameter longitudinal ribbed bars and stirrups with 6 mm diameter. The tests are conducted in stages with increasing peak ground acceleration (PGA) till the failure of the frame. Sarpol-E-Zahab earthquake seismic record is adopted for the experiment. The structural responses (e.g., displacements, longitudinal bars' strain, crack propagation, accelerations) are monitored during the test using both conventional sensors and vison-based sensors. As a comparative study, both conventional sensors and computer vision techniques are used to monitor the health state and to analyze the structural dynamics of the scaled RC frame structure.</description>

      <title>A Novel Shortest Path Query Algorithm Based on Optimized Adaptive Topology Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban rail transit is a fundamental component of public transportation, however, commonly station-based path search algorithms often overlook the impact of transfer times on search results, leading to decreased accuracy. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel shortest path query algorithm based on adaptive topology optimization called the Adaptive Topology Extension Road Network Structure (ATEN). This algorithm categorizes transfer stations into different types and treats travel time and transfer time equivalently as weights for edges in the topological graph. The proposed algorithm introduces virtual stations to differentiate between pedestrian paths and train paths, eliminating the need for additional operations on transfer stations. The algorithm controls the extent of expansion in the urban rail transit topology, overcoming query errors caused by mishandling of transfer stations in the existing algorithm. Finally, a series of simulation experiments were conducted on Beijing's urban rail transit network to validate both correctness and efficiency of the proposed adaptive topology optimization algorithm. The results demonstrate significant advantages compared to existing similar algorithms.</description>

      <title>Enhanced User Interaction in Operating Systems through Machine Learning Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the large language model showing human-like logical reasoning and understanding ability, whether agents based on the large language model can simulate the interaction behavior of real users, so as to build a reliable virtual recommendation A/B test scene to help the application of recommendation research is an urgent, important and economic value problem. The combination of interaction design and machine learning can provide a more efficient and personalized user experience for products and services. This personalized service can meet the specific needs of users and improve user satisfaction and loyalty. Second, the interactive system can understand the user's views and needs for the product by providing a good user interface and interactive experience, and then use machine learning algorithms to improve and optimize the product. This iterative optimization process can continuously improve the quality and performance of the product to meet the changing needs of users. At the same time, designers need to consider how these algorithms and tools can be combined with interactive systems to provide a good user experience. This paper explores the potential applications of large language models, machine learning and interaction design for user interaction in recommendation systems and operating systems. By integrating these technologies, more intelligent and personalized services can be provided to meet user needs and promote continuous improvement and optimization of products. This is of great value for both recommendation research and user experience applications.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Ethereum Upgradable Smart Contracts and Their Security Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upgradeable smart contracts (USCs) have been widely adopted to enable modifying deployed smart contracts. While USCs bring great flexibility to developers, improper usage might introduce new security issues, potentially allowing attackers to hijack USCs and their users. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale measurement study to characterize USCs and their security implications in the wild. We summarize six commonly used USC patterns and develop a tool, USCDetector, to identify USCs without needing source code. Particularly, USCDetector collects various information such as bytecode and transaction information to construct upgrade chains for USCs and disclose potentially vulnerable ones. We evaluate USCDetector using verified smart contracts (i.e., with source code) as ground truth and show that USCDetector can achieve high accuracy with a precision of 96.26%. We then use USCDetector to conduct a large-scale study on Ethereum, covering a total of 60,251,064 smart contracts. USCDetecor constructs 10,218 upgrade chains and discloses multiple real-world USCs with potential security issues.</description>

      <title>A face-centred finite volume method for laminar and turbulent incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops, for the first time, a face-centred finite volume (FCFV) solver for the simulation of laminar and turbulent viscous incompressible flows. The formulation relies on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations coupled with the negative Spalart-Allmaras (SA) model and three novel convective stabilisations, inspired by Riemann solvers, are derived and compared numerically. The resulting method achieves first-order convergence of the velocity, the velocity-gradient tensor and the pressure. FCFV accurately predicts engineering quantities of interest, such as drag and lift, on unstructured meshes and, by avoiding gradient reconstruction, the method is insensitive to mesh quality, even in the presence of highly distorted and stretched cells. A monolithic and a staggered solution strategies for the RANS-SA system are derived and compared numerically. Numerical benchmarks, involving laminar and turbulent, steady and transient cases are used to assess the performance, accuracy and robustness of the proposed FCFV method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning (ML) techniques to solve complex physical problems has been considered recently as a promising approach. However, the evaluation of such learned physical models remains an important issue for industrial use. The aim of this competition is to encourage the development of new ML techniques to solve physical problems using a unified evaluation framework proposed recently, called Learning Industrial Physical Simulations (LIPS). We propose learning a task representing a well-known physical use case: the airfoil design simulation, using a dataset called AirfRANS. The global score calculated for each submitted solution is based on three main categories of criteria covering different aspects, namely: ML-related, Out-Of-Distribution, and physical compliance criteria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first competition addressing the use of ML-based surrogate approaches to improve the trade-off computational cost/accuracy of physical simulation.The competition is hosted by the Codabench platform with online training and evaluation of all submitted solutions.</description>

      <title>Blue and Green-Mode Energy-Efficient Chemiresistive Sensor Array Realized by Rapid Ensemble Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) necessitates the development of optimized Chemiresistive Sensor (CRS) arrays that are both energy-efficient and capable. This study introduces a novel optimization strategy that employs a rapid ensemble learning-based model committee approach to achieve these goals. Utilizing machine learning models such as Elastic Net Regression, Random Forests, and XGBoost, among others, the strategy identifies the most impactful sensors in a CRS array for accurate classification: A weighted voting mechanism is introduced to aggregate the models' opinions in sensor selection, thereby setting up wo distinct working modes, termed "Blue" and "Green". The Blue mode operates with all sensors for maximum detection capability, while the Green mode selectively activates only key sensors, significantly reducing energy consumption without compromising detection accuracy. The strategy is validated through theoretical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy. The proposed optimization strategy not only elevates the detection capability of CRS arrays but also brings it closer to theoretical limits, promising significant implications for the development of low-cost, easily fabricable next-generation IoT sensor terminals.</description>

      <title>Payment Scheduling in the Interval Debt Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The network-based study of financial systems has received considerable attention in recent years but has seldom explicitly incorporated the dynamic aspects of such systems. We consider this problem setting from the temporal point of view and introduce the Interval Debt Model (IDM) and some scheduling problems based on it, namely: Bankruptcy Minimization/Maximization, in which the aim is to produce a payment schedule with at most/at least a given number of bankruptcies; Perfect Scheduling, the special case of the minimization variant where the aim is to produce a schedule with no bankruptcies (that is, a perfect schedule); and Bailout Minimization, in which a financial authority must allocate a smallest possible bailout package to enable a perfect schedule. We show that each of these problems is NP-complete, in many cases even on very restricted input instances. On the positive side, we provide for Perfect Scheduling a polynomial-time algorithm on (rooted) out-trees although in contrast we prove NP-completeness on directed acyclic graphs, as well as on instances with a constant number of nodes (and hence also constant treewidth). When we allow non-integer payments, we show by a linear programming argument that the problem Bailout Minimization can be solved in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Mol-Instructions: A Large-Scale Biomolecular Instruction Dataset for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08018</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their remarkable task-handling capabilities and innovative outputs, have catalyzed significant advancements across a spectrum of fields. However, their proficiency within specialized domains such as biomolecular studies remains limited. To address this challenge, we introduce Mol-Instructions, a comprehensive instruction dataset designed for the biomolecular domain. Mol-Instructions encompasses three key components: molecule-oriented instructions, protein-oriented instructions, and biomolecular text instructions. Each component aims to improve the understanding and prediction capabilities of LLMs concerning biomolecular features and behaviors. Through extensive instruction tuning experiments on LLMs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Mol-Instructions in enhancing large models' performance in the intricate realm of biomolecular studies, thus fostering progress in the biomolecular research community. Mol-Instructions is publicly available for ongoing research and will undergo regular updates to enhance its applicability.</description>

      <title>NeRF Solves Undersampled MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel undersampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that leverages the concept of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). With radial undersampling, the corresponding imaging problem can be reformulated into an image modeling task from sparse-view rendered data; therefore, a high dimensional MR image is obtainable from undersampled k-space data by taking advantage of implicit neural representation. A multi-layer perceptron, which is designed to output an image intensity from a spatial coordinate, learns the MR physics-driven rendering relation between given measurement data and desired image. Effective undersampling strategies for high-quality neural representation are investigated. The proposed method serves two benefits: (i) The learning is based fully on single undersampled k-space data, not a bunch of measured data and target image sets. It can be used potentially for diagnostic MR imaging, such as fetal MRI, where data acquisition is relatively rare or limited against diversity of clinical images while undersampled reconstruction is highly demanded. (ii) A reconstructed MR image is a scan-specific representation highly adaptive to the given k-space measurement. Numerous experiments validate the feasibility and capability of the proposed approach.</description>
