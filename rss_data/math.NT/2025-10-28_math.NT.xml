      <title>Predicting the size ranking of minimal primes in the generalised Goldbach partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scarcely known generalization of Goldbach's conjecture introduced by Hardy and Littlewood states that for every pair of (relatively prime) positive integers m1 and m2, every sufficiently large integer n satisfying certain simple congruence criteria can be $(m_1,m_2)$-partitioned as $n = m_1p+m_2q$ for some primes $p$ and $q$. While the size of the minimal prime in the Goldbach partitions of even numbers has received prior attention, we extend this investigation to the general case of $(m_1,m_2)$-partitions. This question has a direct implication on the running times of verification algorithms of the generalised Goldbach conjecture. We study the rankings of the pairs $(m_1,m_2)$ according to the sizes of the averages and maxima, respectively, of the minimal $p$ in the $(m_1,m_2)$-partitions of numbers up to large thresholds, and propose a rank-order predicting function depending only on m2 and the prime factors of $m_1$. We computed both the average and the maximum of the minimal prime $p$ in all $(m_1,m_2)$-partitions of integers up to $10^9$, for every pair of relatively prime coefficients $1\leq m1\neq m2\leq 40$. Our function shows very high rank-order correlations with both the empirical averages and maxima of the minimal primes $p$ (Spearman's $\rho=0.9949$ and $0.9958$, respectively). It also correctly predicts trends in the experimental data, for example, that for all relatively prime $1\leq m1&lt;m2\leq 40$, the average minimal $p$ in the $(m_1,m_2)$-partitions of numbers up to $10^9$ exceeds the analogous average for the $(m_2,m_1)$-partitions. We present numerical data, including the average and the maximum of the minimal $p$ in the $(m_1,m_2)$-partitions of numbers up to $10^9$ for each pair $1\leq m1\neq m2\leq 20$ relatively prime, and the resulting size rankings.</description>

      <title>Difference operators and difference equations on lattices, or grids, up to the elliptic hypergeometric case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown how to define difference operators and equations on particular lattices $\{x_n\}$, $2n\in\mathbb{Z}$, such that the divided difference operator $(\mathcal{D}f)(x_{n+1/2})= (f(x_{n+1})-f(x_n))/(x_{n+1}-x_n)$ has the property that $\mathcal{D}f$ is a rational function of degree $2d$ when $f$ is a rational function of degree $d$. It is then shown that the $x_n$s are in the most general case values of an elliptic function at a sequence of arguments in arithmetic progression (\emph{elliptic lattice}). Many special and limit cases, down to the most elementary ones, are considered too. First and second order difference operators and equations are constructed, up to the simplest elliptic hypergeometric ones. One also shows orthogonality and biorthogonality properties of rational solutions to some of these difference equations.</description>

      <title>Linking Congruences for PED and POD partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work of Garvan, Sellers, Smoot, and others has made connections between infinite families of congruences for various partition functions. Here, we apply this approach to families of congruences for PED and POD partitions and find that they are naturally linked to congruence families for overpartitions into odd parts and overpartitions.</description>

      <title>Some 2-adic integers related to the odd part of 2^e!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The odd part of 2^e! as e approaches infinity leads to a 2-adic integer z. The bits of z were publicized in OEIS-A359349, where two conjectures were made, relevant to computing z. We prove both of those conjectures. A second 2-adic integer, the limit of ((2^e-1)!!-1)/2^e, plays a key role in one proof.</description>

      <title>Tetragonal modular quotients $X_0^*(N)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a positive integer. For every $d\mid N$ such that $(d,N/d)=1$ there exists an Atkin-Lehner involution $w_d$ of the modular curve $X_0(N)$. The curve $X_0^*(N)$ is a quotient curve of $X_0(N)$ by $B(N)$, the group of all involutions $w_d$. In this paper we determine all quotient curves $X_0^*(N)$ whose $\mathbb C$-gonality is equal to $4$. We also determine all curves $X_0^*(N)$ whose $\mathbb Q$-gonality is equal to $4$ with the exception of level $N=378$.</description>

      <title>A survey and a result on inhomogeneous quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey recent work done on the values at integer points of irrational inhomogeneous quadratic forms, namely, inhomogeneous analogues of the famous Oppenheim conjecture. We also prove that the set of such forms in two variables whose set of values at integer points avoids a given countable set not containing zero, has full Hausdorff dimension. Moreover, we consider the more refined variant of this problem, where the shift is fixed and the form is allowed to vary. The strategy is to translate the problems to homogeneous dynamics and deduce the theorems from their dynamical counterparts. While our approach is inspired by the work of Kleinbock and Weiss, the dynamical results can be deduced from more general results of An, Guan, and Kleinbock.</description>

      <title>Abhyankar valuations, Pr\"ufer-Manis valuations, and perfectoid Tate algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \(K\) be a perfectoid field. We describe all quotient fields of the perfectoid Tate algebra \begin{equation*}T_{n, K}^{\text{perfd}}=K\langle X_{1}^{1/p^{\infty}},\dots,
  X_{n}^{1/p^{\infty}}\rangle \end{equation*}in any number $n\geq1$ of variables in terms of (completed perfections of) the nonarchimedean fields $K_{r_1,\dots, r_l}$ occuring in Berkovich geometry. We prove that every quotient field \begin{equation*}L=T_{n, K}^{\text{perfd}}/\mathfrak{m}\end{equation*}is a so-called semi-immediate extension of $K_{r_1,\dots, r_l}^{\text{perfd}}$ for some \begin{equation*} l \leq \max(0, n-\text{ht}(\mathfrak{m}^{\flat} \cap (T_{n, K^{\flat}})^{\text{coperf}})-1), \end{equation*}which pins down the value groups and the residue fields of the possible quotient fields $L$.
  The main ingredient in our proof is a qualitative generalization of Berkovich's classification of points on the nonarchimedean closed unit ball. Namely, we introduce the notion of topologically simple valuations, which generalize type (IV) points in the classification of points on $\text{Spa}(K\langle T\rangle)$. We also consider Abhyankar valuations (i.e., those for which Abhyankar's inequality is an equality), which generalize type (II) and (III) points. We prove that, on an affinoid algebra in the sense of Tate which is not a field, the topologically simple valuations are never Abhyankar, and we derive our result on the perfectoid Tate algebra from this statement. Along the way, we also show that our topologically simple valuations are the same as Pr\"ufer-Manis valuations in the sense of \cite{Knebusch-Zhang}.
  Finally, we also show that all allowed possibilities for the quotient fields $L$ do indeed occur (i.e., the above bound on $l$ is optimal) by generalizing an example of Gleason in \cite{Gleason22N}.</description>

      <title>A $2$-Regular Sequence That Counts The Divisors of $n^2 + 1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the $2$-regular integer sequence A383066 $= (s(n))_{n \geq 1}$, which begins $0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, \ldots$. We prove that the number of occurrences of an integer $m \geq 0$ in this sequence is equal to $\tau(m^2+1)$, the number of divisors of $m^2 + 1$. Using this fact, we give a generating function for $\tau(m^2+1)$. We also discuss other interesting properties of $s(n)$, including its relationship to the Fibonacci sequence.</description>

      <title>Effective Erd\H{o}s-Wintner for Cantor series via a trailing-window method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove explicit Erd\H{o}s--Wintner bounds for Cantor series via a simple trailing-window decomposition. We temporarily discard the last block of digits (the ``window'') and analyze the remaining prefix. The resulting bound has three contributions: (i) a bridge loss from discarding the window; (ii) a variance-type tail for the prefix; and (iii) a regime-dependent smoothing term (Esseen, bounded density, or cancellation of the third cumulant). Optimizing the window length yields rates that are explicit in the sample size. In the fixed-base (q-adic) case we recover Delange's product and obtain effective convergence bounds; the same scheme applies unchanged to Cantor series. We also include a brief guide indicating when each regime is preferable.</description>

      <title>A Galois Criterion for Good Reduction via Orbital Arboreal Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let K be a non-archimedean local field and phi: P^1 -&gt; P^1 a rational endomorphism of degree d &gt;= 2 defined over K. We relate the reduction of phi to the Galois action on its preimage towers by introducing the *orbital colimit* G_{O+(x)} := colim_n Im(rho_{phi^n(x)}), a canonical Galois object encoding the dynamics along a forward orbit. Our main theorem (Theorem 3.1) gives a precise equivalence: phi has *strict good reduction* if and only if there exists a nonempty open set of integral points x in P^1(O_K) whose reductions avoid the reduced postcritical set PC(tilde{phi}), such that the reduced level-1 fibers have degree d and are etale -- equivalently, the associated fiber polynomials have unit leading coefficient and unit discriminant. In particular, for every such x, the extensions K(X_n(x))/K are unramified for all n &gt;= 1. This yields a dynamical Neron--Ogg--Shafarevich criterion in arboreal terms, valid on the natural open locus. We provide complete proofs and explicit examples over Q_p.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss several congruences satisfied by the coefficients of meromorphic modular forms, or equivalently, $p$-adic behaviors of meromorphic modular forms under the $U_p$ operator, that are summarized from numerical experiments, connecting meromorphic modular forms to symmetric powers of elliptic curves. We also provide heuristic explanations for these congruences as well as prove some of them using hypergeometric functions and the Borcherds--Shimura lift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate variations of Selmer ranks under quadratic twists satisfying the Heegner hypothesis. In particular, starting with an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ with partial $2$-torsion and a common relaxed Selmer group, we derive explicit formulae describing the effect of twisting on Selmer ranks in terms of matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{2}$. As an application, we show that these formulae are compatible with predictions made by the parity conjecture.</description>

      <title>Density of orbits of horocycle flows at sub-quadratic polynomial times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma\subset PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ be such that the space $X=\Gamma\backslash PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ is not compact. Let $(h_t)$ be the horocycle flow acting on $X$. We show that for every $x\in X$ that is not periodic for $(h_t)$ and for every $\delta\in (0,1)$ the orbit $\{h_{n^{2-\delta}}x\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is dense in $X$. Assuming additionally the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture we show that for every non-periodic $x\in X$, $\{h_{p}x\}_{p- \text{prime}}$ is dense in $X$. Finally we show that for $\Gamma=PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$, $\{h_{n^2}y_q\}_{n&lt;q}$ equidistribute, as $q\to \infty$ along primes congruent to $1 \pmod{4}$, towards Haar measure, where $\{y_q\}$ is a sequence of periodic points of period $q$.</description>

      <title>Essential dimension relative to branched covers of degree at most n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove for various finite groups $G$ and integers $n\geq 1$ that there are families of equations with Galois group $G$ that cannot be simplified to a one-parameter family even after adjoining a root of a polynomial of degree at most $n$. In more geometric language, there are $G$-varieties $X$ with the following property: for any $G$-equivariant branched cover $\widetilde{X}\to X$ of degree $\leq n$, there is no dominant rational $G$-map $\widetilde{X}\dashrightarrow C$ to any $G$-curve $C$. The method of proof is new, and applies in cases where previous methods do not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nathanson introduced the range of cardinalities of $h$-fold sumsets $R(h,k) := \{|hA|:A \subset \mathbb{Z} \text{ and }|A| = k\}.$ Following a remark of Erd\H{o}s and Szemer\'edi that determined the form of $R(h,k)$ when $h=2$, Nathanson asked what the form of $R(h,k)$ is for arbitrary $h, k \in \mathbb{N}$. For $h \in \mathbb{N}$, we prove there is some constant $k_h \in \mathbb{N}$ such that if $k &gt; k_h$, then $R(h,k)$ is the entire interval $\left[hk-h+1,\binom{h+k-1}{h}\right]$ except for a specified set of $\binom{h-1}{2}$ numbers. Moreover, we show that one can take $k_3 = 2$.</description>

      <title>Partition analysis and the little G\"ollnitz identites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work follows the spirit of Andrews' series of papers on Partition Analysis. In $2011$, Savage and Sills found new sum sides for the little G\"ollnitz identities and provided their partition interpretations. It turns out that similar companions exist for a mod $8$ partition identity due to Andrews. In this work, we use MacMahon's Partition Analysis to study partitions related to these identities. We find refined generating functions for them, where we keep track of the size of each part. Finally, by considering the alternating sum and Schmidt weight, we show the application of these refined functions in the study of partition statistics.</description>

      <title>Borel Complexity of the set of vectors normal for a fixed recurrence sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider recurrence sequences $x_n=\xi_1 \alpha_1^n+\xi_2 \alpha_2^n$ ($n=0,1,\ldots$) with companion polynomial $P(X)$. For example, the sequence $x_n=\xi_1(4+\sqrt{2})^n+\xi_2(4-\sqrt{2})^n$ satisfies the recurrence $x_{n+2}-8x_{n+1}+14x_n=0$ and has companion polynomial $P(X)=X^2-8X+14=(X-4-\sqrt{2})(X-4+\sqrt{2})$. We call $(\xi_1,\xi_2)$ normal with respect to the recurrence relation determined by $P(X)$ when $(x_n)_{n\ge 0}$ is uniformly distributed modulo one.
  Determining the Borel complexity of the set of normal vectors for a fixed recurrence sequence is unresolved even for most geometric progressions. Under certain assumptions, we prove that the set of normal vectors is $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_3^0$-complete. A special case is the new result that the sets of numbers normal in base $\alpha$, i.e. $\{\xi\in \mathbb{R}\mid (\xi\alpha^n)_{n\geq 0}\mbox{ is u.d. modulo one.} \}$, are $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_3^0$-complete for every real number $\alpha$ with $|\alpha|$ Pisot. We analyze the fractional parts of recurrence sequences in terms of finite words via certain numeration systems. One of the difficulties in proving the main result is that even when recurrence sequences are uniformly distributed modulo one, it is not known what the average frequencies of the digits in the corresponding digital expansions are or if they even must exist.</description>

Abstract: Adapting Reiher's proof of Kemnitz's conjecture, we obtain two refinements of a theorem of Schmid and Zhuang. Our main results provide improved upper bounds for the Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv constant of rank-two-like $p$-groups, and their direct products with cyclic groups of order coprime to $p$. In particular, we determine the exact value of this constant, and also confirm a conjecture of Gao, for a new infinite family of groups of arbitrarily large rank.</description>

Abstract: We consider the generalized Lebesgue-Ramanujan-Nagell equation $x^2+17^k41^\ell 59^m=2^\delta y^n$ in the unknown integers $x\geq 1, y&gt;1,n\geq 3$ and $k, \ell, m\geq 0$ satisfying $\gcd(x,y)=1$. We first find all the integer solutions of the above equation, and then use this result to determine all the integer solutions of some other Lebesgue-Ramanujan-Nagell type equations. Our method uses the classical results of Bilu, Hanrot and Voutier on existence of primitive divisors of Lehmer sequences in combination with number theoretic arguments and computer search.</description>

      <title>Iwasawa invariants of modular forms with $a_p=0$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05748v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix a prime $p$ and a cuspidal newform $f$ of level coprime to $p$ with $a_p=0$. Attached to $f$ are signed $p$-adic $L$-functions $L_p^\pm(f)$ and Mazur-Tate elements $\theta_n(f)$, both of which encode arithmetic data about $f$ along the cyclotomic $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extension of $\mathbf{Q}$. We compute the Iwasawa invariants of Mazur-Tate elements in terms of the corresponding invariants of the signed $p$-adic $L$-functions. As corollaries, we determine the $p$-adic valuation of critical values of the $L$-function of $f$, and describe a relation between the Iwasawa invariants of congruent modular forms of weights 2 and $p+1$. Our results provide an asymptotic method for computing the signed Iwasawa invariants attached to newforms of any weight $k\geq 2$ with $a_p=0$.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a finite set of positive integers and $y\geq 1$. We give an effective lower bound of the cardinality of the set $\{n\in\mathcal{A};\,p|n\Longrightarrow p\leq y\}$ under the condition of a good knowledge of the level of distribution of the set $\mathcal{A}$. Some consequences are studied: an application to the friable values of irreducible polynomials or binary forms with integer coefficients, and an application to shifted friable numbers.</description>

      <title>The Batyrev-Manin conjecture for DM stacks II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new framework for studying the distribution of rational points on DM stacks of positive characteristic. Our primary focus is on wild stacks, which existing frameworks do not address. There was not even a satisfactory notion of heights for such stacks. First, we introduce a new kind of height function that extends the authors' idea from their preceding paper on characteristic-zero stacks. This new height function is more general and flexible than the previous one. Examples of the new height function include discriminants of torsors, minimal discriminants, and conductors of elliptic curves in characteristic three. Next, we formulate a generalization of the Batyrev-Manin conjecture for rational points of DM stacks in positive characteristic relative to this new type of height function. We provide several pieces of evidence for this generalization.</description>

      <title>Density combinatorics theorems in fractal dimension theory of continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build a bridge from density combinatorics to dimension theory of continued fractions. We establish a fractal transference principle that transfers common properties of subsets of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density to properties of subsets of irrationals in $(0,1)$ for which the set $\{a_n(x)\colon n\in\mathbb N\}$ of partial quotients induces an injection $n\in\mathbb N\mapsto a_n(x)\in\mathbb N$. Let $(*)$ be a certain property that holds for any subset of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density. The principle asserts that for any subset $S$ of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density, there exists a set $E_S$ of Hausdorff dimension $1/2$ such that the set $\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N}\bigcap_{x\in E_S}\{a_n(x)\}\cap S$ has the same upper density as that of $S$, and thus inherits property $(*)$. Examples of $(*)$ include the existence of arithmetic progressions of arbitrary lengths and the existence of arbitrary polynomial progressions, known as Szemer\'edi's and Bergelson-Leibman's theorems respectively. In the same spirit, we establish a relativized version of the principle applicable to the primes, to the primes of the form $y^2+z^2+1$, to the sets given by the Piatetski-Shapiro sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the theta series associated to the quadratic form $Q(\mathbf{x}) := x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2$ with congruence conditions on $x_i$ modulo $2, 3, 4$, and $6$. By employing special operators on modular, non-holomorphic Eisenstein series of weight $2$, we construct a basis for the Eisenstein space for levels $2^k$ (with $k \le 7$), $3^{\ell}$ (with $\ell \le 3$), and $p$, where $p&gt;3$ is an odd prime. Using the relation between the trace of Frobenius on an elliptic curve and the Fourier coefficients of the cusp-form part of the theta series corresponding to $Q$, we establish a relation between the number of integer solutions to the equation $Q(\mathbf{x}) = p$ and the number of $\mathbb{F}_p$-rational points on the associated elliptic curve under certain congruence conditions on $p$.</description>

Abstract: We prove new results related to the digital reverse $\overleftarrow{n}$ of a positive integer $n$ in a fixed base $b$. First we show that for $b\geq 26000$, there exists infinitely many primes $p$ such that $\overleftarrow{p}$ is square-free. Further, we show that for $b\geq 2$ there are infinitely many palindromes (with $n=\overleftarrow{n}$) that are cube-free. We also give asymptotic expressions for the counting functions corresponding to these results. The main tools we use are recent bounds from the literature on reversed primes and palindromes in arithmetic progressions.</description>

Abstract: Given an integer $ n \geq 2 $, its prime factorization is expressed as $ n = \prod p_i^{a_i} $. We define the function $ f(n) $ as the smallest positive integer satisfying the following condition: \[ \nu_{p}\left(\frac{f(n)!}{n}\right) \geq 0, \quad \forall p \in \{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_s\}, \] where $ \nu_{p}(m) $ denotes the $ p $-adic valuation of $ m $. The main objective of this paper is to derive an asymptotic formula for both sums $ \sum_{n\leq x} f(n) $ and $ \sum_{n \leq x, n \in S_k} f(n) $, where $ S_k $ denotes the set of all $ k $-free integers.</description>

Abstract: Denote by $\pi(x;q,a)$ the number of primes $p\leqslant x$ with $p\equiv a\bmod q.$ We prove new upper bounds for $\pi(x;q,a)$ when $q$ is a large prime very close to $\sqrt{x}$, improving upon the classical work of Iwaniec (1982). The proof reduces to bounding a quintilinear sum of Kloosterman sums, to which we introduce a new shifting argument inspired by Vinogradov--Burgess--Karatsuba, going beyond the classical Fourier-analytic approach thanks to a deep algebro-geometric result of Kowalski--Michel--Sawin on sums of products of Kloosterman sums.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A calculation was performed to verify Proth-Gilbraith's conjecture for all prime numbers up to 0$^{14}$. The previous calculation was performed by Andrew Odlyzko in 1993 up to 0$^{13}$. This involves calculating the differences between consecutive primes in absolute value and starting over. The conjecture states that all lines except the first begin with 1. To prove it, it suffices to find a line beginning with 1 and followed only by 0 and 2.</description>

      <title>On the decimal digits of $1/p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07873v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime $\equiv 3$ mod 4, $p&gt;3$, and suppose that 10 has the order $(p-1)/2$ mod p. Then $1/p$ has a decimal period of length $(p-1)/2$. We express the frequency of each digit $0,\ldots,9$ in this period in terms of the class numbers of two imaginary quadratic number fields. We also exhibit certain analogues of this result, so for the case that 10 is a primitive root mod $p$ and for octal digits of $1/p$.</description>

      <title>Explicit surjectivity of Galois representations of products of elliptic curves over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an explicit surjectivity result for products of non-isotrivial, non-isogenous elliptic curves over a function field of arbitrary characteristic. This is by way of an isogeny degree bound in this setting, generated from bounds for elliptic curves by Griffon--Pazuki, and techniques originated by Serre and Masser--W\"{u}stholz in the number field setting. We apply our result to prove that most members of a family of products of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with no extra endomorphisms have no exceptional primes above a specified constant which depends neither on the elliptic curve factors nor on the dimension of the product.</description>

      <title>Non-admissible irreducible representations of $p$-adic $\mathrm{GL}_{n}$ in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07281v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p&gt;3$ and $F$ be a non-archimedean local field with residue field a proper finite extension of $\mathbb{F}_p$. We construct smooth absolutely irreducible non-admissible representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(F)$ defined over the residue field of $F$ extending the earlier results of the authors for $F$ unramified over $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$. This construction uses the theory of diagrams of Breuil and Paskunas. By parabolic induction, we obtain smooth absolutely irreducible non-admissible representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ for $n&gt;2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explain a derived version of the basic construction of localisations of module categories by means of idempotent ideals, which lie at the heart of Faltings' almost ring theory. We use it to provide an example of a commutative algebra in positive characteristic whose Frobenius endomorphism does not induce an isomorphism on its smashing spectrum.</description>

      <title>The rationality problem for multinorm one tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rationality problem for multinorm one tori, a natural generalization of norm one tori. For multinorm one tori that split over finite Galois extensions with nilpotent Galois group, we prove that stable rationality and retract rationality are equivalent, and give a criterion for the validity of the above two conditions. This generalizes the result of Endo (2011) on the rationality problem for norm one tori. To accomplish it, we introduce a generalization of character groups of multinorm one tori. Moreover, we establish systematic reduction methods originating in work of Endo (2001) for an investigation of the rationality problem for arbitrary multinorm one tori. In addition, we provide a new example for which the multinorm principle holds.</description>

      <title>Permutation--invariant Niven numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces permutation-invariant Niven numbers--a novel class of Niven numbers where all digit permutations (with leading zeros automatically ignored) must retain the Niven property. We demonstrate that there exist infinitely many such numbers and that their magnitude is unbounded. Furthermore, we present an exhaustive search method for identifying permutation--invariant Niven numbers.</description>

      <title>From small eigenvalues to large cuts, and Chowla's cosine problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every graph with average degree $d$ and smallest adjacency eigenvalue $|\lambda_n|\leq d^{\gamma}$ contains a clique of size $d^{1-O(\gamma)}$. A simple corollary of this yields the first polynomial bound for Chowla's cosine problem (1965): for every finite set $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}$, the minimum of the cosine polynomial satisfies $$\min_{x\in [0, 2\pi]}\sum_{a\in A}\cos(ax)\leq -|A|^{1/10-o(1)}.$$
  Another application makes significant progress on the problem of MaxCut in $H$-free graphs initiated by Erd\H{o}s and Lov\'asz in the 1970's. We show that every $m$-edge graph with no clique of size $m^{1/2-\delta}$ has a cut of size at least $m/2+m^{1/2+\varepsilon}$ for some $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(\delta)&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>An inverse and a stability result for Ruzsa's inequality on triple sumsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ruzsa's inequality states that $|A+A+A| \leq |A+A|^{3/2}$ for any finite set $A$ in a commutative group. Ruzsa has constructed examples showing that this inequality is sharp asymptotically, up to a constant factor. We prove an inverse result which says that if $|A+A+A| \geq \frac{1}{M} |A+A|^{3/2}$ for some parameter $M,$ then the set $A$ resembles the sets in Ruzsa's construction. We then construct more families of examples which suggest that our inverse result is likely best possible qualitatively. The method extends to give an inverse result for a higher sumset analogue of Ruzsa's inequality, namely $|(h+1)A| \leq |hA|^{\frac{h+1}{h}}$ for any $h\geq 2.$ We also provide a "99%-stability" version of Ruzsa's inequality, which describes near optimal structures when $M$ is very close to $1.$</description>
