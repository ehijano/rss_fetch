      <title>Integrating network pharmacology, metabolomics, and gut microbiota analysis to explore the effects of Jinhong tablets on chronic superficial gastritis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic superficial gastritis (CSG) severely affects quality of life and can progress to worse gastric pathologies. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) effectively treats CSG, as exemplified by Jinhong Tablets (JHT) with known anti-inflammatory properties, though their mechanism remains unclear. This study integrated network pharmacology, untargeted metabolomics, and gut microbiota analyses to investigate how JHT alleviates CSG. A rat CSG model was established and evaluated via H&amp;E staining. We identified JHT's target profiles and constructed a multi-layer biomolecular network. Differential metabolites in plasma were determined by untargeted metabolomics, and gut microbiota diversity/composition in fecal and cecal samples was assessed via 16S rRNA sequencing. JHT markedly reduced gastric inflammation. Network pharmacology highlighted metabolic pathways, particularly lipid and nitric oxide metabolism, as essential to JHT's therapeutic effect. Metabolomics identified key differential metabolites including betaine (enhancing gut microbiota), phospholipids, and citrulline (indicating severity of CSG). Pathway enrichment supported the gut microbiota's involvement. Further microbiota analysis showed that JHT increased betaine abundance, improved short-chain fatty acid production, and elevated Faecalibaculum and Bifidobacterium, thereby alleviating gastric inflammation. In conclusion, JHT alleviates CSG via diverse metabolic processes, especially lipid and energy metabolism, and influences metabolites like betaine alongside gut microbes such as Faecalibaculum and Bifidobacterium. These findings underscore JHT's therapeutic potential and deepen our understanding of TCM's role in CSG management.</description>

      <title>Exact first passage time distribution for nonlinear chemical reaction networks II: monomolecular reactions and a A + B - C type of second-order reaction with arbitrary initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In biochemical reaction networks, the first passage time (FPT) of a reaction quantifies the time it takes for the reaction to first occur, from the initial state. While the mean FPT historically served as a summary metric, a far more comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of the network is contained within the complete FPT distribution. The relatively uncommon theoretical treatments of the FPT distribution that have been given in the past have been confined to linear systems, with zero and first-order processes. Recently, we presented theoretically exact solutions for the FPT distribution, within nonlinear systems involving two-particle collisions, such as A+B - C. Although this research yielded invaluable results, it was based upon the assumption of initial conditions in the form of a Poisson distribution. This somewhat restricts its relevance to real-world biochemical systems, which frequently display intricate behaviour and initial conditions that are non-Poisson in nature. Our current study extends prior analyses to accommodate arbitrary initial conditions, thereby expanding the applicability of our theoretical framework and providing a more adaptable tool for capturing the dynamics of biochemical reaction networks.</description>
