      <title>Evacuation of rectangular standard Young tableaux corresponds to reflection of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ webs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web graphs form a family of planar directed graphs with boundary that can be used to model quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_n$-invariant vectors. Standard Young tableaux on an $n \times k$ rectangle naturally index a basis for $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ web graphs. We prove that evacuation of the tableau $T$ corresponds to reflection of the associated web graph $w_T$ up to equivalence under a specific set of edge-flip relations. This extends a result of Patrias and Pechenik for the cases $n=2,3$ and mirrors analogous results about rotation of web graphs corresponding to promotion of tableau by Peterson-Pylyavskyy-Rhoades for $n=3$ and Gaetz-Pechenik-Pfannerer-Striker-Swanson for $n=4$. We use an intermediate object called a multicolored noncrossing matching, which is closely related to the notion of strandings recently introduced by Russell and the fourth author.</description>

Abstract: We explain how to define the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) correspondence in terms of local transformations called "toggles." (This note, which is not intended for publication and which is based on presentations of Alex Postnikov, was written in 2014 and has been circulating since then. We are finally posting it to the arXiv for preservation purposes.)</description>

      <title>EKR-Type Theorems for Pendant Graph Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado (EKR) theorem characterizes the maximum size of intersecting families of $r$-element subsets of an $n$-element set. We study EKR-type questions for independent $r$-sets in \emph{pendant} graph constructions, obtained by attaching to each base vertex a clique of prescribed size.
  Our contributions are threefold. We give an alternate and purely combinatorial proof (via shifting and shadows) that the pendant complete graph $K_n^{*}$ is $r$-EKR for $n \ge 2r$, and strictly so for $n&gt;2r$, recovering a result of De Silva, Dionne, Dunkelberg, and Harris. We extend this to \emph{generalized pendant complete graphs}, where every base vertex in the clique supports a clique of arbitrary size, proving that that generalized pendant complete graphs are $r$-EKR whenever $n \ge 2r$. For pendant paths $P_n^{*}$, we provide elementary constructions showing that $P_n^{*}$ is not $(n-k)$-EKR when $n \ge 3k+2$ for $k\ge 2$, not $(n-1)$-EKR for $n\ge 6$, and not $n$-EKR for $n\ge 4$. These results fit naturally into the Holroyd--Talbot perspective relating $r$-EKR thresholds to independence parameters and supply tools for further pendant constructions.</description>

      <title>Manhattan and Chebyshev flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate multidimensional nowhere-zero flows of bridgeless graphs. By extending the established use of the Euclidean norm, this paper considers the Manhattan and Chebyshev norms, leading to the definition of the flow numbers $\Phi_d^1(G)$ and $\Phi_d^\infty(G)$, respectively. These flow numbers are always rational and in two dimensions, they distinguish between cubic graphs that are 3-edge-colourable and those that are not. We also prove that, for any bridgeless graph $G$, the two values $\Phi^1_2(G)$ and $\Phi^\infty_2(G)$ are the same. We give new upper and lower bounds and structural results, and we find connections with cycle covers. Finally, we introduce the idea of $t$-flow-pairs, which comes from a method used in Seymour's proof of the 6-flow theorem, and we propose new conjectures that could be stronger than Tutte's famous 5-flow conjecture.</description>

      <title>Talagrand-Type Correlation Inequalities for Supermodular and Submodular Functions on the Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Talagrand initiated a quantitative program by lower-bounding the correlation of any two increasing Boolean functions in terms of their influences, thereby capturing how strongly the functions depend on the exact coordinates. We strengthen this line of results by proving Talagrand-type correlation lower bounds that hold whenever the increasing functions additionally satisfy super/submodularity. In particular, under super/submodularity, we establish the ``dream inequality'' $$\mathbb{E}[fg]-\mathbb{E}[f]\mathbb{E}[g]\ge \frac{1}{4}\cdot\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\mathrm{Inf}_i[f]\mathrm{Inf}_i[g].$$ Thereby confirming a conjectural direction suggested by Kalai--Keller--Mossel. Our results also clarify the connection to the antipodal strengthening considered by Friedgut, Kahn, Kalai, and Keller, who showed that a famous Chv\'atal's conjecture is equivalent to a certain reinforcement of Talagrand-type correlation inequality when one function is antipodal. Thus, our inequality verifies the Friedgut--Kahn--Kalai--Keller conjectural bound in this structured regime (super/submodular). Our approach uses two complementary methods: (1) a semigroup proof based on a new heat-semigroup representation via second-order discrete derivatives, and (2) an induction proof that avoids semigroup argument entirely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elucidate a bijection between ribbon graphs on the real projective plane and non-crossing annular pairings that relate to the $1/N$ correction term of the GOE and LOE spectral moments. We also derive analogous objects for the $1/N^2$ correction terms of said moments and their equivalents for the GUE and LUE.</description>

      <title>The Parity-Constrained Four-Peg Tower of Hanoi Problem and Its Associated Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new four-peg variant of the Tower of Hanoi problem under parity constraints. Two pegs are neutral and allow arbitrary disc placements, while the remaining two pegs are restricted to discs of a prescribed parity: one for even-labelled discs and the other for odd-labelled discs. Within this constrained setting, we investigate four canonical optimization objectives according to distinct target configurations and derive for each the exact number of moves required to optimally transfer the discs. We establish a coupled system of recursive relations governing the four optimal move functions and unfold them into higher-order recurrences and explicit closed forms. These formulas exhibit periodic growth patterns and reveal that all solutions grow exponentially, but at a significantly slower rate than the classical three-peg case. In particular, each optimal move sequence has an a half-exponential-like asymptotic order induced by the parity restriction. In addition, we define the associated parity-constrained Hanoi graph, whose vertices represent all feasible states and whose edges represent legal moves. We determine its order, degrees, connectivity, planarity, diameter, Hamiltonicity, clique number, and chromatic properties, and show that it lies strictly between the classical three- and four-peg Hanoi graphs via the inclusion relation.</description>

      <title>Partitions of complete twisted graphs into plane spanning trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize all partitions of the complete twisted graph $T_{2n}$ into plane spanning trees. In the case of partitions of $T_{2n}$ into isomorphic plane spanning trees, we show that all trees in these partitions must be balanced double stars. As a consequence of our results, any complete topological graph with $n$ vertices contains a complete topological subgraph with $m \geq c\log^{1/8} n$ vertices that admits a partition into plane spanning trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce two $t$-analogues $I_n(q,t)$ and $\widetilde{I}_n(q,t)$ of the tree inversion enumerator $I_n(q)$. Although similar, $I_n(q,t)$ and $\widetilde{I}_n(q,t)$ are different. But they both seem to have interesting properties. In particular, we conjecture that their $q=-1$ specializations give two different, natural refinements of the zigzag numbers counting alternating permutations.</description>

      <title>Efficient k-mer Dataset Compression Using Eulerian Covers of de Bruijn Graphs and BWT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transforming an input sequence into its constituent k-mers is a fundamental operation in computational genomics. To reduce storage costs associated with k-mer datasets, we introduce and formally analyze MCTR, a novel two-stage algorithm for lossless compression of the k-mer multiset. Our core method achieves a minimal text representation (W) by computing an optimal Eulerian cover (minimum string count) of the dataset's de Bruijn graph, enabled by an efficient local Eulerization technique. The resulting strings are then further compressed losslessly using the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT).
  Leveraging de Bruijn graph properties, MCTR is proven to achieve linear time and space complexity and guarantees complete reconstruction of the original k-mer multiset, including frequencies.
  Using simulated and real genomic data, we evaluated MCTR's performance (list and frequency representations) against the state-of-the-art lossy unitigging tool greedytigs (from matchtigs). We measured core execution time and the raw compression ratio cmpr = weight(M)/weight(W), where M is the input sequence data). Benchmarks confirmed MCTR's data fidelity but revealed performance trade-offs inherent to lossless representation. GreedyTigs was significantly faster. Regarding raw compression, GreedyTigs achieved high ratios (cmpr approx 14) on noisy real data for its lossy sequence output. On real data, MCTR (frequency) showed moderate raw compression (cmpr approx 1.5-2.7), while MCTR (list) showed none (cmpr approx 1). Importantly, the full MCTR+BWT pipeline significantly outperforms BWT alone for enhanced lossless compression. Our results establish MCTR as a valuable, theoretically grounded tool for applications demanding efficient, lossless storage and analysis of k-mer multisets, complementing lossy methods optimized for sequence summarization.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Polyominoes up to Size N=59</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports the results of numerical computations for determining the number of polyominoes of size n (n-ominoes). We verify the existing counts for n &lt;= 50 and newly compute the total number of polyominoes up to n &lt;= 59, extending the counting limit. This work shows that, in addition to optimizing the search algorithm for the polyomino counting problem, multi-threading dramatically improves computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Pinned patterns and density theorems in $\mathbb R^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For integers $k\geq 3,d\geq 2,$ we consider the abundance property of pinned $k$-point patterns occurring in $E\subseteq \mathbb R^d$ with positive upper density $\delta(E)$. We show that for any fixed $k$-point pattern $V$, there is a set $E$ with positive upper density such that $E$ avoids all sufficiently large affine copies of $V$, with one vertex fixed at any point in $E$. However, we obtain a positive quantitative result, which states that for any fixed $E$ with positive upper density, there exists a $k$-point pattern $V,$ such that for any $x\in E$, the pinned scaling factor set
  \begin{equation*}
  D_x^V(E):=\{r&gt; 0: \exists \text{ isometry } O \text{ such that }x+r\cdot O(V)\subseteq E\},
  \end{equation*}
  has upper density $\geq \tilde \varepsilon&gt;0$, where constant $\tilde \varepsilon$ depends on $k,d$ and $\delta(E)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the homotopy type and combinatorial properties of total cut complexes of squared cycle graphs. The total cut complexes are a new type of graphical complexes introduced by Bayer et al.(2024) to extend Fr\"oberg's theorem. In Bayer et al.[Topology of cut complexes of graphs, SIAM J. on Discrete Math. 38(2): 1630--1675 (2024)], the authors made a conjecture on the homotopy type of total cut complexes of squared cycle graphs for $k \geq 3$. We proved this conjecture in the case when $k=3$ . For general $k\geq 3$, we confirmed the cases when $n =3k+1$ and $3k+2$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, the following problem is addressed. Given an integer n&gt;=1. Suppose, a simple polygon is a union of n triangles. What is the maximal number of sides it can have? This is a sequence A375986, a recent entry into the OEIS. It starts as 3, 12, 22, and most likely continues as 33, 44, 55, 67, 79. We give upper and lower bounds for this sequence and present evidence showing that needed configurations are quite delicate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For given graphs $G_1, \ldots, G_k$, let $\tilde{r}(G_1, \ldots, G_k)$ denote their online Ramsey number. In an influential paper on the online Ramsey numbers for paths and cycles, Cyman, Dzido, Lapinskas, and Lo (Electron. J. Combin., 2015) determined the exact values of $\tilde{r}(P_3, P_{\ell})$ and $\tilde{r}(P_3, C_{\ell})$. They also conjectured the exact value of $\tilde{r}(P_4, P_{\ell})$ and the limit of $\tilde{r}(P_k, P_{\ell})/\ell$ as $\ell \to \infty$ for $k \ge 5$. The former conjecture was independently confirmed by Bednarska-Bzd\c{e}ga (European J. Combin., 2024) and Y.B. Zhang and Y.X. Zhang (arXiv:2302.13640), while the latter was disproved by Mond and Portier (European J. Combin., 2024). In this paper, we extend this line of research to the three-color setting and establish the exact value of $\tilde{r}(P_3,P_3,P_{\ell})$ for $\ell\ge 2$ and $\tilde{r}(P_3, P_3, C_{\ell})$ for $\ell \ge 16$.</description>

      <title>Monotonically Decreasing the Number of Directed 3-Cycles via Edge-Flips?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a combinatorial reconfiguration problem on oriented graphs, where a reconfiguration step (edge-flip) is the inversion of the orientation of a single edge. A recently published conjecture that is relevant to the correctness of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler for directed flag complexes states that any simple oriented graph admits a flip sequence that monotonically decreases the number of directed 3-cycles to zero, and is known to be true for complete oriented graphs.
  We show that, in general, this conjecture does not hold. As main tool for disproving the conjecture, we introduce the concept of FBD-graphs (fully blocked digraphs). An FBD-graph is a directed graph that does not contain any directed 1-, 2-, or 3-cycles, and for which any edge-flip creates a directed 3-cycle. We prove that the non-existence of FBD-graphs is a necessary condition for the conjecture to hold and succeed in constructing FBD-graphs. On the other hand, we show that complete graphs, as well as graphs in which every edge is incident to at most two triangles, cannot be fully blocked. In addition to being relevant for determining in which cases the above mentioned sampling process is correct, the concept of FBD-graphs might also be useful for other problems and yields interesting questions for further study.</description>

      <title>Games as recursive coalgebras: A categorical view on the Nim-sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1901, Bouton proved that a winning strategy of the game of Nim is given by the bitwise XOR, called the nim-sum. But, why does such a weird binary operation work? Led by this question, this paper introduces a categorical reinterpretation of combinatorial games and the nim-sum. The main categorical gadget used here is recursive coalgebras, which allow us to redefine games as ``graphs on which we can conduct recursive calculation'' in a concise and precise way.
  For game-theorists, we provide a systematic framework to decompose an impartial game into simpler games and synthesize the quantities on them, which generalizes the nim-sum rule for the Conway addition. To read the first half of this paper, the categorical preliminaries are limited to the definitions of categories and functors.
  For category theorists, this paper offers a nicely behaved category of games $\mathbf{Games}$, which is a locally finitely presentable symmetric monoidal closed category comonadic over $\mathbf{Set}$ admitting a subobject classifier!
  As this paper has several ways to be developed, we list seven open questions in the final section.</description>

      <title>Possible Sizes of Sumsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nathanson introduced the range of cardinalities of $h$-fold sumsets $R(h,k) := \{|hA|:A \subset \mathbb{Z} \text{ and }|A| = k\}.$ Following a remark of Erd\H{o}s and Szemer\'edi that determined the form of $R(h,k)$ when $h=2$, Nathanson asked what the form of $R(h,k)$ is for arbitrary $h, k \in \mathbb{N}$. For $h \in \mathbb{N}$, we prove there is some constant $k_h \in \mathbb{N}$ such that if $k &gt; k_h$, then $R(h,k)$ is the entire interval $\left[hk-h+1,\binom{h+k-1}{h}\right]$ except for a specified set of $\binom{h-1}{2}$ numbers. Moreover, we show that one can take $k_3 = 2$.</description>

      <title>A skew group ring of $\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ over $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, Leonard triples and odd graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a skew group ring of $\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ over $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ to construct modules over the universal Bannai--Ito algebra. In addition, we give the conditions under which the defining generators act as Leonard triples on the resulting modules. As a combinatorial realization, we establish an algebra homomorphism from the universal Bannai--Ito algebra onto the Terwilliger algebra of an odd graph. This homomorphism provides a unified description of Leonard triples on all irreducible modules over the Terwilliger algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work follows the spirit of Andrews' series of papers on Partition Analysis. In $2011$, Savage and Sills found new sum sides for the little G\"ollnitz identities and provided their partition interpretations. It turns out that similar companions exist for a mod $8$ partition identity due to Andrews. In this work, we use MacMahon's Partition Analysis to study partitions related to these identities. We find refined generating functions for them, where we keep track of the size of each part. Finally, by considering the alternating sum and Schmidt weight, we show the application of these refined functions in the study of partition statistics.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we give a geometric model for non-homogeneous tubes of the cluster category of the affine type $D$. This model is given in terms of homotopy classes of unoriented arcs in the twice punctured disk. In particular, we extend the geometric model for the tube of rank $n-2$ given in arXiv:2407.11232 to the two tubes of rank $2$.</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonian Bicirculants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bicirculant is a regular graph that admits a semi-regular automorphism with two vertex-orbits of the same size. By $m$ we denote the size of vertex-orbits and by $d$ the valence of a bicirculant. Furthermore, we denote by $s$ the valence of the bipartite graph joining the two vertex-orbits. In 1983, Brian Alspach proved that the only non-hamiltonian generalized Petersen graphs are $G(m,2)$ with $m \equiv 5 \pmod 6$. In a recent paper we conjectured that this is the only exception among regular, connected bicirculants of degree $d &gt; 1$ and we have verified the conjecture for the quartic bicirculants with $s=2$, also known as the generalized rose window graphs.
  In this paper we develop tools and apply them for a partial verification of the conjecture. We show that the conjecture holds for all bicirculants with $s \leq 2$. As a consequence we obtain that every connected bicirculant with $s \ge 3$ is hamiltonian if $m$ is a product of at most three prime powers. In particular, every connected bicirculant with $s \ge 3$ is hamiltonian for even $m&lt;210$ and odd $m &lt; 1155$. Our results imply that many other families of bicirculants are hamiltonian. For example, all bicirculants with $d-s$ odd are hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>The complete classification of triply-transitive strongly regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper completes the classification of triply-transitive strongly regular graphs, a program recently initiated by Herman, Maleki, and Razafimahatratra. By proving that the collinearity graph of the polar space $\mathcal{Q}^{-}(5,q)$ and the affine polar graph $\mathrm{VO}^{\varepsilon}_{2m}(2)$ are triply-transitive, we resolve the final open cases in the classification. The result is a definitive list of all strongly regular graphs that exhibit this exceptional form of local symmetry, characterized by the equality $T_{0,\omega}=T_{\omega}=\widetilde{T}_{\omega}$ of their Terwilliger algebras.</description>

      <title>On Hyperbolic Sombor index of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hyperbolic Sombor index $HSO(G)$ of a graph $G$ is defined as \begin{align*} HSO(G) = \sum_{v_iv_j \in E(G)} \frac{\sqrt{d_i^{2}+d_j^{2}}}{\min\{d_i,d_j\}}, \end{align*} where $d_i$ and $d_j$ denote the degrees of the vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$, respectively. This index was recently introduced by Barman et al. [Geometric approach to degree-based topological index: Hyperbolic Sombor index, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 95 (2026) 63-94], who explored some of its mathematical properties and applications. However, their work contains several inaccuracies that require correction. In this paper, we first identify and rectify the errors found in the earlier study. We then extend the investigation by establishing new mathematical results for the Hyperbolic Sombor index across various classes of graphs, including trees, unicyclic graphs, and bicyclic graphs. In addition, we derive some lower and upper bounds for $HSO(G)$ in terms of the number of edges, maximum degree and minimum degree, and we characterize the graphs that attain these bounds. Finally, we conclude the paper by outlining potential directions for future research in this emerging area.</description>

      <title>On generalized inverses of matrices associated with certain graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate generalized inverses of matrices associated with two classes of digraphs: double star digraphs and D-linked stars digraphs. For double star digraphs, we determine the Drazin index and derive explicit formulas for the Drazin inverse. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the Moore-Penrose inverse and give its explicit expression whenever it exists. For D-linked stars digraphs, we characterize when the group inverse exists and obtain its explicit form. In the singular case where BC = 0, we express the Drazin index of the matrix in terms of the Drazin index of the base digraph matrix. Additionally, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for Moore--Penrose invertibility and derive explicit formulas in that case. Our results reveal a clear connection between the algebraic structure of generalized inverses and the combinatorial properties of these graph classes, providing a unified framework for group, Drazin, and Moore-Penrose invertibility.</description>

Abstract: Adapting Reiher's proof of Kemnitz's conjecture, we obtain two refinements of a theorem of Schmid and Zhuang. Our main results provide improved upper bounds for the Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv constant of rank-two-like $p$-groups, and their direct products with cyclic groups of order coprime to $p$. In particular, we determine the exact value of this constant, and also confirm a conjecture of Gao, for a new infinite family of groups of arbitrarily large rank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we prove an Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres type result for words with repeats. Specifically, we show that every word with $kn^6+1$ repeats contains one of the following patterns: $0^{k+2}$, $0011\cdots nn$, $nn\cdots1100$, $012 \cdots n012 \cdots n$, $012 \cdots nn\cdots 210$, $n\cdots 210012\cdots n$, $n\cdots 210n\cdots 210$. Moreover, when $k=1$, we show that this is best possible by constructing a word with $n^6$ repeats that does not contain any of these patterns.</description>

In this paper, we study the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of factorial association schemes.

      <description>arXiv:2510.21753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a concise historical background to Montmort's matching problem and its modern variants such as the hat-check problem, then develop a unified counting framework for fixed-point-free allocations. Using elementary recurrence and inclusion-exclusion arguments, we derive closed forms for derangements, rectangular injections, and partial l-matchings, and we combine them into a single formula. We also provide exact counts for the number of fixed points and Poisson limit laws. This note thus offers a compact, self-contained synthesis linking classical results with their two principal generalizations in a single scheme.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Tree-like Multigraphs with a Given Number of Vertices, Self-loops and Multiple Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counting non-isomorphic tree-like multigraphs that include self-loops and multiple edges is an important problem in combinatorial enumeration, with applications in chemical graph theory, polymer science, and network modeling. Traditional counting techniques, such as Polya's theorem and branching algorithms, often face limitations due to symmetry handling and computational complexity. This study presents a unified dynamic programming framework for enumerating tree-like graphs characterized by a fixed number of vertices, self-loops, and multiple edges. The proposed method utilizes canonical rooted representations and recursive decomposition of subgraphs to eliminate redundant configurations, ensuring exact counting without the need for explicit structure generation. The framework also provides analytical bounds and recurrence relations that describe the growth behaviour of such multigraphs. This work extends previous models that treated self-loops and multiple edges separately, offering a general theoretical foundation for the enumeration of complex tree-like multigraphs in both mathematical and chemical domains.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the package MacaulayPosets written for the computational algebra system Macaulay2. This package utilized the poset data type introduced in the Posets package and offers functionality for studying the Macaulay property for posets, particularly those which arise as monomial posets of commutative rings. A Macaulay poset is characterized by a ranked structure and a total order that interacts harmoniously with the partial order, enabling the establishment of bounds on the sizes of subsets of a given rank within an order ideal.</description>

      <title>Type II success runs of Bernoulli trials separated by a gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We treat success runs of independent identically distributed Bernoulli trials (with success parameter $p$) distributed according to the Type II binomial distribution of order $k$. However, the success runs are separated by a gap $g\ge1$ (a failure followed by $g-1$ arbitrary outcomes). Most of the literature treats the case $g=1$ only. Our main results are expressions for the probability mass function (we present two derivations) and the distribution of the longest success run. We also present more concise expressions for previously published results for the factorial moments. Finally, we present results for the mean, variance, probability mass function and factorial moments for $\textrm{NB}_{\rm II}(k,g,r)$, the Type II negative binomial distribution of order $k$, where the number of success runs $r$ is fixed and the number of trials $n$ is variable.</description>

      <title>On Conjectures concerning the Labeled Coupon Collector Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a labeled variant of the classical Coupon Collector Problem (CCP), recently introduced by Tan et al., where coupons arrive in groups and only the set of labels is revealed. The goal is to determine the expected number of group drawings required to uniquely identify the labeling of all coupons. We focus on the case where groups consist of pairs ($k=2$), and provide rigorous proofs for two conjectures posed by Tan et al.</description>

      <title>Expected Length of the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree and 1-norms of Chromatic Persistence Diagrams in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $c$ be the constant such that the expected length of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of $n$ random points in the unit square is $c \sqrt{n}$ in the limit, when $n$ goes to infinity. We improve the prior best lower bound of $0.6008 \leq c$ by Avram and Bertsimas to $0.6289 \leq c$. The proof is a by-product of studying the persistent homology of randomly $2$-colored point sets. Specifically, we consider the filtration induced by the inclusions of the two mono-chromatic sublevel sets of the Euclidean distance function into the bi-chromatic sublevel set of that function. Assigning colors randomly, and with equal probability, we show that the expected $1$-norm of each chromatic persistence diagram is a constant times $\sqrt{n}$ in the limit, and we determine the constant in terms of $c$ and another constant, $c_L$, which arises for a novel type of Euclidean minimum spanning tree of $2$-colored point sets.</description>

      <title>On the Martin boundary for discrete TASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a problem with three equivalent formulations: describing Gibbs measures for five-vertex model in quadrant; classifying coherent systems on a p-deformation of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph related to Grothendieck polynomials; finding the Martin boundary for discrete time TASEP with p-geometric jumps. We find a wide family of the Gibbs measures, parameterized by certain analytic functions. A subset of our measures have probabilistic interpretation as interacting particle systems with fixed particles speeds. In contrast to previous related boundary problems, we find that admissible speeds are not arbitrary, but must be larger than $\frac{p}{1-p}$. For this subset we further establish Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem, connecting the fluctuations to families of independent GUE eigenvalues. As a consequence, the measures from the subset are extreme points of the Martin boundary. It remains open whether our list of measures is exhaustive.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of discrete $N$-particle systems at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second paper in a series studying the global asymptotics of discrete $N$-particle systems with inverse temperature parameter $\theta$ in the high temperature regime. In the first paper, we established necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers at high temperature in terms of Jack generating functions. In this paper, we derive a functional equation for the moment generating function of the limiting measure, which enables its analysis using analytic tools. We apply this functional equation to compute the densities of the high temperature limits of the pure Jack measures. As a special case, we obtain the high temperature limit of the large fixed-time distribution of the discrete-space $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion of Gorin-Shkolnikov. Two special cases of our densities are the high temperature limits of discrete versions of the G$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Guionnet in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 (2012), 094102; arXiv:1205.3598], and L$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Majumdar-Vivo in [J. Phys. A, vol. 46, no. 1 (2013), 015001; arXiv:1209.6171]. Moreover, we prove the following crystallization phenomenon of the particles in the high temperature limit: the limiting measures are uniformly supported on disjoint intervals with unit gaps and their locations correspond to the zeros of explicit special functions with all roots located in the real line. We also show that these zeros correspond to the spectra of certain unbounded Jacobi operators.</description>

Abstract: We show a variation of the usual homological freeness criterion for operadic modules over a Koszul operad. We then apply this result to decorated partition posets for some operads, showing that their augmentation is Cohen-Macaulay and computing its homology.

      <title>Whirling injections, surjections, and other functions between finite sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.02411v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a certain action called "whirling" that can be defined on any family of functions between two finite sets equipped with a linear (or cyclic) ordering. Many maps of interest in dynamical algebraic combinatorics, such as rowmotion of order ideals, can be represented as a composition of "toggling" involutions, each of which modifies its object only locally. Similarly whirling is made up of locally-acting whirling maps which directly generalize toggles, but cycle through more than two possible outputs. In this first paper on whirling, we consider it as a map on subfamilies of functions between finite sets.
  For whirling acting on the set of injections or the set of surjections, we prove that within each whirling orbit, any two elements of the codomain appear as outputs of functions the same number of times. This result can be stated in terms of the homomesy phenomenon, which occurs when a statistic has the same average across every orbit. We further explore homomesy results and conjectures for whirling on restricted-growth words, which correspond to set partitions. These results extend the collection of combinatorial objects for which we have interesting dynamics and homomesy, and open the door to considering whirling in other contexts.</description>

      <title>Intersection theorems for families of matchings of complete $k$-partite $k$-graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:1811.07481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated {Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado} Theorem states that for $n \geq 2k$ a family $\mathscr{F}$ of $k$ subsets of $[n]$ for which each pair of members of $\mathscr{F}$ have a non-empty intersection has size at most $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ and for $n &gt;2k$ has exactly this size if and only if it is the family of all $k$-subsets of $[n]$ containing a fixed element $x\in [n]$. Since its discovery, the {Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado} Theorem has be generalised extensively and many variants have been found for structures other than sets. One such variant is for permutations and so-called generalised permutations. These structures are equivalent to $r$-matchings of the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,m}$ with $r \leq \min\{n,m\}$ in a natural way.
  The culmination of results of several groups of authors constitute an {Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado} Theorem for families of generalised permutations and so for families of $r$-matchings of $K_{n,m}$ for all feasible values of $r,n$ and $m$. In this paper we generalise this by proving an {Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado} Theorem for families of $r$-matchings of complete $k$-partite $k$-graphs, which can be seen as a partial generalisation of the {Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado} Theorem itself. We also prove similar results for $t$-intersecting families, and for families of matchings whose members have sizes from some set of integers $R$, rather than a single size $r$.</description>

      <title>Reduced bandwidth: a qualitative strengthening of twin-width in minor-closed classes (and beyond)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.11858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a reduction sequence of a graph, vertices are successively identified until the graph has one vertex. At each step, when identifying $u$ and $v$, each edge incident to exactly one of $u$ and $v$ is coloured red. Bonnet, Kim, Thomass\'e and Watrigant [J. ACM 2022] defined the twin-width of a graph $G$ to be the minimum integer $k$ such that there is a reduction sequence of $G$ in which every red graph has maximum degree at most $k$. For any graph parameter $f$, we define the reduced $f$ of a graph $G$ to be the minimum integer $k$ such that there is a reduction sequence of $G$ in which every red graph has $f$ at most $k$. Our focus is on graph classes with bounded reduced bandwidth, which implies and is stronger than bounded twin-width (reduced maximum degree). We show that every proper minor-closed class has bounded reduced bandwidth, which is qualitatively stronger than an analogous result of Bonnet et al.\ for bounded twin-width. In many instances, we also make quantitative improvements. For example, all previous upper bounds on the twin-width of planar graphs were at least $2^{1000}$. We show that planar graphs have reduced bandwidth at most $466$ and twin-width at most $583$. Our bounds for graphs of Euler genus $\gamma$ are $O(\gamma)$. Lastly, we show that fixed powers of graphs in a proper minor-closed class have bounded reduced bandwidth (irrespective of the degree of the vertices). In particular, we show that map graphs of Euler genus $\gamma$ have reduced bandwidth $O(\gamma^4)$. Lastly, we separate twin-width and reduced bandwidth by showing that any infinite class of expanders excluding a fixed complete bipartite subgraph has unbounded reduced bandwidth, while there are bounded-degree expanders with twin-width at most 6.</description>

Abstract: Graph packing problem is one of the central problems in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. The famous Steiner tree packing problem in undirected graphs has become an well-established area. It is natural to extend this problem to digraphs, and such problems in digraphs are called directed Steiner type packing problems.
  In this survey we overview known results on several directed Steiner type packing problems. The paper is divided into seven sections: introduction, directed Steiner tree packing problem, directed Steiner path packing problem, directed pendant Steiner tree packing problem, strong subgraph packing problem, strong arc decomposition problem, directed Steiner cycle packing problem. This survey also contains some conjectures and open problems for further study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite point set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is in general position if no $d + 1$ points lie on a common hyperplane. Let $\alpha_d(N)$ be the largest integer such that any set of $N$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with no $d + 2$ members on a common hyperplane, contains a subset of size $\alpha_d(N)$ in general position. Using the method of hypergraph containers, Balogh and Solymosi showed that $\alpha_2(N) &lt; N^{5/6 + o(1)}$. In this paper, we also use the container method to obtain new upper bounds for $\alpha_d(N)$ when $d \geq 3$. More precisely, we show that if $d$ is odd, then $\alpha_d(N) &lt; N^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2d} + o(1)}$, and if $d$ is even, we have $\alpha_d(N) &lt; N^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{d-1} + o(1)}$. We also study the classical problem of determining $a(d,k,n)$, the maximum number of points selected from the grid $[n]^d$ such that no $k + 2$ members lie on a $k$-flat, and improve the previously best known bound for $a(d,k,n)$, due to Lefmann in 2008, by a polynomial factor when $k$ = 2 or 3 (mod 4).</description>

Explicit point counts are given in some special cases where we find new interpretations of sequences in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). We compare and contrast the theory of totally nonnegative Grassmannians over a finite field with the traditional case of the field of real numbers.</description>

      <title>Semirigidity and the enumeration of nilpotent semigroups of index three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is strong evidence for the belief that `almost all' finite semigroups, whether we consider multiplication operations on a fixed set or their isomorphism classes, are nilpotent of index 3 (3-nilpotent for short). The only known method for counting all semigroups of given order is exhaustive testing, but formulae exist for the numbers of 3-nilpotent ones, and it is also known that `almost all' of these are rigid (have only trivial automorphism).
  Here we express the number of distinct 3-nilpotent semigroup operations on a fixed set of cardinality $n$ as a sum of Stirling numbers, and provide a new expression for the number of isomorphism classes of 3-nilpotent semigroups of cardinality $n$. We introduce a notion of semirigidity for semigroups (as a generalization of rigidity) and find computationally tractable formulae giving an upper bound for the number of pairwise non-isomorphic semirigid 3-nilpotent semigroups, and thus an improved lower bound for the number of all 3-nilpotent semigroups up to isomorphism. Analogous formulae are also developed for isomorphism classes such as commutative and self-dual semigroups, and for equivalence classes (isomorphic or anti-isomorphic). The method relies on an application of the theory of orbit counting in permutation group actions. Our main results are accompanied by tables containing values of these numbers and bounds up to $n=10$ with computations carried out in GAP (but perfectly feasible well beyond this value of $n$).</description>

Abstract: The rank (also known as protection number or leaf-height) of a vertex in a rooted tree is the minimum distance between the vertex and any of its leaf descendants. We consider the sum of ranks over all vertices (known as the security) in binary trees, and produce a classification of families of binary trees for which the security is maximized. In addition, extremal results relating to maximum rank among all vertices in families of trees is discussed.</description>

Abstract: The complete bipartite graph $K_{1,3}$ is called a claw. The properties of claw-free graphs have attracted considerable attention, with research on claw-free planar graphs tracing back to Plummer's work in 1989. In this paper, we extend this line of research by establishing some fundamental results for claw-free 1-planar graphs, focusing on upper bounds for maximum degree and vertex-connectivity. We show that the maximum degree of claw-free 1-planar graphs is at most 10, and the bound is sharp. Furthermore, we show that for 6-connected 1-planar graphs and optimal 1-planar graphs under the constraint of forbidding induced claws, the maximum degree has the better upper bound 8. Finally, we show that every 7-connected 1-planar graph contains an induced claw, thereby implying that the vertex-connectivity of claw-free 1-planar graphs is at most 6. For a better comparison, we also refine some known results by Plummer on claw-free planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Statistics on monotonically ordered non-crossing partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study some combinatorial statistics defined on the set $NC^{(mton)}(n)$ of monotonically ordered non-crossing partitions of {1,...,n}, and on the set $NC_2^{(mton)}(2n)$ of monotonically ordered non-crossing pair-partitions of {1,...,2n}. Unlike in the analogous results known for unordered non-crossing partitions, the computations of expectations and variances for natural block-counting statistics on $NC^{(mton)}(n)$ and for the expectation of the area statistic on $NC_2^{(mton)}(2n)$ turn out to yield a logarithmic regime. An important role in our study is played by a nice tree structure on the disjoint union of the $NC^{(mton)}(n)$'s, which we use to streamline our arguments. As an illustration of how these ideas can be applied to calculations of cumulants in monotone probability, we discuss some combinatorial aspects of the monotonic Poisson process.</description>

      <title>Levelable graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of positive weighted well-covered graphs, which we call levelable graphs, that are related to a construction of level artinian rings in commutative algebra. A graph $G$ is levelable if there exists a weight function with positive integer values on the vertices of $G$ such that $G$ is well-covered with respect to this weight function. That is, the sum of the weights in any maximal independent set of vertices of $G$ is the same. We describe some of the basic properties of levelable graphs and classify the levelable graphs for some families of graphs, e.g., trees, cubic circulants, Cameron--Walker graphs. We also explain the connection between levelable graphs and a class of level artinian rings. Applying a result of Brown and Nowakowski about weighted well-covered graphs, we show that for most graphs, their edge ideals are not Cohen--Macaulay.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Sets for Proving Bounds on Rado Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a linear equation $\cal E$ of the form $ax + by = cz$ where $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive integers, the $k$-colour Rado number $R_k({\cal E})$ is the smallest positive integer $n$, if it exists, such that every $k$-colouring of the positive integers $\{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}$ contains a monochromatic solution to $\cal E$. In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$. No computer algebra system that we are aware of currently has sufficiently capable support for symbolic sets, leading us to develop a tool supporting symbolic sets using the Python symbolic computation library SymPy coupled with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver Z3.</description>

      <title>Inverse eigenvalue problem for discrete Schr\"odinger operators of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A discrete Schr\"odinger operator of a graph $G$ is a real symmetric matrix whose $i,j$-entry, $i \neq j$, is negative if $\{i,j\}$ is an edge and zero if it is not an edge, while diagonal entries can be any real numbers. The discrete Schr\"odinger operators have been used to study vibration theory and the Colin de Verdi\`ere parameter. The inverse eigenvalue problem for discrete Schr\"odinger operators of a graph aims to characterize the possible spectra among discrete Schr\"odinger operators of a graph. Compared to the inverse eigenvalue problem of a graph, the answers turn out to be more limited, and several restrictions based on graph structure are given. Using the strong properties, analogous versions of the supergraph lemma, the liberation lemma, and the bifurcation lemma are established. Using these results, the inverse eigenvalue problem for discrete Schr\"odinger operators is resolved for each graph with at most $5$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Complete polyhedral description of chemical graphs of maximum degree at most 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical graphs are simple undirected connected graphs, where vertices represent atoms in a molecule and edges represent chemical bonds. A degree-based topological index is a molecular descriptor used to study specific physicochemical properties of molecules. Such an index is computed from the sum of the weights of the edges of a chemical graph, each edge having a weight defined by a formula that depends only on the degrees of its endpoints. Given any degree-based topological index and given two integers $n$ and $m$, we are interested in determining chemical graphs of order $n$ and size $m$ that maximize or minimize the index. Focusing on chemical graphs with maximum degree at most 3, we show that this reduces to determining the extreme points of a polytope that contains at most 10 facets. We also show that the number of extreme points is at most 16, which means that for any given $n$ and $m$, there are very few different classes of extremal graphs, independently of the chosen degree-based topological index.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For integer $n$, the $n$-iterated line graph $L^n(G)$ of an undirected graph $G$ is defined to be $L(L^{n-1}(G))$, where $L^1(G)$ is the line graph $L(G)$ of $G$. In this paper we introduce hamiltonian path index. Hamiltonian path index, denoted by $h_p(G)$, is the minimum number $n$ such that $L^n(G)$ contains a hamiltonian path. We show that hamiltonian path index of $G$ exists for any graph $G$ and we set the exact value of hamiltonian path index for trees and discuss the problem about graphs with hamiltonian 2-connected blocks.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces permutation-invariant Niven numbers--a novel class of Niven numbers where all digit permutations (with leading zeros automatically ignored) must retain the Niven property. We demonstrate that there exist infinitely many such numbers and that their magnitude is unbounded. Furthermore, we present an exhaustive search method for identifying permutation--invariant Niven numbers.</description>

      <title>From small eigenvalues to large cuts, and Chowla's cosine problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every graph with average degree $d$ and smallest adjacency eigenvalue $|\lambda_n|\leq d^{\gamma}$ contains a clique of size $d^{1-O(\gamma)}$. A simple corollary of this yields the first polynomial bound for Chowla's cosine problem (1965): for every finite set $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}$, the minimum of the cosine polynomial satisfies $$\min_{x\in [0, 2\pi]}\sum_{a\in A}\cos(ax)\leq -|A|^{1/10-o(1)}.$$
  Another application makes significant progress on the problem of MaxCut in $H$-free graphs initiated by Erd\H{o}s and Lov\'asz in the 1970's. We show that every $m$-edge graph with no clique of size $m^{1/2-\delta}$ has a cut of size at least $m/2+m^{1/2+\varepsilon}$ for some $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(\delta)&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Completely (Quasi-)Uniform Nested Boolean Steiner Quadruple Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nested Steiner quadruple systems are designs derived from Steiner quadruple systems (SQSs) by partitioning each block into pairs. A nested SQS is completely uniform if every possible pair appears with equal multiplicity, and completely quasi-uniform if every pair appears with multiplicities that differ by at most one. An explicit construction on the Boolean SQS of order $2^m$ is presented, producing for each integer $m \ge 3$ a nested SQS$(2^m)$ that is completely uniform when $m$ is odd and completely quasi-uniform when $m$ is even. These results resolve two open problems posed by Chee et al.~(2025).
  The notion of completely uniform pairings is further generalized for $t$-designs with $t \ge 2$. As an application, completely uniform nested $2$-$(2^m,4,3)$ designs give rise to fractional repetition codes with zero skip cost, requiring fewer storage nodes than constructions based on SQSs. In addition, small examples are provided for non-Boolean orders, establishing the existence of completely uniform nested SQS$(v)$ for all $v \le 50$.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Latin Squares of Order Ten with Two Relations: A SAT Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $k$-net($n$) is a combinatorial design equivalent to $k-2$ mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order $n$. A relation in a net is a linear dependency over $\mathbb{F}_2$ in the incidence matrix of the net. A computational enumeration of all orthogonal pairs of Latin squares of order 10 whose corresponding nets have at least two nontrivial relations was achieved by Delisle in 2010 and verified by an independent search of Myrvold. In this paper, we confirm the correctness of their exhaustive enumerations with a satisfiability (SAT) solver approach instead of using custom-written backtracking code. Performing the enumeration using a SAT solver has at least three advantages. First, it reduces the amount of trust necessary, as SAT solvers produce independently-verifiable certificates that their enumerations are complete. These certificates can be checked by formal proof verifiers that are relatively simple pieces of software, and therefore easier to trust. Second, it is typically more straightforward and less error-prone to use a SAT solver over writing search code. Third, it can be more efficient to use a SAT-based approach, as SAT solvers are highly optimized pieces of software incorporating backtracking-with-learning for improving the efficiency of the backtracking search. For example, the SAT solver completely enumerates all orthogonal pairs of Latin squares of order ten with two nontrivial relations in under 2 hours on a desktop machine, while Delisle's 2010 search used 11,700 CPU hours. Although computer hardware was slower in 2010, this alone cannot explain the improvement in the efficiency of our SAT-based search.</description>

Abstract: We construct a left-compressed family F(n, k, G) generated by a collection of generating sets G, and identify conditions on G under which F(n, k, G) is an intersecting family. From this, we obtain a convenient method to construct left-compressed intersecting families. After that, we provide some comparisons between the theorem of Bond and our result. Finally, we present some results on the generators of a maximal left-compressed intersecting family.</description>

      <title>A Variant of Wythoff's Game Defined by Hofstadter's G-Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a variant of the classical Wythoff's game. The classical form is played with two piles of stones, from which two players take turns to remove stones from one or both piles. When removing stones from both piles, an equal number must be removed from each. The player who removes the last stone or stones is the winner. Equivalently, we consider a single chess queen placed somewhere on a large grid of squares. Each player can move the queen toward the upper-left corner of the grid, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, in any number of steps. The winner is the player who moves the queen into the upper-left corner, the position (0,0) in our coordinate system. We call (0,0) the terminal position of Wythoff's game. In our variant of Wythoff's game, we have a set of positions {(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1),(2,0),(0,2)} as the terminal set. If a player moves the queen into this terminal set, that player is the winner of the game. The P-positions of this variant are described by the P-positions of Wythoff's game and
  Hofstadter's G-Sequence. This variant has two remarkable properties. For a position (x,y) with x &gt;= 8 or y &gt;= 8, the Grundy number of the position (x,y) is 1 in this variant if and only if (x,y) is a P-position of Wythoff's game. There is another remarkable property.For a position (x,y) with x &gt;= 8 or y &gt;= 8, (x,y) is a P-position of of the misere version of this variant if and only if (x,y) is a P-position of of Wythoff's game.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pathbreaking article \cite{LED16}, an integral representation of the derivatives of entropy along the heat flow of a probability measure was established under suitable moment conditions. These integral representations have found significant applications in diverse domains - notably in information theory (e.g., entropy power inequalities, monotonicity of Fisher information) and in estimation theory (through the link between entropy derivatives and the minimum mean square error, MMSE, in Gaussian channels). The representations involve multivariate polynomials $(R_n)_n$, arising from a Lie algebra framework on multilinear operators. Despite their central role, the combinatorial structure of these polynomials remains only partially understood. In this note, we prove that the number of monomials in $R_n$ coincides with the number of degree sequences with degree sum $2n$ having a non-separable graph realization, thereby resolving a conjecture from \cite{MPS24}, and drawing an interesting link between these two domains.</description>

      <title>An inverse and a stability result for Ruzsa's inequality on triple sumsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ruzsa's inequality states that $|A+A+A| \leq |A+A|^{3/2}$ for any finite set $A$ in a commutative group. Ruzsa has constructed examples showing that this inequality is sharp asymptotically, up to a constant factor. We prove an inverse result which says that if $|A+A+A| \geq \frac{1}{M} |A+A|^{3/2}$ for some parameter $M,$ then the set $A$ resembles the sets in Ruzsa's construction. We then construct more families of examples which suggest that our inverse result is likely best possible qualitatively. The method extends to give an inverse result for a higher sumset analogue of Ruzsa's inequality, namely $|(h+1)A| \leq |hA|^{\frac{h+1}{h}}$ for any $h\geq 2.$ We also provide a "99%-stability" version of Ruzsa's inequality, which describes near optimal structures when $M$ is very close to $1.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that any function $f$ from a finite set $Y$ to itself can be represented linearly. Specifically, we prove the existence of an injective map $j$ from $Y$ into a modular ring $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ and a constant $a \in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ such that the relation $j(f(y)) = a \cdot j(y)$ in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ holds for all $y \in Y$. This result is established by analyzing the algebraic properties of the adjugate of the characteristic matrix associated with the function's digraph. The proof is constructive, providing a method for finding the embedding $j$, the modulus $m$, and the linear multiplier $a$.</description>

      <title>Lattice and Non-lattice Piercing of Axis-Parallel Rectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a family ${\mathcal F}$ of shapes in the plane, we study what is the lowest possible density of a point set $P$ that pierces (``intersects'', ``hits'') all translates of each shape in ${\mathcal F}$. For instance, if ${\mathcal F}$ consists of two axis-parallel rectangles the best known piercing set, i.e., one with the lowest density, is a lattice.
  Given a finite family ${\mathcal F}$ of axis-parallel rectangles, we present an algorithm for finding an optimal ${\mathcal F}$-piercing lattice. The algorithm runs in time polynomial in the number of rectangles and the maximum aspect ratio of the rectangles in the family. No prior algorithms for this problem were known.
  On the other hand, we show that for every $n \geq 3$, there exists a family of $n$ axis-parallel rectangles for which the best piercing density achieved by a lattice is separated by a positive (constant) gap from the optimal piercing density for the respective family. Finally, we show that the best lattice can be sometimes worse by $20\%$ than the optimal piercing set.</description>

      <title>A Miyaoka-Yau inequality for hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{CP}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a hyperplane arrangement in $\mathbb{CP}^n$. We define a quadratic form $Q$ on $\mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{H}}$ that is entirely determined by the intersection poset of $\mathcal{H}$. Using the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for parabolic bundles, we show that if $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{H}}$ is such that the weighted arrangement $(\mathcal{H}, \mathbf{a})$ is stable, then $Q(\mathbf{a}) \leq 0$.
  As an application, we consider the symmetric case where all the weights are equal. The inequality $Q(a, \ldots, a) \leq 0$ gives a lower bound for the total sum of multiplicities of codimension $2$ intersection subspaces of $\mathcal{H}$. The lower bound is attained when every $H \in \mathcal{H}$ intersects all the other members of $\mathcal{H} \setminus \{H\}$ along $(1-2/(n+1))|\mathcal{H}| + 1$ codimension $2$ subspaces; extending from $n=2$ to higher dimensions a condition found by Hirzebruch for line arrangements in the complex projective plane.</description>

      <title>Graph Powers of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lights Out Puzzle, played on a graph $\Gamma$, has been studied using linear algebra over $\mathbb{F}_2$ and more generally over $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$. We generalize the setting by allowing the states of vertices to be the elements of a group $G$, where a \textit{click} in vertex $v$ multiplies the state of $v$ and its neighbors by an element $g \in G$ on the right.
  Starting with the identity element $e \in G$ for all vertices, the totality of all achievable state configurations forms a group $G^{\Gamma}$. This group generalizes parallel products of group actions and provides a rich structure for analysis. For many graphs, which we term ``RA'' (reducible to abelian), the problem reduces -- regardless of $G$ -- to a linear algebra question over $\mathbb{Z}$. We discuss a chain of five different subgroups consisting of commutators and introduce techniques for showing that families of graphs are RA using each. In particular, using Heisenberg groups, we establish that a graph is RA precisely when a certain lattice spans $\mathbb{Z}^{|\Gamma|}$. While most graphs appear to be RA, we show the odd-dimensional cube graphs $Q_{2n+1}$ and folded cube graphs $\square_d$, for $d$ odd or 2, are not.</description>

      <title>On the Global Optimality of Fibonacci Lattices in the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use linear programming bounds to analyze point sets in the torus with respect to their optimality for problems in discrepancy theory and quasi-Monte Carlo methods. These concepts will be unified by introducing tensor product energies.
  We show that the canonical $3$-point lattice in any dimension is globally optimal among all $3$-point sets in the torus with respect to a large class of such energies. This is a new instance of universal optimality, a special phenomenon that is only known for a small class of highly structured point sets.
  In the case of $d=2$ dimensions it is conjectured that so-called Fibonacci lattices should also be optimal with respect to a large class of potentials. To this end we show that the $5$-point Fibonacci lattice is globally optimal for a continuously parametrized class of potentials relevant to the analysis fo the quasi-Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>Chern Classes of Toric Variety Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we resolve a conjecture of Khovanskii--Monin on the Chern classes of toric variety bundles. The main result is a formula for the total Chern class of the tangent bundle of a toric variety bundle in terms of the total Chern class of the base and the total Chern class of the toric fibre. The result serves as a simultaneous generalization of the description of the total Chern class of a projectivized vector bundle and of the formula for the total Chern class of a toric variety in terms of the Chern classes of the toric divisors. We also establish a topological version of this statement for stably complex quasitoric manifolds. As an immediate application, we obtain a formula for the total Chern class of a toroidal horospherical variety in terms of the Chern classes of the generalized flag variety and the total Chern class of the toric fibre, as well as a new proof of Masuda's formula for equivariant Chern classes. This paper is written with a view towards finding polytopal models for various numeric invariants of spherical varieties.</description>

      <title>Elementary differentials from multi-indices to rooted trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rooted trees are essential for describing numerical schemes via the so-called B-series. They have also been used extensively in rough analysis for expanding solutions of singular Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). When one considers scalar-valued equations, the most efficient combinatorial set is multi-indices. In this paper, we investigate the existence of intermediate combinatorial sets that will lie between multi-indices and rooted trees. We provide a negative result stating that there is no combinatorial set encoding elementary differentials in dimension $d\neq 1$, and compatible with the rooted trees and the multi-indices aside from the rooted trees. This does not close the debate of the existence of such combinatorial sets, but it shows that it cannot be obtained via a naive and natural approach.</description>

      <title>Matrix Points on Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of $C_n(X)$, the moduli space of commuting $n$-by-$n$ matrices satisfying the equations defining a variety $X$. This space can be viewed as a non-commutative Weil restriction from the algebra of $n$-by-$n$ matrices to the ground field. We introduce a ``Fermionic" counterpart $S_n(X)$, constructed as a convolution $X^n \times^{S_n} \mathrm{GL}_n/\mathrm{T}_n$. Our main result establishes that a natural map $\sigma \colon S_n(X) \to C_n(X)$ induces an isomorphism on $\ell$-adic cohomology under mild conditions on $X$ or the characteristic of the field. This confirms a heuristic derived from the classical theory of Weil restrictions and highlights a version of Boson-Fermion correspondence. Furthermore, we derive explicit combinatorial formulae for the Betti numbers of $C_n(X)$ and a Macdonald-type generating series. Finally we prove a Hermitian variant of our main result.</description>
