      <title>Towards a Bayesian mechanics of metacognitive particles: A commentary on "Path integrals, particular kinds, and strange things" by Friston, Da Costa, Sakthivadivel, Heins, Pavliotis, Ramstead, and Parr</title>

Abstract: What could metacognition look like in simple physical terms? We define metacognition as having beliefs about beliefs, which can be articulated very simply using the language of statistical physics and Bayesian mechanics. We introduce a typology between cognitive and metacognitive particles and develop an example of a metacognitive particle. This can be generalized to provide examples of higher forms of metacognition: i.e. particles having beliefs about beliefs about beliefs and so forth. We conclude by saying that the typology of particles laid down in the target article seems promising, for seemingly enabling a physics of cognition that builds upon and refines the free energy principle, toward a physical description of entities that specifically possess higher forms of cognition.</description>

      <title>Phase autoencoder for limit-cycle oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phase autoencoder that encodes the asymptotic phase of a limit-cycle oscillator, a fundamental quantity characterizing its synchronization dynamics. This autoencoder is trained in such a way that its latent variables directly represent the asymptotic phase of the oscillator. The trained autoencoder can perform two functions without relying on the mathematical model of the oscillator: first, it can evaluate the asymptotic phase and phase sensitivity function of the oscillator; second, it can reconstruct the oscillator state on the limit cycle in the original space from the phase value as an input. Using several examples of limit-cycle oscillators, we demonstrate that the asymptotic phase and phase sensitivity function can be estimated only from time-series data by the trained autoencoder. We also present a simple method for globally synchronizing two oscillators as an application of the trained autoencoder.</description>

      <title>Vibrational resonance: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, vibrational resonance has garnered significant interest and evolved into a prominent research field. Classical vibrational resonance examines the response of a nonlinear system excited by two signals: a weak, slowly varying characteristic signal, and a fast-varying auxiliary signal. The characteristic signal operates on a much longer time scale than the auxiliary signal. Through the cooperation of the nonlinear system and these two excitations, the faint input can be substantially amplified, showcasing the constructive role of the fast-varying signal. Since its inception, vibrational resonance has been extensively studied across various disciplines, including physics, mathematics, biology, neuroscience, laser science, chemistry, and engineering. Here, we delve into a detailed discussion of vibrational resonance and the most recent advances, beginning with an introduction to characteristic signals commonly used in its study. Furthermore, we compile numerous nonlinear models where vibrational resonance has been observed to enhance readers' understanding and provide a basis for comparison. Subsequently, we present the metrics used to quantify vibrational resonance, as well as offer a theoretical formulation. This encompasses the method of direct separation of motions, linear and nonlinear vibrational resonance, re-scaled vibrational resonance, ultrasensitive vibrational resonance, and the role of noise in vibrational resonance. Later, we showcase two practical applications of vibrational resonance: one in image processing and the other in fault diagnosis. This presentation offers a comprehensive and versatile overview of vibrational resonance, exploring various facets and highlighting promising avenues for future research in both theory and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring simplicity bias in 1D dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arguments inspired by algorithmic information theory predict an inverse relation between the probability and complexity of output patterns in a wide range of input-output maps. This phenomenon is known as \emph{simplicity bias}. By viewing the parameters of dynamical systems as inputs, and resulting (digitised) trajectories as outputs, we study simplicity bias in the logistic map, Gauss map, sine map, Bernoulli map, and tent map. We find that the logistic map, Gauss map, and sine map all exhibit simplicity bias upon sampling of map initial values and parameter values, but the Bernoulli map and tent map do not. The simplicity bias upper bound on output pattern probability is used to make \emph{a priori} predictions for the probability of output patterns. In some cases, the predictions are surprisingly accurate, given that almost no details of the underlying dynamical systems are assumed. More generally, we argue that studying probability-complexity relationships may be a useful tool in studying patterns in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Repetitive Infection Spreading and Directed Evolution in the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two simple mathematical models of the epidemic. At first, we study the repetitive infection spreading in a simplified SIRS model including the effect of the decay of the acquired immune. The model is an intermediate model of the SIRS model including the recruitment and death terms and the SIR model in which the recovered population is assumed to be never infected again. When the decay rate \delta of the immune is sufficiently small, the multiple infection spreading occurs in spikes. The model equation can be reduced to be a map when the decay rate \delta is sufficiently small, and the spike-like multiple infection spreading is reproduced in the mapping. The period-doubling bifurcation and chaos are found in the simplified SIRS model with seasonal variation. The nonlinear phenomena are reproduced by the map. Next, we study coupled SIRS equations for the directed evolution where the mutation is expressed with a diffusion-type term. A kind of reaction-diffusion equation is derived by the continuum approximation for the infected population I. The reaction-diffusion equation with the linear dependence of infection rate on the type space has an exact Gaussian solution with a time-dependent average and variance. The propagation of the Gaussian pulse corresponds to the successive transitions of the dominant variant.</description>

      <title>Persistence and Doubling of Chaotic Attractors in Coupled 3-Cell Hopfield Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two novel phenomena for unidirectionally coupled 3-cell Hopfield neural networks (HNNs) are investigated. The first one is the persistence of chaos, which means the permanency of sensitivity and infinitely many unstable periodic oscillations in the response HNN even if the networks are not synchronized in the generalized sense. Doubling of chaotic attractors is the second phenomenon realized in this study. It can be achieved when the response network possesses two stable point attractors in the absence of the driving. This feature leads to the formation of two coexisting chaotic attractors with disjoint basins. Lyapunov functions are utilized to deduce the presence of an invariant region, and the sensitivity is rigorously proved. The absence of synchronization is approved via the auxiliary system approach and analysis of conditional Lyapunov exponents. Additionally, quadruple and octuple coexisting chaotic attractors are demonstrated, and the formation of hyperchaos is discussed.</description>

      <title>Universal bounds on optimization of free energy harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04975v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harvesting free energy from the environment is essential for the operation of many biological and artificial systems. We investigate the maximum rate of harvesting achievable by optimizing a set of reactions in a Markovian system, possibly given topological, kinetic, and thermodynamic constraints. We show that the maximum harvesting rate can be expressed as a variational principle, which we solve in closed-form for three physically meaningful regimes. Our approach is relevant for optimal design and for quantifying efficiency of existing reactions. Our results are illustrated on bacteriorhodopsin, a light-driven proton pump from Archae, which is found to be close to optimal under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Effects of heterogeneous opinion interactions in many-agent systems for epidemic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we define a kinetic model for understanding the impact of heterogeneous opinion formation dynamics on epidemics. The considered many-agent system is characterized by nonsymmetric interactions which define a coupled system of kinetic equations for the evolution of the opinion density in each compartment. In the quasi-invariant limit we may show positivity and uniqueness of the solution of the problem together with its convergence towards an equilibrium distribution exhibiting bimodal shape. The tendency of the system towards opinion clusters is further analyzed by means of numerical methods, which confirm the consistency of the kinetic model with its moment system whose evolution is approximated in several regimes of parameters.</description>
