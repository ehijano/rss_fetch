      <title>DynamicSound simulator for simulating moving sources and microphone arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing algorithms for sound classification, detection, and localization requires large amounts of flexible and realistic audio data, especially when leveraging modern machine learning and beamforming techniques. However, most existing acoustic simulators are tailored for indoor environments and are limited to static sound sources, making them unsuitable for scenarios involving moving sources, moving microphones, or long-distance propagation. This paper presents DynamicSound an open-source acoustic simulation framework for generating multichannel audio from one or more sound sources with the possibility to move them continuously in three-dimensional space and recorded by arbitrarily configured microphone arrays. The proposed model explicitly accounts for finite sound propagation delays, Doppler effects, distance-dependent attenuation, air absorption, and first-order reflections from planar surfaces, yielding temporally consistent spatial audio signals. Unlike conventional mono or stereo simulators, the proposed system synthesizes audio for an arbitrary number of virtual microphones, accurately reproducing inter-microphone time delays, level differences, and spectral coloration induced by the environment. Comparative evaluations with existing open-source tools demonstrate that the generated signals preserve high spatial fidelity across varying source positions and acoustic conditions. By enabling the generation of realistic multichannel audio under controlled and repeatable conditions, the proposed open framework provides a flexible and reproducible tool for the development, training, and evaluation of modern spatial audio and sound-source localization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multichannel Active Noise Control with Asynchronous Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed multichannel active noise control (DMCANC) offers effective noise reduction across large spatial areas by distributing the computational load of centralized control to multiple low-cost nodes. Conventional DMCANC methods, however, typically assume synchronous communication and require frequent data exchange, resulting in high communication overhead. To enhance efficiency and adaptability, this work proposes an asynchronous communication strategy where each node executes a weight-constrained filtered-x LMS (WCFxLMS) algorithm and independently requests communication only when its local noise reduction performance degrades. Upon request, other nodes transmit the weight difference between their local control filter and the center point in WCFxLMS, which are then integrated to update both the control filter and the center point. This design enables nodes to operate asynchronously while preserving cooperative behavior. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed asynchronous communication DMCANC (ACDMCANC) system maintains effective noise reduction with significantly reduced communication load, offering improved scalability for heterogeneous networks.</description>

      <title>A Stabilized Hybrid Active Noise Control Algorithm of GFANC and FxNLMS with Online Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Filtered-x Normalized Least Mean Square (FxNLMS) algorithm suffers from slow convergence and a risk of divergence, although it can achieve low steady-state errors after sufficient adaptation. In contrast, the Generative Fixed-Filter Active Noise Control (GFANC) method offers fast response speed, but its lack of adaptability may lead to large steady-state errors. This paper proposes a hybrid GFANC-FxNLMS algorithm to leverage the complementary advantages of both approaches. In the hybrid GFANC-FxNLMS algorithm, GFANC provides a frame-level control filter as an initialization for FxNLMS, while FxNLMS performs continuous adaptation at the sampling rate. Small variations in the GFANC-generated filter may repeatedly reinitialize FxNLMS, interrupting its adaptation process and destabilizing the system. An online clustering module is introduced to avoid unnecessary re-initializations and improve system stability. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves fast response, very low steady-state error, and high stability, requiring only one pre-trained broadband filter.</description>

      <title>Timbre-Aware LLM-based Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation Extendable to Multiple Language Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) has gained increasing attention for its ability to translate speech from one language to another, while reducing error propagation and latency inherent in traditional cascaded pipelines. However, existing direct S2ST systems continue to face notable challenges, including instability in semantic-acoustic alignment when parallel speech data is scarce, difficulty in preserving speaker identity, and limited multilingual scalability. In this work, we introduce DS2ST-LM, a scalable, single-stage direct S2ST framework leveraging a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM). The architecture integrates a Whisper speech encoder, a learnable projection module, a Qwen2-0.5B LLM, and a timbre-controlled vocoder. We construct GigaS2S-1000, a 1000-hour bilingual corpus by extending the GigaST dataset with high-fidelity synthetic target speech, and show that this synthetic data alleviates data scarcity to some extent. We investigate two semantic token generation strategies: speech-derived S3 tokens and text-derived tokens generated by a pre-trained LLM, and analyze their impact on training stability and semantic consistency. We further evaluate three projection architectures (Linear, Conv1D-Linear, and Q-Former) and observe that while higher-capacity projectors converge faster, the simple Linear projector achieves higher performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DS2ST-LM outperforms traditional cascaded and ST (Qwen-Audio) + TTS baselines across both lexical (BLEU, METEOR) and semantic (BLEURT, COMET) metrics, while extending to multiple language pairs, including French, Spanish, German, Hindi, Bengali, and Urdu. Furthermore, we incorporate timbre-aware speech synthesis to preserve speaker information, enabling DS2ST-LM to surpass prior direct S2ST systems in both speaker similarity and perceptual naturalness.</description>

      <title>Loose coupling of spectral and spatial models for multi-channel diarization and enhancement of meetings in dynamic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound capture by microphone arrays opens the possibility to exploit spatial, in addition to spectral, information for diarization and signal enhancement, two important tasks in meeting transcription. However, there is no one-to-one mapping of positions in space to speakers if speakers move. Here, we address this by proposing a novel joint spatial and spectral mixture model, whose two submodels are loosely coupled by modeling the relationship between speaker and position index probabilistically. Thus, spatial and spectral information can be jointly exploited, while at the same time allowing for speakers speaking from different positions. Experiments on the LibriCSS data set with simulated speaker position changes show great improvements over tightly coupled subsystems.</description>

      <title>DeepASMR: LLM-Based Zero-Shot ASMR Speech Generation for Anyone of Any Voice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While modern Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems achieve high fidelity for read-style speech, they struggle to generate Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR), a specialized, low-intensity speech style essential for relaxation. The inherent challenges include ASMR's subtle, often unvoiced characteristics and the demand for zero-shot speaker adaptation. In this paper, we introduce DeepASMR, the first framework designed for zero-shot ASMR generation. We demonstrate that a single short snippet of a speaker's ordinary, read-style speech is sufficient to synthesize high-fidelity ASMR in their voice, eliminating the need for whispered training data from the target speaker. Methodologically, we first identify that discrete speech tokens provide a soft factorization of ASMR style from speaker timbre. Leveraging this insight, we propose a two-stage pipeline incorporating a Large Language Model (LLM) for content-style encoding and a flow-matching acoustic decoder for timbre reconstruction. Furthermore, we contribute DeepASMR-DB, a comprehensive 670-hour English-Chinese multi-speaker ASMR speech corpus, and introduce a novel evaluation protocol integrating objective metrics, human listening tests, LLM-based scoring and unvoiced speech analysis. Extensive experiments confirm that DeepASMR achieves state-of-the-art naturalness and style fidelity in ASMR generation for anyone of any voice, while maintaining competitive performance on normal speech synthesis.</description>

      <title>Qwen3-TTS Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report, we present the Qwen3-TTS series, a family of advanced multilingual, controllable, robust, and streaming text-to-speech models. Qwen3-TTS supports state-of-the-art 3-second voice cloning and description-based control, allowing both the creation of entirely novel voices and fine-grained manipulation over the output speech. Trained on over 5 million hours of speech data spanning 10 languages, Qwen3-TTS adopts a dual-track LM architecture for real-time synthesis, coupled with two speech tokenizers: 1) Qwen-TTS-Tokenizer-25Hz is a single-codebook codec emphasizing semantic content, which offers seamlessly integration with Qwen-Audio and enables streaming waveform reconstruction via a block-wise DiT. 2) Qwen-TTS-Tokenizer-12Hz achieves extreme bitrate reduction and ultra-low-latency streaming, enabling immediate first-packet emission ($97\,\mathrm{ms}$) through its 12.5 Hz, 16-layer multi-codebook design and a lightweight causal ConvNet. Extensive experiments indicate state-of-the-art performance across diverse objective and subjective benchmark (e.g., TTS multilingual test set, InstructTTSEval, and our long speech test set). To facilitate community research and development, we release both tokenizers and models under the Apache 2.0 license.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Perception Gap: A Lightweight Coarse-to-Fine Architecture for Edge Audio Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying Audio-Language Models (Audio-LLMs) on edge infrastructure exposes a persistent tension between perception depth and computational efficiency. Lightweight local models tend to produce passive perception - generic summaries that miss the subtle evidence required for multi-step audio reasoning - while indiscriminate cloud offloading incurs unacceptable latency, bandwidth cost, and privacy risk. We propose CoFi-Agent (Tool-Augmented Coarse-to-Fine Agent), a hybrid architecture targeting edge servers and gateways. It performs fast local perception and triggers conditional forensic refinement only when uncertainty is detected. CoFi-Agent runs an initial single-pass on a local 7B Audio-LLM, then a cloud controller gates difficult cases and issues lightweight plans for on-device tools such as temporal re-listening and local ASR. On the MMAR benchmark, CoFi-Agent improves accuracy from 27.20% to 53.60%, while achieving a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off than an always-on investigation pipeline. Overall, CoFi-Agent bridges the perception gap via tool-enabled, conditional edge-cloud collaboration under practical system constraints.</description>

      <title>PF-D2M: A Pose-free Diffusion Model for Universal Dance-to-Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dance-to-music generation aims to generate music that is aligned with dance movements. Existing approaches typically rely on body motion features extracted from a single human dancer and limited dance-to-music datasets, which restrict their performance and applicability to real-world scenarios involving multiple dancers and non-human dancers. In this paper, we propose PF-D2M, a universal diffusion-based dance-to-music generation model that incorporates visual features extracted from dance videos. PF-D2M is trained with a progressive training strategy that effectively addresses data scarcity and generalization challenges. Both objective and subjective evaluations show that PF-D2M achieves state-of-the-art performance in dance-music alignment and music quality.</description>

      <title>MOSA: Mixture of Simple Adapters Outperforms Monolithic Approaches in LLM-based Multilingual ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based ASR overcomes multilingual data scarcity by projecting speech representations into the LLM space to leverage its robust semantic and reasoning capabilities. However, while previous approaches typically enhance performance by scaling data or model parameters, a single projector often struggles to effectively align representations across different languages. In this work, we propose an MoE-based projector named MOSA (Mixture of Simple Adapters). By aggregating multiple simple adapters, this architecture enables different experts to specialize in learning either language-shared or language-specific knowledge. This approach not only mitigates parameter interference between languages but also facilitates positive transfer from high-resource to low-resource languages, effectively alleviating data scarcity issues. Experimental results demonstrate that MOSA-Base achieves a 15.4% relative reduction in average WER compared to the Ideal-LLM Base, consistently outperforming it across all languages. Notably, MOSA achieves a 13.3% WER reduction over the Ideal-LLM Base while utilizing only 60% of its parameters. These findings highlight MOSA's superior parameter efficiency and robustness against data imbalance, suggesting that a mixture of simple adapters is more suitable for multilingual LLM-based ASR than complex single-adapter designs.</description>

      <title>Attentive AV-FusionNet: Audio-Visual Quality Prediction with Hybrid Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning-based audio-visual quality (AVQ) prediction model that leverages internal features from state-of-the-art unimodal predictors. Unlike prior approaches that rely on simple fusion strategies, our model employs a hybrid representation that combines learned Generative Machine Listener (GML) audio features with hand-crafted Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) video features. Attention mechanisms capture cross-modal interactions and intra-modal relationships, yielding context-aware quality representations. A modality relevance estimator quantifies each modality's contribution per content, potentially enabling adaptive bitrate allocation. Experiments demonstrate improved AVQ prediction accuracy and robustness across diverse content types.</description>

      <title>Towards Evaluating Generative Audio: Insights from Neural Audio Codec Embedding Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs (NACs) achieve low-bitrate compression by learning compact audio representations, which can also serve as features for perceptual quality evaluation. We introduce DACe, an enhanced, higher-fidelity version of the Descript Audio Codec (DAC), trained on diverse real and synthetic tonal data with balanced sampling. We systematically compare Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) on MUSHRA tests across speech, music, and mixed content. FAD consistently outperforms MMD, and embeddings from higher-fidelity NACs (such as DACe) show stronger correlations with human judgments. While CLAP LAION Music (CLAP-M) and OpenL3 Mel128 (OpenL3-128M) embeddings achieve higher correlations, NAC embeddings provide a practical zero-shot approach to audio quality assessment, requiring only unencoded audio for training. These results demonstrate the dual utility of NACs for compression and perceptually informed audio evaluation.</description>

      <title>AQA-TTRL: Self-Adaptation in Audio Question Answering with Test-Time Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) demonstrate impressive general audio understanding, but once deployed, they are static and fail to improve with new real-world audio data. As traditional supervised fine-tuning is costly, we introduce a novel framework for test-time audio understanding, AQA-TTRL, where an LALM evolves on-the-fly using only unlabeled test data. It first generates pseudo-labels from the prediction via majority voting, then optimizes the model via reinforcement learning. To handle the inherent noise in these self-generated labels, we introduce a confidence-based weighting method to adjust training signals. Furthermore, a multiple-attempt sampling operation mitigates advantage collapse and stabilizes training. On the MMAU (test-mini/test), MMAR, and MMSU benchmarks, AQA-TTRL achieves significant average improvements of 4.42% for the Qwen2.5-Omni 7B model and 11.04% for the 3B model. Notably, the adapted 3B model consistently outperforms the direct inference of the unadapted 7B model, highlighting the effectiveness of previously unexplored test-time adaptations in audio understanding.</description>

      <title>Quantization-Based Score Calibration for Few-Shot Keyword Spotting with Dynamic Time Warping in Noisy Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting occurrences of keywords with keyword spotting (KWS) systems requires thresholding continuous detection scores. Selecting appropriate thresholds is a non-trivial task, typically relying on optimizing performance on a validation dataset. However, such greedy threshold selection often leads to suboptimal performance on unseen data, particularly in varying or noisy acoustic environments or few-shot settings. In this work, we investigate detection threshold estimation for template-based open-set few-shot KWS using dynamic time warping on noisy speech data. To mitigate the performance degradation caused by suboptimal thresholds, we propose a score calibration approach that operates at the embedding level by quantizing learned representations and applying quantization error-based normalization prior to DTW-based scoring and thresholding. Experiments on KWS-DailyTalk with simulated high frequency radio channels show that the proposed calibration approach simplifies the selection of robust detection thresholds and significantly improves the resulting performance.</description>

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive speech generation by letting a fast draft model propose tokens that a larger target model verifies. However, for speech LLMs that generate acoustic tokens, exact token matching is overly restrictive: many discrete tokens are acoustically or semantically interchangeable, reducing acceptance rates and limiting speedups. We introduce Principled Coarse-Graining (PCG), which verifies proposals at the level of Acoustic Similarity Groups (ASGs) derived from the target model's embedding space. By splitting each token's probability mass across the overlapping groups that contain it, we define an overlap-aware coarse-grained distribution and perform rejection sampling on the resulting group variable. This yields an exactness guarantee at the group level while allowing the accepted draft token to stand in for any member of the group in practice. On LibriTTS, PCG increases acceptance and throughput relative to standard speculative decoding and prior speech-specific relaxations while maintaining intelligibility and speaker similarity. These results suggest acoustically aware, group-level acceptance as a simple and general way to accelerate speech token generation while maintaining speech quality.</description>

      <title>Configurations, Tessellations and Tone Networks</title>

Abstract: The Eulerian tonnetz, which associates three minor chords to each major chord and three major chords to each minor chord, can be represented by a bipartite graph with twelve white vertices denoting major chords and twelve black vertices denoting minor chords. This so-called Levi graph determines a configuration of twelve points and twelve lines in $\mathbb R^2$ with the property that three points lie on each line and three lines pass through each point. Interesting features of the tonnetz, such as the existence of the four hexatonic cycles and the three octatonic cycles, crucial for the understanding of nineteenth-century harmony and voice leading, can be read off directly as properties of this configuration $\{12_3\}$ and its Levi graph. Analogous tone networks together with their Levi graphs and configurations can be constructed for pentatonic music and twelve-tone music. These and other new tonnetze offer the promise of new methods of composition. If the constraints of the Eulerian tonnetz are relaxed so as to allow movements between major and minor triads with variations at exactly two tones, the resulting bipartite graph has two components, each generating a tessellation of the plane, of a type known to Kepler, based on hexagons, squares and dodecagons. When the same combinatorial idea is applied to tetrachords of the 'Tristan' genus (dominant sevenths and half-diminished sevenths) the cycles of the resulting bipartite graph are sufficiently ample in girth to ensure the existence of a second configuration $\{12_3\}$, distinct from the Eulerian tonnetz as an incidence geometry, which can be used for a new approach to the analysis of the rich tetradic harmonies of the nineteenth century common practice.</description>

      <title>MMSU: A Massive Multi-task Spoken Language Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04779</link>

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content), paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics, semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models, highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding, providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ddwang2000/MMSU. Evaluation Code is available at https://github.com/dingdongwang/MMSU_Bench.</description>

      <title>Toward Efficient Speech Emotion Recognition via Spectral Learning and Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) traditionally relies on auditory data analysis for emotion classification. Several studies have adopted different methods for SER. However, existing SER methods often struggle to capture subtle emotional variations and generalize across diverse datasets. In this article, we use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as spectral features to bridge the gap between computational emotion processing and human auditory perception. To further improve robustness and feature diversity, we propose a novel 1D-CNN-based SER framework that integrates data augmentation techniques. MFCC features extracted from the augmented data are processed using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture enhanced with channel and spatial attention mechanisms. These attention modules allow the model to highlight key emotional patterns, enhancing its ability to capture subtle variations in speech signals. The proposed method delivers cutting-edge performance, achieving the accuracy of 97.49% for SAVEE, 99.23% for RAVDESS, 89.31% for CREMA-D, 99.82% for TESS, 99.53% for EMO-DB, and 96.39% for EMOVO. Experimental results show new benchmarks in SER, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in recognizing emotional expressions with high precision. Our evaluation demonstrates that the integration of advanced Deep Learning (DL) methods substantially enhances generalization across diverse datasets, underscoring their potential to advance SER for real-world deployment in assistive technologies and human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>Xi+: Uncertainty Supervision for Robust Speaker Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05993v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are various factors that can influence the performance of speaker recognition systems, such as emotion, language and other speaker-related or context-related variations. Since individual speech frames do not contribute equally to the utterance-level representation, it is essential to estimate the importance or reliability of each frame. The xi-vector model addresses this by assigning different weights to frames based on uncertainty estimation. However, its uncertainty estimation model is implicitly trained through classification loss alone and does not consider the temporal relationships between frames, which may lead to suboptimal supervision. In this paper, we propose an improved architecture, xi+. Compared to xi-vector, xi+ incorporates a temporal attention module to capture frame-level uncertainty in a context-aware manner. In addition, we introduce a novel loss function, Stochastic Variance Loss, which explicitly supervises the learning of uncertainty. Results demonstrate consistent performance improvements of about 10\% on the VoxCeleb1-O set and 11\% on the NIST SRE 2024 evaluation set.</description>

      <title>Behind the Scenes: Mechanistic Interpretability of LoRA-adapted Whisper for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large pre-trained speech models such as Whisper offer strong generalization but pose significant challenges for resource-efficient adaptation. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, yet its underlying mechanisms in speech tasks remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct the first systematic mechanistic interpretability study of LoRA within the Whisper encoder for speech emotion recognition (SER). Using a suite of analytical tools, including layer contribution probing, logit-lens inspection, and representational similarity via singular value decomposition (SVD) and centered kernel alignment (CKA), we reveal two key mechanisms: a delayed specialization process that preserves general features in early layers before consolidating task-specific information, and a forward alignment, backward differentiation dynamic between LoRA's matrices. Our findings clarify how LoRA reshapes encoder hierarchies, providing both empirical insights and a deeper mechanistic understanding for designing efficient and interpretable adaptation strategies in large speech models.
