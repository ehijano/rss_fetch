      <title>The spectrum of limit models in a first order setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Originally introduced by Kolmann and Shelah as a surrogate for saturated models, limit models have been established as natural and useful objects when studying abstract elementary classes. Shelah began the study of when (multiple notions of) limit models exist for first order theories. In this paper we look at their structure.
  In superstable theories it is known that all limit models are isomorphic, but in the strictly stable case the number of non-isomorphic models was not well understood. Here we characterise the full spectrum of limit models in the first order stable setting, by a short and simple argument using only the familiar machinery of stable first order theories:
  $\textbf{Theorem.}$ Let $T$ be a complete $\lambda$-stable theory where $\lambda \geq |\operatorname{L}(T)| + \aleph_0$. Let $\delta_1, \delta_2 &lt; \lambda^+$ be limit ordinals where $\operatorname{cf}(\delta_1)&lt; \operatorname{cf}(\delta_2)$. Let $N_l$ be a $(\lambda, \delta_l)$-limit model for $l = 1, 2$. Then $N_1$ and $N_2$ are isomorphic if and only if $\operatorname{cf}(\delta_1) \geq \kappa_r(T)$.
  Moreover, if $\kappa_r(T) = \aleph_\alpha$, there are exactly $|\alpha| + 1$ limit models up to isomorphism.
  In the context of first order stable theories, this reduces the proof of the main result of arXiv:2503.11605 from 19 pages to 2. We hope this will make limit models a more comprehensible and accessible tool in first order model theory.</description>

      <title>On the global linear Zarankiewicz problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The `global' Zarankiewicz problem for hypergraphs asks for an upper bound on the number of edges of a finite $r$-hypergraph $V$ in terms of the number $|V|$ of its vertices, assuming the edge relation is induced by a fixed $K_{k, \dots, k}$-free $r$-hypergraph $E$, for some $k\in\mathbb N$. In [4], such bounds of size $O(|V|^{r-1})$ were achieved for a semilinear $E$, namely, definable in a linear o-minimal structure. We establish the same bounds in five new settings: when $E$ is definable in (a) a semibounded o-minimal structure and the vertex set of $V$ is `sufficiently distant', (b) a model of Presburger arithmetic, (c) the expansion $\langle\mathbb R,&lt;,+, \mathbb Z\rangle$ of the real ordered group by the set of integers, (d) a stable 1-based structure without the finite cover property, and (e) a locally modular regular type in a stable theory, such as the generic type of the solution set of the Heat differential equation.
  Our methods include techniques for reducing Zarankiewicz's problem to the setting of arbitrary subgroups of powers of groups, used in geometric cases (a)--(c). They also include an abstract version of Zarankiewicz's problem for general `linear structures' that yields the desired bounds in the model-theoretic settings (d)--(e), as well as a parametric version in (b). Furthermore, the bounds in (a) characterise those o-minimal structures that do not recover a global field, and in (c) they yield new versions of Zarankiewicz's problem for certain ordered abelian groups.</description>

      <title>A virtual five element basis for the uncountable linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every Aronzsajn line A and every Countryman line C, there is a proper forcing extension in which A contains an isomorphic copy of either C or its converse C*. As a corollary, we obtain answers to several related questions asked by the second author in the literature: if there is an inaccessible cardinal, then there is a proper forcing extension in which the uncountable linear orders have a five element basis; BPFA implies the existence of a five element basis for the uncountable linear orders; BPFA is equiconsistent with the conjunction of BPFA and Aronszajn tree saturation. These results are derived from new preservation results concerning subtrees of Aronszajn trees, proper forcings, and countable support iterations, generalizing work of Miyamoto, Abraham, and Shelah.</description>

      <title>Tableaux for epistemic G\"{o}del logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multi-agent epistemic logic capturing reasoning with degrees of plausibility that agents can assign to a given statement, with $1$ interpreted as "entirely plausible for the agent" and $0$ as "completely implausible" (i.e., the agent knows that the statement is false). We formalise such reasoning in an expansion of G\"{o}del fuzzy logic with an involutive negation and multiple $\mathbf{S5}$-like modalities. As already G\"{o}del single-modal logics are known to lack the finite model property w.r.t. their standard $[0,1]$-valued Kripke semantics, we provide an alternative semantics that allows for the finite model property. For this semantics, we construct a strongly terminating tableaux calculus that allows us to produce finite counter-models of non-valid formulas. We then use the tableaux to show that the validity problem in our logic is $\mathsf{PSpace}$-complete when there are two or more agents, and $\mathsf{coNP}$-complete for the single-agent case.</description>

      <title>Filters and congruences in weakly complemented lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that given a weakly dicomplemented lattice (WDL) $\mathcal{L}=(L; \vee, \wedge, ^{\Delta}, ^{\nabla}, 0, 1)$, $^{\Delta}$ induces a structure of a dual weakly complemented lattice in the lattice $(F(L), \subseteq)$ of filters of $\mathcal{L}$. We prove that the set of dense elements of $F(L)$ forms a nearlattice, and the set of principal filters of $\mathcal{L}$ forms a dual weakly complemented lattice that is dually isomorphic to the weakly complemented lattice (WCL) $(L,\wedge, \vee, ^{\Delta}, 0, 1)$.\par Each filter of the dual skeleton $\overline{S}(L)$ of $L$ constitutes a base of some filter in $L$, called an S-filter, and it is proved that S-filters form a complete lattice isomorphic to the complete lattice of filters of $\overline{S}(L)$. S-primary filters are introduced and investigated, and it is shown that there exists a bijection between the set of prime filters of $\overline{S}(L)$ and the set of S-primary filters of $\mathcal{L}$. Furthermore, each maximal filter of a WDL $\mathcal{L}$ is a primary filter, though there exist primary filters of $\mathcal{L}$ that are not maximal.The congruences generated by filters in a distributive weakly complemented lattice are characterized. Finally, simple and subdirectly irreducible distributive weakly complemented lattices are also characterized using S-filters.</description>

      <title>Janus-faces of temporal constraint languages: a dichotomy of expressivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04347v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bodirsky-K\'ara classification of temporal constraint languages stands as one of the earliest and most seminal complexity classifications within infinite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), yet it remains one of the most mysterious in terms of algorithms and algebraic invariants for the tractable cases. We show that those temporal languages which do not pp-construct EVERYTHING (and thus by the classification are solvable in polynomial time) have, in fact, very limited expressive power as measured by the graphs and hypergraphs they can pp-interpret. This limitation yields many previously unknown algebraic consequences, while also providing new, uniform proofs for known invariance properties. In particular, we show that such temporal constraint languages admit $4$-ary pseudo-Siggers polymorphisms -- a result that sustains the possibility that the existence of such polymorphisms extends to the much broader context of the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture.</description>

      <title>The analogy theorem in Hoare logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of machine learning methods has led to significant advances in automation, optimization, and discoveries in various fields of science and technology. However, their widespread application faces a fundamental limitation: the transfer of models between data domains generally lacks a rigorous mathematical justification. The key problem is the lack of formal criteria to guarantee that a model trained on one type of data will retain its properties on another.This paper proposes a solution to this problem by formalizing the concept of analogy between data sets and models using first-order logic and Hoare logic.We formulate and rigorously prove a theorem that sets out the necessary and sufficient conditions for analogy in the task of knowledge transfer between machine learning models. Practical verification of the analogy theorem on model data obtained using the Monte Carlo method, as well as on MNIST and USPS data, allows us to achieving F1 scores of 0.84 and 0.88 for convolutional neural networks and random forests, respectively.The proposed approach not only allows us to justify the correctness of transfer between domains but also provides tools for comparing the applicability of models to different types of data.The main contribution of the work is a rigorous formalization of analogy at the level of program logic, providing verifiable guarantees of the correctness of knowledge transfer, which opens new opportunities for both theoretical research and the practical use of machine learning models in previously inaccessible areas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize Pach and de Zeeuw's bound for distinct distances between points on two curves, from algebraic curves to Pfaffian curves. Pfaffian curves include those that can be defined by any combination of elementary functions, including exponential and logarithmic functions, rational and irrational powers, trigonometric functions and their inverses, integration, and more. The bound remains $\Omega(\min\{m^{3/4}n^{3/4},m^2,n^2\})$, as obtained from the proximity technique of Solymosi and Zahl.</description>

      <title>Free Independence is not Definable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free independence is an important tool for studying the structure of operator algebras. It is natural to ask from the model-theoretic standpoint whether free independence is captured well in first-order model theory via the notion of a definable set. We prove that pairs of freely independent elements do not form a definable set in the sense of continuous model theory, relative to the theory of both C$^*$-probability spaces and tracial von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the isomorphism of ergodic measure-preserving transformations is not Borel reducible to the relation induced by the conjugacy action of the full group of an ergodic measure-preserving transformation on itself. This answers a question of Le Ma\^{i}tre in the negative and gives a positive indication towards a conjecture of Sabok. In fact, we prove that the isomorphism of ergodic measure-preserving transformation is unbalanced, which answers another question of Le Ma\^{i}tre in the positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.12233v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is motivated by the problem of finding the limit of the applicability of the first incompleteness theorem ($\sf G1$). A natural question is: can we find a minimal theory for which $\sf G1$ holds? We examine the Turing degree structure of recursively enumerable (RE) theories for which $\sf G1$ holds and the interpretation degree structure of RE theories weaker than the theory $\mathbf{R}$ with respect to interpretation for which $\sf G1$ holds. We answer all questions that we posed in [2], and prove more results about them. It is known that there are no minimal essentially undecidable theories with respect to interpretation. We generalize this result and give some general characterizations which tell us under what conditions there are no minimal RE theories having some property with respect to interpretation.</description>

Abstract: We axiomatize the provability logic of HA and show that it is decidable. Moreover we axiomatize the preservativity and relative admissibility for several modal logics extending iK4. As a main tool, we also provide some sort of semantics, called provability semantics, for modal logics extending iGL, which is a mixture of usual Kripke semantics and provability in propositional modal logics.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies relative unification and admissibility in the intuitionistic logic. We generalize results of [Ghilardi, 1999; Iemhoff, 2001a] and prove them relative in NNIL(par) propositions, the class of propositions with No Nested Implications in the Left made up from parameters. The main application of such generalization is to characterize provability logic of Heyting Arithmetic HA and prove its decidability [Mojtahedi, 2022].</description>

      <title>Network Satisfaction Problems Solved by k-Consistency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the problem of deciding for a given finite relation algebra A whether the network satisfaction problem for A can be solved by the k-consistency procedure, for some natural number k, is undecidable. For the important class of finite relation algebras A with a normal representation, however, the decidability of this problem remains open. We show that if A is symmetric and has a flexible atom, then the question whether NSP(A) can be solved by k-consistency, for some natural number k, is decidable (even in polynomial time in the number of atoms of A). This result follows from a more general sufficient condition for the correctness of the k-consistency procedure for finite symmetric relation algebras. In our proof we make use of a result of Alexandr Kazda about finite binary conservative structures.</description>

Abstract: We axiomatize the first-order theories of exponential integer parts of real-closed exponential fields in a language with $2^x$, in a language with a predicate for powers of 2, and in the basic language of ordered rings. In particular, the last theory extends IOpen by sentences expressing the existence of winning strategies in a certain game on integers; we show that it is a proper extension of IOpen, and give upper and lower bounds on the required number of rounds needed to win the game.</description>

      <title>Upwards homogeneity in iterated symmetric extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is sometimes desirable in choiceless constructions of set theory that one iteratively extends some ground model without adding new sets of ordinals after the first extension. Pushing this further, one may wish to have models $V \subseteq M \subseteq N$ of $\mathsf{ZF}$ such that $N$ contains no subsets of $V$ that do not already appear in $M$. We isolate, in the case that $M$ and $N$ are symmetric extensions (particular inner models of a generic extension of $V$), the exact conditions that cause this behaviour and show how it can broadly be applied to many known constructions. We call this behaviour upwards homogeneity.</description>

      <title>Failure of Approachability at the Successor of the first Singular for any Cofinality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve two long-standing open problems regarding the combinatorics of $\aleph_{\omega+1}$. We answer a question of Shelah by showing that it is consistent for any $n\geq 1$ that $\mathsf{GCH}$ holds and there is a stationary set of points of cofinality $\aleph_n$ which is not in the approachability ideal. As a corollary, we obtain a model where the notions of goodness and approachability are distinct for stationarily many points of cofinality $\aleph_1$, answering an open question of Cummings, Foreman, and Magidor.</description>

      <title>Cubic incompleteness: Hilbert's tenth problem begins at degree three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a preliminary result addressing a long-standing open question: Are cubic Diophantine equations undecidable?} We answer in the affirmative. By encoding G\"odel's first incompleteness theorem via a Fibonacc-based G\"oodel numbering and the Zeckendorf representation, we reduce the arithmetic complexity sufficiently to construct an explicit \emph{cubic Diophantine equation} whose solvability is independent of a model provided by \emph{Peano axioms}. We present three results. First, a commonsense argument that relies on an unjustified generalization by necessity. Second, a constructive procedure that, given any Turing machine $M$, produces a cubic polynomial $Q_M(\vec{u}) \in \mathbb{Z}[\vec{u}]$ of total degree at most $3$, such that the equation $Q_M(\vec{u}) = 0$ has a solution in $\mathbb{N}^k$ if and only if $M$ halts on empty input. Third, we formalize a thesis concerning bounds.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of (pre)liminary C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary countable ordinal $\alpha $, we introduce the notion of type $I_{\alpha }$ C*-algebra and $\alpha $-subhomogeneous C*-algebra. When $\alpha =0$, these recover the notions of Fell C*-algebra and of commutative C*-algebra, respectively. When $\alpha = n &lt;\omega $, these recover the notions of type $I_{n}$ C*-algebra and of $n$-subhomogeneous C*-algebra, respectively. We prove that a separable C*-algebra is liminary if and only if it is type $I_{\alpha }$ for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$, and it is preliminary (i.e., has no infinite-dimensional irreducible representation) if and only if it is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$. We also prove that for any countable ordinal $\alpha $ there exists a separable C*-algebra that is type $I_{\alpha }$ and not type $I_{\beta }$ for $\beta &lt;\alpha $, and a separable C*-algebra that is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous and not $\beta $-subhomogeneous for any $\beta &lt;\alpha $.</description>
