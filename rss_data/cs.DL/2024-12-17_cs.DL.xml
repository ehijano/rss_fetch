      <title>The publication activity and migration trends of Ukrainian scientists in the social sciences and humanities during the first two years of the Russo-Ukrainian war</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyses the publication activity and migration patterns of Ukrainian scholars in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) during the initial two years of the Russo-Ukrainian war. Focusing on scholars who published at least three papers, the study underscores the resilience of these scholars, who continued their academic endeavours within their homeland despite the conflict. The research utilizes data from the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and the Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (AHCI) to illustrate their continued scientific contributions under adverse conditions. It also highlights the crucial role of international collaboration in supporting Ukrainian SSH research, emphasizing that such collaborations primarily manifest through joint research projects rather than relocation of scholars to foreign institutions.</description>

      <title>A Literature Review of Literature Reviews in Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12928v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI) have led to an overwhelming expansion of scientific knowledge, spawning numerous literature reviews aimed at collecting and synthesizing fragmented information. This paper presents a thorough analysis of these literature reviews within the PAMI field, and tries to address three core research questions: (1) What are the prevalent structural and statistical characteristics of PAMI literature reviews? (2) What strategies can researchers employ to efficiently navigate the growing corpus of reviews? (3) What are the advantages and limitations of AI-generated reviews compared to human-authored ones? To address the first research question, we begin with a narrative overview to highlight common preferences in composing PAMI reviews, followed by a statistical analysis to quantitatively uncover patterns in these preferences. Our findings reveal several key insights. First, fewer than 20% of PAMI reviews currently comply with PRISMA standards, although this proportion is gradually increasing. Second, there is a moderate positive correlation between the quality of references and the scholarly impact of reviews, emphasizing the importance of reference selection. To further assist researchers in efficiently managing the rapidly growing number of literature reviews, we introduce four novel, real-time, article-level bibliometric indicators that facilitate the screening of numerous reviews. Finally, our comparative analysis reveals that AI-generated reviews currently fall short of human-authored ones in accurately evaluating the academic significance of newly published articles and integrating rich visual elements, which limits their practical utility. Overall, this study provides a deeper understanding of PAMI literature reviews by uncovering key trends, evaluating current practices, and highlighting areas for future improvement.</description>

      <title>Canadian Publications in Library and Information Science: A Database of research by LIS academics and practitioners in Canada</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of the Canadian publications in Library and Information Science (LIS) database is to help break down the silos in which the two main target audiences - LIS faculty members and academic librarians - conduct their research. As part of a larger project entitled "Breaking down research silos", we created a database of research contributions by Canadian LIS researchers (academics and practitioners). This was motivated by a desire to make research by Canadian LIS scholars and practitioners more visible and foster collaboration between these two groups. The aim of this paper is to introduce the database, describe the process through which it was created, provide descriptive statistics of the database content, and highlight areas for future development.</description>

      <title>From Division to Unity: A Large-Scale Study on the Emergence of Computational Social Science, 1990-2021</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on the emergence of Computational Social Science (CSS) - an interdisciplinary field leveraging computational methods to address social science questions - and its impact on adjacent social sciences. We trained a robust CSS classifier using papers from CSS-focused venues and applied it to 11 million papers spanning 1990 to 2021. Our analysis yielded three key findings. First, there were two critical inflections in the rise of CSS. The first occurred around 2005 when psychology, politics, and sociology began engaging with CSS. The second emerged in approximately 2014 when economics finally joined the trend. Sociology is currently the most engaged with CSS. Second, using the density of yearly knowledge embeddings constructed by advanced transformer models, we observed that CSS initially lacked a cohesive identity. From the early 2000s to 2014, however, it began to form a distinct cluster, creating boundaries between CSS and other social sciences, particularly in politics and sociology. After 2014, these boundaries faded, and CSS increasingly blended with the social sciences. Third, shared data-driven methods homogenized CSS papers across disciplines, with politics and economics showing the most alignment due to the combined influence of CSS and causal identification. Nevertheless, non-CSS papers in sociology, psychology, and politics became more divergent. Taken together, these findings highlight the dynamics of division and unity as new disciplines emerge within existing knowledge landscapes.
