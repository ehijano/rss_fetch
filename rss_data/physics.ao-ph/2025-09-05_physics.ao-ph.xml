      <title>Finetuning AI Foundation Models to Develop Subgrid-Scale Parameterizations: A Case Study on Atmospheric Gravity Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global climate models parameterize a range of atmospheric-oceanic processes like gravity waves, clouds, moist convection, and turbulence that cannot be sufficiently resolved. These subgrid-scale closures for unresolved processes are a leading source of model uncertainty. Here, we present a new approach to developing machine learning parameterizations of small-scale climate processes by fine-tuning a pre-trained AI foundation model (FM). FMs are largely unexplored in climate research. A pre-trained encoder-decoder from a 2.3 billion parameter FM (NASA and IBM Research's Prithvi WxC) -- which contains a latent probabilistic representation of atmospheric evolution -- is fine-tuned (or reused) to create a deep learning parameterization for atmospheric gravity waves (GWs). The parameterization captures GW effects for a coarse-resolution climate model by learning the fluxes from an atmospheric reanalysis with 10 times finer resolution. A comparison of monthly averages and instantaneous evolution with a machine learning model baseline (an Attention U-Net) reveals superior predictive performance of the FM parameterization throughout the atmosphere, even in regions excluded from pre-training. This performance boost is quantified using the Hellinger distance, which is 0.11 for the baseline and 0.06 for the fine-tuned model. Our findings emphasize the versatility and reusability of FMs, which could be used to accomplish a range of atmosphere- and climate-related applications, leading the way for the creation of observations-driven and physically accurate parameterizations for more earth-system processes.</description>

      <title>Strengthening national capability in urban climate science: an Australian perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cities are experiencing significant warming and more frequent climate extremes, raising risks for over 90% of Australians living in cities. Yet many of our tools for climate prediction and projection lack accurate representations of these environments. We also lack the observations and datasets needed to evaluate model performance. This paper identifies critical gaps in Australias current capability, showing how they undermine climate impact and risk assessments in cities and may lead to poorly designed adaptation and mitigation strategies. These gaps, and the recommendations to address them, were identified through consultation with experts across research institutes, universities, two ARC Centres of Excellence, federal and state governments, and private agencies.
  Our recommendations span four key areas: city descriptive datasets, integrated observations, fit for purpose models, and a coordinated community of research and practice. Urgent action is needed to tailor models to Australia's unique urban landscapes and climates. This requires comprehensive, nationally consistent, high resolution datasets that capture the form, fabric, and function of contemporary and future cities. It also requires filling systematic gaps in integrated networks of urban climate observations for evaluation and benchmarking. At the same time, scientific understanding of key urban processes that influence weather and climate must advance, alongside improvements in their representation in physical models. This can be achieved through a national community of research and practice that codesigns and oversees an implementation plan, integrated with infrastructure such as ACCESS NRI and AURIN. Building this capability will enable us to answer critical questions about the interaction between cities and climate, protecting Australias urban populations and ensuring a resilient future.</description>

      <title>Multiple Scattering Effects in Noctilucent Clouds: Numerical Estimation and Application to Altitude and Particle Size Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simple 3-D radiative transfer model in the atmosphere of the Earth is built for numerical comparison of direct solar radiation and limb scattering background at the definite layer during the deep twilight period at the middle and upper atmosphere. This allows finding the contribution of multiple scattering in the field of high-altitude clouds such as polar stratospheric and noctilucent clouds. This is the factor that can influence the results of altitude and microphysical study of the particles based on the approximation of single scattering. The possible errors caused by this effect are estimated together with the contribution of multiple scattering for different altitudes of the clouds, wavelengths and solar zenith angles. The results are interpreted geometrically and optically, color effects observed for noctilucent clouds are described.</description>
