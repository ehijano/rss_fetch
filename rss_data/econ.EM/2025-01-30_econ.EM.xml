      <title>Demand Analysis under Price Rigidity and Endogenous Assortment: An Application to China's Tobacco Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe nominal price rigidity in tobacco markets across China. The monopolistic seller responds by adjusting product assortments, which remain unobserved by the analyst. We develop and estimate a logit demand model that incorporates assortment discrimination and nominal price rigidity. We find that consumers are significantly more responsive to price changes than conventional models predict. Simulated tax increases reveal that neglecting the role of endogenous assortments results in underestimations of the decline in higher-tier product sales, incorrect directional predictions of lower-tier product sales, and overestimation of tax revenue by more than 50%. Finally, we extend our methodology to settings with competition and random coefficient models.</description>

      <title>Uniform Confidence Band for Marginal Treatment Effect Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for constructing uniform confidence bands for the marginal treatment effect function. Our approach visualizes statistical uncertainty, facilitating inferences about the function's shape. We derive a Gaussian approximation for a local quadratic estimator, enabling computationally inexpensive construction of these bands. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that our bands provide the desired coverage and are less conservative than those based on the Gumbel approximation. An empirical illustration is included.</description>

      <title>Uniform Inference on High-dimensional Spatial Panel Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.07424v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose employing a debiased-regularized, high-dimensional generalized method of moments (GMM) framework to perform inference on large-scale spatial panel networks. In particular, network structure with a flexible sparse deviation, which can be regarded either as latent or as misspecified from a predetermined adjacency matrix, is estimated using debiased machine learning approach. The theoretical analysis establishes the consistency and asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator, taking into account general temporal and spatial dependency inherent in the data-generating processes. A primary contribution of our study is the development of uniform inference theory that enables hypothesis testing on the parameters of interest, including zero or non-zero elements in the network structure. Additionally, the asymptotic properties for the estimator are derived for both linear and nonlinear moments. Simulations demonstrate superior performance of our proposed approach. Lastly, we apply our methodology to investigate the spatial network effect of stock returns.</description>

      <title>A Neyman-Orthogonalization Approach to the Incidental Parameter Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A popular approach to perform inference on a target parameter in the presence of nuisance parameters is to construct estimating equations that are orthogonal to the nuisance parameters, in the sense that their expected first derivative is zero. Such first-order orthogonalization may, however, not suffice when the nuisance parameters are very imprecisely estimated. Leading examples where this is the case are models for panel and network data that feature fixed effects. In this paper, we show how, in the conditional-likelihood setting, estimating equations can be constructed that are orthogonal to any chosen order. Combining these equations with sample splitting yields higher-order bias-corrected estimators of target parameters. In an empirical application we apply our method to a fixed-effect model of team production and obtain estimates of complementarity in production and impacts of counterfactual re-allocations.</description>

      <title>Interference Among First-Price Pacing Equilibria: A Bias and Variance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online A/B testing is widely used in the internet industry to inform decisions on new feature roll-outs. For online marketplaces (such as advertising markets), standard approaches to A/B testing may lead to biased results when buyers operate under a budget constraint, as budget consumption in one arm of the experiment impacts performance of the other arm. To counteract this interference, one can use a budget-split design where the budget constraint operates on a per-arm basis and each arm receives an equal fraction of the budget, leading to ``budget-controlled A/B testing.'' Despite clear advantages of budget-controlled A/B testing, performance degrades when budget are split too small, limiting the overall throughput of such systems. In this paper, we propose a parallel budget-controlled A/B testing design where we use market segmentation to identify submarkets in the larger market, and we run parallel experiments on each submarket.
  Our contributions are as follows: First, we introduce and demonstrate the effectiveness of the parallel budget-controlled A/B test design with submarkets in a large online marketplace environment. Second, we formally define market interference in first-price auction markets using the first price pacing equilibrium (FPPE) framework. Third, we propose a debiased surrogate that eliminates the first-order bias of FPPE, drawing upon the principles of sensitivity analysis in mathematical programs. Fourth, we derive a plug-in estimator for the surrogate and establish its asymptotic normality. Fifth, we provide an estimation procedure for submarket parallel budget-controlled A/B tests. Finally, we present numerical examples on semi-synthetic data, confirming that the debiasing technique achieves the desired coverage properties.</description>
