      <title>Impact of Heterogeneity on Scalar Flux Variance Relations Across Diverse Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional surface layer theory to understand the behavior, scaling and exchange of heat, water vapor and carbon dioxide between the land surface and atmosphere relies on a number of commonly broken assumptions. In particular, traditional theory breaks down under three different forms of heterogeneity highlighted in this work: spatial heterogeneity in the sources of the scalars, heterogeneity in the Reynolds stress tensor (turbulence anisotropy), and temporal heterogeneity (non-stationarity). The work explores the relationship between the idealized flux-variance relations and these three forms of heterogeneity across a diverse network of 47 flux towers representing a broad range of ecosystems including forests, agricultural land, grasslands, tundra, tropical and arid: the National Ecological Observation Network (NEON). Results use high resolution spatial data (1 meter resolution) to show a direct relationship between spatial heterogeneity and deviation from traditional scaling relations. Prior work indicates a close relationship between turbulence anisotropy and velocity scaling. A similar result shows weaker, albeit significant differences in the surface layer scaling for all three variables under both stable and unstable stratification based on turbulence anisotropy. The study also indicates an interplay between stationarity and anisotropy, with the non-dimensionalized scalar variance scaling more strongly with anisotropy under more non-stationary turbulence. Updated flux-variance relations that leverage turbulence anisotropy for the scaling of temperature are introduced, as are novel anisotropy-generalized scalings for water vapor and carbon dioxide. The novel scalings show significant improvement over traditional relations. The work also explores in detail how the scaling relations, and their relationship with heterogeneity, vary across the diverse sites in the NEON network.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Effect of a Parallax Correcting Algorithm for Passive Microwave Satellite Precipitation Retrievals across the Continental United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite precipitation retrieval algorithms whose measurement instruments are tilted to the zenith line are subject to a spatial mismatch between the theoretical ground coordinates and the coordinate pair corresponding to the cloud layers sending spectral signals to the satellite. This is the case of the precipitation retrievals of the GPM Passive Microwave Imagery (GMI) on board the core satellite of the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) that uses the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF). Currently, no geometrical correction is applied to GMI retrievals of surface precipitation, creating a horizontal displacement (or parallax mismatching) between the reported surface and the corrected coordinates corresponding to the cloud structures intersecting the field of view.
  GPROF precipitation retrievals over the Continental United States are analyzed using the ground-validated Multi-Resolution Multi-Sensor (GV-MRMS) system data and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) temperature profiles. Results applying this parallax correction scheme show improvements in the overall retrieval accuracy of GPROF, mainly during the summer months, for every precipitation type, when the freezing level (FL) is relatively high. The development of this new parallax-correction algorithm for passive microwave radiometers will significantly improve the accuracy of remote sensing data by minimizing spatial distortions in atmospheric measurements, leading to more precise weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and environmental assessments.</description>

      <title>Climate-Adaptive and Cascade-Constrained Machine Learning Prediction for Sea Surface Height under Greenhouse Warming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has achieved remarkable success in climate and marine science. Given that greenhouse warming fundamentally reshapes ocean conditions such as stratification, circulation patterns and eddy activity, evaluating the climate adaptability of the ML model is crucial. While physical constraints have been shown to enhance the performance of ML models, kinetic energy (KE) cascade has not been used as a constraint despite its importance in regulating multi-scale ocean motions. Here we develop two sea surface height (SSH) prediction models (with and without KE cascade constraint) and quantify their climate adaptability at the Kuroshio Extension. Our results demonstrate that both models exhibit only slight performance degradation under greenhouse warming conditions. Incorporating the KE cascade as a physical constraint significantly improve the model performance, reducing eddy kinetic energy errors by 14.7% in the present climate and 15.9% under greenhouse warming. This work presents the first application of the kinetic energy (KE) cascade as a physical constraint for ML based ocean state prediction and demonstrates its robust adaptability across climates, offering guidance for the further development of global ML models for both present and future conditions.</description>

      <title>An update to ECMWF's machine-learned weather forecast model AIFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an update to ECMWF's machine-learned weather forecasting model AIFS Single with several key improvements. The model now incorporates physical consistency constraints through bounding layers, an updated training schedule, and an expanded set of variables. The physical constraints substantially improve precipitation forecasts and the new variables show a high level of skill. Upper-air headline scores also show improvement over the previous AIFS version. The AIFS has been fully operational at ECMWF since the 25th of February 2025.</description>

      <title>Discovering strategies for coastal resilience with AI-based prediction and optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical storms cause extensive property damage and loss of life, making them one of the most destructive types of natural hazards. The development of predictive models that identify interventions effective at mitigating storm impacts has considerable potential to reduce these adverse outcomes. In this study, we use an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approach for optimizing intervention schemes that improve resilience to coastal flooding. We combine three different AI models to optimize the selection of intervention types, sites, and scales in order to minimize the expected cost of flooding damage in a given region, including the cost of installing and maintaining interventions. Our approach combines data-driven generation of storm surge fields, surrogate modeling of intervention impacts, and the solving of a continuous-armed bandit problem. We applied this methodology to optimize the selection of sea wall and oyster reef interventions near Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) in Florida, an area that was catastrophically impacted by Hurricane Michael. Our analysis predicts that intervention optimization could be used to potentially save billions of dollars in storm damage, far outpacing greedy or non-optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Data Assimilation with GenCast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation is widely used in many disciplines such as meteorology, oceanography, and robotics to estimate the state of a dynamical system from noisy observations. In this work, we propose a lightweight and general method to perform data assimilation using diffusion models pre-trained for emulating dynamical systems. Our method builds on particle filters, a class of data assimilation algorithms, and does not require any further training. As a guiding example throughout this work, we illustrate our methodology on GenCast, a diffusion-based model that generates global ensemble weather forecasts.</description>

      <title>Normal mode parameters estimation by a VLA in single-shooting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an orthogonality-constrained modal search (OCMS) method for estimating modal wavenumbers and modal depth functions using a vertical linear array (VLA). Under the assumption of a known sound speed profile, OCMS leverages the orthogonality of distinct modal depth functions to extract both the modal depth functions and their corresponding wavenumbers, even when the VLA and a monochromatic sound source remain stationary.The performance of OCMS is evaluated through numerical simulations under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), different VLA apertures, varying numbers of VLA elements, VLA tilt and sound speed profile (SSP) uncertainty. The results demonstrate that OCMS is robust against noise, VLA aperture variations, and changes in the number of VLA elements, meanwhile, the algorithm maintains reliable performance when SSP uncertainty &lt; 1 m/s and VLA tilt angle &lt;5{\deg}. Furthermore, the effectiveness of OCMS is validated using SwellEx96 experimental data. The relative error between the modal wavenumbers derived from experimental data and those computed via Kraken is on the order of $10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>A Generative Framework for Probabilistic, Spatiotemporally Coherent Downscaling of Climate Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15361v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local climate information is crucial for impact assessment and decision-making, yet coarse global climate simulations cannot capture small-scale phenomena. Current statistical downscaling methods infer these phenomena as temporally decoupled spatial patches. However, to preserve physical properties, estimating spatio-temporally coherent high-resolution weather dynamics for multiple variables across long time horizons is crucial. We present a novel generative framework that uses a score-based diffusion model trained on high-resolution reanalysis data to capture the statistical properties of local weather dynamics. After training, we condition on coarse climate model data to generate weather patterns consistent with the aggregate information. As this predictive task is inherently uncertain, we leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models and sample multiple trajectories. We evaluate our approach with high-resolution reanalysis information before applying it to the climate model downscaling task. We then demonstrate that the model generates spatially and temporally coherent weather dynamics that align with global climate output.</description>

      <title>The Gradient of Mean Molecular Weight Across the Radius Valley</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photo-evaporation shapes the observed radii of small exoplanets and constrains the underlying distributions of atmospheric and core masses. However, the diversity of atmospheric chemistries corresponding to these distributions remains unelucidated. We develop a first-principles carbon-hydrogen-oxygen-sulfur-silicon (CHOSSi) outgassing model that accounts for non-ideal gas behavior (via fugacities) at high pressures, as well as the tendency for water and hydrogen to dissolve in melt (via solubility laws). We use data-driven radius valley constraints to establish the relationship between the atmospheric surface pressures and melt temperatures of sub-Neptunes. Sub-Neptunes with less massive rocky cores retain less of their primordial hydrogen envelopes, which leads to less heat retention and diminished melt temperatures at the surfaces of these cores. Lower melt temperatures lead thermodynamically to the dominance of carbon-, oxygen-, sulfur- and silicon-bearing molecules over molecular hydrogen, which naturally produce a diversity of mean molecular weights. Our geochemical outgassing calculations robustly predict a gradient of mean molecular weight across the radius valley, where the strength of this gradient is primarily driven by the oxygen fugacity of the molten cores and not by the carbon enrichment (or "metallicity") of the atmosphere. Smaller sub-Neptunes are predicted to have less hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. The precise relationship between the observed and outgassed chemistries requires an understanding of how convection near the core interacts with large-scale atmospheric circulation (driven by stellar heating) near the photosphere, as well as the influence of photochemistry.</description>
