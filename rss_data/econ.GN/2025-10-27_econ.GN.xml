      <title>Edgeworth's exact and naturally weighted evolutionary utilitarianism and the happiness of Mr. Pongo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article challenges the conventional reading of Francis Ysidro Edgeworth by reconstructing his intellectual project of unifying the moral sciences through mathematics. The contribution he made in the first phase of his writing, culminating in \textit{Mathematical Psychics}, aimed to reconfigure utilitarianism as an exact science, grounding it in psychophysics and evolutionary biology. In order to solve the utilitarian problem of maximizing pleasure for a given set of sentient beings, he modeled individuals as ``quasi-Fechnerian'' functions, which incorporated their capacity for pleasure as determined by their place in the evolutionary order. The problem of maximization is solved by distributing means according to the individuals' capacity for pleasure. His radical anti-egalitarian conclusions did not stem from an abstract principle of justice, but from the necessity to maximize welfare among naturally unequal beings. This logic was applied not only to sentients of different evolutionary orders, such as Mr. Pongo, a famous gorilla, and humans, but also to human races, sexes, and classes. The system, in essence, uses the apparent neutrality of science to naturalize and justify pre-existing social hierarchies. This analysis reveals that the subsequent surgical removal of his utilitarianism by economists, starting with Schumpeter, while making his tools palatable, eviscerates his overarching philosophical system.</description>

      <title>State capacity, innovation, and endogenous development in Chile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study explores the evolution of Chile's industrial policy from 1990 to 2022 through the lens of state capacity, innovation and endogenous development. In a global context where governments are reasserting their role as active agents of innovation, Chile presents a paradox. It is a stable and open economy that has expanded investment in science and technology but still struggles to transform this effort into sustainable capabilities. Drawing on the works of Mazzucato, Aghion, Howitt, Mokyr, Samuelson and Sampedro, the study integrates evolutionary economics, public policy and humanist ethics. Using a longitudinal case study approach and official data, it finds that Chile has improved its innovation institutions but continues to experience weak coordination, regional inequality and a fragile culture of knowledge. The research concludes that achieving inclusive innovation requires adaptive governance and an ethical vision of innovation as a public good.</description>

      <title>Central Bank Digital Currency, Flight-to-Quality, and Bank-Runs in an Agent-Based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse financial stability and welfare impacts associated with the introduction of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in a macroeconomic agent-based model. The model considers firms, banks, and households interacting on labour, goods, credit, and interbank markets. Households move their liquidity from deposits to CBDC based on the perceived riskiness of their banks. We find that the introduction of CBDC exacerbates bank-runs and may lead to financial instability phenomena. The effect can be changed by introducing a limit on CBDC holdings. The adoption of CBDC has little effect on macroeconomic variables but the interest rate on loans to firms goes up and credit goes down in a limited way. CBDC leads to a redistribution of wealth from firms and banks to households with a higher bank default rate. CBDC may have negative welfare effects, but a bound on holding enables a welfare improvement.</description>

      <title>Urban Planning in 3D with a Two-tier LUTI model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-tier Lowry model brings dynamic simulations of population and employment directly into the planning process. By linking regional modelling with neighbourhood design, the framework enables planners to explore how alternative planning scenarios may evolve over time. The upper tier captures regional flows of people, jobs, and services, while the lower tier allocates these to fine-grain zones such as neighbourhoods or parcels. Implemented in CityEngine, the approach allows interactive visualisation and evaluation of multi-scale scenarios. A case study in South Yorkshire (UK) illustrates how regional forecasts can be translated into local design responses, connecting quantitative modelling with 3D spatial planning.</description>

      <title>Gas price shocks, uncertainty and price setting: evidences from Italian firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines how natural gas price shocks affect Italian firms' pricing decisions and inflation expectations using quarterly survey data from the Bank of Italy's Survey on Inflation and Growth Expectations (SIGE) spanning 1999Q4-2025Q2. We identify natural gas price shocks through a Bayesian VAR with sign and zero restrictions. Our findings reveal that these shocks are important drivers of HICP and firms' inflation expectations, particularly during the 2021-2023 period. We then estimate a larger BVAR incorporating firm-level and macro variables, documenting that gas price shocks increase both firms' current and expected prices, alongside inflation uncertainty. We uncover substantial nonlinearities using state-dependent local projections: under high uncertainty, firms successfully pass through cost increases to consumers, maintaining elevated prices; under low uncertainty, recessionary effects dominate, causing firms to reduce prices below baseline.</description>

      <title>AI-assisted Programming May Decrease the Productivity of Experienced Developers by Increasing Maintenance Burden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI solutions like GitHub Copilot have been shown to increase the productivity of software developers. Yet prior work remains unclear on the quality of code produced and the challenges of maintaining it in software projects. If quality declines as volume grows, experienced developers face increased workloads reviewing and reworking code from less-experienced contributors. We analyze developer activity in Open Source Software (OSS) projects following the introduction of GitHub Copilot. We find that productivity indeed increases. However, the increase in productivity is primarily driven by less-experienced (peripheral) developers. We also find that code written after the adoption of AI requires more rework. Importantly, the added rework burden falls on the more experienced (core) developers, who review 6.5% more code after Copilot's introduction, but show a 19% drop in their original code productivity. More broadly, this finding raises caution that productivity gains of AI may mask the growing burden of maintenance on a shrinking pool of experts.</description>

      <title>Anti-correlation network among China A-shares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correlation-based financial networks are studied intensively. However, previous studies ignored the importance of the anti-correlation. This paper is the first to consider the anti-correlation and positive correlation separately, and accordingly construct the weighted temporal anti-correlation and positive correlation networks among stocks listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. For both types of networks during the first 24 years of this century, fundamental topological measurements are analyzed systematically. This paper unveils some essential differences in these topological measurements between the anti-correlation and positive correlation networks. It also observes an asymmetry effect between the stock market decline and rise. The methodology proposed in this paper has the potential to reveal significant differences in the topological structure and dynamics of a complex financial system, stock behavior, investment portfolios, and risk management, offering insights that are not visible when all correlations are considered together. More importantly, this paper proposes a new direction for studying complex systems: the anti-correlation network. It is well worth reexamining previous relevant studies using this new methodology.</description>

      <title>AI Realtor: Towards Grounded Persuasive Language Generation for Automated Copywriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16810v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) for grounded persuasive language generation in automated copywriting, with real estate marketing as a focal application. Our method is designed to align the generated content with user preferences while highlighting useful factual attributes. This agent consists of three key modules: (1) Grounding Module, mimicking expert human behavior to predict marketable features; (2) Personalization Module, aligning content with user preferences; (3) Marketing Module, ensuring factual accuracy and the inclusion of localized features. We conduct systematic human-subject experiments in the domain of real estate marketing, with a focus group of potential house buyers. The results demonstrate that marketing descriptions generated by our approach are preferred over those written by human experts by a clear margin while maintaining the same level of factual accuracy. Our findings suggest a promising agentic approach to automate large-scale targeted copywriting while ensuring factuality of content generation.</description>
