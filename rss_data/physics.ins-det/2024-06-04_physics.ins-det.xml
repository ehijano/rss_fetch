      <title>Impact of Neutron Irradiation on LGADs with a Carbon-Enriched Shallow Multiplication Layer: Degradation of Timing Performance and Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this radiation tolerance study, Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) with a carbon-enriched broad and shallow multiplication layer were examined in comparison to identical non-carbonated LGADs. Manufactured at IMB-CNM, the sensors underwent neutron irradiation at the TRIGA reactor in Ljubljana, reaching a fluence of $1.5e^{15} {n_{eq}} cm^{-2}$. The results revealed a smaller deactivation of boron and improved resistance to radiation in carbonated LGADs. The study demonstrated the potential benefits of carbon enrichment in mitigating radiation damage effects, particularly the acceptor removal mechanism, reducing the acceptor removal constant by more than a factor of two. Additionally, time resolution and collected charge degradation due to irradiation were observed, with carbonated samples exhibiting better radiation tolerance. A noise analysis focused on baseline noise and spurious pulses showed the presence of thermal-generated dark counts attributed to a too narrow distance between the gain layer end and the p-stop implant at the periphery of the pad for the characterized LGAD design; however, without significant impact of operation performance.</description>

      <title>Distillation and Stripping purification plants for JUNO liquid scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical and radiochemical purification of the scintillating liquid, which will fill the central detector of the JUNO experiment, plays a crucial role in achieving its scientific goals. Given its gigantic mass and dimensions and an unprecedented target value of about 3% @ 1 MeV in energy resolution, JUNO has set severe requirements on the parameters of its scintillator, such as attenuation length (Lat&gt;20 m at 430 nm), transparency, light yield, and content of radioactive contaminants (238U,232Th&lt;10-15 g/g). To accomplish these needs, the scintillator will be processed using several purification methods, including distillation in partial vacuum and gas stripping, which are performed in two large scale plants installed at the JUNO site. In this paper, layout, operating principles, and technical aspects which have driven the design and construction of the distil- lation and gas stripping plants are reviewed. The distillation is effective in enhancing the optical properties and removing heavy radio-impurities (238U,232Th, 40K), while the stripping process exploits pure water steam and high-purity nitrogen to extract gaseous contaminants (222Rn, 39Ar, 85Kr, O2) from the scintillator. The plant operating parameters have been tuned during the recent com- missioning phase at the JUNO site and several QA/QC measurements and tests have been performed to evaluate the performances of the plants. Some preliminary results on the efficiency of these purification processes will be shown.</description>

      <title>Development of large-volume $^{130}$TeO$_2$ bolometers for the CROSS $2\beta$ decay search experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the development of thermal detectors based on large-size tellurium dioxide crystals (45x45x45 mm), containing tellurium enriched in $^{130}$Te to ~91%, for the CROSS double-beta decay experiment. A powder used for the crystals growth was additionally purified by the directional solidification method, resulting in the reduction of the concentration of impurities by a factor 10, to a few ppm of the total concentration of residual elements (the main impurity is Fe). The purest part of the ingot (the first ~200 mm, ~80% of the total length of the cylindrical part of the ingot) was determined by scanning segregation profiles of impurities (both on the surface and in center of the ingot) and used for the $^{130}$TeO$_2$ powder production with no evidence of re-contamination. The crystal growth was verified with precursors produced from powder with natural Te isotopic composition, and two small-size (20x20x10 mm) samples were tested at a sea-level laboratory showing high bolometric and spectrometric performance together with acceptable $^{210}$Po content (below 10 mBq/kg). This growth method was then applied for the production of six large cubic $^{130}$TeO$_2$ crystals for the CROSS experiment and 4 of them were taken randomly to be characterized at the Canfranc underground laboratory, in the CROSS-dedicated low-background cryogenic facility. Two $^{130}$TeO$_2$ samples were coated with a thin metal film in form of Al layer (on 4 sides) or AlPd grid (on a single side) to investigate the possibility to tag surface events by pulse-shape discrimination. Similarly to the small natural precursors, large-volume $^{130}$TeO$_2$ bolometers show high performance and even better internal purity ($^{210}$Po activity ~ 1 mBq/kg, while activities of $^{228}$Th and $^{226}$Ra are below 0.01 mBq/kg), satisfying requirements for the CROSS and, potentially, next-generation experiments.</description>

      <title>VERTECS: A COTS-based payload interface board to enable next generation astronomical imaging payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to advances in observation and imaging technologies, modern astronomical satellites generate large volumes of data. This necessitates efficient onboard data processing and high-speed data downlink. Reflecting this trend is the VERTECS 6U Astronomical Nanosatellite. Designed for the observation of Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), this mission is expected to generate a substantial amount of image data, particularly within the confines of CubeSat capabilities. This paper introduces the VERTECS Camera Control Board (CCB), an open-source payload interface board leveraging Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components, with a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 at its core. The VERTECS CCB hardware and software have been designed from the ground up to serve as the sole interface between the VERTECS bus system and astronomical imaging payload, while providing compute capability not usually seen in nanosatellites of this class. Responsible for mission data processing, it will facilitate high-speed data transfer from the imaging payload via gigabit Ethernet, while also providing a high-bitrate serial connection to the payload X-band transmitter for mission data downlink. Additional interfaces for secondary payloads are provided via USB-C and standard 15-pin camera connectors. The Raspberry Pi embedded within the VERTECS CCB operates on a standard Linux distribution, streamlining the software development process. Beyond addressing the current mission's payload control and data handling requirements, the CCB sets the stage for future missions with heightened data demands. Furthermore, it supports the adoption of machine learning and other compute-intensive applications in orbit. This paper delves into the development of the VERTECS CCB, offering insights into the design and validation of this next-generation payload interface, to ensure that it can survive the rigors of space flight.</description>

      <title>A Point-cloud Clustering &amp; Tracking Algorithm for Radar Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In data mining, density-based clustering, which entails classifying datapoints according to their distributions in some space, is an essential method to extract information from large datasets. With the advent of software-based radio, ionospheric radars are capable of producing unprecedentedly large datasets of plasma turbulence backscatter observations, and new automatic techniques are needed to sift through them. We present an algorithm to automatically identify and track clusters of radar echoes through time, using dbscan, a celebrated density-based clustering method for noisy point-clouds. We demonstrate its efficiency by tracking turbulent structures in the E-region ionosphere, the so-called radar aurora. Through conjugate auroral imagery, as well as in-situ satellite observations, we demonstrate that the observed turbulent structures generally track the motion of the aurora. We discuss instances when this prediction is brought to fruition and when it ostensibly is not. Through case studies, we highlight the important instances when the radar echo bulk motions vary considerably around discrete auroral arcs, an effect we argue is produced by strong electric field modulations caused by energetic particle precipitation.</description>

      <title>Insect Diversity Estimation in Polarimetric Lidar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identification of insects in flight is a particular challenge for ecologists in several settings with no other method able to count and classify insects at the pace of entomological lidar. Thus, it can play a unique role as a non-intrusive diagnostic tool to assess insect biodiversity, inform planning, and evaluate mitigation efforts aimed at tackling declines in insect abundance and diversity. While species richness of co-existing insects could reach tens of thousands, to date, photonic sensors and lidars can differentiate roughly one hundred signal types. This taxonomic specificity or number of discernible signal types is currently limited by instrumentation and algorithm sophistication. In this study we report 32,533 observations of wild flying insects along a 500-meter transect. We report the benefits of lidar polarization bands for differentiating species and compare the performance of two unsupervised clustering algorithms, namely Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and Gaussian Mixture Model. We demonstrate that polarimetric properties could be partially predicted even with unpolarized light, thus polarimetric lidar bands provide only a minor improvement in specificity. Finally, we use physical properties of the clustered observation, such as wing beat frequency, daily activity patterns, and spatial distribution, to establish a lower bound for the number of species represented by the differentiated signal types.</description>

      <title>A time-to-digital converter with steady calibration through single-photon detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-to-Digital Converters (TDCs) are a crucial tool in a wide array of fields, in particular for quantum communication, where time taggers performance can severely affect the quality of the entire application. Nowadays, FPGA-based TDCs present a viable alternative to ASIC ones, once the nonlinear behaviour due to the intrinsic nature of the device is properly mitigated. To compensate said nonlinearities, a calibration procedure is required, usually based on an interpolation methods. Here we present the design and the demonstration of a TDC that is FPGA-based and showing a residual jitter of 27 ps, that is scalable for multichannel operation. The application in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is discussed with a unique calibration method based on the exploitation of single-photon detection that does not require to stop the data acquisition or to use any interpolation methods, thus increasing accuracy and removing data loss. The calibration was tested in a relevant environment, investigating the device behaviour between 5{\deg}C and 80{\deg}C. Moreover, our design is capable of continuously streaming up to 12 Mevents/s for up to ~1 week without the TDC overflowing.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Parameters analysis of GdAlO$_3$ based on thermoluminescent phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: {We herein report on the calculation of thermoluminescence (TL) kinetic parameters determined from the TL emission of synthetic GdAlO3 (GAO) phosphors prepared by the co-precipitation method. The sample, characterized by means of X-ray diffraction with an orthorhombic phase structure (space group Pnma (62), shows complex glow curves consisting of at least four groups of components peaked at 100, 140, 240, and 290 {\deg}C where the two lower overlapped temperature peaks are difficult to identify using the $T_M-T_{stop}$. The coexistence of a continuum in the trap distribution (linked to the lower temperature peaks) and a discrete trap system (associated with the components at temperatures higher than 200 {\deg}C) can be distinguished. The estimation of the TL kinetic parameters is performed using GlowFit, TLAnal, the spreadsheet Origin, Computing Glow Curve Deconvolution (CGCD), and various heating rate (VHR) methods. However, only CGCD appears as the suitable technique for such purpose since it provides information on the TL physical process supported by mathematical models based on a linear combination of functions related to the First Order Kinetic approach.</description>

      <title>Convolutional L2LFlows: Generating Accurate Showers in Highly Granular Calorimeters Using Convolutional Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the quest to build generative surrogate models as computationally efficient alternatives to rule-based simulations, the quality of the generated samples remains a crucial frontier. So far, normalizing flows have been among the models with the best fidelity. However, as the latent space in such models is required to have the same dimensionality as the data space, scaling up normalizing flows to high dimensional datasets is not straightforward. The prior L2LFlows approach successfully used a series of separate normalizing flows and sequence of conditioning steps to circumvent this problem. In this work, we extend L2LFlows to simulate showers with a 9-times larger profile in the lateral direction. To achieve this, we introduce convolutional layers and U-Net-type connections, move from masked autoregressive flows to coupling layers, and demonstrate the successful modelling of showers in the ILD Electromagnetic Calorimeter as well as Dataset 3 from the public CaloChallenge dataset.</description>

      <title>Optimizaci\'on del sistema de iluminaci\'on y proyecci\'on para un sensor multiparam\'etrico acusto-\'optico</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous works we presented a novel multiparametric sensor to simultaneously measure the refractive index and the speed of sound in a liquid by means of the acousto-optic effect. The sensor requires an illumination system that expands the laser beam so that it interacts effectively with the liquid under study. Also, a projection system is necessary in order to adequately capture the diffraction pattern at the cell exit. In this article, we present the optimization of the sensor illumination and projection system using the optical design computational tool Zemax OpticStudio. The considered range of refractive indices of the liquid samples is between 1.33 and 1.51. The results show a correct expansion of the incident beam on the cell, and the projection system achieves an image with very few aberrations and an adequate angular separation between the maxima of the diffraction pattern. Based on the resulting dimensions of the sensor after optimizing the illumination and projection system, we confirm that it is compact and portable.</description>
