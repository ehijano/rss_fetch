      <title>A Score-based Generative Solver for PDE-constrained Inverse Problems with Complex Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of inverse estimation for systems modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs), challenges arise when estimating high- (or even infinite-) dimensional parameters. Typically, the ill-posed nature of such problems necessitates leveraging prior information to achieve well-posedness. In most existing inverse solvers, the prior distribution is assumed to be of either Gaussian or Laplace form which, in many practical scenarios, is an oversimplification. In case the prior is complex and the likelihood model is computationally expensive (e.g., due to expensive forward models), drawing the sample from such posteriors can be computationally intractable, especially when the unknown parameter is high-dimensional. In this work, to sample efficiently, we propose a score-based diffusion model, which combines a score-based generative sampling tool with a noising and denoising process driven by stochastic differential equations. This tool is used for iterative sample generation in accordance with the posterior distribution, while simultaneously learning and leveraging the underlying information and constraints inherent in the given complex prior. A time-varying time schedule is proposed to adapt the method for posterior sampling. To expedite the simulation of non-parameterized PDEs and enhance the generalization capacity, we introduce a physics-informed convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate for the forward model. Finally, numerical experiments, including a hyper-elastic problem and a multi-scale mechanics problem, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. In particular, the score-based diffusion model, coupled with the physics-informed CNN surrogate, effectively learns geometrical features from provided prior samples, yielding better inverse estimation results compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen reaction rate modeling based on convolutional neural network for large eddy simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a data-driven modeling framework for lean Hydrogen (H2)-air reaction rates for the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of turbulent reactive flows. This is particularly challenging since H2 molecules diffuse much faster than heat, leading to large variations in burning rates, thermodiffusive instabilities at the subfilter scale, and complex turbulence-chemistry interactions. Our data-driven approach leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), trained to approximate filtered burning rates from emulated LES data. First, five different lean premixed turbulent H2-air flame Direct Numerical Simulations (DNSs) are computed each with a unique global equivalence ratio. Second, DNS snapshots are filtered and downsampled to emulate LES data. Third, a CNN is trained to approximate the filtered burning rates as a function of LES scalar quantities: progress variable, local equivalence ratio and flame thickening due to filtering. Finally, the performances of the CNN model are assessed on test solutions never seen during training. The model retrieves burning rates with very high accuracy. It is also tested on two filter and downsampling parameters and two global equivalence ratios between those used during training. For these interpolation cases, the model approximates burning rates with low error even though the cases were not included in the training dataset. This a priori study shows that the proposed data-driven machine learning framework is able to address the challenge of modeling lean premixed H2-air burning rates. It paves the way for a new modeling paradigm for the simulation of carbon-free hydrogen combustion systems.</description>

      <title>3D Topological Modeling and Multi-Agent Movement Simulation for Viral Infection Risk Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a method to study how the design of indoor spaces and people's movement within them affect disease spread is proposed by integrating computer-aided modeling, multi-agent movement simulation, and airborne viral transmission modeling. Topologicpy spatial design and analysis software is used to model indoor environments, connect spaces, and construct a navigation graph. Pathways for agents, each with unique characteristics such as walking speed, infection status, and activities, are computed using this graph. Agents follow a schedule of events with specific locations and times. The software calculates "time-to-leave" based on walking speed and event start times, and agents are moved along the shortest path within the navigation graph, accurately considering obstacles, doorways, and walls. Precise distance calculations between agents are enabled by this setup. Viral aerosol concentration is then computed and visualized using a reaction-diffusion equation, and each agent's infection risk is determined with an extension of the Wells-Riley ansatz. Infection risk simulations are improved by this spatio-temporal and topological approach, incorporating realistic human behavior and spatial dynamics. The resulting software is designed as a rapid decision-support tool for policymakers, facility managers, stakeholders, architects, and engineers to mitigate disease spread in existing buildings and inform the design of new ones. The software's effectiveness is demonstrated through a comparative analysis of cellular and open commercial office plan layouts.</description>
