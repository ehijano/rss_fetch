      <title>Structure-preserving local discontinuous Galerkin discretization of conformational conversion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a two-state conformational conversion system and introduce a novel structure-preserving numerical scheme that couples a local discontinuous Galerkin space discretization with the backward Euler time-integration method. The model is first reformulated in terms of auxiliary variables involving suitable nonlinear transformations, which allow us to enforce positivity and boundedness at the numerical level. Then, we prove a discrete entropy-stability inequality, which we use to show the existence of discrete solutions, as well as to establish the convergence of the scheme by means of some discrete compactness arguments. As a by-product of the theoretical analysis, we also prove the existence of global weak solutions satisfying the system's physical bounds. Numerical results validate the theoretical results and assess the capabilities of the proposed method in practice.</description>

      <title>Uniformly accurate structure-preserving neural surrogates for radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a uniformly accurate, structure-preserving neural surrogate for the radiative transfer equation with periodic boundary conditions based on a multiscale parity decomposition framework. The formulation introduces a refined decomposition of the particle distribution into macroscopic, odd, and higher-order even components, leading to an asymptotic-preserving neural network system that remains stable and accurate across all parameter regimes. By constructing key higher-order correction functions, we establish rigorous uniform error estimates with respect to the scale parameter $\varepsilon$, which ensures $\varepsilon$-independent accuracy. Furthermore, the neural architecture is designed to preserve intrinsic physical structures such as parity symmetry, conservation, and positivity through dedicated architectural constraints. The framework extends naturally from one to two dimensions and provides a theoretical foundation for uniformly accurate neural solvers of multiscale kinetic equations. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>A dual grid geometric electromagnetic particle in cell method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric particle-in-cell discretizations have been derived based on a discretization of the fields that is conforming with the de Rham structure of the Maxwell's equation and a standard particle-in-cell ansatz for the fields by deriving the equations of motion from a discrete action principle. While earlier work has focused on finite element discretization of the fields based on the theory of Finite Element Exterior Calculus, we propose in this article an alternative formulation of the field equations that is based on the ideas conveyed by mimetic finite differences. The needed duality being expressed by the use of staggered grids. We construct a finite difference formulation based on degrees of freedom defined as point values, edge, face and volume integrals on a primal and its dual grid. Compared to the finite element formulation no mass matrix inversion is involved in the formulation of the Maxwell solver. In numerical experiments, we verify the conservation properties of the novel method and study the influence of the various parameters in the discretization.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of the dual-phase-lag heat conduction equation on a one-dimensional unbounded domain using artificial boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the numerical solution of a dual-phase-lag heat conduction equation on a space unbounded domain. First, based on the Laplace transform and the Pad\'e approximation, a high-order local artificial boundary condition is constructed for the considered problem, which effectively transforms the original problem into an initial-boundary value problem on a bounded computational domain. Subsequently, for the resulting reduced problem on the bounded domain equipped with high-order local artificial boundary, a stability result based on the $L^2$-norm is derived. Next, we develop finite difference method for the reduced problem by introducing auxiliary variable to reduce the order of time derivative. The numerical analysis demonstrates that the developed numerical scheme is unconditionally stable and possesses a second-order convergence rate in both space and time. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed numerical method and the correctness of the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Implicit reconstruction from point cloud: an adaptive level-set-based semi-Lagrangian method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a level-set-based semi-Lagrangian method on graded adaptive Cartesian grids to address the problem of surface reconstruction from point clouds. The goal is to obtain an implicit, high-quality representation of real shapes that can subsequently serve as computational domain for partial differential equation models. The mathematical formulation is variational, incorporating a curvature constraint that minimizes the surface area while being weighted by the distance of the reconstructed surface from the input point cloud. Within the level set framework, this problem is reformulated as an advection-diffusion equation, which we solve using a semi-Lagrangian scheme coupled with a local high-order interpolator. Building on the features of the level set and semi-Lagrangian method, we use quadtree and octree data structures to represent the grid and generate a mesh with the finest resolution near the zero level set, i.e., the reconstructed surface interface. The complete surface reconstruction workflow is described, including localization and reinitialization techniques, as well as strategies to handle complex and evolving topologies. A broad set of numerical tests in two and three dimensions is presented to assess the effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>The law of iterated logarithm for numerical approximation of time-homogeneous Markov process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for the time-homogeneous Markov process with a unique invariant measure characterizes the almost sure maximum possible fluctuation of time averages around the ergodic limit. Whether a numerical approximation can preserve this asymptotic pathwise behavior remains an open problem. In this work, we give a positive answer to this question and establish the LIL for the numerical approximation of such a process under verifiable assumptions. The Markov process is discretized by a decreasing time-step strategy, which yields the non-homogeneous numerical approximation but facilitates a martingale-based analysis. The key ingredient in proving the LIL for such numerical approximation lies in extracting a quasi-uniform time-grid subsequence from the original non-uniform time grids and establishing the LIL for a predominant martingale along it, while the remainder terms converge to zero. Finally, we illustrate that our results can be flexibly applied to numerical approximations of a broad class of stochastic systems, including SODEs and SPDEs.</description>

      <title>An Isogeometric Tearing and Interconnecting method for conforming discretizations of the biharmonic problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a domain decomposition solver for the biharmonic problem. The problem is discretized in a conforming way using multi-patch Isogeometric Analysis. As first step, we discuss the setup of a sufficiently smooth discretization space. We focus on two dimensional computational domains that are parameterized with sufficiently smooth geometry functions. As solution technique, we use a variant of the Dual-Primal Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting method that is also known as Dual-Primal Isogeometric Tearing and Interconnecting (IETI-DP) method in the context of Isogeometric Analysis. We present a condition number estimate and illustrate the behavior of the proposed method with numerical results.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic error distribution of numerical methods for parabolic SPDEs with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the asymptotic error distribution of several numerical methods for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with multiplicative noise. Firstly, we give the limit distribution of the normalized error process of the exponential Euler method in $\dot{H}^\eta$ for some $\eta&gt;0$. A key finding is that the asymptotic error in distribution of the exponential Euler method is governed by a linear SPDE driven by infinitely many independent $Q$-Wiener processes. This characteristic represents a significant difference from numerical methods for both stochastic ordinary differential equations and SPDEs with additive noise. Secondly, as applications of the above result, we derive the asymptotic error distribution of a full discretization based on the temporal exponential Euler method and the spatial finite element method. As a concrete illustration, we provide the pointwise limit distribution of the normalized error process when the exponential Euler method is applied to a specific class of stochastic heat equations. Finally, by studying the asymptotic error of the spatial semi-discrete spectral Galerkin method, we demonstrate that the actual strong convergence speed of spatial semi-discrete numerical methods may be highly problem-dependent, rather than universally predictable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we compare two methods for finding extremal eigenvalues and eigenvectors: the restarted Lanczos method and momentum accelerated power iterations. The convergence of both methods is based on ratios of Chebyshev polynomials evaluated at subdominant and dominant eigenvalues; however, the convergence is not the same. Here we compare the theoretical convergence properties of both methods, and determine the relative regimes where each is more efficient. We further introduce a preconditioning technique for the restarted Lanczos method using momentum accelerated power iterations, and demonstrate its effectiveness. The theoretical results are backed up by numerical tests on benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Stability of Solutions to the Forced Higher-order Degenerate Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of fourth-order quasilinear degenerate parabolic equations under both time-dependent and time-independent inhomogeneous forces, modeling non-Newtonian thin-film flow over a solid surface in the "complete wetting" regime. Using regularity theory for higher-order parabolic equations and energy methods, we establish the global existence of positive weak solutions and characterize their long-time behavior.
  Specifically, for power-law thin-film problem with the time-dependent force $f(t,x)$, we prove that the weak solution converges to $ \bar{u}_0 + \frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_{0}^t \int_{\Omega} f(s,x) \, {\rm d}x \, {\rm d}s$, and provide the convergence rate, where $\bar{u}_0$ is the spatial average of the initial data. Compared with the homogeneous case in \cite{JJCLKN} (Jansen et al., 2023), this result clearly demonstrates the influence of the inhomogeneous force on the convergence rate of the solution. For the time-independent force $f(x)$, we prove that the difference between the weak solution and the linear function $\bar{u}_0 + \frac{t}{|\Omega|}\int_\Omega f(x)\, {\rm d}x$ is uniformly bounded. For the constant force $f_0$, we show that in the case of shear thickening, the weak solution coincides exactly with $\bar{u}_0 + tf_0$ in a finite time. In both shear-thinning and Newtonian cases, the weak solution approaches $\bar{u}_0 + tf_0$ at polynomial and exponential rates, respectively. Later, for the Ellis law thin-film problem, we find that its solutions behave like those of Newtonian fluids.
  Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to confirm our main analytical results.</description>

      <title>Regularized Reconstruction of Scalar Parameters in Subdiffusion with Memory via a Nonlocal Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper, we propose an analytical and numerical approach to identify scalar parameters (coefficients, orders of fractional derivatives) in the multi-term fractional differential operator in time, $\mathbf{D}_t$. To this end, we analyze inverse problems with an additional nonlocal observation related to a linear subdiffusion equation $\mathbf{D}_{t}u-\mathcal{L}_{1}u-\mathcal{K}*\mathcal{L}_{2}u=g(x,t),$ where $\mathcal{L}_{i}$ are the second order elliptic operators with time-dependent coefficients, $\mathcal{K}$ is a summable memory kernel, and $g$ is an external force. Under certain assumptions on the given data in the model, we derive explicit formulas for unknown parameters. Moreover, we discuss the issues concerning to the uniqueness and the stability in these inverse problems. At last, by employing the Tikhonov regularization scheme with the quasi-optimality approach, we give a computational algorithm to recover the scalar parameters from a noisy discrete measurement and demonstrate the effectiveness (in practice) of the proposed technique via several numerical tests.</description>

      <title>A time-fractional Fisher-KPP equation for tumor growth: Analysis and numerical simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a time-fractional Fisher-KPP equation involving a Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative acting on the diffusion term, as derived by Angstmann and Henry (Entropy, 22:1035, 2020). The model captures memory effects in diffusive population dynamics and serves as a framework for tumor growth modeling. We first establish local well-posedness of weak solutions. The analysis combines a Galerkin approximation with a refined a priori estimate based on a Bihari-Henry-Gronwall inequality, addressing the nonlinear coupling between the fractional diffusion and the reaction term. For small initial data, we further prove global well-posedness and asymptotic stability. A numerical method based on a nonuniform convolution quadrature scheme is then proposed and validated. Simulations demonstrate distinct dynamical behaviors compared to conventional formulations, emphasizing the physical consistency of the present model in describing tumor progression.</description>

      <title>A Latent-Variable Formulation of the Poisson Canonical Polyadic Tensor Model: Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish parameter inference for the Poisson canonical polyadic (PCP) tensor model through a latent-variable formulation. Our approach exploits the observation that any random PCP tensor can be derived by marginalizing an unobservable random tensor of one dimension larger. The loglikelihood of this larger dimensional tensor, referred to as the "complete" loglikelihood, is comprised of multiple rank one PCP loglikelihoods. Using this methodology, we first derive non-iterative maximum likelihood estimators for the PCP model and demonstrate that several existing algorithms for fitting non-negative matrix and tensor factorizations are Expectation-Maximization algorithms. Next, we derive the observed and expected Fisher information matrices for the PCP model. The Fisher information provides us crucial insights into the well-posedness of the tensor model, such as the role that tensor rank plays in identifiability and indeterminacy. For the special case of rank one PCP models, we demonstrate that these results are greatly simplified.</description>

      <title>Near-Efficient and Non-Asymptotic Multiway Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish non-asymptotic efficiency guarantees for tensor decomposition-based inference in count data models. Under a Poisson framework, we consider two related goals: (i) parametric inference, the estimation of the full distributional parameter tensor, and (ii) multiway analysis, the recovery of its canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition factors. Our main result shows that in the rank-one setting, a rank-constrained maximum-likelihood estimator achieves multiway analysis with variance matching the Cram\'{e}r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) up to absolute constants and logarithmic factors. This provides a general framework for studying "near-efficient" multiway estimators in finite-sample settings. For higher ranks, we illustrate that our multiway estimator may not attain the CRLB; nevertheless, CP-based parametric inference remains nearly minimax optimal, with error bounds that improve on prior work by offering more favorable dependence on the CP rank. Numerical experiments corroborate near-efficiency in the rank-one case and highlight the efficiency gap in higher-rank scenarios.</description>

      <title>Block-structured Operator Inference for coupled multiphysics model reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a block-structured formulation of Operator Inference as a way to learn structured reduced-order models for multiphysics systems. The approach specifies the governing equation structure for each physics component and the structure of the coupling terms. Once the multiphysics structure is specified, the reduced-order model is learned from snapshot data following the nonintrusive Operator Inference methodology. In addition to preserving physical system structure, which in turn permits preservation of system properties such as stability and second-order structure, the block-structured approach has the advantages of reducing the overall dimensionality of the learning problem and admitting tailored regularization for each physics component. The numerical advantages of the block-structured formulation over a monolithic Operator Inference formulation are demonstrated for aeroelastic analysis, which couples aerodynamic and structural models. For the benchmark test case of the AGARD 445.6 wing, block-structured Operator Inference provides an average 20% online prediction speedup over monolithic Operator Inference across subsonic and supersonic flow conditions in both the stable and fluttering parameter regimes while preserving the accuracy achieved with monolithic Operator Inference.</description>

      <title>A Low Rank Neural Representation of Entropy Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new representation of entropy solutions to nonlinear scalar conservation laws with a smooth convex flux function in a single spatial dimension. The representation is a generalization of the method of characteristics and posseses a compositional form. While it is a nonlinear representation, the embedded dynamics of the solution in the time variable is linear. This representation is then discretized as a manifold of implicit neural representations where the feedforward neural network architecture has a low rank structure. Finally, we show that the low rank neural representation with a fixed number of layers and a small number of coefficients can approximate any entropy solution regardless of the complexity of the shock topology, while retaining the linearity of the embedded dynamics.</description>

      <title>Surface elevation errors in finite element Stokes models for glacier evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary data which determine the evolution of glaciation are the bedrock elevation and the surface mass balance. From this data, which we assume is defined over a fixed land region, the glacier's geometry solves a free boundary problem which balances the time derivative of the surface elevation, the surface velocity from the Stokes flow of the ice, and the surface balance rate. This problem can be posed in weak form as a variational inequality over a cone of admissible surface elevation functions, those which are above the bedrock topography. After some preparatory theory for the Stokes problem, we conjecture that the corresponding continuous-space, implicit time-step variational inequality problem is well-posed if the surface kinematical equation is appropriately regularized. This conjecture is supported by physical arguments and numerical evidence. We then prove a general theorem which bounds the numerical error made by finite element approximations of nonlinear-operator variational inequalities in Banach spaces. This bound is a sum of error terms of different types, special to variational inequalities. When it is applied to the implicit time-step glacier problem there are three terms in the bound: an error from discretizing the bed elevation, an error from numerically solving for the Stokes velocity, and finally an expected error which is quasi-optimal in the finite element space representation of the surface elevation. The design of glacier models is then reconsidered based on this a priori error analysis.</description>

      <title>Analysis and numerical analysis of the Helmholtz-Korteweg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the nematic Helmholtz-Korteweg equation, a variant of the classical Helmholtz equation that describes time-harmonic wave propagation in calamitic fluids in the presence of nematic order. A prominent example is given by nematic liquid crystals, which can be modeled as nematic Korteweg fluids - that is, fluids whose stress tensor depends on density gradients and on a nematic director describing the orientation of the anisotropic molecules. These materials exhibit anisotropic acoustic properties that can be tuned by external electromagnetic fields, making them attractive for potential applications such as tunable acoustic resonators. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to this equation in two and three dimensions for suitable (nonresonant) wave numbers and propose a convergent discretisation for its numerical solution. The discretisation of this problem is nontrivial as it demands high regularity and involves unfamiliar boundary conditions; we address these challenges by using high-order conforming finite elements and enforcing the boundary conditions with Nitsche's method. We illustrate our analysis with numerical simulations in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Least-Squares Finite Element Methods for nonlinear problems: A unified framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified Least-Squares framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations by recasting the governing system as a residual minimisation problem. A Least-Squares functional is formulated and the corresponding Gauss-Newton method derived, which approximates simultaneously primal and dual variables. We derive conditions under which the Least-Squares functional is coercive and continuous in an appropriate solution space, and establish convergence results while demonstrating that the functional serves as a reliable a posteriori error estimator. This inherent error estimation property is then exploited to drive adaptive mesh refinement across a variety of problems, including the stationary heat equation with either temperature-dependent or discontinuous conductivity, nonlinear elasticity based on the Saint-Venant Kirchhoff model and sea-ice dynamics.</description>

      <title>Analysis of randomized CholeskyQR for sparse matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is about rounding error analysis of randomized CholeskyQR-type algorithms for sparse matrices. We often encounter QR factorization of the sparse matrices in many real problems. In this work, we focus on some typical CholeskyQR-type algorithms with matrix sketching, which is a popular randomized technique in recent years. We build a new model of the sparse matrices and provide rounding error analysis of randomized CholeskyQR-type algorithms for the sparse cases with this model. We make comparison between the bounds with different models of sparsity both theoretically and experimentally. Numerical experiments show some new phenomena of randomized CholeskyQR-type algorithms for the sparse cases, which do not occur in the common sparse cases. We also test the applicability, accuracy, efficiency and robustness of randomized CholeskyQR-type algorithms for sparse matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct families of polynomials defined by recurrence relations related to mean-zero random walks. We show these families of polynomials can be used to approximate $z^n$ by a polynomial of degree $\sim \sqrt{n}$ in associated radially convex domains in the complex plane. Moreover, we show that the constructed families of polynomials have a useful rapid growth property and a connection to Faber polynomials. Applications to iterative linear algebra are presented, including the development of arbitrary-order dynamic momentum power iteration methods suitable for classes of non-symmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>A quantum analogue of convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convex optimization is the powerhouse behind the theory and practice of optimization. We introduce a quantum analogue of unconstrained convex optimization: computing the minimum eigenvalue of a Schr\"odinger operator $h = -\Delta + V $ with convex potential $V:\mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R_{\ge 0}$ such that $V(x)\rightarrow\infty $ as $\|x\|\rightarrow\infty$. For this problem, we present an efficient quantum algorithm, called the Fundamental Gap Algorithm (FGA), that computes the minimum eigenvalue of $h$ up to error $\epsilon$ in polynomial time in $n$, $1/\epsilon$, and parameters that depend on $V$. Adiabatic evolution of the ground state is used as a key subroutine, which we analyze with novel techniques that allow us to focus on the low-energy space. We apply the FGA to give the first known polynomial-time algorithm for finding the lowest frequency of an $n$-dimensional convex drum, or mathematically, the minimum eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian on an $n$-dimensional region that is defined by $m$ linear constraints in polynomial time in $n$, $m$, $1/\epsilon$ and the radius $R$ of a ball encompassing the region.</description>
