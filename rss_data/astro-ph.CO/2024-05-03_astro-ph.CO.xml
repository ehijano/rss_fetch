      <title>Abell 0399-Abell 0401 radio bridge spectral index: the first multifrequency detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent low-frequency radio observations at 140 MHz discovered a 3 Mpc-long bridge of diffuse emission connecting the galaxy clusters Abell 0399 and Abell 0401. We present follow-up observations at 60 MHz to constrain the spectral index of the bridge, which so far has only been detected at 140 and 144 MHz. We analysed deep (~18 hours) LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Low Band Antenna (LBA) data at 60 MHz to detect the bridge at very low frequencies. We then conducted a multi-frequency study with LOFAR HBA data at 144 MHz and uGMRT data at 400 MHz. Assuming second-order Fermi mechanisms for the re-acceleration of relativistic electrons driven by turbulence in the radio bridge regions, we compare the observed radio spectrum with theoretical synchrotron models. The bridge is detected in the 75'' resolution LOFAR image at 60 MHz and its emission fully connects the region between the two galaxy clusters. Between 60 MHz and 144 MHz we found an integrated spectral index value of -1.44 +\- 0.16 for the bridge emission. For the first time, we produced spectral index and related uncertainties maps for a radio bridge. We produce a radio spectrum, which show significant steepening between 144 and 400 MHz. This detection at low frequencies provides important information on the models of particle acceleration and magnetic field structure on very extended scales. The spectral index gives important clues to the origin of inter-cluster diffuse emission. The steepening of the spectrum above 144 MHz can be explained in a turbulent re-acceleration framework, assuming that the acceleration timescales are longer than ~200 Myr.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich velocity reconstruction from Planck and unWISE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect is a blackbody cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropy induced by Thomson scattering off free electrons in bulk motion with respect to the CMB rest frame. The statistically anisotropic cross-correlation between the CMB and galaxy surveys encodes the radial bulk velocity (more generally, the remote dipole field), which can be efficiently reconstructed using a quadratic estimator. Here, we develop and implement a quadratic estimator for the remote dipole field to data from the Planck satellite and the unWISE galaxy redshift catalog. With this data combination, we forecast a $\sim 1$-$\sigma$ detection within $\Lambda$CDM assuming a simple model for the distribution of free electrons. Using reconstructions based on individual frequency temperature maps, we characterize the impact of foregrounds, concluding that they can be effectively mitigated by masking and removing the estimator monopole. We demonstrate that reconstructions based on component-separated CMB maps have no detectable biases from foregrounds or systematics at the level of the expected statistical error. We use these reconstructions to constrain the multiplicative optical depth bias to $b_v &lt; 1.40$ at $68 \%$ confidence. Our fiducial signal model with $b_v =1$ is consistent with this measurement. Our results support an optimistic future for kSZ velocity reconstruction with near-term datasets.</description>

      <title>No $\nu$s is Good News</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analysis from the first year of data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), when combined with data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), has placed an upper-limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_\nu &lt; 70$ meV (95%). In addition to excluding the minimum sum associated with the inverted hierarchy, the posterior is peaked at $\sum m_\nu = 0$ and is close to excluding even the minumum sum, 58 meV at 2$\sigma$. In this paper, we explore the implications of this data for cosmology and particle physics. The sum of neutrino mass is determined in cosmology from the suppression of clustering in the late universe. Allowing the clustering to be enhanced, we extended the DESI analysis to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0$ and find $\sum m_\nu = - 160 \pm 90$ meV (68%), and that the suppression of power from the minimum sum of neutrino masses is excluded at 99% confidence. We show this preference for negative masses makes it challenging to explain the result by a shift of cosmic parameters, such as the optical depth or matter density. We then show how a result of $\sum m_\nu =0$ could arise from new physics in the neutrino sector, including decay, cooling, and/or time-dependent masses. These models are consistent with current observations but imply new physics that is accessible in a wide range of experiments. In addition, we discuss how an apparent signal with $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0$ can arise from new long range forces in the dark sector or from a primordial trispectrum that resembles the signal of CMB lensing.</description>

      <title>Transparent Spheres as Gravitational Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we present a short account of gravitational lenses and how to calculate different properties of its images in the case of having a transparent distribution of matter such as the uniform transparent sphere, isothermal gas sphere, non-singular isothermal gas sphere and a transparent King profile. With the help of XFGLenses software, and numerical methods, different images arising from all of these profiles, and the different caustics and critical curves are shown. The images were consistent with several previous results that are expected for transparent profiles, like having an odd number of images, and reducing the number of images by two when the source passes through the caustic. The curves shown in the caustics where the diamond, the ellipse and the lemniscate-like. For the critical curves, the most common curve was the ellipse, and the lemniscate appeared in the transparent NSIS case, which is consistent with the fact that these curves are common in gravitational lenses.</description>

      <title>Euclid -- The Dark Universe detective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euclid is a recently launched medium-class mission by the European Space Agency (ESA) designed to measure cosmological parameters, test the cosmological standard model, and explore the nature of dark matter and dark energy. To this end, Euclid conducts a survey of up to 14000 square degrees of the extra-galactic sky and obtains optical and near-infrared photometric measurements for more than a billion galaxies as well as near-infrared slitless spectroscopy for more than 35 million galaxies. These observations will be used to estimate galaxy clustering and cosmic shear. It is expected that Euclid will achieve percent-level constraints on the Dark Energy equation of state parameter. The survey will also be exploited with a range of other cosmological probes and prove revolutionary for non-cosmological science.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Reionization kSZ trispectrum methodology and limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patchy reionization generates kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Large-scale velocity perturbations along the line of sight modulate the small-scale kSZ power spectrum, leading to a trispectrum (or four-point function) in the CMB that depends on the physics of reionization. We investigate the challenges in detecting this trispectrum and use tools developed for CMB lensing, such as realization-dependent bias subtraction and cross-correlation based estimators, to counter uncertainties in the instrumental noise and assumed CMB power spectrum. We also find that both lensing and extragalactic foregrounds can impart larger trispectrum contributions than the reionization kSZ signal. We present a range of mitigation methods for both of these sources of contamination, validated on microwave-sky simulations. We use ACT DR6 and Planck data to calculate an upper limit on the reionization kSZ trispectrum from a measurement dominated by foregrounds. The upper limit is about 50 times the signal predicted from recent simulations.</description>

      <title>Cutting corners: Hypersphere sampling as a new standard for cosmological emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological emulators of observables such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectra and matter power spectra commonly use training data sampled from a Latin hypercube. This method often incurs high computational costs by covering less relevant parts of the parameter space, especially in high dimensions where only a small fraction of the parameter space yields a significant likelihood.
  In this paper, we introduce hypersphere sampling, which instead concentrates sample points in regions with higher likelihoods, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of emulators. A novel algorithm for sampling within a high-dimensional hyperellipsoid aligned with axes of correlation in the cosmological parameters is presented. This method focuses the distribution of training data points on areas of the parameter space that are most relevant to the models being tested, thereby avoiding the computational redundancies common in Latin hypercube approaches.
  Comparative analysis using the \textsc{connect} emulation tool demonstrates that hypersphere sampling can achieve similar or improved emulation precision with more than an order of magnitude fewer data points and thus less computational effort than traditional methods. This was tested for both the $\Lambda$CDM model and a 5-parameter extension including Early Dark Energy, massive neutrinos, and additional ultra-relativistic degrees of freedom. Our results suggest that hypersphere sampling holds potential as a more efficient approach for cosmological emulation, particularly suitable for complex, high-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Force metrology with plane parallel plates: Final design review and outlook</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the past few decades, abundant evidence for physics beyond the two standard models of particle physics and cosmology was found. Yet, we are tapping into the dark regarding our understanding of the dark sector. For more than a century, open problems related to the nature of the vacuum remain unresolved. Besides the traditional high-energy frontier and cosmology, technological advancement provides complementary access to new physics via high-precision experiments. Among the latter, the Casimir And Non-Newtonian force EXperiment (\cannex{}) has successfully completed its proof-of-principle phase and will soon commence operation. Benefiting from its plane parallel plate geometry, both interfacial and gravity-like forces are maximized, leading to increased sensitivity. A wide range of dark sector forces, Casimir forces in and out of thermal equilibrium, and gravity will be tested. This article describes the final experimental design, its sensitivity, and expected results.</description>

      <title>Introducing the DREAMS Project: DaRk mattEr and Astrophysics with Machine learning and Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the DREAMS project, an innovative approach to understanding the astrophysical implications of alternative dark matter models and their effects on galaxy formation and evolution. The DREAMS project will ultimately comprise thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that simultaneously vary over dark matter physics, astrophysics, and cosmology in modeling a range of systems -- from galaxy clusters to ultra-faint satellites. Such extensive simulation suites can provide adequate training sets for machine-learning-based analyses. This paper introduces two new cosmological hydrodynamical suites of Warm Dark Matter, each comprised of 1024 simulations generated using the Arepo code. One suite consists of uniform-box simulations covering a $(25~h^{-1}~{\rm M}_\odot)^3$ volume, while the other consists of Milky Way zoom-ins with sufficient resolution to capture the properties of classical satellites. For each simulation, the Warm Dark Matter particle mass is varied along with the initial density field and several parameters controlling the strength of baryonic feedback within the IllustrisTNG model. We provide two examples, separately utilizing emulators and Convolutional Neural Networks, to demonstrate how such simulation suites can be used to disentangle the effects of dark matter and baryonic physics on galactic properties. The DREAMS project can be extended further to include different dark matter models, galaxy formation physics, and astrophysical targets. In this way, it will provide an unparalleled opportunity to characterize uncertainties on predictions for small-scale observables, leading to robust predictions for testing the particle physics nature of dark matter on these scales.</description>

      <title>Identifying Halos in Cosmological Simulations with Continuous Wavelet Analysis: The 2D Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous wavelet analysis is gaining popularity in science and engineering for its ability to analyze data across spatial and scale domain simultaneously. In this study, we introduce a wavelet-based method to identify halos and assess its feasibility in two-dimensional (2D) scenarios. We begin with the generation of four pseudo-2D datasets from the SIMBA dark matter simulation by compressing thin slices of three-dimensional (3D) data into 2D. We then calculate the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) directly from the particle distributions, identify local maxima that represent actual halos, and segment the CWT to delineate halo boundaries. A comparison with the traditional Friends-of-Friends (FOF) method shows that our CWT-identified halos, while containing slightly fewer particles, have smoother boundaries and are more compact in dense regions. In contrast, the CWT method can link particles over greater distances to form halos in sparse regions due to its spatial segmentation scheme. The spatial distribution and halo power spectrum of both CWT and FOF halos demonstrate substantial consistency, validating the 2D applicability of CWT for halo detection. Our identification scheme operates with a linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, suggesting its suitability for analyzing significantly larger datasets in the future.</description>

      <title>Gravitational collapse and gravitational wave in Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet theory with two scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational collapse to form the black hole in the acceleratingly expanding universe in the frame of Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet theory having two scalar fields and we study the propagation of the gravitational wave (GW). The collapsing spacetime can be obtained by using the formulation of the ``reconstruction'', that is, we find a model that realises the desired or given geometry. In the reconstructed models, ghosts often appear, which could be eliminated by imposing constraints. We show that the standard cosmological solutions or self-gravitating objects such as a planet, the Sun, various types of stars, etc., in Einstein's gravity, are also solutions in this model. Using the dynamical value of Gauss-Bonnet coupling, the propagation of the high-frequency GW is investigated. The propagating speed changes due to the coupling during the period of the black hole formation. The speed at which the GW propagates The speed at which the GW propagates going into the black hole is different from that of the wave going out.</description>

      <title>Echo-free quality factor of a multilayer axion haloscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a methodology to determine the quality factor ($Q$) in implementations of the so-called dielectric haloscope, a new concept of wavy dark matter detector equipped with a multilayered resonator. An anechoic chamber enables the observation of the resonance frequency and its amplitude for an unlimited series of layers for the first time, which is conveniently filtered. The frequency-normalized power enhancement measured in a Dark-photons \&amp; Axion-Like particles Interferometer (DALI) prototype is a few hundred per layer over a sweep bandwidth of half a hundred MHz. In light of this result, this scaled-down prototype is sensitive to axions saturating the local dark matter density with a coupling to photons between $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ and $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim$ few $\times 10^{-14}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at frequencies of several dozens of GHz once cooled down to the different working temperatures of the experiment and immersed in magnetic fields ranging from 1 T to 10 T; while the sensitivity of the full-scale DALI is projected at $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim\mathrm{few}\times10^{-15}$ GeV$^{-1}$ over the entire 25--250 {\mu}eV range since $Q\gtrsim10^4$ is expected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nontopological fermionic solitons exist across a diverse range of particle physics models and have rich cosmological implications. This study establishes a general framework for calculating fermionic soliton profiles under arbitrary scalar potentials, utilizing relativistic mean field theory to accurately depict the interaction between the fermion condensate and the background scalar field. Within this framework, the conventional fermion bound states are revealed as a subset of fermionic solitons. In addition, we demonstrate how the analytical formulae in previous studies are derived as special cases of our algorithm, discussing the validity of such approximations. Furthermore, we explore the phenomenology of fermionic solitons, highlighting new formation mechanisms and evolution paths, and reconsidering the possibility of collapse into primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Inflationary complexity of thermal state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the inflationary complexity of the two-mode squeezed state with thermal effect for the single field inflation, modified dispersion relation, and non-trivial sound speed with the method of closed system and open system, respectively, which our analysis is valid for most inflationary models. First, the numeric of Krylov complexity in the method of the closed system indicates that the evolution of Krylov complexity highly depends on the squeezed angle parameter once taking the thermal effect into account, which will decay into some very tiny values, but the Krylov complexity will always enhance without thermal effect. For comparison, the numeric of circuit complexity shows that the evolution is always increasing no matter whether there are thermal effects or not which is independent of the evolution of squeezed angle parameter. By utilizing the method of open system, we first construct the wave function. As for the Krylov complexity with the method of open system, our investigations show the evolution of Krylov complexity will enhance upon some peaks factoring in the thermal effects. For completeness, we also calculate the Krylov entropy in the method of closed system and open system, which indicates that the hotter universe, the more chaotic the universe. Furthermore, our derivation for the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy could nicely recover into the case of closed system under weak dissipative approximation, which confirms the validity of construction for the wave function. Finally, our numeric of Lanczos coefficient shows that the non-trivial sound speed has minimal chaos compared to the other two cases.</description>

Abstract: The Hubble constant, $H_0$, tension is the tension among the local probes, Supernovae Ia, and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. It has been almost a decade, and this tension still puzzles the community. Here, we add intermediate redshift probes, such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) and Quasars (QS0s), to check if and to what extent these higher redshift probes can reduce this tension. We use the three-dimensional fundamental plane relation among the prompt peak luminosity, the luminosity at the end of the plateau emission, and its rest frame duration. We find similar trend in GRB intrinsic parameters as previously seen in Pantheon-Plus intrinsic parameters. We find an apparent $3.14\sigma$ tension for the GRB intrinsic parameter $b$. Indeed, this tension disappears and the parameters are actually compatible within $2.26\sigma$. Another interesting point is that the 3D relation plays an important role in conjunction with Supernovae data with Pantheon Plus and that this apparent discrepancy show how it is important the correction for selection biases and redshift evolution. The incorporation of redshift evolution correction results in a reduction of the GRB tension to $2.26\sigma$ when adjusting correction parameters. We envision that with more data this indication of tension will possibly disappear when the evolutionary parameters of GRBs are computed with increased precision.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Streamlining Time-Domain and Multi-Messenger Astronomy Follow-Up Infrastructure at Keck Observatory</title>

Abstract: With active time-domain surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility, the anticipated Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and multi-messenger experiments such as LIGO/VIRGO/KANGRA for gravitational wave detection and IceCube for high-energy neutrino events, there is a new era in both time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy. The Astro2020 decadal survey highlights effectively responding to these astronomical alerts in a timely manner as a priority, and thus, there is an urgent need for the development of a seamless follow-up infrastructure at existing facilities that are capable of following up on detections at the survey depths. At the W. M. Keck Observatory (WMKO), we are actively constructing critical infrastructure, aimed at facilitating the Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) trigger, optimizing observational planning, streamlining data acquisition, and enhancing data product accessibility. In this document, we provide an overview of these developing services and place them in context of existing observatory infrastructure like the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) and Data Services Initiative (DSI).</description>

      <title>The impact of peculiar velocities on supernova cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.10420v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of 'peculiar' velocities due to the formation of cosmic structure marks a point of discord between the real Universe and the usually assumed Friedmann-Lema\'{i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric which accomodates only the smooth Hubble expansion on large scales. In the standard $\Lambda$CDM model framework, Type Ia supernovae data are routinely "corrected" for the peculiar velocities of both the observer and the supernova host galaxies relative to the cosmic rest frame, in order to infer evidence for acceleration of the expansion rate from their Hubble diagram. However observations indicate a strong, coherent local bulk flow that continues outward without decaying out to a redshift $z \gtrsim 0.1$, contrary to the $\Lambda$CDM expectation. By querying the halo catalogue of the Dark Sky Hubble-volume N-body simulation, we find that an observer placed in an unusual environment like our local Universe should see correlations between supernovae in the JLA catalogue that are 2-8 times stronger than seen by a typical or Copernican observer. This accounts for our finding that peculiar velocity corrections have a large impact on the value of the Cosmological Constant inferred from supernova data. We also demonstrate that local Universe-like observers will infer a downward biased value of the clustering parameter $S_8$ from comparing the density and velocity fields. More realistic modelling of the peculiar local Universe is thus essential for correctly interpreting cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Subaru HSC weak lensing of SDSS redMaPPer cluster satellite galaxies: Empirical upper limit on orphan fractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.00018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing directly probes the matter distribution surrounding satellite galaxies in galaxy clusters. We measure the weak lensing signal induced on the shapes of background galaxies around SDSS redMaPPer cluster satellite galaxies, which have their central galaxies assigned with a probability $P_{\rm cen}&gt;0.95$ in the redshift range, $0.1\leq z\leq 0.33$. We use the galaxy shapes from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey for this purpose. We bin satellite galaxies by their distance from the cluster centre and compare it to the signal around a control sample of galaxies which do not reside in clusters but have similar colours and magnitudes. We explore the effect of environmental processes on the dark matter mass around satellites. We see hints of a difference in the mass of the subhalo of the satellite compared to the halo masses of galaxies in our control sample, especially in the innermost cluster-centric radial bin ($0.1&lt;r&lt;0.3$ [$h^{-1}\rm Mpc$]). For the first time, we put an upper limit on the prevalence of orphan galaxies which have entirely lost their dark matter halos with cluster-centric distances with the help of our measurements. However, these upper limits could be relaxed if there is substantial contamination in the satellite galaxy sample.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing the Primordial Black Holes Interpretation of PTA Gravitational Waves and JWST Early Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations have granted to us two unique insights into the early universe: the presence of a low-frequency stochastic gravitational wave background detected by the NANOGrav and Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments and the emergence of unusually massive galaxy candidates at high redshifts reported by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this letter, we consider the possibility that both observations have a common origin, namely primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mass range between $10^{6}~M_{\odot}$ and $10^{13}~M_{\odot}$. While superheavy PBHs act as seeds for accelerated galaxy formation capable of explaining the JWST extreme galaxies, they can also form binary mergers that source gravitational waves which can be potentially identified as the PTA signal. The analysis is performed taking into account the constraints on the relevant region of the PBH parameter space including the novel bound imposed by the Ultraviolet Luminosity Function of galaxies observed by the Hubble Space Telescope. We conclude that PTA's and JWST's interpretations in terms of PBH binary mergers and Poissonian gas of PBHs, respectively, are strongly excluded.</description>

      <title>Observational Feasibility of 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology: Bouncing and Non-Bouncing Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the possibility of bouncing and non-bouncing universes in the framework of four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4D-EGB) gravity, corresponding respectively to negative and positive coupling constants $\lambda$ of the Gauss-Bonnet term. We also use the Horndeski-type scalar-tensor theory to assess the role of a scalar charge $C$ as a geometrical contribution to the radiation in the Universe. We modify the expansion history of the universe to allow for modifications induced by the 4D-EGB gravity. Using Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies as well as various datasets of baryonic acoustic oscillations, we set the upper bounds $\lambda \le 10^{-16} \text{(km/s/Mpc)}^{-2} $ and $\lambda \le 10^{-30} \text{(km/s/Mpc)}^{-2} $ for the non-bouncing and bouncing scenarios. The upper limit in the latter case is mainly driven by the requirement to conservatively respect the thermal history at energy scales of the standard model of particle physics. We also find that the contribution of the geometrical radiation-like term of the model cannot exceed 10\% of the current radiation in the Universe. The possibility of an early inflationary phase produced by a single scalar field is also studied and found to be feasible in both bouncing and non-bouncing scenarios. This study shows the feasibility of a bouncing universe, even with normal matter sector, in the 4D-EGB gravity. More theoretical investigation is required to further explore possible observational predictions of the model that can distinguish between general relativity and 4D-EGB gravity.</description>

      <title>AMICO galaxy clusters in KiDS-DR3: measuring the splashback radius from weak gravitational lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Weak gravitational lensing offers a powerful method to investigate the projected matter density distribution within galaxy clusters, granting crucial insights into the broader landscape of dark matter on cluster scales. Aims. In this study, we make use of the large photometric galaxy cluster data set derived from the publicly available Third Data Release of the Kilo-Degree Survey, along with the associated shear signal. Our primary objective is to model the peculiar sharp transition in the cluster profile slope, that is what is commonly referred to as the splashback radius. The data set under scrutiny includes 6962 galaxy clusters, selected by AMICO - an optimised detection algorithm of galaxy clusters - on the KiDS-DR3 data, in the redshift range of 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.6, all observed at a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 3.5. Methods. Employing a comprehensive Bayesian analysis, we model the stacked excess surface mass density distribution of the clusters. We adopt a model from recent results on numerical simulations that capture the dynamics of both orbiting and infalling materials, separated by the region where the density profile slope undergoes a pronounced deepening. Results. We find that the adopted profile successfully characterizes the cluster masses, consistent with previous works, and models the deepening of the slope of the density profiles measured with weak-lensing data up to the outskirts. Moreover, we measure the splashback radius of galaxy clusters and show that its value is close to the radius within which the enclosed overdensity is 200 times the mean matter density of the Universe, while theoretical models predict a larger value consistent with a low accretion rate. This points to a potential bias of optically selected clusters preferentially characterized by a high density at small scales compared to a pure mass-selected cluster sample.</description>

      <title>Signatures of afterglows from light dark matter boosted by supernova neutrinos in current and future large underground detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supernova neutrino boosted dark matter (SN$\nu$ BDM) and its afterglow effect have been shown to be a promising signature for beyond Standard Model (bSM) physics. The time-evolution feature of SN$\nu$ BDM allows for %the possibly direct inference of DM mass $m_\chi$, and results in significant background suppression with improving sensitivity. This paper extends the earlier study and provides a general framework for computing the SN$\nu$ BDM fluxes for a supernova that occurs at any location in our galaxy. A bSM $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model with its gauge boson coupling to both DM and the second and third generation of leptons is considered, which allows for both DM-$\nu$ and DM-$e$ interactions. Detailed analysis of the temporal profile, angular distribution, and energy spectrum of the SN$\nu$ BDM are performed. Unique signatures in SN$\nu$ BDM allowing extraction of $m_\chi$ and detail features that contain information of the underlying interaction type are discussed. Expected sensitivities on the above new physics model from Super-Kamiokande, Hyper-Kamiokande, and DUNE detections of BDM events induced by the next galactic SN are derived and compared with the existing bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the late-time cosmological dynamics in a simple case of explicit spacetime-symmetry breaking. By expanding in a small symmetry-breaking coefficient we are able to write the Friedmann equations as $\Lambda$CDM + dynamical dark energy, which we show contains logarithmic dependence of the scale factor. We find that the dark energy equation of state displays divergencies and phantom behaviour for certain values of the symmetry-breaking coefficient, where the NEC is also broken. We discuss the adiabatic sound speed of dark energy and compare the model to current constraints using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrisation. Remarkably, although the constraints on the same symmetry-breaking coefficient from e.g. gravitational-wave propagation are orders of magnitude stronger than what we obtain in this paper, we are able to cut those constraints, which are more or less symmetric around zero, in half by showing that same coefficient must be negative (or zero) if one wishes to keep the NEC intact.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Measurement in the Mid-Band with Atom Interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GWs) have been detected in the $\sim$100 Hz and nHz bands, but most of the gravitational spectrum remains unobserved. A variety of detector concepts have been proposed to expand the range of observable frequencies. In this work, we study the capability of GW detectors in the ``mid-band'', the $\sim$30 mHz -- 10 Hz range between LISA and LIGO, to measure the signals from and constrain the properties of ${\sim}$1 -- 100 $M_\odot$ compact binaries. We focus on atom-interferometer-based detectors. We describe a Fisher matrix code, AIMforGW, which we created to evaluate their capabilities, and present numerical results for two benchmarks: terrestrial km-scale detectors, and satellite-borne detectors in medium Earth orbit. Mid-band GW detectors are particularly well-suited to pinpointing the location of GW sources on the sky. We demonstrate that a satellite-borne detector could achieve sub-degree sky localization for any detectable source with chirp mass $\mathcal{M}_c \lesssim 50 M_\odot$. We also compare different detector configurations, including different locations of terrestrial detectors and various choices of the orbit of a satellite-borne detector. As we show, a network of only two terrestrial single-baseline detectors or one single-baseline satellite-borne detector would each provide close-to-uniform sky-coverage, with signal-to-noise ratios varying by less than a factor of two across the entire sky. We hope that this work contributes to the efforts of the GW community to assess the merits of different detector proposals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an eigenfunction method to analyze 161 visual light curves (LCs) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained by the Carnegie Supernova Project to characterize their diversity and host-galaxy correlations. The eigenfunctions are based on the delayed-detonation scenario using three parameters: the LC stretch being determined by the amount of deflagration-burning governing the 56Ni production, the main-sequence mass M_MS of the progenitor white dwarf controlling the explosion energy, and its central density rho_c shifting the 56Ni distribution. Our analysis tool (SPAT) extracts the parameters from observations and projects them into physical space using their allowed ranges M_MS &lt; 8 M_sun, rho_c &lt; 7-8x10^9g/cc. The residuals between fits and individual LC-points are ~ 1-3% for ~ 92% of objects. We find two distinct M_MS groups corresponding to a fast (~ 40-65 Myrs) and a slow(~ 200-500 Myrs) stellar evolution. Most underluminous SNe Ia have hosts with low star formation but high M_MS, suggesting slow evolution times of the progenitor system. 91T-likes SNe show very similar LCs and high M_MS and are correlated to star formation regions, making them potentially important tracers of star formation in the early Universe out to z = 4-11. Some 6% outliers with `non-physical' parameters can be attributed to superluminous SNe Ia and subluminous SNe Ia with hosts of active star formation. For deciphering the SNe Ia diversity and high-precision SNe Ia cosmology, the importance is shown for LCs covering out to ~ 60 days past maximum. Finally, our method and results are discussed within the framework of multiple explosion scenarios, and in light of upcoming surveys.</description>

Abstract: The strongly-coupled system like the quark-hadron transition (if it is of first order) is becoming an active play-yard for the physics of cosmological first-order phase transitions. However, the traditional field theoretic approach to strongly-coupled first-order phase transitions is of great challenge, driving recent efforts from holographic dual theories with explicit numerical simulations. These holographic numerical simulations have revealed an intriguing linear correlation between the phase pressure difference (pressure difference away from the wall) to the non-relativistic terminal velocity of an expanding planar wall, which has been reproduced analytically alongside both cylindrical and spherical walls from perfect-fluid hydrodynamics in our previous study but only for a bag equation of state. We have also found in our previous study a universal quadratic correlation between the wall pressure difference (pressure difference near the bubble wall) to the non-relativistic terminal wall velocity regardless of wall geometries. In this paper, we will generalize these analytic relations between the phase/wall pressure difference and terminal wall velocity into a more realistic equation of state beyond the simple bag model, providing the most general predictions so far for future tests from holographic numerical simulations of strongly-coupled first-order phase transitions</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Randall-Sundrum (RS) II braneworld scenario, general relativity (GR) is modified by adding an extra dimension such that it is indistinguishable from GR in the weak gravity limit. However, such modifications may leave a mark in the strong field regime. We therefore analyze massive scalar perturbations around rotating black holes in the RS II model. Unlike black holes in GR, these braneworld black holes carry a tidal charge that contains information about the extra spatial dimension, and the rotation parameter for such black holes can exceed unity. Through the method of continued fractions, we investigate the quasinormal mode spectra, and the superradiant instabilities associated with the existence of quasibound states, that is, gravitational atoms. In comparison to the four-dimensional Kerr black hole, we report distinctive signatures of the tidal charge and the rotation parameter, which manifest as signals of the extra dimension, on both the fundamental quasinormal mode and the formation of gravitational atoms. These findings offer insights into testing modifications to GR and detecting ultralight bosonic particles around black holes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Metastable Cosmic String Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable cosmic strings appear in models of new physics with a two-step symmetry breaking $G\to H\to 1$, where $\pi_1(H)\neq 0$ and $\pi_1(G)=0$. They decay via the monopole-antimonopole pair creation inside. Conventionally, the breaking rate has been estimated by an infinitely thin string approximation, which requires a large hierarchy between the symmetry breaking scales. In this paper, we reexamine it by taking into account the finite sizes of both the cosmic string and the monopole. We obtain a robust lower limit on the tunneling factor $e^{-S_B}$ even for regimes the conventional estimate is unreliable. In particular, it is relevant to the cosmic string interpretation of the gravitational wave signals recently reported by pulsar timing array experiments.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray Bursts as Distance Indicators by a Statistical Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be probes of the early universe, but currently, only 26% of GRBs observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory GRBs have known redshifts ($z$) due to observational limitations. To address this, we estimated the GRB redshift (distance) via a supervised statistical learning model that uses optical afterglow observed by Swift and ground-based telescopes. The inferred redshifts are strongly correlated (a Pearson coefficient of 0.93) with the observed redshifts, thus proving the reliability of this method. The inferred and observed redshifts allow us to estimate the number of GRBs occurring at a given redshift (GRB rate) to be 8.47-9 $yr^{-1} Gpc^{-1}$ for $1.9&lt;z&lt;2.3$. Since GRBs come from the collapse of massive stars, we compared this rate with the star formation rate highlighting a discrepancy of a factor of 3 at $z&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from the Normalized Velocity Profile of Gaia Wide Binary Stars and Statistical Testing of Newtonian and Milgromian Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-acceleration gravitational anomaly is investigated with a new method of exploiting the normalized velocity profile $\tilde{v}\equiv v_p/v_c$ of wide binary stars as a function of the normalized sky-projected radius $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ where $v_p$ is the sky-projected relative velocity between the pair, $v_c$ is the Newtonian circular velocity at the sky-projected separation $s$, and $r_{\rm{M}}$ is the MOND radius. With a Monte Carlo method Gaia observed binaries and their virtual Newtonian counterparts are probabilistically distributed on the $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ versus $\tilde{v}$ plane and a logarithmic velocity ratio parameter $\Gamma$ is measured in the bins of $s/r_{\rm{M}}$. With three samples of binaries covering a broad range in size, data quality, and implied fraction of hierarchical systems including a new sample of 6389 binaries selected with accurate distances and radial velocities, I find a unanimous systematic variation from the Newtonian flat line. With $\Gamma=0$ at $s/r_{\rm{M}}\lesssim 0.15$ or $s\lesssim 1$~kilo astronomical units (kau), I get $\Gamma=0.068\pm 0.015$ (stat) $_{-0.015}^{+0.024}$ (syst) for $s/r_{\rm{M}} \gtrsim 0.7$ or $s\gtrsim 5$~kau. The gravitational anomaly (i.e.\ acceleration boost) factor given by $\gamma_g = 10^{2\Gamma}$ is measured to be $\gamma_g = 1.37_{-0.09}^{+0.10}$ (stat) $_{-0.09}^{+0.16}$ (syst). With a reduced $\chi^2$ test of Newtonian and Milgromian nonrelativistic theories, I find that Newtonian gravity is ruled out at $5.8\sigma$ ($\chi^2_\nu=9.4$) by the new sample (and $9.2\sigma$ by the largest sample used). The Milgromian AQUAL theory is acceptable with $0.5\lesssim \chi^2_\nu\lesssim 3.1$. These results agree well with earlier results with the ``acceleration-plane analysis'' for a variety of samples and the ``stacked velocity profile analysis'' for a pure binary sample.</description>

      <title>MeV gamma rays from Q-ball decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the supersymmetric Q balls which decay at present and find that they create a distinctive spectrum of gamma rays at around O(10) MeV. The charge of the Q ball is lepton numbers in order for the lifetime to be as long as the present age of the universe, and the main decay products are light leptons. However, as the charge of the Q ball decreases, the decay channel into pions becomes kinematically allowed towards the end of the decay, and the pions are produced at rest. Immediately, $\pi^0$ decays into two photons with the energy of 67.5 MeV, half the pion mass, which exhibits a unique emission line. In addition, $\pi^\pm$ decay into $\mu^\pm$, which further decay with emitting internal bremsstrahlung, whose spectrum has a sharp cutoff at $\sim$50 MeV. If the observations would find these peculiar features of the gamma-ray spectrum in the future, it could be a smoking gun of the supersymmetric Q-ball decay at present.</description>

      <title>A$^3$COSMOS and A$^3$GOODSS: Continuum Source Catalogues and Multi-band Number Counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy submillimetre number counts are a fundamental measurement in our understanding of galaxy evolution models. Most early measurements are obtained via single-dish telescopes with substantial source confusion, whereas recent interferometric observations are limited to small areas. We used a large database of ALMA continuum observations to accurately measure galaxy number counts in multiple (sub)millimetre bands, thus bridging the flux density range between single-dish surveys and deep interferometric studies. We continued the Automated Mining of the ALMA Archive in the COSMOS Field project (A$^3$COSMOS) and extended it with observations from the GOODS-South field (A$^3$GOODSS). The database consists of ~4,000 pipeline-processed continuum images from the public ALMA archive, yielding 2,050 unique detected sources. To infer galaxy number counts, we constructed a method to reduce the observational bias inherent to targeted pointings that dominate the database. This method comprises a combination of image selection, masking, and source weighting. The effective area was calculated by accounting for inhomogeneous wavelengths, sensitivities, and resolutions and for spatial overlap between images. We tested and calibrated our method with simulations. We derived the number counts in a consistent and homogeneous way in four different ALMA bands covering a relatively large area. The results are consistent with number counts from the literature within the uncertainties. In Band 7, at the depth of the inferred number counts, ~40% of the cosmic infrared background is resolved into discrete sources. This fraction, however, decreases with wavelength, reaching ~4% in Band 3. Finally, we used the number counts to test models of dusty galaxy evolution, and find a good agreement within the uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Can nonlocal gravity really explain dark energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11301v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In view to scrutinize the idea that nonlocal modifications of General Relativity could dynamically address the dark energy problem, we investigate the evolution of the Universe at infrared scales as an Infinite Derivative Gravity model of the Ricci scalar, without introducing the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ or any scalar field. The accelerated expansion of the late Universe is shown to be compatible with the emergence of nonlocal gravitational effects at sufficiently low energies. A technique for circumventing the mathematical complexity of the nonlocal cosmological equations is developed and, after drawing a connection with the Starobinsky gravity, verifiable predictions are considered, like a possible decreasing in the strength of the effective gravitational constant. In conclusion, the emergence of nonlocal gravity corrections at given scales could be an efficient mechanism to address the dark energy problem.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Black Hole Shadow with Dark Matter Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has revolutionized our ability to study black holes by providing unprecedented spatial resolution and unveiling horizon-scale details. With advancements leading to the next-generation EHT, there is potential to probe even deeper into the black hole's dark region, especially the inner shadow characterized by low-intensity foreground emissions from the jet, thanks to a significant enhancement in dynamic range by two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate how such enhanced observations could transform supermassive black holes into powerful probes for detecting annihilating dark matter, which can form a dense profile in the vicinity of supermassive black holes, by examining the morphology of the black hole image.</description>
