      <title>Optical conductivity of the Majorana mode at the s- and d-wave topological superconductor edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Majorana fermion offers fascinating possibilities such as non-Abelian statistics and non-local robust qubits, and hunting it is one of the most important topics in current condensed matter physics. Most of the efforts have been focused on the Majorana bound state at zero energy in terms of scanning tunneling spectroscopy searching for the quantized conductance. On the other hand, a chiral Majorana edge channel appears at the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator when engineering an interface between proximity-induced superconductivity and ferromagnetism. Recent advances in microwave spectroscopy of topological edge states open a new avenue for observing signatures of such Majorana edge states through the local optical conductivity. As a guide to future experiments, we show how the local optical conductivity and density of states present distinct qualitative features depending on the symmetry of the superconductivity, that can be tuned via the magnetization and temperature. In particular, the presence of the Majorana edge state leads to a characteristic non-monotonic temperature dependence achieved by tuning the magnetization.</description>

      <title>Einstein-de Haas effect: a bridge linking mechanics, magnetism, and topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein-de Haas (EdH) effect is an interesting phenomenon linking mechanics and magnetism, in which changes in magnetization induce mechanical rotation. Despite being discovered more than a century ago, the EdH effect still shows crucial significance in modern science, particularly in the realms of spintronics and ultrafast magnetism. Recently, it has been predicted that the EdH effect can be realised in topological magnon systems, which undoubtedly brings even richer properties. In this perspective, we aim to review the recent progress of the EdH effect and discuss its developments in three key aspects: the microscopic mechanism of the EdH effect, the EdH effect of topological magnons, and the chiral phonon--magnon conversion. These discussions are poised to inspire further explorations in physics and promising applications in different areas.</description>

      <title>Machine learning analysis of structural data to predict electronic properties in near-surface InAs quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor crosshatch patterns in thin film heterostructures form as a result of strain relaxation processes and dislocation pile-ups during growth of lattice mismatched materials. Due to their connection with the internal misfit dislocation network, these crosshatch patterns are a complex fingerprint of internal strain relaxation and growth anisotropy. Therefore, this mesoscopic fingerprint not only describes the residual strain state of a near-surface quantum well, but also could provide an indicator of the quality of electron transport through the material. Here, we present a method utilizing computer vision and machine learning to analyze AFM crosshatch patterns that exhibits this correlation. Our analysis reveals optimized electron transport for moderate values of $\lambda$ (crosshatch wavelength) and $\epsilon$ (crosshatch height), roughly 1 $\mu$m and 4 nm, respectively, that define the average waveform of the pattern. Simulated 2D AFM crosshatch patterns are used to train a machine learning model to correlate the crosshatch patterns to dislocation density. Furthermore, this model is used to evaluate the experimental AFM images and predict a dislocation density based on the crosshatch waveform. Predicted dislocation density, experimental AFM crosshatch data, and experimental transport characterization are used to train a final model to predict 2D electron gas mean free path. This model shows electron scattering is strongly correlated with elastic effects (e.g. dislocation scattering) below 200 nm $\lambda_{MFP}$.</description>

      <title>Polarizability and plasmons in pseudospin-1 gapped materials with a flat band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective electronic properties of various types of pseudospin-$1$ Dirac-cone materials with a flat band and finite bangaps in their energy spectra are the subject of our reported investigation. Specifically, we have calculated the dynamical polarization, plasmon dispersions as well as their decay rates due to Landau damping. Additionally, we present closed-form analytical expressions for the wave function overlaps for both the gapped dice lattice and the Lieb lattice. The gapped dice lattice is a special case of the more general $\alpha$-${\cal T}_3$ model since its band structure is symmetric and the flat band remains dispersionless. On the other hand, the Lieb lattice has a flat band which appears at the lowest point of its conduction band. Our results for these two cases exhibit unique features in the plasmon spectra and their damping regions, which have never been reported in previous studies. For example, the particle-hole modes of a Lieb lattice appear as finite-size regions, while the plasmon modes exist only in a region with small wave numbers but an extended range of frequencies.</description>

      <title>Coupled Spin and Valley Hall Effect Driven by Coherent Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the coexistence of tunneling spin and valley Hall effects when electrons in graphene coherently transmit through a barrier with broken inversion symmetry and intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Due to the rotation of the pseudospin in the tunneling process, the transmitted electrons acquire a finite spin- and valley-dependent backreflection geometric phase when the two interfaces of the barrier are asymmetric. This results in a spin- and valley-dependent skew coherent tunneling, which is responsible for the transverse spin and valley Hall currents. We further demonstrate that the coherent-tunneling assisted charge-spin and charge-valley conversions are highly efficient with large Hall angles. Our work provides a new route for the generation of efficient spin and valley Hall effects, suggesting potential applications for spintronic and valleytronic devices.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of terahertz conductivity in a gated monolayer semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors and their moir\'e superlattices have emerged as important platforms for investigating correlated electrons. However, many key properties of these systems, such as the frequency-dependent conductivity, remain experimentally inaccessible because of the mesoscopic sample size. Here we report a technique to directly measure the complex conductivity of electrostatically gated two-dimensional semiconductors in the terahertz frequency range. Applying this technique to a WSe2 monolayer encapsulated in hBN, we observe clear Drude-like response between 0.1 and 1 THz, in a density range challenging to access even in DC transport. Our work opens a new avenue for studying tunable van der Waals heterostructures using terahertz spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Pulsed magnetic field gradient on a tip for nanoscale imaging of spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging (nanoMRI) aims at obtaining structure at the single molecule level. Most of the techniques for effecting a nanoMRI gradient use small permanent magnets. Here, we present a switchable magnetic field gradient on a tip, which is designed to provide a local and controllable magnetic field with a high gradient on the nanometer scale. We incorporate the gradient field with a nanoscale magnetic resonance sensor, a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, to provide high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. The device is a metal microwire deposited along a quartz tip, with the current flowing along the tip inducing a magnetic field around its apex. This field can be manipulated throughout a measurement by controlling the current along the wire. We achieved gradients as high as 1 $\mathrm{\mu}\text{T/nm}$ at fields weaker than 200 $\mathrm{\mu}\text{T}$. Such a gradient can facilitate electron spin mapping with 1 nm resolution using single NV sensors, allowing for nanoscale imaging of electrons. The ability to switch the current on and off and to position the device with high precision overcomes limitations such as limited emitter contrast and the flexibility in sample preparation. Moreover, we show that proximity of the metallic tip to the sensor modifies the Rabi power in a spatially dependent manner, providing regions with enhanced ($\times$3.5) and decreased Rabi power. This spatial gradient, induced by the tip, offers the opportunity for selective pulses on nearby spin species where the same microwave power will result in different spin manipulation characteristics.</description>

      <title>Observation of Transient Trion Induced by Ultrafast Charge Transfer in Graphene/MoS2 Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (Vdw) heterostructures constructed from TMDCs provide an ideal platform for exploring various quasiparticle behaviors, with trion-composed of neutral exciton and charged carrier-being a notable example. There are typically three methods to generate trion: electrical doping, chemical doping, and direct optical doping. The first two methods generate static trion, while the last gives rise to transient trion. Here, we present an indirect optical doping approach to generate transient trion via ultrafast charge transfer (CT) and achieve control over the trion-to-exciton ratio by adjusting CT in Gr/MoS2 heterostructure. Furthermore, we demonstrated that dynamics of the transient trion generated with this method, which shows slightly longer lifetime than that of exciton accounted for the Coulomb interactions between trion and charged defect. This study provides fresh perspectives on the construction of new quasiparticles, dynamical characterization and the control of the many-body interaction in two-dimensional structure.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Order in $R_3\text{Ni}_{30}\text{B}_{10}$ $(R = \text{La}, \text{Ce})$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of single crystals of the $R_3\text{Ni}_{30}\text{B}_{10}$ $(R = \text{La}, \text{Ce})$ system which realizes the tetragonal $P4/nmm$ (No. 129) space group. We performed single crystal, transmission X-ray diffraction measurements to determine the crystal structure. Additionally, we characterized the samples through magnetization, resistivity, and heat capacity measurements. The $R = \text{Ce}$ system exhibits mixed-valence states and we observe maxima in the heat capacity at $T_1^* = 6 \, \text{K}$ and $T_2^* = 2 \, \text{K}$ (both absent for $R = \text{La}$) with no corresponding features in the resistivity or magnetization. We discuss the potential roles of multipolar and short-ranged/partial order in connection to the $T_1^*$ anomalous order.</description>

      <title>Spin-Dependent Signatures of Majorana Vortex Fusion within Planar Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic characteristics and tunnelling signatures of a planar Josephson junction with Rashba spin-orbit coupling during the fusion of two Majorana vortices. By employing the topological phase diagram and conducting tight-binding simulations of the proposed device, we demonstrate that this fusion process induces a parity-dependent magnetic moment aligned with the junction axis. We further propose a method to probe the spin properties of the fusing Majorana zero modes through spin-resolved Andreev conductance measurements at the junction endpoints. To support our findings, we derive a low-energy effective Hamiltonian that provides a detailed microscopic description of the numerically observed phenomena. Our analysis enables the detection of Majorana fusion outcome from accessible spin current measurements, thus paving the way for future experimental verification and potential applications in topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>All-optical magnetometric characterization of the antiferromagnetic exchange-spring system Mn$_2$Au|Py by terahertz spin-torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic materials have great potential for spintronic applications at terahertz (THz) frequencies. However, in contrast to ferromagnets, experimental studies of antiferromagnets are often challenging due to a lack of straightforward external control of the N\'eel vector $\mathbf{L}$. Here, we study an AFM|FM stack consisting of an antiferromagnetic metal layer (AFM) of the novel material Mn2Au and a ferromagnetic metal layer (FM) of NiFe. In this exchange-spring system, $\mathbf{L}$ of AFM Mn2Au can be controlled by the application of an external magnetic field B_ext. To characterize the AFM|FM stack as a function of the quasi-static $\mathbf{B}_{\mathrm{ext}}$, we perform THz-pump magneto-optic probe experiments. We identify signal components that can consistently be explained by the in-plane antiferromagnetic magnon mode excited by field-like N\'eel spin-orbit torques (NSOTs). Remarkably, we find that the $\mathbf{B}_{\mathrm{ext}}$- and THz-pump-induced changes in the optical response of the sample are dominated exclusively by the spin degrees of freedom of AFM. We fully calibrate the magnetic circular and magnetic linear optical birefringence of AFM and extract the efficiency of the NSOTs. Finally, by selective excitation of domains with different orientation of $\mathbf{L}$, we are able to determine the relative volume fraction of 0{\deg}, 90{\deg}, 180{\deg} and 270{\deg} domains distribution during the quasi-static reversal of $\mathbf{L}$ by $\mathbf{B}_{\mathrm{ext}}$. Our insights are an important prerequisite for future studies of ultrafast coherent switching of spins by THz NSOTs and show that THz-pump magneto-optic-probe experiments are a powerful tool to characterize magnetic properties of antiferromagnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable quantum simulators based on neutral atom arrays today offer powerful platforms for studying strongly correlated phases of quantum matter. Here, we employ the projective symmetry group framework to describe the symmetry fractionalization patterns in a topologically ordered $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) synthesized in such a Rydberg array on the ruby lattice. By systematically comparing the static structure factors of $\textit{all}$ possible mean-field $\textit{Ans\"atze}$ against density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we identify a promising candidate for the precise $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ QSL realized microscopically. We also present detailed analyses of the dynamical structure factors as a reference for future experiments and showcase how these spin correlations can differentiate between varied QSL $\textit{Ans\"atze}$.</description>

      <title>Detecting axion dynamics on the surface of magnetic topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions, initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem, have recently gained attention in condensed matter physics, particularly in topological insulators. However, detecting axion dynamics has proven challenging, with no experimental confirmations to date. In this study, we identify the surface of magnetic topological insulators as an ideal platform for observing axion dynamics. The vanishing bulk gap at the surface allows for order $O(1)$ variations in the axion field, making the detection of axion-like phenomena more feasible. In contrast, these phenomena are strongly suppressed in the bulk due to the small magnetic exchange gap. We investigate two-photon decay as a signature of axion dynamics and calculate the branching ratio using a perturbative approach. Our findings reveal that the photon flux emitted from the surface is in-plane and orders of magnitude larger than that from the bulk, making it detectable with modern microwave technology. We also discuss potential material platforms for detecting axion two-photon decay and strategies to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Reduction of Electrical Resistivity in Ultrathin Non-Crystalline NbP Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrical resistivity of conventional metals, such as copper, is known to increase in thinner films due to electron-surface scattering, limiting the performance of metals in nanoscale electronics. Here, we uncover an exceptional reduction of resistivity with decreasing film thickness in NbP semimetal, deposited at relatively low temperatures of 400 {\deg}C. In sub-5 nm thin films, we find a significantly lower resistivity (~34 uOhm.cm for 1.5 nm thin NbP, at room temperature) than in the bulk form, and lower than conventional metals at similar thickness. Remarkably, the NbP films are not crystalline, but display local nanocrystalline, short-range order within an amorphous matrix. Our analysis suggests that the lower resistivity is due to conduction through surface channels, together with high surface carrier density and sufficiently good mobility, as the film thickness is reduced. These results and the fundamental insights obtained here could enable ultrathin, low-resistivity wires for nanoelectronics, beyond the limitations of conventional metals.</description>

      <title>Revealing the phonon bottleneck limit in negatively charged CdS quantum dots</title>

Abstract: The capture of photoexcited hot electrons in semiconductors before they lose their excess energy to cooling is a long-standing goal in photon energy conversion. Semiconductor nanocrystals have large electron energy spacings that are expected to slow down electron relaxation by phonon emission, but hot electrons in photoexcited nanocrystals nevertheless cool rapidly by energy transfer to holes. This makes the intrinsic phonon-bottleneck limited electron lifetime in nanocrystals elusive. We used a combination of theory and experiments to probe the hot electron dynamics of negatively charged Cadmium Sulfide (CdS) colloidal quantum dots (QDs) in the absence of holes. Experiments found that these hot electrons cooled on a 100 ps timescale. Theoretical simulations predicted that pure phonon-bottleneck limited electron cooling occurs on a similar timescale. This similarity suggests that the experimental measurements reflect the upper limit on hot electron lifetimes in these CdS QDs and the lower limit on the rates of processes that can harvest those hot electrons.</description>

      <title>Optically Coherent Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in HPHT Treated Diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a point defect with unique spin and optical properties, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has attracted much attention in the fields of quantum sensing, quantum simulation, and quantum networks. The optical properties of an NV center are crucial for all these quantum applications. However, NV centers fabricated by destructive methods such as electron irradiation or ion implantation usually exhibit poor optical coherence. In this work, we demonstrate a non-destructive method to fabricate optically coherent NV centers. High-purity single crystal diamonds are annealed under high pressure and high temperature (1700 $^{\circ}$C, 5.5 GPa), and individually resolvable NV centers with narrow PLE linewidth (&lt;100 MHz) are produced. The high-pressure condition prevents the conversion of diamond to graphite during high-temperature annealing, significantly expanding the parameter space for creating high-performance artificial defects for quantum information science. These findings deepen our understanding of NV center formation in diamond and have implications for the optimization of color centers in solids, including silicon carbide and hexagonal boron nitride.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-dependent anisotropic light-matter interaction in 2D ferroelectric In2Se3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anisotropic light-matter interactions in 2D materials have garnered significant attention for their potential to develop futuristic polarization-based optoelectronic devices, such as photodetectors and photo-actuators. In this study, we investigate the polarization-dependent interactions in ferroelectric 3R alpha-In2Se3 using Angle-Resolved Polarized Raman Spectroscopy (ARPRS) with different excitation lasers. Our experimental findings supported by complementary Density Functional Theory calculations demonstrate that the light-matter interactions depend not only on the crystallographic orientation but also on the excitation energy. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirms the highly anisotropic 3R crystal structure of alpha-In2Se3. This anisotropy in crystal structure facilitates significant optical anisotropy, driven by a complex interplay of electron-photon and electron-phonon interactions, which is reflected in the complex nature of the Raman tensor elements. These anisotropy interactions extend to the materials electrical response under light illumination. Remarkably, the anisotropic photo-response can be tuned by both polarization and wavelength of the incident light, making In2Se3 a promising material for advanced polarization-sensitive photodetection applications.</description>

      <title>Core-hole induced misalignment between Van-Hove singularities and K-edge fine structure in carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the K-edge fine structure of isolated single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and the Van Hove singularities (VHSs) in the conduction band density of states. To this end, we model X-ray absorption spectra of SWCNTs using the final-state approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) method. Both methods can reproduce the experimental fine structure, where the BSE results improve on peak positions and amplitude rations compared to the final-state approximation. When the fine structure in the modeled spectra is related to the VHSs significant differences are found. We suggest that these differences arise due to modifications of the core exciton wavefunctions induced by the confinement along the circumference. Additionally, we analyze the character of core excitons in SWCNTs and find that the first bright excitons are Frenkel excitons while higher-lying excitons are charge resonance states. Finally, we suggest that the qualitative picture based on VHSs in the density of states holds when there is a large energy gap between successive VHSs.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal DC Conductivity in Dirac Nodal Line Semimetals: Intrinsic and Extrinsic Contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nodal line semimetals, a class of topological quantum materials, exhibit a variety of novel phenomena due to their properties, such as bands touching on a one-dimensional line or a ring in the Brillouin zone and drumhead-like surface states. In addition, these semimetals are protected by the combined space-inversion and time-reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. In this study, we investigate the longitudinal DC conductivity of the Dirac nodal line semimetals for the broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system by the mass term. Here, using the quantum kinetic technique, we find the intrinsic (field-driven) and extrinsic (scattering-driven) contributions to the total DC conductivity due to interband effects. Interestingly, the resulting intrinsic conductivity is the Fermi sea contribution, while the extrinsic stems from the Fermi surface contribution. We show that at low chemical potential, the extrinsic part contributes more and dominates over the traditional Drude intraband term, while at the high chemical potential, the intrinsic conductivity contributes. Furthermore, the total DC response due to interband effects saturates at high chemical potential and its strength decreases with increasing mass value. Our findings suggest that the extrinsic contributions are rich enough to understand the overall feature of the response for the three-dimensional system.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional nanoscale control of magnetism in crystalline Yttrium Iron Garnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exceptional magnetic, optical and phononic properties of Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) make it unique for spin-wave based and photonic applications. Yet, nanostructuring crystalline YIG and manipulating its magnetism in a non-destructive way is an outstanding challenge, and so far mostly limited to two-dimensional capabilities. Here, we show that irradiation of single-crystal YIG films with a focused UV laser drives a stable, giant enhancement of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, preserving the crystalline quality. This modulation is highly confined at the nanoscale in both the lateral and vertical directions, and its extension within the volume can be finely tuned with a continuous depth-control. By harnessing these three-dimensional anisotropy profiles, we demonstrate a large tuning of the spin-wave band structure, volume spatial localization, and non-reciprocity, realizing proof-of-principle 3D magnonic crystals. This straightforward, single-step, laser nanofabrication of three-dimensional magnetic systems based on crystalline YIG thin films opens the way to design novel functions in magnonic and magneto-optic devices.</description>

      <title>Electric Control of Polarity in Spin-Orbit Josephson Diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect (JDE), characterized by a unidirectional supercurrent across a Josephson junction, arises from non-reciprocal critical currents typically controlled by magnetic fields. In this study, we demonstrate JDE controlled by local electric fields, achieving complete polarity reversal through gate voltages on epitaxial Al-InAs Josephson junctions. Our observations reveal intricate effects of in-plane magnetic fields and gate voltages on the JDE. We develop a theoretical model that considers the coherent interplay between finite Cooper-pair momentum (fCPM) and anisotropic spin-orbit coupling (SOC), identifying that fCPM dominates JDE at low in-plane magnetic fields, while SOC governs its polarity reversal at high fields. This model aligns well with experimental data, illustrating precise electric control of JDE polarity through anisotropic SOC. These findings introduce a novel approach to controlling superconducting circuits, paving a route toward advanced applications in superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Material-realistic modelling of quantum many-body effects in a monolayer TMDC nanolaser device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient light-matter interaction in combination with the small volume occupied by monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) makes this material class a notable option as gain layer in future opto-electronic devices. Many-body effects of excited carriers influence the emission dynamics due to the introduction of optical non-linearities following excitation, but the exact mechanisms remain unexamined from a theoretical point of view. In this paper, we present a material-realistic microscopic theory of a device based on an MoS2-monolayer, which demonstrates stimulated emission activity at room temperature. The modelling procedure combines Coulomb and light-matter interaction matrix elements with doublet-level Quantum Laser Equations (QLEs). These give access to the dynamics of the photon-assisted polarisation, populations, and photon number while allowing the solution of a multi-scale problem ranging from femto- to nanoseconds. The input-output curve, hole burning and spectral clamping obtained from this theory present strong indications of electron-hole-plasma-based lasing occurring at densities above $5 \cdot 10^{13}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$ in this device.</description>

      <title>Competing Ordinary and Hanle Magnetoresistance in Pt and Ti Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key elements in spintronics research is the spin Hall effect, allowing to generate spin currents from charge currents. A large spin Hall effect is observed in materials with strong spin orbit coupling, e.g., Pt. Recent research suggests the existence of an orbital Hall effect, the orbital analogue to the spin Hall effect, which also arises in weakly spin orbit coupled materials like Ti, Mn or Cr. In Pt both effects are predicted to coexist. In any of these materials, a magnetic field perpendicular to the spin or orbital accumulation leads to additional Hanle dephasing and thereby the Hanle magnetoresistance (MR). To reveal the MR behavior of a material with both spin and orbital Hall effect, we thus study the MR of Pt thin films over a wide range of thicknesses. Careful evaluation shows that the MR of our textured samples is dominated by the ordinary MR rather than by the Hanle effect. We analyze the intrinsic properties of Pt films deposited by different groups and show that next to the resistivity also the structural properties of the film influence which MR dominates. We further show that this correlation can be found in both spin Hall active materials like Pt and orbital Hall active materials, like Ti. For both materials, the crystalline samples shows a MR attributed to the ordinary MR, whereas we find a large Hanle MR for the samples without apparent structural order. We then provide a set of rules to distinguish between the ordinary and the Hanle MR. We conclude that in all materials with a spin or orbital Hall effect the Hanle MR and the ordinary MR coexist and the purity and crystallinity of the thin film determine the dominating effect.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Charge Density Wave Proximity Effect in Graphene on 1T-TaS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proximity-effect, whereby materials in contact appropriate each others electronic-properties, is widely used to induce correlated states, such as superconductivity or magnetism, at heterostructure interfaces. Thus far however, demonstrating the existence of proximity-induced charge-density-waves (PI-CDW) proved challenging. This is due to competing effects, such as screening or co-tunneling into the parent material, that obscured its presence. Here we report the observation of a PI-CDW in a graphene layer contacted by a 1T-TaS2 substrate. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) together with theoretical-modeling, we show that the coexistence of a CDW with a Mott gap in 1T-TaS2 coupled with the Dirac-dispersion of electrons in graphene, makes it possible to unambiguously demonstrate the PI-CDW by ruling out alternative interpretations. Furthermore, we find that the PI-CDW is accompanied by a reduction of the Mott gap in 1T-TaS2 and show that the mechanism underlying the PI-CDW is well-described by short-range exchange-interactions that are distinctly different from previously observed proximity effects.</description>

Abstract: Carbon-based nanostructures have unparalleled electronic properties. At the same time, using an allotrope of carbon as the contacts can yield better device control and reproducibility. In this work, we simulate a single-electron transistor composed of a segment of a graphene nanoribbon coupled to carbon nanotubes electrodes. Using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism we atomistically describe the electronic transport properties of the system including electron-electron interactions. Using this methodology we are able to recover experimentally observed phenomena, such as the Coulomb blockade, as well as the corresponding Coulomb diamonds. Furthermore, we are able to separate the different contributions to transport and show that incoherent effects due to the interaction play a crucial role in the transport properties depending on the region of the stability diagram being considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetries -- whether explicit, latent, or hidden -- are fundamental to understanding topological materials. This work introduces a prototypical spring-mass model that extends beyond established canonical models, revealing topological edge states with distinct profiles at opposite edges. These edge states originate from hidden symmetries that become apparent only in deformation coordinates, as opposed to the conventional displacement coordinates used for bulk-boundary correspondence. Our model, realized through the intricate connectivity of a spinner chain, demonstrates experimentally distinct edge states at opposite ends. By extending this framework to two dimensions, we explore the conditions required for such edge waves and their hidden symmetry in deformation coordinates. We also show that these edge states are robust against disorders that respect the hidden symmetry. This research paves the way for advanced material designs with tailored boundary conditions and edge state profiles, offering potential applications in fields such as photonics, acoustics, and mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>High fidelity macroscopic superposition states via shortcut to adiabaticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A shortcut to an adiabatic scheme is proposed for preparing a massive object in a macroscopic spatial superposition state. In this scheme we propose to employ counterdiabatic driving to maintain the system in the ground state of its instantaneous Hamiltonian while the trap potential is tuned from a parabola to a double well. This, in turn, is performed by properly ramping a control parameter. We show that a few counterdiabatic drives are enough for most practical cases. A hybrid electromechanical setup in superconducting circuits is proposed for the implementation. The efficiency of our scheme is benchmarked by numerically solving the system dynamics in the presence of noises and imperfections. The results show that a mechanical resonator with very-high-fidelity spatially distinguishable cat states can be prepared with our protocol. Furthermore, the protocol is robust against noises and imperfections. We also discuss a method for verifying the final state via spectroscopy of a coupled circuit electrodynamical cavity mode. Our work can serve as the ground work to feasibly realize and verify macroscopic superposition states in future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that three different generalized similarities enclose all unitary and anti-unitary symmetries that induce exceptional points in lower-dimensional non-Hermitian systems. We prove that the generalized similarity conditions result in a larger class of systems than any class defined by a unitary or anti-unitary symmetry. Further we highlight that the similarities enforce spectral symmetry on the Hamiltonian resulting in a reduction of the codimension of exceptional points. As a consequence we show that the similarities drive the emergence of exceptional points in lower dimensions without the more restrictive need for a unitary and/or anti-unitary symmetry.</description>

Abstract: In the past decade, detection of THz radiation by plasma-wave-assisted frequency mixing in antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs) -- implemented in various semiconductor material systems (Si CMOS, GaN/AlGaN, GaAs/AlGaAs, graphene, etc.) -- has matured and led to a practically applied detector technology. This has been supported by the development of powerful device simulation tools which take into account relevant collective carrier dynamics and mixing processes in various approximations. These tools mostly model carrier transport in 1D and they are usually geared towards continuous-wave illumination of the device and small-signal response. Depending on their implementation, it may not be possible readily to simulate large-signal and pulsed operation. Another approximation which may lead to unsatisfactory results is the 1D restriction to calculate only the longitudinal electric field components. Especially at the edges of the gate electrode, solving of the 2D Poisson equation promises better results. This contribution introduces a stable way to solve the 2D Poisson equation self-consistently with the hydrodynamic transport equations including the numerically challenging convection term. We employ a well-balanced approximate Harten-Lax-van-Leer-Contact Riemann solver. The approach is well suited for a future treatment of transient and large-signal cases as well as the Dyakonov-Shur instability. The 2D treatment also generically extends the model beyond the gradual-channel approximation and allows to calculate the FET's response at high THz frequencies where the gate-to-channel potential acquires a non-local character. Model calculations are performed for the exemplary case of a 65-nm Si CMOS TeraFET in the isothermal approximation.</description>

      <title>Influence of capacitance and thermal fluctuations on the Josephson diode effect in asymmetric higher-harmonic SQUIDs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric two-junction SQUIDs with different current-phase relations in the two Josephson junctions, involving higher Josephson harmonics, demonstrate a flux-tunable Josephson diode effect (asymmetry between currents flowing in the opposite directions, which can be tuned by the magnetic flux through the interferometer loop). We theoretically investigate influence of junction capacitance and thermal fluctuations on performance of such Josephson diodes. Our main focus is on the "minimal model" with one junction in the SQUID loop possessing the sinusoidal current-phase relation and the other one featuring additional second harmonic. Capacitance generally weakens the diode effect in the resistive branch (R state) of the current-voltage characteristic (CVC) both in the absence and in the presence of external ac irradiation. At the same time, it leads to qualitatively new features of the Josephson diode effect such as asymmetry of the retrapping currents (which are a manifestation of hysteretic CVC). In particular, the limiting case of the single-sided hysteresis becomes accessible. In its turn, thermal fluctuations are known to lead to nonzero average voltages at any finite current, even below the critical value. We demonstrate that in the diode regime, the fluctuation-induced voltage can become strongly (exponentially) asymmetric. In addition, we find asymmetry of the switching currents arising both due to thermal activation and due to Josephson plasma resonances in the presence of ac irradiation.</description>

      <title>Emergent Multifunctionality in Two-Dimensional Janus VSBrI Monolayer: A Study of Multiferroicity, Magnetoelectricity, and Piezoelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02407v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Janus VSBrI monolayer, identified by first-principles calculations, emerges as a promising semiconducting material with desirable ferromagnetic and ferroelectric properties. It's in-plane magnetic anisotropic energy is up to 460 $\mu$eV/V , and in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric strain coefficients are larger than many other known two-dimensional materials. The energy variations among different magnetic states show a strong correlate with polarization. Interestingly, the stability of the ferroelectric phase can be further enhanced by the application of biaxial tensile strain. These intriguing properties make the Janus VSBrI monolayer highly desirable for practical applications in piezoelectronic devices, and a promising candidate for multifunctional spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect in one-dimensional quantum wires connected to superconductors with mixed singlet-triplet pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02794</link>

Abstract: The Josephson diode effect (JDE), characterized by asymmetric critical currents in a Josephson junction, has drawn considerable attention in the field of condensed matter physics. We investigate the conditions under which JDE can manifest in a one-dimensional Josephson junction composed of a spin-orbit-coupled quantum wire with an applied Zeeman field, connected between two superconductors. Our study reveals that while spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and a Zeeman field in the quantum wire are not sufficient to induce JDE when the superconductors are purely singlet, the introduction of triplet pairing in the superconductors leads to the emergence of JDE. This finding highlights the potential of JDE as a probe for triplet superconductivity. We further demonstrate that even in absence of SOC in the quantum wire, JDE can arise when the directions of the triplet pairing and the Zeeman field are non-collinear, provided the superconductors exhibit mixed singlet-triplet pairing. Additionally, we identify specific conditions under which JDE is absent, namely, when the pairing is purely triplet and the directions of the SOC and the triplet pairing are perpendicular. Our findings indicate that JDE is always accompanied by anomalous Josephson effect. The diode effect coefficient is found to oscillate with variations in the chemical potential of the quantum wire, driven by Fabry-P\'erot interference effects. Our results suggest that quantum wires connected across superconductors could serve as effective platforms for probing triplet superconductivity through the observation of JDE.</description>
