      <title>A scalable quadratic nonlinear silicon photonics platform with printable entangled photon-pair sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of second-order optical nonlinearities into scalable photonic platforms remains a key challenge due to their large sensitivity to fabrication variations. Here, we present a scalable quadratic nonlinear platform that harnesses the maturity and scalability of existing CMOS processes by heterogeneously integrating periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) onto a silicon photonics platform. A generic PPLN design enables frequency conversion on two distinct waveguide geometries with efficiencies comparable to LNOI rib waveguides. We achieve reproducible phase-matching across the full radius of a commercial 200 mm silicon photonics wafer, leveraging superior CMOS fabrication tolerances. Furthermore, we introduce a tuning mechanism for both blue- and red-shifting of the operating wavelength, fully compensating fabrication-induced offsets. This enables deterministic phase-matching over an entire wafer and yields a strategy for wafer-scale phase-matched quadratic nonlinearities. Finally, we realize printable photon-pair sources via spontaneous parametric down-conversion, highlighting the platform's potential for large-scale quantum optical circuits. These results pave the way for wafer-scale integration of second-order optical nonlinearities in large photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Measuring ultrafast laser pulses using a single-shot amplitude swing implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-shot characterization techniques are crucial when dealing with shot-to-shot pulse-shape fluctuations (e.g., unstable laser systems, high-power, or with low repetition rate) since the scanning configurations cannot measure single pulses. The demand for simple setups that can be easily adapted to a wide variety of experimental conditions is continuously rising. In this work, we propose a single-shot implementation of amplitude swing, maintaining the compactness, versatility, and robustness of the scanning versions of this technique. First, we theoretically study the proposed implementation, based on a pair of uniaxial wedges. Then, we present the retrieval ptychographic algorithm. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the setup by comparing the single-shot and scanning traces and their retrieved pulses. In sum, we provide the ultrafast science community with a simple and versatile setup capable of measuring single laser pulses, which is necessary for characterizing fluctuating pulse trains, meeting the current increasing demand.</description>

      <title>GHz-speed wavefront shaping metasurface modulators enabled by resonant electro-optic nanoantennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrically tunable metasurfaces that control the amplitude and phase of light through biasing of nanoscale antennas present a route to compact, sub-micron thick modulator devices. However, most platforms face limitations in bandwidth, absolute optical efficiency, and tuning response. Here, we present electro-optically tunable metasurfaces capable of both GHz amplitude modulation and transmissive wavefront shaping in the telecom range. Our resonant electro-optic nanoantenna design consists of a silicon nanobar atop thin-film lithium niobate, with gold electrodes. The silicon nanobar is a periodically perturbed optical waveguide that supports high quality factor (Q $&gt;$ 1000) guided mode resonances excited with free space light. Applying a voltage bias to the lithium niobate tunes its refractive index, modulating the resonant behavior of the silicon nanobar through evanescent mode overlap. We demonstrate an absolute transmittance modulation of 7.1% with $\pm$5 V applied voltage, and show the dependence of this modulation behavior on the resonance quality factor. We additionally study the electrode limitations on modulation bandwidth, demonstrating bandwidths exceeding 800 MHz. Finally, we show how this resonant antenna platform can be used to design wavefront shaping metasurfaces. We demonstrate a beamsplitting metasurface device, whose diffraction efficiency can be modulated with a bandwidth of 1.03 GHz. The high-speed modulation and wavefront control capabilities of this platform provide a foundation for compact, high bandwidth free space communications and sensing devices.</description>

      <title>Q-switched Mode-locking in Er-doped ZBLAN Fibre Lasers using Carbon Nanotube Saturable Absorber and GaSb-based SESAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared fibre lasers are crucial for applications in spectroscopy, medical diagnostics, and environmental sensing, owing to their ability to interact with fundamental molecular vibrational bands. However, achieving stable ultrafast pulse generation in this spectral range remains challenging due to the limited availability of robust saturable absorbers. For the first time, we demonstrate Q-switched mode-locking in an all-fibre Er-doped ZBLAN laser employing an aerosol-synthesised carbon nanotube film. Furthermore, we compare the laser performance with pulse generation using a state-of-the-art GaSb-based SESAM in an identical cavity design. The carbon nanotube saturable absorber enables pulse generation with a minimum duration of 1.32 us and a pulse energy of 1.4 uJ at an average output power of 63.1 mW. In contrast, the SESAM-based laser produces 560-ns pulses with a pulse energy reaching 4.42 uJ and an average power of 138 mW. These results provide new insights into the interplay between saturable absorber properties and mid-IR fibre laser performance, paving the way for next-generation compact ultrafast sources for scientific and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Detuning-symmetric laser cooling of many mechanical modes with a photothermally modified cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simultaneously cool $\gtrsim$100 mechanical modes of a membrane with a photothermally modified optical cavity driven by a single blue-detuned laser. In contrast to radiation pressure and bolometric forces applied directly to the mechanical system, this cooling effect does not depend on the sign of detuning, allowing for single-laser stabilization (i.e., simultaneous positive optical spring and damping) that is especially effective at room temperature and high laser power. We also provide intuition about the competing thermal processes, and propose two simple modifications to the mirror coatings that can strongly enhance this effect.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Efficient Thermally Undercut Silicon Photonic Devices in a 300 mm CMOS Foundry Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photonic devices fundamental to high-density wavelength-division multiplexed (DWDM) optical links and photonic switching networks, such as resonant modulators and Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), are highly sensitive to fabrication variations and operational temperature swings. However, thermal tuning to compensate for fabrication and operational temperature variations can result in prohibitive power consumption, challenging the scalability of energy-efficient photonic integrated circuits (PICs). In this work, we develop and demonstrate a wafer-scale thermal undercut in a 300 mm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) foundry that dramatically improves the thermal isolation of thermo-optic devices by selectively removing substrate material beneath the waveguides and resonators. This approach significantly reduces the power required for thermal tuning across multiple device architectures, achieving almost a 5$\times$ improvement in tuning efficiency in a state-of-the-art 4.5 $\mu$m radius microdisk modulator and a 40$\times$ improvement in efficiency for a MZI phase shifter. Additionally, to the best of the authors' knowledge, we demonstrate the first wafer-scale analysis of the impact of undercut trench geometry on device performance using comprehensive wafer-scale measurements across 64 reticles of a 300 mm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. These results highlight the effectiveness of this wafer-scale thermal undercut technique in minimizing energy consumption, paving the way for scalable, ultra low-power silicon photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution measurement of thermo-optic coefficient of KTP crystal based on phase amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given that the phase amplification method based on harmonic generation exhibits significant phase super-resolution capability in interferometric precision measurement, extending this technology to birefringence interferometers to achieve super-resolution characterization of birefringent crystal properties has important research significance and application value. Here, we achieve a four-fold enhancement in the measurement resolution of the thermo-optic coefficient of a KTiOPO4 crystal by combining a self-stabilized birefringence interferometer with cascaded second harmonic generation processes. We observe the tunable interference beating phenomenon by rotating a birefringent crystal versus the temperature of the crystal for the fundamental wave, second harmonic, and fourth harmonic. Furthermore, the fourth harmonic interference fringes beat 4 times faster than the fundamental wave interference fringes. This beating effect is used to determine the thermo-optic coefficients of the two principal refractive axes with a single measurement. This work provides a feasible, real-time, and robust method for super-resolution measurements based on birefringence interferometry.</description>

      <title>Topological Degeneracy Induced by Twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, twisting has emerged as a new degree of freedom that plays an increasingly important role in Bloch bands of various physical systems. However, there is currently a lack of reports on the non-trivial physics of topological degeneracy in twisted systems. In this work, we investigated the intrinsic physical correlation between twisting and topological degeneracy. We found that twisting not only breaks the symmetry of the system but also introduces topological degeneracy that does not exist under the original symmetric system without twisting. Furthermore, the topological degeneracy can be easily tuned through twisting. This new twist-induced topological degeneracy gives rise to a unique polarization-degenerate birefringent medium, wherein the twist angle acts as a novel degree of freedom for dispersion and polarization management of interface states. Exhibiting fascinating properties and experimental feasibilities, our work points to new possibilities in the research of various topological physics in twisted photonics.</description>

      <title>Slow Light Waveguides based on Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of bound states in the continuum (BIC) has been advancing light confinement technology in leaky environments. In this letter, we propose and numerically demonstrate a slow light waveguide based on a BIC mode. We considered a waveguide with a polymer core loaded on a plane slab, which supports a leaky guided mode coupled to the radiation continuum in the slab. We found that periodic modulation of the polymer core along the propagation direction can result in a high group index mode with a low propagation loss due to BIC confinement. The introduction of one-dimensional photonic crystals into the BIC waveguides will largely expand its functionality and applications in integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Optical Control of Multi-Valley States in 2D SnS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the ultrafast optical control of multiple valley states in two-dimensional (2D) tin sulfide (SnS) monolayers, a member of the layered group-IV monochalcogenides, which is a promising class of materials for overcoming current challenges in valleytronics. By combining time-dependent density functional theory with Maxwells equations, we simulate how both linearly and circularly polarized ultrashort laser pulses affect the electronic excitation dynamics and valley polarization in SnS. Our results reveal that the corrugated phosphorene-like crystal structure of SnS monolayers leads to the emergence of both linear and circular dichroism, allowing flexible manipulation of multi-valley excitation by simply adjusting the light polarization. Moreover, the interplay between broken inversion symmetry and spin-orbit coupling gives rise to distinct Berry curvature effects and spin-valley coupling, thereby enabling circular dichroism. Furthermore, we propose that tuning the carrier-envelope phase of few-cycle femtosecond laser pulses can achieve sub-cycle, ultrafast switching among multiple valleys states. These findings not only deepen our understanding of valley dynamics in 2D materials but may also open new avenues for the development of valleytronic devices.</description>

      <title>Experimental Analysis of a Self-Coherent M-QAM Receiver by Means of Recurrent Optical Spectrum Slicing and Direct Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High order modulation formats constitute the most prominent way for increasing spectral efficiency in transmission systems. Coherent transceivers that support such higher order formats require heavy digital signal processing (DSP), which increases the power consumption of coherent pluggables, well above the intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) counterparts. Self-coherent or phase retrieval methods have emerged as potential solutions, trying to combine the merits of coherent technology with the simplicity of direct detection. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the reception of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modulation formats based on direct detection aided by the recurrent optical spectrum slicing (ROSS) photonic accelerator, utilizing minimal DSP and low modulator driving voltages. We experimentally demonstrate 32 Gbaud QAM-4/16 for 25 km, 50 km and 75 km in the C-band aided by a linear digital equalization and the use of programmable photonics as recurrent optical spectrum slicers. We showcase successful detection with driving swings below V{\pi}/3 in contrast to the full swing required by conventional coherent transceivers. We further improve the system performance utilizing geometric constellation shaping. Finally, we explore the potential power consumption improvement for the next-generation 1.6T pluggables, showcasing over 40% reduction with respect to the most lightweight state of the art coherent solutions reported in literature</description>

      <title>Microring resonator as a Rayleigh mirror for broadband laser cavity comb generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality microring resonators (MRRs) have proven to be promising sources of optical combs generated from continuous-wave radiation. In addition to the primary comb that propagates along with the pump, Rayleigh scattering creates a comb that travels in the opposite direction. Normally, the scattering is a very weak, however, in the high-quality-factor MRR the power transferred to the backward-propagating comb can be quite significant. We demonstrate that the backward-propagating comb can be used as a feedback source for a fiber laser, effectively creating a nonlinear mirror for the laser cavity. By assembling a simple laser cavity comprising only active fiber and two mirrors, one of which is an integrated MRR, we show a robust self-starting comb generation with width exceeding 500 nm. We confirm the universal character of this approach for other types of microresonators, including whispering gallery mode resonators, by launching self-starting laser cavity combs with the crystalline toroidal cavity, coupled with a tapered fiber. This method provides significant simplification for the filter-driven laser cavity soliton generation, especially when free-space coupling is applied.</description>

      <title>Scalable manufacturing of polarization-insensitive metalenses with high-uniform focal arrays in the visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-foci metalenses with uniform focal arrays attract special attention as they enable a single incident beam to focus on the same focal plane and share the identical numerical apertures. In this work, we demonstrate the scalable manufacturing of polarization-insensitive metalenses with high-uniform focal arrays in the visible. To overcome the limitations inherent in conventional imprint resins characterized by a low refractive index, hybrid meta-atoms are formed using the imprint resin itself, and a thin layer of titanium dioxide (TiO2) is deposited on it via atomic layer deposition (ALD) to increase the effective refractive index, enabling full phase coverage. We propose the gradient-descent-optimization strategy for phase retrieval of multi-foci metalens, which renders our design free from cross-talk and makes it feasible to achieve uniform focal arrays with flexible geometries. Based on this inverse-design scheme, the capability of nanoimprinted metalenses are explored by directly producing various focal arrays, including complex geometries such as square, rhombic lattices, as well as intact and defective rings. We envision this work may pave the way for various fields, including optical trapping, materials science, and quantum optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant interest in non-Hermitian phenomena, particularly optical gain, stemming from electro-optic effects. Typically, these effects are attributed to nonlinear interactions arising from the ``anomalous velocity" of Bloch electrons. Here, we introduce a novel mechanism for achieving optical gain through nonlinear interactions between free and bound electrons. We propose a semiclassical phenomenological microscopic model that encompasses a broad spectrum of nonlinear interactions, consistent with passivity and with the principles of microscopic reversibility. Our analysis shows that under non-equilibrium conditions and within low-symmetry systems, the linearized electromagnetic response can display both nonreciprocal and gain properties. We examine the stability of these electrically-biased systems and illustrate their potential applications, including the development of optical isolators and traveling wave amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Sub-kHz single-frequency pulsed semiconductor laser based on NPRO injection locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a single-frequency, narrow-linewidth semiconductor pulsed laser based on pump current modulation and optical injection locking technique. A monolithic non-planar ring oscillator laser is employed as the seed source to guarantee the single-frequency narrow-linewidth performance. Simultaneously, pulse operation is achieved by directly modulating the pump current of the semiconductor laser. The single-frequency pulsed laser (SFPL) has achieved a pulse repetition rate of 50 kHz-1 MHz, a pulse duration ranging from 120 ns to a quasi-continuous state, and a peak power of 160 mW. Moreover, the SFPL has reached a pulsed laser linewidth as narrow as 905 Hz, optical spectrum signal-to-noise ratio of better than 65 dB at a center wavelength of 1064.45 nm. Such extremely narrow-linewidth, repetition-rate and pulse-width tunable SFPL has great potential for applications in coherent LIDAR, metrology, remote sensing, and nonlinear frequency conversion.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Investigation of Fundamental Mode Profiles in Monolithic Nonplanar Ring Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonplanar ring oscillators (NPROs) are building blocks for high-performance single-frequency lasers and ring-laser gyroscopes that have profoundly improved the state-of-the-art laser technologies, fundamental research and precision measurements. However, a comprehensive investigation of fundamental mode profiles in monolithic NPROs has been a missing part even though they will affect the performance of the lasers or ring-laser gyroscopes. Here, we present a comprehensive finite-element modeling of the output beam profiles of monolithic NPROs by combining ABCD transmission matrix and generalized Huygens-Fresnel integral. We theoretically investigate the effects of geometric parameters of monolithic NPROs on their output mode profiles. In particular, we focus on the thermal effect inside the monolithic NPRO and calculate the equivalent focal-length of the thermal-lens by using a ray-tracing-method. Furthermore, we experimentally characterize the output laser beam profile, reconstruct the beam profile at the A-facet of the monolithic NPRO, and compare the experimental results with the simulation, thereby validating the accuracy and reliability of our model. The investigation may facilitate monolithic NPRO design and subsequently improve the performances of NPRO lasers and gyroscopes in the future.</description>

      <title>Electro-mechanically tunable, waveguide-coupled photonic-crystal cavities with embedded quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip micro-cavities with embedded quantum emitters provide an excellent platform for high-performance quantum technologies. A major difficulty for such devices is overcoming the detrimental effects of fluctuations in the device dimensions caused by the limitations of the fabrication processes. We present a fully tunable system based on a 1D photonic-crystal cavity with an embedded quantum dot, which enables tuning of both the quantum dot emission energy and the cavity mode wavelength. A micro-electromechanical cantilever is used to tune the cavity mode wavelength via index modulation and the quantum-confined Stark effect is used to tune the quantum dot emission energy, mitigating the effect of fabrication imperfections. To demonstrate the operation of the device, a maximum, voltage-controllable cavity tuning range of $\Delta \lambda = 1.8$ nm is observed. This signal is measured at the end of a bus waveguide which side-couples to the cavity, enabling the coupling of multiple cavities to a common waveguide, a key requirement for scale-up in these systems. Additionally, a quantum dot is tuned into resonance with the cavity mode, exhibiting an enhanced emission rate with a resolution limited Purcell factor of $F_P = 3.5$.</description>

      <title>Distribution and Moments of a Normalized Dissimilarity Ratio for two Correlated Gamma Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two random variables $X$ and $Y$ following correlated Gamma distributions, characterized by identical scale and shape parameters and a linear correlation coefficient $\rho$. Our focus is on the parameter: \[
  D(X,Y) = \frac{|X - Y|}{X + Y}, \] which appears in applied contexts such as dynamic speckle imaging, where it is known as the \textit{Fujii index}. In this work, we derive a closed-form expression for the probability density function of $D(X,Y)$ as well as analytical formulas for its moments of order $k$. Our derivation starts by representing $X$ and $Y$ as two correlated exponential random variables, obtained from the squared magnitudes of circular complex Gaussian variables. By considering the sum of $k$ independent exponential variables, we then derive the joint density of $(X,Y)$ when $X$ and $Y$ are two correlated Gamma variables. Through appropriate varable transformations, we obtain the theoretical distribution of $D(X,Y)$ and evaluate its moments analytically. These theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations, with particular attention to two specific cases: zero correlation and unit shape parameter.</description>

      <title>Stark-modulated Rydberg dissipative time crystals at room-temperature applied to sub-kHz electric-field sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium Rydberg gases exhibit emergent many-body phases due to mode competition. Sustained limit cycle oscillations (OSC) emerge when driven by B-fields at room-temperature, forming robust Rydberg dissipative time crystals (DTC). These driven-dissipative Rydberg DTC have recently been shown to develop an effective transition centered at the OSC frequency (-10dB bandwidth of ~1.7kHz, centered at 9.8kHz). Weak RF signals injected within this emergent transition perturb and emerge on the OSC spectrum, from which sensitive and high-resolution sensing of E-fields (~1.6-2.3 uVcm-1Hz-1/2) near the OSC frequencies can be achieved. In this article, it is demonstrated that DC and AC Stark fields in the sub-kHz regime can be used effectively to shift (DC) or modulate (AC) the OSC frequency of Rydberg DTC at room-temperature. The AC-Stark driven modulation of the OSC is shown as an effective technique to sense weak AC E-fields in the sub-kHz regime. With a modest setup, a sensitivity of ~7.8 uVcm-1Hz-1/2 for AC signals at 300Hz (~8.7x improvement over state-of-art Rydberg atom techniques), and high-resolution detection to as low as sub-Hz is demonstrated. This approach enables the development of ultra-compact, extremely low-frequency E-field detectors for applications in remote sensing, communications, navigation, and bio-medical technologies.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Light-Induced Microwave Mode Tuning in a Rutile TiO$_2$ Whispering Gallery Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of transient nonlinear optical effects in a macroscopic whispering gallery mode resonator made of rutile TiO$_2$, demonstrating strong optical-microwave transduction under laser irradiation. By comparing the effects of ultraviolet (UV, 385 nm) and near-infrared (NIR, 700 nm) radiation, we find that the UV-induced effects are significantly amplified, consistent with the material's semiconductor bandgap energy. The interaction results in frequency shifts of microwave modes and changes in quality factor, suggesting a localized saturable refractive index tuning. This may be attributed to the saturation of a spin transition of a dopant ion within the crystal lattice. Remarkably, these effects are observed at low optical powers, down to nanowatt levels, indicating high sensitivity and efficient of light-matter interaction in this system. The phenomenon is centered around 15 GHz, yet electron spin resonance measurements reveal no zero-field splitting at this frequency, suggesting an alternative mechanism beyond conventional spin resonance. These findings highlight the potential of low-power optical control of microwave modes in high-Q resonators for applications in quantum technologies, sensing, and reconfigurable photonic-microwave systems.</description>

      <title>Excitonic bound states in the continuum in van der Waals heterostructure metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of excitonic quasi-bound states in the continuum in van der Waals heterostructures composed of two-dimensional excitonic layers and resonant dielectric metasurfaces. We begin our analysis with a simplified planar heterostructure slab model containing a vdW layer. We develop a theoretical framework based on the slab's Green function to describe the weak coupling between excitons and quasi-normal electromagnetic modes. We show that the exciton Purcell factor can be significantly suppressed when the exciton frequency matches a Fabry-P\'{e}rot mode and the vdW layer is positioned at the nodes of the mode's electric field. In this case, the suppression reaches its fundamental limit, which is defined exclusively by slab's permittivity. In heterostructure metasurfaces, a more substantial suppression can be achieved due to multiple interferences between Fabry-P\'{e}rot modes and guided-mode resonances with high quality factors. Numerical simulations confirm that the exciton radiative lifetime can be extended by over two orders of magnitude, demonstrating the formation of excitonic quasi-BICs and their potential for advancing quantum optics and information processing.</description>

      <title>Coherence Properties of Rare-Earth Spins in Micrometer-Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth ions in bulk crystals are excellent solid-state quantum systems in quantum information science, owing to the exceptional optical and spin coherence properties. However, the weak fluorescence of single rare-earth ions present a significant challenge for scalability, necessitating the integration into micro-cavities. Thin films serve as a promising material platform for the integration, yet the fabrication without compromising the properties of the materials and rare-earth ions remains challenging. In this work, we fabricate micrometer-thin yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) films from bulk crystals using ion implantation techniques. The resulting films preserve the single-crystalline structure of the original bulk crystal. Notably, the embedded rare-earth ions are photo-stable and exhibit bulk-like spin coherence properties. Our results demonstrate the compatibility of bulk-like spin properties with the thin-film fabrication technique, facilitating the efficient integration of rare-earth ions into on-chip photonic devices and advancing the applications of rare-earth ions systems in quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Optomechanics with semi-transparent membrane multi-oscillators in a high-finesse cavity is an established solution for designing the dispersive interaction, and reaching many achievements, such as the study of non-linear dynamics, heat transfer, and so on. The multi-oscillators are dielectric slabs, usually with low reflectivity, constituting an etalon. Here we propose the theoretical and experimental investigation of a low-finesse optical cavity formed by two (nominally identical) parallel semi-transparent membranes. The experiment consists in laser-driving the cavity, detecting interferometrically the field reflected by the etalon, and measuring the intensity of the transmitted field, for different distances within the two membranes. A complete characterization of the membrane sandwich is provided. On the other hand, we developed an analytical model to describe the fields, which reproduces all the experimental results, under specific approximations. As expected, the model reproduces the known results when high-reflectivity, and/or fixed mirrors conditions are restored. This work paves the way for a complete and analytical model to describe multi-oscillators "membrane-in-the-middle" optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Capturing non-equilibrium electron dynamics in metals accurately and efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of non-equilibrium electron distributions is essential for capturing light-metal interactions and therefore the study of photoabsorption, photocatalysis, laser ablation, and many other phenomena. Current methodologies, such as the Boltzmann equation using full collision integrals, describe non-equilibrium electron dynamics in great detail but at often prohibitive computational expense. In contrast, the simplification via a relaxation time approach can hinder the description of important features or, even worse, lead to nonphysical behavior due to the lack of particle and energy conservation. We propose a model that bridges the gap between the Boltzmann equation and two-temperature models to trace non-equilibrium distributions efficiently. This Athermal Electron Model (AthEM) separately captures the dynamics of thermal and athermal electrons and describes the energy and particle flow between two electronic systems and phonons. We show that the results align well with the results of Boltzmann equation and data from photoemission experiments. The AthEM enables the rapid generation of qualitatively accurate non-equilibrium electron distributions and provides a good starting point for further extensions.</description>

      <title>Statistical Virtual Temperature of Classical and Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a foundational definition of statistical virtual temperature, derived from the spectrum of the Gibbs Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) state and formulated using d-1 indices of purity (IP), where d represents the Hilbert space dimension within the C*-algebra framework. We demonstrate that the universal physical bounds between von Neumann entropy and statistical virtual temperature are constrained by these IPs, which may offer broader applications to quantum systems. Additionally, we geometrize classical optical polarization states of an arbitrary electromagnetic field and provide an interpretation of the quantum Mpemba effect, where a quantum system prepared at a higher statistical virtual temperature relaxes to equilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. This behavior is explained through a novel concept of temperature-resolved entanglement asymmetry. Additionally, we present a geometric interpretation of the third law of thermodynamics using these entropy-temperature diagrams. Nevertheless, the defined statistical virtual temperature inherently exhibits the third law of thermodynamics. We believe that this work has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of classical polarization theory, quantum information theory, and quantum thermodynamics, and it may establish new connections and insights into these fields.</description>

      <title>Two-Photon Interference of Photons from Remote Tin-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable quantum networks rely on optical connections between long-lived qubits to distribute entanglement. Tin vacancies in diamond have emerged as promising long-lived qubits, offering extended spin coherence times at liquid helium temperatures and spin-dependent, highly coherent optical transitions for effective photon-based communication. Connecting remote nodes requires quantum interference of indistinguishable photons, which is challenging in an inhomogeneous solid-state environment. Here, we demonstrate a two-node experiment with tin vacancies in diamond, which exhibit a resonant frequency distribution spanning approximately 8 GHz. To overcome the frequency mismatch, we tune the resonant frequencies of one node using the Stark effect. We achieve tunability up to 4 GHz while maintaining optical coherence. As a demonstration, we achieve detuning-dependent remote two-photon interference between separate nodes, obtaining 80(6)% interference visibility without postprocessing when the defects' optical transitions are tuned into resonance, and 63(8)% with detuning up to 20 times their natural linewidths. These results highlight the potential of tin-vacancy centres in diamond for establishing robust optical links between remote quantum registers.</description>
