      <title>Toward End-to-End Bearing Fault Diagnosis for Industrial Scenarios with Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) transmit information via low-power binary spikes and have received widespread attention in areas such as computer vision and reinforcement learning. However, there have been very few explorations of SNNs in more practical industrial scenarios. In this paper, we focus on the application of SNNs in bearing fault diagnosis to facilitate the integration of high-performance AI algorithms and real-world industries. In particular, we identify two key limitations of existing SNN fault diagnosis methods: inadequate encoding capacity that necessitates cumbersome data preprocessing, and non-spike-oriented architectures that constrain the performance of SNNs. To alleviate these problems, we propose a Multi-scale Residual Attention SNN (MRA-SNN) to simultaneously improve the efficiency, performance, and robustness of SNN methods. By incorporating a lightweight attention mechanism, we have designed a multi-scale attention encoding module to extract multiscale fault features from vibration signals and encode them as spatio-temporal spikes, eliminating the need for complicated preprocessing. Then, the spike residual attention block extracts high-dimensional fault features and enhances the expressiveness of sparse spikes with the attention mechanism for end-to-end diagnosis. In addition, the performance and robustness of MRA-SNN is further enhanced by introducing the lightweight attention mechanism within the spiking neurons to simulate the biological dendritic filtering effect. Extensive experiments on MFPT and JNU benchmark datasets demonstrate that MRA-SNN significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, energy consumption and noise robustness, and is more feasible for deployment in real-world industrial scenarios.</description>

      <title>EPiC: Cost-effective Search-based Prompt Engineering of LLMs for Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen increasing use in various software development tasks, especially in code generation. The most advanced recent methods attempt to incorporate feedback from code execution into prompts to help guide LLMs in generating correct code, in an iterative process. While effective, these methods could be costly and time-consuming due to numerous interactions with the LLM and the extensive token usage. To address this issue, we propose an alternative approach named Evolutionary Prompt Engineering for Code (EPiC), which leverages a lightweight evolutionary algorithm to evolve the original prompts toward better ones that produce high-quality code, with minimal interactions with LLM. Our evaluation against state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM-based code generation models shows that EPiC outperforms all the baselines in terms of cost-effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A Little Confidence Goes a Long Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a group of related methods for binary classification tasks using probes of the hidden state activations in large language models (LLMs). Performance is on par with the largest and most advanced LLMs currently available, but requiring orders of magnitude fewer computational resources and not requiring labeled data. This approach involves translating class labels into a semantically rich description, spontaneous symmetry breaking of multilayer perceptron probes for unsupervised learning and inference, training probes to generate confidence scores (prior probabilities) from hidden state activations subject to known constraints via entropy maximization, and selecting the most confident probe model from an ensemble for prediction. These techniques are evaluated on four datasets using five base LLMs.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Hopfield Network Dynamics: Beyond Synchronous Updates and Forward Euler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield network serves as a fundamental energy-based model in machine learning, capturing memory retrieval dynamics through an ordinary differential equation (ODE). The model's output, the equilibrium point of the ODE, is traditionally computed via synchronous updates using the forward Euler method. This paper aims to overcome some of the disadvantages of this approach. We propose a conceptual shift, viewing Hopfield networks as instances of Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs). The DEQ framework not only allows for the use of specialized solvers, but also leads to new insights on an empirical inference technique that we will refer to as 'even-odd splitting'. Our theoretical analysis of the method uncovers a parallelizable asynchronous update scheme, which should converge roughly twice as fast as the conventional synchronous updates. Empirical evaluations validate these findings, showcasing the advantages of both the DEQ framework and even-odd splitting in digitally simulating energy minimization in Hopfield networks.
