      <title>Animer une base de connaissance: des ontologies aux mod{\`e}les d'I.A. g{\'e}n{\'e}rative</title>

Abstract: In a context where the social sciences and humanities are experimenting with non-anthropocentric analytical frames, this article proposes a semiotic (structural) reading of the hybridization between symbolic AI and neural (or sub-symbolic) AI based on a field of application: the design and use of a knowledge base for area studies. We describe the LaCAS ecosystem -- Open Archives in Linguistic and Cultural Studies (thesaurus; RDF/OWL ontology; LOD services; harvesting; expertise; publication), deployed at Inalco (National Institute for Oriental Languages and Civilizations) in Paris with the Okapi (Open Knowledge and Annotation Interface) software environment from Ina (National Audiovisual Institute), which now has around 160,000 documentary resources and ten knowledge macro-domains grouping together several thousand knowledge objects. We illustrate this approach using the knowledge domain ''Languages of the world'' (~540 languages) and the knowledge object ''Quechua (language)''. On this basis, we discuss the controlled integration of neural tools, more specifically generative tools, into the life cycle of a knowledge base: assistance with data localization/qualification, index extraction and aggregation, property suggestion and testing, dynamic file generation, and engineering of contextualized prompts (generic, contextual, explanatory, adjustment, procedural) aligned with a domain ontology. We outline an ecosystem of specialized agents capable of animating the database while respecting its symbolic constraints, by articulating model-driven and data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>Basic scientists' disproportionate impact amid applied drift reveals structural asymmetry in science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite broad acclaim for basic research, science is undergoing an applied shift that marginalizes basic scientists. This gap reflects an incomplete understanding of their distinctive roles, which prevents translating philosophical appreciation into effective support. We introduce a scalable metric--the application score--to position research along the basic-applied spectrum and apply it to 62 million publications (1970-2023) to reveal the distinctive contributions of basic scientists. We find a structural asymmetry: involvement of basic scientists substantially increases citation impact, even more so in applied contexts, while applied scientists show no such effect in basic domains. This asymmetric effect arises from their intellectual leadership in conceptualization, writing, and experimental design, amplified in large, multidisciplinary, and intermediate career teams. Yet basic scientists remain concentrated in historically prestigious institutions, while new entrants shift toward applied work, indicating critical undersupply. These findings provide large-scale evidence for the indispensable role of basic scientists, guiding policy and institutional strategy to sustain the foundations of discovery and innovation.</description>

      <title>A World in Print: Introducing a Danish-Norwegian corpus of historical newspapers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Data Descriptor introduces the dataset Enevaeldens Nyheder Online (News during Absolutism Online). The Enevaeldens Nyheder Online (ENO) dataset provides a reconstruction of the contents of major newspapers in Denmark and Norway during the period of Absolutism (1660-1849). The dataset contains approx. 474 million words, created using neural networks designed to process digitised microfilm versions of Danish newspapers as well as a smaller selection of Norwegian publications that were all hitherto illegible for computers. The contributions details this process and its results, including a way to derive standalone texts from the editions, and the accompanying BERT-model trained on a beta-version of the dataset.</description>

      <title>Authorship conflicts in academia: an international cross-discipline survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaboration among scholars has emerged as a significant characteristic of contemporary science. As a result, the number of authors listed in publications continues to rise steadily. Unfortunately, determining the authors to be included in the byline and their respective order entails multiple difficulties which often lead to conflicts. Despite the large volume of literature about conflicts in academia, it remains unclear how exactly these are distributed over the main socio-demographic properties, as well as the different types of interactions academics experience. To address this gap, we conducted an international and cross-disciplinary survey answered by 752 academics from 41 fields of research and 93 countries that statistically well-represent the overall academic workforce. Our findings are concerning and suggest that conflicts over authorship credit arise very early in one's academic career, even at the level of Master and Ph.D., and become increasingly common over time.</description>

      <title>Publishing Instincts: An Exploration-Exploitation Framework for Studying Academic Publishing Behavior and "Home Venues"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scholarly communication is vital to scientific advancement, enabling the exchange of ideas and knowledge. When selecting publication venues, scholars consider various factors, such as journal relevance, reputation, outreach, and editorial standards and practices. However, some of these factors are inconspicuous or inconsistent across venues and individual publications. This study proposes that scholars' decision-making process can be conceptualized and explored through the biologically inspired exploration-exploitation (EE) framework, which posits that scholars balance between familiar and under-explored publication venues. Building on the EE framework, we introduce a grounded definition for "Home Venues" (HVs) - an informal concept used to describe the set of venues where a scholar consistently publishes - and investigate their emergence and key characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the publication patterns of roughly three-quarters of computer science scholars align with the expectations of the EE framework. For these scholars, HVs typically emerge and stabilize after approximately 15-20 publications. Additionally, scholars with higher h-indexes, greater number of publications, or higher academic age tend to have higher-ranking journals as their HVs.</description>
