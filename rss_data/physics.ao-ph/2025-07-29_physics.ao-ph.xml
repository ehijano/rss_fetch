      <title>A Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Microphysical Properties of Ice Crystals from Cloud Particle Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microphysical properties of ice crystals are important because they significantly alter the radiative properties and spatiotemporal distributions of clouds, which in turn strongly affect Earth's climate. However, it is challenging to measure key properties of ice crystals, such as mass or morphological features. Here, we present a framework for predicting three-dimensional (3D) microphysical properties of ice crystals from in situ two-dimensional (2D) imagery. First, we computationally generate synthetic ice crystals using 3D modeling software along with geometric parameters estimated from the 2021 Ice Cryo-Encapsulation Balloon (ICEBall) field campaign. Then, we use synthetic crystals to train machine learning (ML) models to predict effective density ($\rho_{e}$), effective surface area ($A_e$), and number of bullets ($N_b$) from synthetic rosette imagery. When tested on unseen synthetic images, we find that our ML models can predict microphysical properties with high accuracy. For $\rho_{e}$ and $A_e$, respectively, our best-performing single view models achieved $R^2$ values of 0.99 and 0.98. For $N_b$, our best single view model achieved a balanced accuracy and F1 score of 0.91. We also quantify the marginal prediction improvements from incorporating a second view. A stereo view ResNet-18 model reduced RMSE by 40% for both $\rho_e$ and $A_e$, relative to a single view ResNet-18 model. For $N_b$, we find that a stereo view ResNet-18 model improved the F1 score by 8%. This work provides a novel ML-driven framework for estimating ice microphysical properties from in situ imagery, which will allow for downstream constraints on microphysical parameterizations, such as the mass-size relationship.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Extreme Madden-Julian Oscillation Events and their Impacts on South America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the evolution of extreme Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) events and their impacts on South America during the austral summer. Furthermore, the study explores how the different ENSO phases modulate extreme MJO events, and how the combined effects impact South American climate. Extreme MJO events are defined as those exceeding a specific threshold based on the events distribution, distinguishing them from weak events. Our analysis shows that extreme MJO events most frequently initiate in phases 2-3 throughout the year, with similar distributions across phases 8-1, 6-7, and 4-5. This distribution is also characteristic of winter, while in summer, initiation is more balanced between phases 2-3 and 8-1. In contrast, weak events predominantly start in phases 4-5 year-round, followed by phases 2-3, with phases 8-1 and 6-7 occurring at similar frequencies. Seasonally, weak event initiation prevails in phases 4-5 during summer, while in winter, it is evenly distributed between phases 8-1 and 4-5. Additionally, during La Ni\~na, extreme events tend to last longer than during El Ni\~no, a pattern not observed in weak events. A composite analysis of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), eddy streamfunction, and velocity potential was conducted, with particular focus on the initiation phases 2-3 and 6-7 to determine which phases result in the most significant impacts and how the associated anomalies evolve. The findings show that enhanced (suppressed) convection centers in the equatorial region during extreme events are more intense and exhibit a southeastern displacement compared to those during weak events. These extreme MJO events influence the South American rainfall Dipole (SAD), a key feature of regional climate variability and results show that extreme MJO events induce more intense rainfall anomalies of larger spatial extent compared to weak events.</description>

      <title>Evaluating satellite and reanalysis rainfall estimates for climate services in agriculture: a comprehensive methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution rainfall estimates from satellite and reanalysis data sources (SRE) could play a major role in improving climate services for agriculture. This is particularly relevant in regions that predominantly rely on rain-fed farming but lack a dense network of ground-based measurements to provide localised historical climate information, as in most of the Global South. However, there is a need for a framework which practitioners can use to determine the suitability of these estimated data for specific agricultural applications. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for evaluating the ability of SRE to provide historical rainfall information for agricultural applications, primarily through comparison with ground based measurements. The methodology comprises four main steps: spatial consistency checks, main comparisons, bias correction, and application specific summaries. The methodology makes use of graphical summaries, standard comparison metrics, and Markov chain models. We describe how users can apply this methodology to evaluate rainfall estimates for specific applications, complementing existing validation studies. Evaluation cases are presented to demonstrate the methodology using five widely used satellite and reanalysis rainfall products and ground-based measurements from 12 stations in Africa and the Caribbean. The case studies demonstrate how the methodology can be applied to examine multiple aspects of the rainfall estimates. While previous validation studies ask "Does the SRE estimate the true rainfall well?", this methodology provides means of establishing "To what extent can an SRE be used for this specific purpose?" and a comprehensive framework for achieving this. This meets a major need for location specific rainfall information to improve climate information services for millions of small-holder farming households.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Link Budget Analysis for Low Earth Orbit Satellites in the Optical Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) optical satellite communication systems face performance challenges due to atmospheric effects such as scintillation, turbulence, wavefront distortion, beam spread, and jitter. This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model to characterize these effects and their impact on signal propagation. We develop a methodology for dynamically calculating link budgets at any location and time by integrating these models into a probabilistic framework. The approach accounts for spatial and temporal variations in atmospheric conditions, enabling accurate estimation of link loss probabilities. Simulations validate the model's accuracy and applicability to real-world LEO satellite systems. This work offers a robust tool for optimizing link performance and enhancing the reliability of satellite networks, providing valuable insights for system designers and operators.</description>
