      <title>Assessment of physical schemes for WRF model in convection-permitting mode over southern Iberian Peninsula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convection-permitting models (CPMs) enable the representation of meteorological variables at horizontal high resolution spatial scales (higher than 4 km), where convection plays a significant role. Physical schemes need to be evaluated considering factors in the studied region such as orography and climate variability. This study investigates the sensitivity of the WRF model as CPM to the use of different physics schemes on Andalusia, a complex orography region in southern Iberian Peninsula (IP). A set of 1-year WRF simulations was completed based on two one-way nested domains: the parent domain (d01) spanning the entire IP with 5 km spatial resolution and the nested domain (d02) for the region of Andalusia at 1 km of spatial resolution. 12 physic schemes were examined from combinations of microphysics (MP) schemes including THOMPSON, WRF single moment 6-class (WSM6), and WRF single moment 7-class (WSM7), and different options for the convection in d01, the Grell 3D (G3), Grell-Freitas (GF), Kain-Fritsch (KF), and deactivated cumulus parameterization (OFF). The simulated precipitation and 2-m temperature for the year 2018, a very wet year, were compared with observational datasets to determine the optimal WRF configuration, including point-to-point and station-point comparisons at different time aggregations. In general, greater differences were shown when comparing the results of convection schemes in d01. Simulations completed with GF or OFF presented better performance compared to the reference datasets. Concerning the MP, although THOMPSON showed a better fit in high mountain areas, it generally presents a worse agreement with the reference datasets. In terms of temperature, the results were very similar and, therefore, the selection of the best configuration was based mainly on the precipitation results with the WSM7-GF scheme being suitable for Andalusia region.</description>

      <title>Bounds to the Basset-Boussinesq force on particle laden stratified flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Basset-Boussinesq force is often perfunctory neglected when studying small inertial particles in turbulence. The force results from the diffusion of vorticity from the particles, and as it depends on the particles past history, it complicates the dynamics by turning their equations of motion into integro-differential equations. However, this force is of the same order as other viscous forces acting on the particles, and beyond convenience, the reasons for neglecting it are unclear. We derive strict bounds for the magnitude of the Basset-Boussinesq force in stably stratified flows, in contexts of interest for geophysical turbulence. The bounds are validated by direct numerical simulations. The Basset-Boussinesq force can be neglected when a buoyancy Stokes number $\textrm{Sb} = N \tau_p$ is small, where $N$ is the flow Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency and $\tau_p$ is the particles Stokes time. For sufficiently strong stratification, or particles with large inertia, this force must be considered in the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Computational study of numerical flux schemes for mesoscale atmospheric flows in a Finite Volume framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop, and implement in a Finite Volume environment, a density-based approach for the Euler equations written in conservative form using density, momentum, and total energy as variables. Under simplifying assumptions, these equations are used to describe non-hydrostatic atmospheric flow. The well-balancing of the approach is ensured by a local hydrostatic reconstruction updated in runtime during the simulation to keep the numerical error under control. To approximate the solution of the Riemann problem, we consider four methods: Roe-Pike, HLLC, AUSM+-up and HLLC-AUSM. We assess our density-based approach and compare the accuracy of these four approximated Riemann solvers using two two classical benchmarks, namely the smooth rising thermal bubble and the density current.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Invertible Neural Surrogates of Atmospheric Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for inferring an atmospheric transmission profile from a spectral scene. This framework leverages a lightweight, physics-based simulator that is automatically tuned - by virtue of autodifferentiation and differentiable programming - to construct a surrogate atmospheric profile to model the observed data. We demonstrate utility of the methodology by (i) performing atmospheric correction, (ii) recasting spectral data between various modalities (e.g. radiance and reflectance at the surface and at the sensor), and (iii) inferring atmospheric transmission profiles, such as absorbing bands and their relative magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Inductive biases in deep learning models for weather prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has gained immense popularity in the Earth sciences as it enables us to formulate purely data-driven models of complex Earth system processes. Deep learning-based weather prediction (DLWP) models have made significant progress in the last few years, achieving forecast skills comparable to established numerical weather prediction models with comparatively lesser computational costs. In order to train accurate, reliable, and tractable DLWP models with several millions of parameters, the model design needs to incorporate suitable inductive biases that encode structural assumptions about the data and the modelled processes. When chosen appropriately, these biases enable faster learning and better generalisation to unseen data. Although inductive biases play a crucial role in successful DLWP models, they are often not stated explicitly and their contribution to model performance remains unclear. Here, we review and analyse the inductive biases of state-of-the-art DLWP models with respect to five key design elements: data selection, learning objective, loss function, architecture, and optimisation method. We identify the most important inductive biases and highlight potential avenues towards more efficient and probabilistic DLWP models.</description>
