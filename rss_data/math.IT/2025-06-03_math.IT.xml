      <title>Dual-UAV-Aided Covert Communications for Air-to-Ground ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance both the sensing and covert communication performance, a dual-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided scheme is proposed for integrated sensing and communication networks, in which one UAV maneuvers as the aerial dual-functional base-station (BS), while another UAV flies as the cooperative jammer. Artificial noise (AN) transmitted by the jamming UAV is utilized not only to confuse the ground warden but also to aid the aerial BS to sense multiple ground targets by combing the target-echoed dual-functional waveform and AN components from a perspective of the hybrid monostatitc-bistatic radar. We employ the distance-normalized beampattern sum-gain to measure the sensing performance. To maximize the average covert rate (ACR) from the aerial BS to the ground user, the dual-functional BS beamforming, jamming UAV beamforming, and dual-UAV trajectory are co-designed, subject to transmit power budgets, UAV maneuver constraint, covertness requirement, and sensing performance constraint. The imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) effects on the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio are also considered in maximizing the ACR. To tackle the highly complicated non-convex ACR maximization problem, dual-UAV beamforming and dual-UAV trajectory are optimized in a block coordinate descent way using the trust-region successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation. To find the dual-UAV maneuver locations suitable for sensing the ground targets, we first optimize the dual-UAV trajectory for the covert communication purpose only and then solve a weighted distance minimization problem for the covert communication and sensing purpose.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Fronthaul Signaling for Uplink Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel resource-efficient over-the-air(OTA) computation framework to address the huge fronthaul computational and control overhead requirements in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. We show that the global sufficient statistics to decode the data symbols can be computed OTA using the locally available information at the access points (APs). We provide the essential signal processing aspects at the APs and the central processing unit (CPU) to facilitate the OTA computation of sufficient statistics. The proposed framework scales effectively with an increase in the number of APs. We also make a comprehensive study of the benefits of an OTA framework compared to a conventional digital fronthaul in terms of the overhead associated in transferring the sufficient statistics from the APs to the CPU. To evaluate the performance of the OTA framework, we give closed-form expressions for the mean-square error (MSE)of the estimators of sufficient statistics and the overall data estimator. Furthermore, we assess the symbol error rate (SER)and bit error rate (BER) of the user equipment (UEs) data to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and benchmark them against the state-of-the-art wired fronthaul networks.</description>

      <title>A Sequential Computation Algorithm for the Center of the Smallest Enclosing Ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of finding the center $Q^\ast$ of the SEB (smallest enclosing ball) for $n$ points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. One application of the SEB is SVDD (support vector data description) in support vector machines. Our objective is to develop a sequential computation algorithm for determining the barycentric coordinate of $Q^\ast$. To achieve it, we apply the concept of the Arimoto-Blahut algorithm, which is a sequential computation algorithm used to compute the channel capacity. We first consider the case in which an equidistant point $\widetilde{Q}$ from the $n$ points exists, and construct a recurrence formula that converges to the barycentric coordinate $\widetilde{\bm\lambda}$ of $\widetilde{Q}$. When $\widetilde{Q}$ lies within the convex hull of the $n$ points, $\widetilde{Q}$ coincides with $Q^\ast$, hence in this case, the recurrence formula converges to the barycentric coordinate $\bm\lambda^\ast$ of $Q^\ast$. The resulting recurrence formula is very simple because it uses only the coordinates of the $n$ points. The computational complexity, with an approximation error of $\epsilon$ to the exact solution $\widetilde{\bm\lambda}$, is $O(\kappa n^2\log(1/\epsilon))$, where $\kappa$ is a value determined by the $n$ points. Furthermore, we modify the algorithm so that it can also be applied in cases where $\widetilde{Q}$ does not exist, and evaluate the convergence performance numerically. We compare the proposed algorithm with conventional algorithms in terms of run time and computational accuracy through several examples. The proposed algorithm has some advantages and some disadvantages compared to the conventional algorithms, but overall, since the proposed algorithm can be computed using a very simple formula, it is considered sufficiently practical.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Channel Modeling for Molecular Communications in Tubular Environments with Heterogeneous Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC), one of the emerging techniques in the field of communication, is entering a new phase following several decades of foundational research. Recently, attention has shifted toward MC in liquid media, particularly within tubular environments, due to novel application scenarios. The spatial constraints of such environments make accurate modeling of molecular movement in tubes more challenging than in traditional free-space channels. In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional channel model for molecular communications with an absorbing ring-shaped receiver in a tubular environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study to model the impact of an absorbing ring-shaped receiver on the channel response in tube-based MC systems. The problem is formulated as a partial differential equation with heterogeneous boundary conditions, and an approximate solution is derived under flow-dominated conditions. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated through particle-based simulations. We anticipate that the results of this study will contribute to the design of practical MC systems in real-world tubular environments.</description>

      <title>Constructions of Optimal Frequency-Hopping Sequences with Controlled Minimum Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-hopping sequences (FHSs) with low Hamming correlation and wide gaps significantly contribute to the anti-interference performance in FH communication systems. This paper investigates FHSs with optimal Hamming correlation and controlled minimum gaps. We start with the discussion of the upper bounds on the minimum gaps of uniform FHSs and then propose a general construction of optimal uniform wide-gap FHSs with length 2l and 3l, which includes the work by Li et al. in IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 68, no. 1, 2022 as a special case. Furthermore, we present a recursive construction of FHSs with length 2l, which concatenate shorter sequences of known minimum gaps. It is shown that the resulting FHSs have the same Hamming correlation as the concatenation-ordering sequences. As applications, several known optimal FHSs are used to produce optimal FHSs with controlled minimum gaps.</description>

      <title>Blind Passive Beamforming for MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive beamforming for the intelligent surface (IS)-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication is a difficult nonconvex problem. It becomes even more challenging under the practical discrete constraints on phase shifts. Unlike most of the existing approaches that rely on the channel state information (CSI), this work advocates a blind beamforming strategy without any CSI. Simply put, we propose a statistical method that learns the main feature of the wireless environment from the random samples of received signal power. Field tests in the 5G commercial network demonstrate the superiority of the proposed blind passive beamforming method.</description>

      <title>A Generic Construction on Self-orthogonal Algebraic Geometric Codes and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of algebraic geometric (AG) codes, characterizing dual codes has long been a challenging task. In this paper we introduces a generalized criterion to characterize self-orthogonality of AG codes based on residues, drawing upon the rich algebraic structures of finite fields and the geometric properties of algebraic curves. We also present a generic construction of self-orthogonal AG codes from self-dual MDS codes. Using these approaches, we construct several families of self-dual and almost self-dual AG codes. These codes combine two merits: good performance as AG code whose parameters are close to the Singleton bound together with Euclidean (or Hermtian) self-dual/self-orthogonal property. Furthermore, some AG codes with Hermitian self-orthogonality can be applied to construct quantum codes with notably good parameters.</description>

      <title>DFRC Systems Co-existing in Licensed Spectrum: Cognitive Beamforming Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01202v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) system with cognitive radio capability to tackle the spectral scarcity problem in wireless communications. Particularly, a cognitive DFRC system operates on a spectrum owned by a primary system to simultaneously perform data communication and target tracking with the condition that its interference to the primary users (PUs) is below a certain threshold. To achieve this, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly design the beamforming vectors for both the radar and communication functions in such a way that the mean square error (MSE) of the beam pattern between the designed and desired waveforms is minimized. The optimization problem has the following three constraints: i) the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at each data communication user is above a predetermined level; ii) the per-antenna transmit power is maintained at a given level; iii) the interference imposed on each PU is below a certain threshold. Both the semidefinite relaxation and nature-inspired firefly algorithms are proposed in order to search for the optimal solutions to the optimization problem. The simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithms can enable the DFRC system to protect the PUs while simultaneously performing its communication and radar functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate $\theta$-skew cyclic codes over the ring $R= \mathbb{F}_4 + v \mathbb{F}_4$, where $v^2=v$ and $\theta$ is a non-trivial automorphism over $\mathbb{F}_4 + v \mathbb{F}_4$. This allows us to describe DNA code over this ring by characterizing $\theta$-skew cyclic reversible DNA codes and $\theta$-skew cyclic reversible complement DNA codes. We also explore the Gray images of $\theta$-skew cyclic codes.</description>

      <title>Region-of-Interest-Guided Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep joint source-channel coding (deepJSCC) and semantic communication have shown promising improvements in communication performance over wireless networks. However, current approaches primarily focus on enhancing average performance metrics, such as overall image reconstruction quality or task accuracy, which may not fully align with users' actual experience -- often driven by the quality of specific regions of interest (ROI). Motivated by this, we propose ROI-guided joint source-channel coding (ROI-JSCC), a novel deepJSCC framework that prioritizes high-quality transmission of ROI. The ROI-JSCC consists of four key components: (1) ROI embedding and feature map extraction, (2) ROI-guided split processing, (3) ROI-based loss function design, and (4) ROI-adaptive bandwidth allocation. Together, these components enable ROI-JSCC to selectively improve the reconstruction quality of varying ROI while preserving overall image quality without increasing computational burden. Experimental results under diverse communication environments demonstrate that ROI-JSCC significantly improves ROI reconstruction quality while maintaining competitive average image quality compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. All codes are available at https://github.com/hansung-choi/ROI-JSCC.</description>

      <title>Practical Short-Length Coding Schemes for Binary Distributed Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the design of practical shortlength coding schemes for Distributed Hypothesis Testing (DHT). While most prior work on DHT has focused on informationtheoretic analyses, deriving bounds on Type-II error exponents via achievability schemes based on quantization and quantizebinning, the practical implementation of DHT coding schemes has remained largely unexplored. Moreover, existing practical coding solutions for quantization and quantize-binning approaches were developed for source reconstruction tasks considering very long code length, and they are not directly applicable to DHT. In this context, this paper introduces efficient shortlength implementations of quantization and quantize-binning schemes for DHT, constructed from short binary linear block codes. Numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed coding schemes compared to uncoded cases and to existing schemes initially developed for data reconstruction. In addition to practical code design, the paper derives exact analytical expressions for the Type-I and Type-II error probabilities associated with each proposed scheme. The provided analytical expressions are shown to predict accurately the practical performance measured from Monte-Carlo simulations of the proposed schemes. These theoretical results are novel and offer a useful framework for optimizing and comparing practical DHT schemes across a wide range of source and code parameters.</description>

      <title>Overfitting has a limitation: a model-independent generalization error bound based on R\'enyi entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Will further scaling up of machine learning models continue to bring success? A significant challenge in answering this question lies in understanding generalization error, which is the impact of overfitting. Understanding generalization error behavior of increasingly large-scale machine learning models remains a significant area of investigation, as conventional analyses often link error bounds to model complexity, failing to fully explain the success of extremely large architectures. This research introduces a novel perspective by establishing a model-independent upper bound for generalization error applicable to algorithms whose outputs are determined solely by the data's histogram, such as empirical risk minimization or gradient-based methods. Crucially, this bound is shown to depend only on the R\'enyi entropy of the data-generating distribution, suggesting that a small generalization error can be maintained even with arbitrarily large models, provided the data quantity is sufficient relative to this entropy. This framework offers a direct explanation for the phenomenon where generalization performance degrades significantly upon injecting random noise into data, where the performance degrade is attributed to the consequent increase in the data distribution's R\'enyi entropy. Furthermore, we adapt the no-free-lunch theorem to be data-distribution-dependent, demonstrating that an amount of data corresponding to the R\'enyi entropy is indeed essential for successful learning, thereby highlighting the tightness of our proposed generalization bound.</description>

      <title>PersianMedQA: Language-Centric Evaluation of LLMs in the Persian Medical Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00250v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of NLP benchmarks, often surpassing human-level accuracy. However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale, expert-validated dataset of multiple-choice Persian medical questions, designed to evaluate LLMs across both Persian and English. We benchmark over 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.3% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 35.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, Persian responses are sometimes more accurate due to cultural and clinical contextual cues. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating multilingual and culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset can be accessed at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA</description>

      <title>Accurate Estimation of Mutual Information in High Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is a measure of statistical dependencies between two variables, widely used in data analysis. Thus, accurate methods for estimating MI from empirical data are crucial. Such estimation is a hard problem, and there are provably no estimators that are universally good for finite datasets. Common estimators struggle with high-dimensional data, which is a staple of modern experiments. Recently, promising machine learning-based MI estimation methods have emerged. Yet it remains unclear if and when they produce accurate results, depending on dataset sizes, statistical structure of the data, and hyperparameters of the estimators, such as the embedding dimensionality or the duration of training. There are also no accepted tests to signal when the estimators are inaccurate. Here, we systematically explore these gaps. We propose and validate a protocol for MI estimation that includes explicit checks ensuring reliability and statistical consistency. Contrary to accepted wisdom, we demonstrate that reliable MI estimation is achievable even with severely undersampled, high-dimensional datasets, provided these data admit accurate low-dimensional representations. These findings broaden the potential use of machine learning-based MI estimation methods in real-world data analysis and provide new insights into when and why modern high-dimensional, self-supervised algorithms perform effectively.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial $t$-Designs from Finite Abelian Groups and Their Applications to Elliptic Curve Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the conditions for some finite abelian groups and the family all the $k$-sets in each of them summing up to an element $x$ to form $t$-designs. We fully characterize the sufficient and necessary conditions for the incidence structures to form $1$-designs in finite abelian $p$-groups, generalizing existing results on vector spaces over finite fields. For finite abelian groups of exponent $pq$, we also propose sufficient and necessary conditions for the incidence structures to form a $1$-designs. Furthermore, some interesting observations of the general case when the group is cyclic or non-cyclic are presented and the relations between $(t-1)$-designs and $t$-designs from subset sums are established. As an application, we demonstrate the correspondence between $t$-designs from the minimum-weight codewords in elliptic curve codes and subset-sum designs in their groups of rational points. By such a correspondence, elliptic curve codes supporting designs can be simply derived from subset sums in finite abelian groups that supporting designs.</description>

Abstract: A metric relation by definition is symmetric. Since many data sets are non-symmetric, in this paper we develop a systematic theory of non-symmetric cost functions. Betweenness relations play an important role. We also introduce the notion of a Dress group in the non-symmetric setting and indicate a notion of curvature.</description>

      <title>Statistical Signal Processing for Quantum Error Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, quantum error mitigation (QEM) is essential for producing reliable outputs from quantum circuits. We present a statistical signal processing approach to QEM that estimates the most likely noiseless outputs from noisy quantum measurements. Our model assumes that circuit depth is sufficient for depolarizing noise, producing corrupted observations that resemble a uniform distribution alongside classical bit-flip errors from readout. Our method consists of two steps: a filtering stage that discards uninformative depolarizing noise and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that computes a maximum likelihood (ML) estimate over the remaining data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on small-qubit systems using IBM circuit simulations in Qiskit and compare its performance to contemporary statistical QEM techniques. We also show that our method scales to larger qubit counts using synthetically generated data consistent with our noise model. These results suggest that principled statistical methods can offer scalable and interpretable solutions for quantum error mitigation in realistic NISQ settings.</description>

      <title>On the Use of Bj\"orck Sequences in LEO-based PNT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of Bj\"orck sequences, a class of constant amplitude zero autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequences, as a potential candidate for the design of positioning reference signals (PRS) in Low Earth Orbit (LEO)-based positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems. Unlike legacy systems such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) or terrestrial networks (TNs), LEO-based systems experience large Doppler shifts and delay spreads, where traditional orthogonalization methods become ineffective. Compared to commonly used sequences such as Gold and Zadoff-Chu (ZC), Bj\"orck sequences offer improved ambiguity function behavior, nearly ideal autocorrelation, greater resilience to interference, and accurate delay estimation in high Doppler environments. We further propose a novel sequence construction method to extend Bj\"orck sequences to non-prime lengths while minimizing cyclic autocorrelation. Focusing on LEO-based non-terrestrial network (NTN) localization, we evaluate positioning accuracy under various interference conditions, comparing the performance of Bj\"orck sequences against Gold sequences, which are traditionally used for PRS generation. While Bj\"orck sequences demonstrate strong performance in Doppler-rich environments, we identify an inherent Doppler-dependent behavior that may lead to sequence misidentification. To mitigate this, we propose two strategies: 1) leveraging the availability of a coarse Doppler estimate and 2) employing sequence subset selection to ensure sufficient separation between sequences to account for maximum Doppler uncertainty. Finally, we present scalable sequence reuse strategies for large LEO constellations.</description>

      <title>Learning DNF through Generalized Fourier Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fourier representation for the uniform distribution over the Boolean cube has found numerous applications in algorithms and complexity analysis. Notably, in learning theory, learnability of Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) under uniform as well as product distributions has been established through such representations. This paper makes five main contributions. First, it introduces a generalized Fourier expansion that can be used with any distribution $D$ through the representation of the distribution as a Bayesian network (BN). Second, it shows that the main algorithmic tools for learning with the Fourier representation, that use membership queries to approximate functions by recovering their heavy Fourier coefficients, can be used with slight modifications with the generalized expansion. These results hold for any distribution. Third, it analyzes the $L_1$ spectral norm of conjunctions under the new expansion, showing that it is bounded for a class of distributions which can be represented by difference bounded tree BN, where a parent node in the BN representation can change the conditional expectation of a child node by at most $\alpha&lt;0.5$. Lower bounds are presented to show that such constraints are necessary. The fourth contribution uses these results to show the learnability of DNF with membership queries under difference bounded tree BN. The final contribution is to develop an algorithm for learning difference-bounded tree BN distributions, thus extending the DNF learnability result to cases where the distribution is not known in advance.</description>

      <title>Linear regression with overparameterized linear neural networks: Tight upper and lower bounds for implicit $\ell^1$-regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning models are often trained in a setting where the number of parameters exceeds the number of training samples. To understand the implicit bias of gradient descent in such overparameterized models, prior work has studied diagonal linear neural networks in the regression setting. These studies have shown that, when initialized with small weights, gradient descent tends to favor solutions with minimal $\ell^1$-norm - an effect known as implicit regularization. In this paper, we investigate implicit regularization in diagonal linear neural networks of depth $D\ge 2$ for overparameterized linear regression problems. We focus on analyzing the approximation error between the limit point of gradient flow trajectories and the solution to the $\ell^1$-minimization problem. By deriving tight upper and lower bounds on the approximation error, we precisely characterize how the approximation error depends on the scale of initialization $\alpha$. Our results reveal a qualitative difference between depths: for $D \ge 3$, the error decreases linearly with $\alpha$, whereas for $D=2$, it decreases at rate $\alpha^{1-\varrho}$, where the parameter $\varrho \in [0,1)$ can be explicitly characterized. Interestingly, this parameter is closely linked to so-called null space property constants studied in the sparse recovery literature. We demonstrate the asymptotic tightness of our bounds through explicit examples. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings and suggest that deeper networks, i.e., $D \ge 3$, may lead to better generalization, particularly for realistic initialization scales.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Clustering in Mixture of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of clustering $T$ trajectories of length $H$, each generated by one of $K$ unknown ergodic Markov chains over a finite state space of size $S$. The goal is to accurately group trajectories according to their underlying generative model. We begin by deriving an instance-dependent, high-probability lower bound on the clustering error rate, governed by the weighted KL divergence between the transition kernels of the chains. We then present a novel two-stage clustering algorithm. In Stage~I, we apply spectral clustering using a new injective Euclidean embedding for ergodic Markov chains -- a contribution of independent interest that enables sharp concentration results. Stage~II refines the initial clusters via a single step of likelihood-based reassignment. Our method achieves a near-optimal clustering error with high probability, under the conditions $H = \tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} (S^2 \vee \pi_{\min}^{-1}))$ and $TH = \tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} S^2 )$, where $\pi_{\min}$ is the minimum stationary probability of a state across the $K$ chains and $\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}$ is the minimum pseudo-spectral gap. These requirements provide significant improvements, if not at least comparable, to the state-of-the-art guarantee (Kausik et al., 2023), and moreover, our algorithm offers a key practical advantage: unlike existing approach, it requires no prior knowledge of model-specific quantities (e.g., separation between kernels or visitation probabilities). We conclude by discussing the inherent gap between our upper and lower bounds, providing insights into the unique structure of this clustering problem.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum MIMO Receivers for The Multi-User Uplink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution for evolving wireless receivers from the classical to the quantum domain. To further unleash their great potential in wireless communications, we propose a flexible architecture for Rydberg atomic quantum multiple-input multiple-output (RAQ-MIMO) receivers in the multi-user uplink. Then the corresponding signal model of the RAQ-MIMO system is constructed by paving the way from quantum physics to classical wireless communications. Explicitly, we outline the associated operating principles and transmission flow. We also validate the linearity of our model and its feasible region. Based on our model, we derive closed-form asymptotic formulas for the ergodic achievable rate (EAR) of both the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers operating in uncorrelated fading channels (UFC) and the correlated fading channels (CFC), respectively. Furthermore, we theoretically characterize the EAR difference both between the UFC and CFC scenarios, as well as MRC and ZF schemes. More particularly, we quantify the superiority of RAQ-MIMO receivers over the classical massive MIMO (M-MIMO) receivers, specifying an increase of $\log_{2} \Pi$ of the EAR per user, $\Pi$-fold reduction of the users' transmit power, and $\sqrt[\nu]{\Pi}$-fold increase of the transmission distance, respectively, where $\Pi = \text{ReceiverGainRatio} / \text{ReceiverNoisePowerRatio}$ of the single-sensor receivers and $\nu$ is the path-loss exponent. Our simulation results reveal that, compared to classical M-MIMO receivers, our RAQ-MIMO scheme can either realize $\sim 12$ bits/s/Hz/user ($\sim 8$ bits/s/Hz/user) higher EAR, or $\sim 10000$-fold ($\sim 500$-fold) lower transmit power, or alternatively, $\sim 100$-fold ($\sim 21$-fold) longer distance in free-space transmissions, in the standard quantum limit (photon shot limit).</description>

      <title>Formal Security Analysis of SPV Clients Versus Home-Based Full Nodes in Bitcoin-Derived Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematically rigorous formal analysis of Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients, as specified in Section 8 of the original Bitcoin white paper, versus non-mining full nodes operated by home users. It defines security as resistance to divergence from global consensus and models transaction acceptance, enforcement capability, and divergence probability under adversarial conditions. The results demonstrate that SPV clients, despite omitting script verification, are cryptographically sufficient under honest-majority assumptions and topologically less vulnerable to attack than structurally passive, non-enforcing full nodes. The paper introduces new axioms on behavioral divergence and communication topology, proving that home-based full nodes increase systemic entropy without contributing to consensus integrity. Using a series of formally defined lemmas, propositions, and Monte Carlo simulation results, it is shown that SPV clients represent the rational equilibrium strategy for non-mining participants. This challenges the prevailing narrative that home validators enhance network security, providing formal and operational justifications for the sufficiency of SPV models.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Latent Space Optimization with Nebula Variational Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning approaches process data in a layer-by-layer way with intermediate (or latent) features. We aim at designing a general solution to optimize the latent manifolds to improve the performance on classification, segmentation, completion and/or reconstruction through probabilistic models. This paper proposes a variational inference model which leads to a clustered embedding. We introduce additional variables in the latent space, called \textbf{nebula anchors}, that guide the latent variables to form clusters during training. To prevent the anchors from clustering among themselves, we employ the variational constraint that enforces the latent features within an anchor to form a Gaussian distribution, resulting in a generative model we refer as Nebula Variational Coding (NVC). Since each latent feature can be labeled with the closest anchor, we also propose to apply metric learning in a self-supervised way to make the separation between clusters more explicit. As a consequence, the latent variables of our variational coder form clusters which adapt to the generated semantic of the training data, \textit{e.g.} the categorical labels of each sample. We demonstrate experimentally that it can be used within different architectures designed to solve different problems including text sequence, images, 3D point clouds and volumetric data, validating the advantage of our proposed method.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the attention-indexed model (AIM), a theoretical framework for analyzing learning in deep attention layers. Inspired by multi-index models, AIM captures how token-level outputs emerge from layered bilinear interactions over high-dimensional embeddings. Unlike prior tractable attention models, AIM allows full-width key and query matrices, aligning more closely with practical transformers. Using tools from statistical mechanics and random matrix theory, we derive closed-form predictions for Bayes-optimal generalization error and identify sharp phase transitions as a function of sample complexity, model width, and sequence length. We propose a matching approximate message passing algorithm and show that gradient descent can reach optimal performance. AIM offers a solvable playground for understanding learning in modern attention architectures.</description>

      <title>Trade-offs in Data Memorization via Strong Data Processing Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research demonstrated that training large language models involves memorization of a significant fraction of training data. Such memorization can lead to privacy violations when training on sensitive user data and thus motivates the study of data memorization's role in learning. In this work, we develop a general approach for proving lower bounds on excess data memorization, that relies on a new connection between strong data processing inequalities and data memorization. We then demonstrate that several simple and natural binary classification problems exhibit a trade-off between the number of samples available to a learning algorithm, and the amount of information about the training data that a learning algorithm needs to memorize to be accurate. In particular, $\Omega(d)$ bits of information about the training data need to be memorized when $O(1)$ $d$-dimensional examples are available, which then decays as the number of examples grows at a problem-specific rate. Further, our lower bounds are generally matched (up to logarithmic factors) by simple learning algorithms. We also extend our lower bounds to more general mixture-of-clusters models. Our definitions and results build on the work of Brown et al. (2021) and address several limitations of the lower bounds in their work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01897v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With increasing size of large language models (LLMs), full-parameter fine-tuning imposes substantial memory demands. To alleviate this, we propose a novel memory-efficient training paradigm called Momentum Low-rank compression (MLorc). By directly compressing and reconstructing momentum rather than gradients, MLorc avoids imposing a fixed-rank constraint on weight update matrices and better preserves the training dynamics of full-parameter fine-tuning, in contrast to existing low-rank approaches such as LoRA and GaLore. Empirically, MLorc consistently outperforms other memory-efficient training methods, matches or even exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning with a small rank (e.g., $r=4$), and generalizes well across different optimizers -- all while not compromising time or memory efficiency. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee for its convergence under reasonable assumptions.</description>

      <title>Aerial Relay to Achieve Covertness and Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06842</link>

Abstract: In this work, a delay-tolerant unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relayed covert and secure communication framework is investigated. In this framework, a legitimate UAV serves as an aerial relay to realize communication when the direct link between the terrestrial transmitter and receiver is blocked and also acts as a friendly jammer to suppress the malicious nodes presented on the ground. Subsequently, considering the uncertainty of malicious nodes' positions, a robust fractional programming optimization problem is built to maximize energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the trajectory of the UAV, the transmit power of the transmitter, and the time-switching factor. For the extremely complicated covert constraint, Pinsker's inequality, Jensen's inequality, and the bisection search method are employed to construct a tractable shrunken one. After this, an alternate optimization-based algorithm is proposed to solve the fractional programming optimization problem. To achieve low complexity, we design the primal-dual search-based algorithm and the successive convex approximation-based algorithm, respectively, for each sub-problem. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Information-Set Decoding for Convolutional Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07621v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for generic decoding of convolutional codes, which allows us to do cryptanalysis of code-based systems that use convolutional codes. We then apply this framework to information set decoding, study success probabilities and give tools to choose variables. Finally, we use this to attack two cryptosystems based on convolutional codes. In the first, our code recovered about 74% of errors in less than 10 hours each, and in the second case, we give experimental evidence that 80% of the errors can be recovered in times corresponding to about 70 bits of operational security, with some instances being significantly lower.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Transform for Fractional Programming in Signal Processing and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09977v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional programming (FP) is a branch of mathematical optimization that deals with the optimization of ratios. It is an invaluable tool for signal processing and machine learning, because many key metrics in these fields are fractionally structured, e.g., the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in wireless communications, the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) in radar sensing, the normalized cut in graph clustering, and the margin in support vector machine (SVM). This article provides a comprehensive review of both the theory and applications of a recently developed FP technique known as the quadratic transform, which can be applied to a wide variety of FP problems, including both the minimization and the maximization of the sum of functions of ratios as well as matrix-ratio problems.</description>

      <title>TeleMoM: Consensus-Driven Telecom Intelligence via Mixture of Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in specialized domains like telecommunication (Telecom) due to technical complexity, specialized terminology, and rapidly evolving knowledge. Traditional methods, such as scaling model parameters or retraining on domain-specific corpora, are computationally expensive and yield diminishing returns, while existing approaches like retrieval-augmented generation, mixture of experts, and fine-tuning struggle with accuracy, efficiency, and coordination. To address this issue, we propose Telecom mixture of models (TeleMoM), a consensus-driven ensemble framework that integrates multiple LLMs for enhanced decision-making in Telecom. TeleMoM employs a two-stage process: proponent models generate justified responses, and an adjudicator finalizes decisions, supported by a quality-checking mechanism. This approach leverages strengths of diverse models to improve accuracy, reduce biases, and handle domain-specific complexities effectively. Evaluation results demonstrate that TeleMoM achieves a 9.7\% increase in answer accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness in Telecom applications.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Movable Antennas in Wideband Multi-User MIMO With Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antennas represent an emerging field in telecommunication research and a potential approach to achieving higher data rates in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications when the total number of antennas is limited. Most solutions and analyses to date have been limited to \emph{narrowband} setups. This work complements the prior studies by quantifying the benefit of using movable antennas in \emph{wideband} MIMO communication systems. First, we derive a novel uplink wideband system model that also accounts for distortion from transceiver hardware impairments. We then formulate and solve an optimization task to maximize the average sum rate by adjusting the antenna positions using particle swarm optimization. Finally, the performance with movable antennas is compared with fixed uniform arrays and the derived theoretical upper bound. The numerical study concludes that the data rate improvement from movable antennas over other arrays heavily depends on the level of hardware impairments, the richness of the multi-path environments, and the number of subcarriers. The present study provides vital insights into the most suitable use cases for movable antennas in future wideband systems.</description>

      <title>Polarforming Antenna Enhanced Sensing and Communication: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel polarforming antenna (PA) to achieve cost-effective wireless sensing and communication. Specifically, the PA can enable polarforming to adaptively control the antenna's polarization electrically as well as tune its position/rotation mechanically, so as to effectively exploit polarization and spatial diversity to reconfigure wireless channels for improving sensing and communication performance. We study an PA-enhanced integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that utilizes user location sensing to facilitate communication between an PA-equipped base station (BS) and PA-equipped users. First, we model the PA channel in terms of transceiver antenna polarforming vectors and antenna positions/rotations. We then propose a two-timescale ISAC protocol, where in the slow timescale, user localization is first performed, followed by the optimization of the BS antennas' positions and rotations based on the sensed user locations; subsequently, in the fast timescale, transceiver polarforming is adapted to cater to the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), with the optimized BS antennas' positions and rotations. We propose a new polarforming-based user localization method that uses a structured time-domain pattern of pilot-polarforming vectors to extract the common stable components in the PA channel across different polarizations based on the parallel factor (PARAFAC) tensor model. Moreover, we maximize the achievable average sum-rate of users by jointly optimizing the fast-timescale transceiver polarforming, including phase shifts and amplitude variations, along with the slow-timescale antenna rotations and positions at the BS. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of polarforming-based localization algorithm and demonstrate the performance advantages of polarforming, antenna placement, and their joint design.</description>

Abstract: Polarforming emerges as a promising technique for manipulating the polarization of electromagnetic (EM) waves by shaping the polarization of an antenna into a desired state. By dynamically adjusting antenna polarization, polarforming enables real-time polarization matching or mismatching with received EM waves, thereby leveraging polarization degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance wireless communication performance. In this article, we first present an overview of the fundamental principles and design approaches underlying the polarforming technique. We then analyze the key advantages of polarforming, including hardware cost reduction, depolarization mitigation, channel adaptation, signal power enhancement, and interference suppression. Furthermore, we explore promising applications of polarforming for next-generation wireless networks. Numerical case studies demonstrate the substantial performance gains of polarforming over conventional fixed-polarization antenna (FPA) systems, along with a discussion of implementation challenges to motivate future research.</description>

      <title>Pre-Training and Personalized Fine-Tuning via Over-the-Air Federated Meta-Learning: Convergence-Generalization Trade-Offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11569v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as large language models (LLMs), the training paradigm has recently shifted to pre-training followed by fine-tuning. Furthermore, owing to dwindling open repositories of data and thanks to efforts to democratize access to AI models, pre-training is expected to increasingly migrate from the current centralized deployments to federated learning (FL) implementations. Meta-learning provides a general framework in which pre-training and fine-tuning can be formalized. Meta-learning-based personalized FL (meta-pFL) moves beyond basic personalization by targeting generalization to new agents and tasks. This paper studies the generalization performance of meta-pFL for a wireless setting in which the agents participating in the pre-training phase, i.e., meta-learning, are connected via a shared wireless channel to the server. Adopting over-the-air computing, we study the trade-off between generalization to new agents and tasks, on the one hand, and convergence, on the other hand. The trade-off arises from the fact that channel impairments may enhance generalization, while degrading convergence. Extensive numerical results validate the theory.</description>

      <title>Softmax is not Enough (for Sharp Size Generalisation)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key property of reasoning systems is the ability to make sharp decisions on their input data. For contemporary AI systems, a key carrier of sharp behaviour is the softmax function, with its capability to perform differentiable query-key lookups. It is a common belief that the predictive power of networks leveraging softmax arises from "circuits" which sharply perform certain kinds of computations consistently across many diverse inputs. However, for these circuits to be robust, they would need to generalise well to arbitrary valid inputs. In this paper, we dispel this myth: even for tasks as simple as finding the maximum key, any learned circuitry must disperse as the number of items grows at test time. We attribute this to a fundamental limitation of the softmax function to robustly approximate sharp functions with increasing problem size, prove this phenomenon theoretically, and propose adaptive temperature as an ad-hoc technique for improving the sharpness of softmax at inference time.</description>
