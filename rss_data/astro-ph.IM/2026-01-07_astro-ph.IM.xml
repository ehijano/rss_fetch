      <title>Predictability of bursts of a recurrent nova using topological data analysis and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RS Oph is a recurrent nova, a kind of cataclismic variable that shows bursts in a period approximately shorter than a century. Persistent homology, a technique from topological data analysis, studies the evolution of topological features of a simplicial complex composed of the data points or an embedding of them, as some distance parameter is varied. For this work I trained a supervised learning model based on several featurizations, namely persistence landscapes, Carlsson coordinates, persistent images, and template functions, of the persistence diagrams of sections of the lightcurve of RS Oph. A tenfold cross validation of the model based on one of the featurizations, persistence landscapes, consistently shows high recalls and accuracies. This method serves the purpose of predicting whether RS Oph is bursting within a year.</description>

      <title>Experiments in binary evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of stars more massive than the Sun is found in binary or multiple star systems and many of them will interact during their evolution. Specific interactions, where progenitors and post-mass transfer (MT) systems are clearly linked, can provide yet missing observational constraints. Volume-complete samples of progenitor and post-MT systems are well suited to study those processes. To compile them, we need to determine the parameters of thousands of binary systems with periods spanning several orders of magnitude. The bottleneck are the orbital parameters, because accurate determinations require a good coverage of the orbital phases. The next generation of time-resolved spectroscopic surveys should be optimized to follow-up and solve whole populations of binary systems in an efficient way. To achieve this, a scheduler predicting the best times of the next observation for any given target in real time should be combined with a flexibly schedulable multi-object spectrograph or ideally a network of independent telescopes.</description>

      <title>Validation of Satellite Lifetime Predictions at Leonid Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We validate Leonid Space's satellite lifetime prediction pipeline through comprehensive backtesting against 934 non-maneuvering satellites that deorbited from LEO between 1961 and 2024. This represents the first large-scale validation of lifetime prediction tooling using forecasted space weather conditions rather than historical hindsight. Our toolchain combines ballistic coefficient estimation from on-orbit data with probabilistic orbit propagation under varying environmental conditions. Using TLE data and space weather records spanning six solar cycles, our three-stage validation approach progressively removes hindsight bias to arrive at fully predictive operational conditions. We achieve 1-year prediction accuracy (median continuously ranked probability score) of 6.0 days (1.6%) under perfect knowledge conditions, 18.6 days (5.1%) with estimated ballistic coefficients and known space weather, and 45.5 days (12.4%) under fully predictive conditions. Comparison against ESA's standard DRAMA &amp; DISCOS toolchain demonstrates a 4x improvement in state-of-the-art accuracy for well-characterized satellites. A custom semianalytic propagator provides a &gt;3500x speedup over Orekit and 4.5x speedup over DRAMA, enabling rapid Monte Carlo analysis across large satellite populations. Our analysis reveals that solar cycle forecasting dominates error budgets after ballistic coefficient estimation, with higher-fidelity propagators and atmosphere models providing marginal benefit. These results establish a validated performance baseline for operational lifetime prediction services supporting LEO mission planning and regulatory compliance.</description>

      <title>Exposure-averaged Gaussian Processes for Combining Overlapping Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physically motivated Gaussian process (GP) kernels for stellar variability, like the commonly used damped, driven simple harmonic oscillators that model stellar granulation and p-mode oscillations, quantify the instantaneous covariance between any two points. For kernels whose timescales are significantly longer than the typical exposure times, such GP kernels are sufficient. For time series where the exposure time is comparable to the kernel timescale, the observed signal represents an exposure-averaged version of the true underlying signal. This distinction is important in the context of recent data streams from Extreme Precision Radial Velocity (EPRV) spectrographs like fast readout stellar data of asteroseismology targets and solar data to monitor the Sun's variability during daytime observations. Current solar EPRV facilities have significantly different exposure times per-site, owing to the different design choices made. Consequently, each instrument traces different binned versions of the same "latent" signal. Here we present a GP framework that accounts for exposure times by computing integrated forms of the instantaneous kernels typically used. These functions allow one to predict the true latent oscillation signals and the exposure-binned version expected by each instrument. We extend the framework to work for instruments with significant time overlap (i.e., similar longitude) by including relative instrumental drift components that can be predicted and separated from the stellar variability components. We use Sun-as-a-star EPRV datasets as our primary example, but present these approaches in a generalized way for application to any dataset where exposure times are a relevant factor or combining instruments with significant overlap.</description>

      <title>Scalable Gaussian Processes for Integrated and Overlapping Measurements Via Augmented State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical measurements are often integrated over finite exposures, which can obscure latent variability on comparable timescales. Correctly accounting for exposure integration with Gaussian Processes (GPs) in such scenarios is essential but computationally challenging: once exposure times vary or overlap across measurements, the covariance matrix forfeits any quasiseparability, forcing O($N^2$) memory and O($N^3$) runtime costs. Linear Gaussian state space models (SSMs) are equivalent to GPs and have well-known O($N$) solutions via the Kalman filter and RTS smoother. In this work, we extend the GP-SSM equivalence to handle integrated measurements while maintaining scalability by augmenting the SSM with an integral state that resets at exposure start times and is observed at exposure end times. This construction yields exactly the same posterior as a fully integrated GP but in O($N$) time on a CPU, and is parallelizable down to O($N/T + \log T$) on a GPU with $T$ parallel workers. We present smolgp (State space Model for O(Linear/log) GPs), an open-source Python/JAX package offering drop-in compatibiltiy with tinygp while supporting both standard and exposure-aware GP modeling. As SSMs provide a framework for representing general GP kernels via their series expansion, smolgp also brings scalable performance to many commonly used covariance kernels in astronomy that lack quasiseparability, such as the quasiperiodic kernel. The substantial performance boosts at large $N$ will enable massive multi-instrument cross-comparisons where exposure overlap is ubiquitous, and unlocks the potential for analyses with more complex models and/or higher dimensional datasets.</description>

      <title>Using 23 Years of ACS/SBC Data to Understand Backgrounds: Significant Reductions in Expected Background Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used 23 years of Hubble Space Telescope ACS/SBC data to study what background levels are encountered in practice and how much they vary. The backgrounds vary considerably, with F115LP, F122M, F125LP, PR110L, and PR130L all showing over an order of magnitude of variation in background between observations, apparently due to changes in airglow. The F150LP and F165LP filters, which are dominated by dark rate, not airglow, exhibit a far smaller variation in backgrounds. For the filters where the background is generally dominated by airglow, the backgrounds measured from the data are significantly lower than what the ETC predicts (as of ETC v33.2). The ETC predictions for `average' airglow are greater than the median of our measured background values by factors of 2.51, 2.64, 105, and 3.64, for F115LP, F122M, F125LP, and F140LP, respectively. A preliminary analysis suggests this could be due to certain OI airglow lines usually being fainter than expected by the ETC. With reduced reduced background levels, the shorter-wavelength SBC filters can conduct background-limited observations much more rapidly than had previously been expected. As of ETC v34.1, a new option will be included for SBC calculations, allowing users to employ empirical background percentiles to estimate required exposure times.</description>

      <title>The Lazuli Space Observatory: Architecture &amp; Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lazuli Space Observatory is a 3-meter aperture astronomical facility designed for rapid-response observations and precision astrophysics across visible to near-infrared wavelengths (400-1700 nm bandpass). An off-axis, freeform telescope delivers diffraction-limited image quality (Strehl $&gt;$0.8 at 633 nm) to three instruments across a wide, flat focal plane. The three instruments provide complementary capabilities: a Wide-field Context Camera (WCC) delivers multi-band imaging over a 35' $\times$ 12' footprint with high-cadence photometry; an Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) provides continuous 400-1700 nm spectroscopy at R $\sim$ 100-500 for stable spectrophotometry; and an ExtraSolar Coronagraph (ESC) enables high-contrast imaging expected to reach raw contrasts of $10^{-8}$ and post-processed contrasts approaching $10^{-9}$. Operating from a 3:1 lunar-resonant orbit, Lazuli will respond to targets of opportunity in under four hours--a programmatic requirement designed to enable routine temporal responsiveness that is unprecedented for a space telescope of this size. Lazuli's technical capabilities are shaped around three broad science areas: (1) time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, (2) stars and planets, and (3) cosmology. These capabilities enable a potent mix of science spanning gravitational wave counterpart characterization, fast-evolving transients, Type Ia supernova cosmology, high-contrast exoplanet imaging, and spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres. While these areas guide the observatory design, Lazuli is conceived as a general-purpose facility capable of supporting a wide range of astrophysical investigations, with open time for the global community. We describe the observatory architecture and capabilities in the preliminary design phase, with science operations anticipated following a rapid development cycle from concept to launch.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical platform for high-frequency gravitational wave and vector dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a proposal for a nanomechanical membrane resonator integrated into a moderate-finesse ($\mathcal{F}\sim 10$) optical cavity as a versatile platform for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves and vector dark matter. Gravitational-wave sensitivity arises from cavity-length modulation, which resonantly drives membrane motion via the radiation-pressure force. This force also enables in situ tuning of the membrane's resonance frequency by nearly a factor of two, allowing a frequency coverage from 0.5 to 40 kHz using six membranes. The detector achieves a peak strain sensitivity of $2\times 10^{-23}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at 40 kHz. Using a silicon membrane positioned near a gallium-arsenide input mirror additionally provides sensitivity to vector dark matter via differential acceleration from their differing atomic-to-mass number ratios. The projected reach surpasses the existing limits in the range of $2\times 10^{-12}$ to $2\times 10^{-10}$ $\text{eV}/c^2$ for a one-year measurement. Consequently, the proposed detector offers a unified approach to searching for physics beyond the Standard Model, probing both high-frequency gravitational waves and vector dark matter.</description>

      <title>The Study of a Cosmic Ray Candidate Detected by the Askaryan Radio Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments designed to detect ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrinos using radio techniques are also capable of detecting the radio signals from cosmic-ray (CR) induced air showers. These CR signals are important both as a background and as a tool for calibrating the detector. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), a radio detector array, is designed to detect UHE neutrinos. The array currently comprises five independent stations, each instrumented with antennas deployed at depths of up to 200 meters within the ice at the South Pole.
  In this study, we focus on a candidate event recorded by ARA Station 2 (A2) that shows features consistent with a downward-going CR-induced air shower. This includes distinctive double-pulse signals in multiple channels, interpreted as geomagnetic and Askaryan radio emissions arriving at the antennas in sequence. To investigate this event, we use detailed simulations that combine a modern ice-impacting CR shower simulation framework, FAERIE, with a realistic detector simulation package, AraSim. We will present results for an optimization of the event topology, identified through simulated CR showers, comparing the vertex reconstruction of both the geomagnetic and Askaryan signals of the event, as well as the observed time delays between the two signals in each antenna.</description>

      <title>SpaceWire-based Data Acquisition Network for the Solar Flare Sounding Rocket Experiment FOXSI-4 and FOXSI-5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a SpaceWire-based data acquisition (DAQ) system for the FOXSI-4 and FOXSI-5 sounding rocket experiments, which aim to observe solar flares with high sensitivity and dynamic range using direct X-ray focusing optics. The FOXSI-4 mission, launched on April 17, 2024, achieved the first direct focusing observation of a GOES M1.6 class solar flare with imaging spectroscopy capabilities in the soft and hard X-ray energy ranges, using a suite of advanced detectors, including two CMOS sensors, four CdTe double-sided strip detectors (CdTe-DSDs), and a Quad-Timepix3 detector. To accommodate the high photon flux from a solar flare and these diverse detector types, a modular DAQ network architecture was implemented based on SpaceWire and the Remote Memory Access Protocol (RMAP). This modular architecture enabled fast, reliable, and scalable communication among various onboard components, including detectors, readout boards, onboard computers, and telemetry systems. In addition, by standardizing the communication interface and modularizing each detector unit and its associated electronics, the architecture also supported distributed development among collaborating institutions, simplifying integration and reducing overall complexity. To realize this architecture, we developed FPGA-based readout boards (SPMU-001 and SPMU-002) that support SpaceWire communication for high-speed data transfer and flexible instrument control. In addition, a real-time ground support system was developed to handle telemetry and command operations during flight, enabling live monitoring and adaptive configuration of onboard instruments in response to the properties of the observed solar flare. The same architecture is being adopted for the upcoming FOXSI-5 mission, scheduled for launch in 2026.</description>

      <title>A New Collision Avoidance Fiber Assignment Algorithm for Robotic Fiber Positioners in Multi-Object Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new fiber assignment algorithm for a robotic fiber positioner system in multi-object spectroscopy. Modern fiber positioner systems typically have overlapping patrol regions, resulting in the number of observable targets being highly dependent on the fiber assignment scheme. To maximize observable targets without fiber collisions, the algorithm proceeds in three steps. First, it assigns the maximum number of targets for a given field of view without considering any collisions between fiber positioners. Then, the fibers in collision are grouped, and the algorithm finds the optimal solution resolving the collision problem within each group. We compare the results from this new algorithm with those from a simple algorithm that assigns targets in descending order of their rank by considering collisions. As a result, we could increase the overall completeness of target assignments by 10% with this new algorithm in comparison with the case using the simple algorithm in a field with 150 fibers. Our new algorithm is designed for the All-sky SPECtroscopic survey of nearby galaxies (A-SPEC) based on the K-SPEC spectrograph system, but can also be applied to similar fiber-based systems with heavily overlapping fiber positioners.</description>

      <title>On the exceptionality of exceptional gravitational-wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In gravitational-wave astronomy, as in other scientific disciplines, ``exceptional'' sources attract considerable interest because they challenge our current understanding of the underlying (astro)physical processes. Crucially, ``exceptionality'' is defined only relative to the rest of the detected population. For instance, among all gravitational-wave events detected so far, GW231123 is the binary black hole with the largest total mass, while GW241110 is the binary black hole with the most strongly misaligned spin relative to the orbital angular momentum. Mandel [Astrophys.J.Lett. 996 (2026) 1, L4] argued that apparent ``exceptionality'' may reflect measurement error rather than an extreme true value, and suggested that the total mass of GW231123 may be significantly overestimated. Here we present a quantitative analysis that supports this conceptual point. We find that claims of ``exceptionality'' obtained under agnostic priors should be critically questioned whenever measurement uncertainties are comparable to the width of the underlying population. Specifically, we find that the total mass of GW231123 is unlikely to be meaningfully affected by this effect while the spin of GW241110 is far less likely to be anti-aligned than initially claimed: about 70% of realizations that appear to yield an ``exceptionally anti-aligned'' spin are in fact consistent with either nonspinning or aligned configurations.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Fe K$\alpha$ Doublet of the Galactic Center Molecular Cloud G0.11-0.11 with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fe K$\alpha$ line emission from Galactic center molecular clouds can be produced either via fluorescence after illumination by an X-ray source or by cosmic ray ionization. Unparalleled high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy obtained by XRISM-Resolve for the galactic center molecular cloud G0.11-0.11 resolves its Fe K$\alpha$ line complex for the first time, and points to a new method for discrimination between the X-ray reflection and cosmic ray ionization models. The Fe K$\alpha$ line complex is resolved into Fe K$\alpha_1$ at $E_{1} = 6.4040 \: \rm{keV}$ and Fe K$\alpha_2$ at $E_{2}= 6.3910 \:\rm{keV}$. Both lines have non-instrumental FWHM of $\approx 3 \:\rm{eV}$, close to the predicted quantum mechanical width of the lines, suggesting scant other sources of line broadening other than instrumental and quantum effects. We measure a radial velocity of $v_{\rm{LSR}} = 50 \pm 12_{fit} \pm 14_{scale} \:\rm{km/s}$ for G0.11-0.11, achieving the same precision reached by radio observations of such clouds. The high-resolution spectrum tests for the presence of secondary Fe K$\alpha$ lines, expected as a signature of cosmic ray proton/ion ionization. The absence of the secondary lines argues against the cosmic ray ionization model for G0.11-0.11. In the preferred X-ray reflection model, if the illuminating source is Sgr A$^{\star}$, the required luminosity for an X-ray outburst about 200 years ago is $L_8 \approx 10^{38} \:\rm{erg/s}$ in an $8\:\rm{keV}$-wide band at $8\:\rm{keV}$.</description>

      <title>Catching 3I/ATLAS Using a Solar Oberth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third interstellar object to be discovered, 3I/ATLAS, has a unique and continually unfolding story to tell about its nature and origin as it is monitored by telescopes on Earth, orbiting Earth and around the Solar System. Previous research into missions using chemical propulsion have only really addressed the direct case, where the opportunity to launch already expired before 3I/ATLAS's discovery. In contrast, investigations herein exploit 'Optimum Interplanetary Trajectory Software' to simulate an alternative indirect option for chemical propulsion, namely the Solar Oberth Manoeuvre (SOM). For a SOM, a low perihelion burn provides maximum benefit from the Oberth Effect, and accelerates the spacecraft rapidly towards the receding 3I/ATLAS. Though in principle feasible, results indicate this option presents significant challenges. For possible launch years between 2031 and 2037 inclusive, a 2035 launch permits the most efficient transfer to 3I/ATLAS. The reference mission requires a SOM at 3.2 Solar Radii from the Sun's centre, with an intercept after 35-50 years. It is found the SOM can leverage spacecraft masses up to $\sim{500}$ kg. Two or three solid propellant boosters could deliver the required SOM $\Delta$V, and furthermore a refuelled Starship Block 3 in LEO has sufficient performance for such a mission. As inevitable with a SOM, some of the payload mass would be needed for a heat shield to protect against the high solar flux at low perihelion.</description>

      <title>Orchestral AI: A Framework for Agent Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of LLM agent frameworks has forced developers to choose between vendor lock-in through provider-specific SDKs and complex multi-package ecosystems that obscure control flow and hinder reproducibility. Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers remains a core engineering challenge due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming and tool-calling behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems. We introduce Orchestral, a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers while preserving the simplicity required for scientific computing and production deployment. Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries. A synchronous execution model with streaming support enables deterministic behavior, straightforward debugging, and real-time interaction without introducing server dependencies. The framework's modular architecture cleanly separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user-facing interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement. Orchestral supports advanced agent capabilities found in larger frameworks, including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration.</description>

      <title>Meteor observations as a tool to constrain cosmogonic models of the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of small bodies of the Solar System showed evidence of the presence of refractory (asteroidal) material in the Oort cloud. Different models of the origin of the Solar System predict different numbers of rocky objects in the Oort cloud, meaning that measurement of this population can be used as an observational constraint for cosmogonic models. The aim of our work is to study how the data obtained from meteor observations can be used as a tool for distinguishing among the existing cosmogonic models. We investigated two meteor databases collected by the cameras of the All-Sky Meteor Orbit System (AMOS) located in the Canary Islands and in Chile. We describe methodology and results of the search for unusually strong rocky meteoroids on cometary orbits with the origin in the Oort cloud. These data will be used to calculate the fluxes of meteors of different compositions in order to constrain the ratio of icy and rocky components of the Oort cloud. For the flux determination, we estimate the observational time and effective area of the AMOS system.</description>

      <title>Where does the simplified Stellar Contamination Model fail in Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02621v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar photospheric heterogeneities (e.g., starspots, faculae) distort the stellar spectrum in transit and imprint wavelength-dependent biases on the planet-to-star radius ratio (Transit Light Source Effect, TLSE). The Rackham-TLSE (R-TLSE) prescription applies a disc-averaged correction based solely on filling factor and spectral contrast, but transmission spectroscopy also depends on limb darkening, active-region distribution, and transit geometry. We include these in a pixel-resolved framework, ECLIPSE-Xlambda, and run idealised noise-free model-model comparisons to R-TLSE. For LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, and WASP-69 b, disc-averaged corrections differ from the pixel model by up to about 400 ppm in the optical for active hosts and non-equatorial transits, but stay below about 10 ppm in the near-infrared where limb darkening is weak. We then apply both approaches to the JWST/NIRISS SOSS spectrum of LHS 1140 b. With limb darkening set to zero, ECLIPSE-Xlambda recovers stellar-contamination parameters matching the reference R-TLSE solution, confirming consistency in the disc-averaged limit. With wavelength-dependent limb darkening, reproducing the short-wavelength slope via stellar contamination alone requires hot faculae (delta Tfac about 600 K; ffac about 0.35), equivalent to a circular facular region of radius about 0.6 Rstar (about 60% of the stellar radius) on the disc; such an extended unocculted region is physically unlikely even for an active M dwarf. Purely stellar contamination would therefore require extreme faculae, whereas a genuine atmospheric contribution complementing a more modest facular signal is more plausible. These results delineate the validity regime of R-TLSE and underscore the need for geometry-aware stellar-heterogeneity models including limb darkening in high-precision transmission spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Utilizing anticoincidence veto in a search for gravitational-wave transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We devise a technique to suppress the effect of noise transients occurring at gravitational-wave detectors based on temporal anticoincidence. Searches for gravitational-wave signals in the detector data are prone to spurious disturbances of terrestrial origin. The technique presented here benefits from the fact that such effects are generally non-coincident in time at geographically separated detectors. Therefore, abnormally loud triggers that are not time-coincident can be vetoed. We implement the veto technique in a matched-filter search for transient signals from binary black holes and observe search backgrounds to be generally close to the Gaussian limit. An improvement in the sensitivity of the search is demonstrated using simulated signals. The technique is expected to especially improve the detection efficiency of the search toward short duration transient signals.</description>

      <title>Beyond Sgr A* and M87*: Sub-Microarcsecond Black Hole Shadow Detection via Lunar-based Extremely Long Baseline Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 1.3 mm ground-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) array, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), is limited by the Earth's diameter and can image the supermassive black hole (SMBH) shadows of only M87* and Sgr A*. Extending the array with an assumed lunar-based telescope could achieve $\sim 0.85\ \mu$as angular resolution at 230 GHz, enabling black hole shadow detection for a larger SMBH sample. The concept is motivated by space VLBI missions and lunar exploration, including the ongoing Lunar Orbit VLBI Experiment (LOVEX) aboard QueQiao-2 (Chang'E-7) and the planned International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). We assess shadow detectability for 31 SMBH with predicted large angular sizes, exploring different telescope location and antenna size. Assuming a telescope at the lunar antipode, we simulate the Moon-Earth (u,v) coverage and show that source geometry relative to the Moon's orbit determines whether the primary indicator of shadow, first visibility null, can be sampled. Using a geometric ring model, we identify six high-priority targets: M104, NGC 524, PGC 049940, NGC 5077, NGC 5252, and NGC 1052. Shadows of M104, NGC 5077, and NGC 1052 are detectable with a 5 m lunar-based telescope; PGC 049940 requires 20 m; NGC 524 and NGC 5252 require 100 m. Photon ring detection for Sgr A*, M87*, NGC 1600, and M31 is possible if space telescopes fill the baseline coverage gaps and sensitivity requirements are met. These results provide a clear scientific and technical motivation for lunar-based telescopes in future black hole shadow studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design and testing of a prototype multiplexing kinetic inductance detector (KID) readout electronics for the PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) space mission. PRIMA is a Probe-class astrophysics mission concept that will answer fundamental questions about the formation of planetary systems, the co-evolution of stars and supermassive black holes in galaxies, and the rise of heavy elements and dust over cosmic time. The readout electronics for PRIMA must be compatible with operation at Earth-Sun L2 and capable of multiplexing more than 1000 detectors over 2.5 GHz bandwidth while consuming around 30 W per readout chain. The electronics must also be capable of switching between the two instruments, which have different readout bands: the hyperspectral imager (PRIMAger, 2.6-4.9 GHz) and the spectrometer (FIRESS, 0.4-2.4 GHz). The PRIMA readout electronics use high-heritage SpaceCube digital electronics with a build-to-print SpaceCube Mini v3.0 board using a radiation-tolerant Kintex KU060 field programmable gate array (FPGA) and a custom high-speed digitizer board, along with RF electronics that provide filtering and power conditioning. We present the driving requirements for the system, as well as the hardware, firmware, software, and system-level design that meets those requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The AXIS Community Science Book represents the collective effort of 592 scientists worldwide to define the transformative science enabled by the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), a next-generation X-ray mission selected by NASA's Astrophysics Probe Program for Phase A study. AXIS will advance the legacy of high-angular-resolution X-ray astronomy with ~1.5'' imaging over a wide 24' field of view and an order of magnitude greater collecting area than Chandra in the 0.3-12 keV band. Combining sharp imaging, high throughput, and rapid response capabilities, AXIS will open new windows on virtually every aspect of modern astrophysics, exploring the birth and growth of supermassive black holes, the feedback processes that shape galaxies, the life cycles of stars and exoplanet environments, and the nature of compact stellar remnants, supernova remnants, and explosive transients. This book compiles 138 community-contributed science cases developed by five Science Working Groups focused on AGN and supermassive black holes, galaxy evolution and feedback, compact objects and supernova remnants, stellar physics and exoplanets, and time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these studies establish the scientific foundation for next-generation X-ray exploration in the 2030s and highlight strong synergies with facilities of the 2030s, such as JWST, Roman, Rubin/LSST, SKA, ALMA, ngVLA, and next-generation gravitational-wave and neutrino networks.</description>
