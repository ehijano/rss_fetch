      <title>Weighted norm inequalities of higher-order Riesz transforms associated with Laguerre expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\nu=(\nu_1,\ldots,\nu_n)\in (-1,\vc)^n$, $n\ge 1$, and let $\mathcal{L}_\nu$ be a self-adjoint extension of the differential operator \[ L_\nu := \sum_{i=1}^n \left[-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i^2} + x_i^2 + \frac{1}{x_i^2}(\nu_i^2 - \frac{1}{4})\right] \] on $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}_+^n)$ as the natural domain. The $j$-th partial derivative associated with $L_{\nu}$ is given by \[ \delta_{\nu_j} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} + x_j-\frac{1}{x_j}\Big(\nu_j + \f{1}{2}\Big), \ \ \ \ j=1,\ldots, n. \] In this paper, we investigate the weighted estimates of the higher-order Riesz transforms $\delta_\nu^k\mathcal L^{-|k|/2}_\nu, k\in \mathbb N^n$, where $\delta_\nu^k=\delta_{\nu_n}^{k_n}\ldots \delta_{\nu_1}^{k_1}$. This completes the description of the boundedness of the higher-order Riesz transforms with the full range $\nu \in (-1,\vc)^n$.</description>

      <title>Limits of Discrete Energy of Families of Increasing Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hausdorff dimension of a set can be detected using the Riesz energy. Here, we consider situations where a sequence of points, $\{x_n\}$, ``fills in'' a set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ in an appropriate sense and investigate the degree to which the discrete analog to the Riesz energy of these sets can be used to bound the Hausdorff dimension of $E$. We also discuss applications to data science and Erd\H{o}s/Falconer type problems.</description>

      <title>Boundedness and compactness of Bergman projection commutators in two-weight setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study the boundedness and compactness of the Bergman projection commutators in two weighted settings via the weighted BMO and VMO spaces, respectively. The novelty of our work lies in the distinct treatment of the symbol b in the commutator, depending on whether it is analytic or not, which turns out to be quite different. In particular, we show that an additional weight condition due to Aleman, Pott, and Reguera is necessary to study the commutators when b is not analytic, while it can be relaxed when b is analytic. In the analytic setting, we completely characterize boundedness and compactness, while in the non-analytic setting, we provide a sufficient condition which generalizes the Euclidean case and is also necessary in many cases of interest. Our work initiates a study of the commutators acting on complex function spaces with different symbols.</description>

      <title>On exponential frames near the critical density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a relatively compact set $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of Lebesgue measure $|\Omega|$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we show the existence of a set $\Lambda \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of uniform density $D (\Lambda) \leq (1+\varepsilon) |\Omega|$ such that the exponential system $\{ \exp(2\pi i \lambda \cdot) \mathbf{1}_{\Omega}: \lambda \in \Lambda \}$ is a frame for $L^2 (\Omega)$ with frame bounds $A |\Omega|, B |\Omega|$ for constants $A,B$ only depending on $\varepsilon$. This solves a problem on the frame bounds of an exponential frame near the critical density posed by Nitzan, Olevskii and Ulanovskii. We also prove an extension to locally compact abelian groups, which improves a result by Agora, Antezana and Cabrelli by providing frame bounds involving the spectrum.</description>

      <title>A general form of Newton-Maclaurin type inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the classical Newton-Maclaurin inequalities to functions $S_{k;s}(x)=E_k(x)+\dsum_{i=1}^s \al_i E_{k-i}(x)$, which are formed by linear combinations of multiple basic symmetric mean. We proved that when the coefficients $\al_1,\al_2,\cdots,\al_s$ satisfy the condition that the polynomial $$t^s+\al_1 t^{s-1}+\al_2 t^{s-2}+\cdots+\al_s $$ has only real roots, the Newton-Maclaurin type inequalities hold for $S_{k;s}(x)$.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian stochastic Lie systems and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a practical approach to stochastic Lie systems, i.e. stochastic differential equations whose general solutions can be written as a function depending only on a generic family of particular solutions and some constants related to initial conditions. We correct the stochastic Lie theorem characterising stochastic Lie systems proving that, contrary to previous claims, it retains its classical form in the Stratonovich approach. Meanwhile, we show that the form of stochastic Lie systems may significantly differ from the classical one in the It\^{o} formalism. New generalisations of stochastic Lie systems, like the so-called stochastic foliated Lie systems, are devised. Subsequently, we focus on stochastic Lie systems that are Hamiltonian systems relative to different geometric structures. Special attention is paid to the symplectic case. We study their stability properties and devise the basics of a stochastic energy-momentum method. A stochastic Poisson coalgebra method is developed to derive superposition rules for Hamiltonian stochastic Lie systems. Potential applications of our results are shown for biological stochastic models, stochastic oscillators, stochastic Lotka--Volterra systems, Palomba--Goodwin models, among others. Our findings complement previous approaches by using stochastic differential equations instead of deterministic equations designed to grasp some of the features of models of stochastic nature.</description>

      <title>Rational approximation of Euler's constant using multiple orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct new rational approximants of Euler's constant that improve those of Aptekarev et al. (2007) and Rivoal (2009). The approximants are given in terms of certain (mixed type) multiple orthogonal polynomials associated with the exponential integral. The dual family of multiple orthogonal polynomials leads to new rational approximants of the Gompertz constant that improve those of Aptekarev et al. (2007). Our approach is motivated by the fact that we can reformulate Rivoal's construction in terms of type I multiple Laguerre polynomials of the first kind by making use of the underlying Riemann-Hilbert problem. As a consequence, we can drastically simplify Rivoal's approach, which allows us to study the Diophantine and asymptotic properties of the approximants more easily.</description>

      <title>On the algebra of equal-input matrices in time-inhomogeneous Markov flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov matrices of equal-input type constitute a widely used model class. The corresponding equal-input generators span an interesting subalgebra of the real matrices with zero row sums. Here, we summarise some of their amazing properties and discuss the corresponding Markov embedding problem, both homogeneous and inhomogeneous in time. In particular, we derive exact and explicit solutions for time-inhomogeneous Markov flows with non-commuting generator families of equal-input type and beyond.</description>

      <title>Proofs of Mizuno's Conjectures on Rank Three Nahm Sums of Index $(1,2,2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mizuno provided 15 examples of generalized rank three Nahm sums with symmetrizer $\mathrm{diag}(1,2,2)$ which are conjecturally modular. Using the theory of Bailey pairs and some $q$-series techniques, we establish a number of triple sum Rogers--Ramanujan type identities. These identities confirm the modularity of all of Mizuno's examples except that two Nahm sums are sums of modular forms of weights $0$ and $1$. We also prove Mizuno's conjectural modular transformation formulas for two vector-valued functions consisting of Nahm sums with symmetrizers $\mathrm{diag}(1,1,2)$ and $\mathrm{diag}(1,2,2)$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Sextic Freud Weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of the sequence of coefficients $(\b_n)_{n\geq0}$ in the recurrence relation satisfied by the sequence of monic symmetric polynomials, orthogonal with respect to the symmetric sextic Freud weight $$\omega(x; \tau, t) = \exp(-x^6 + \tau x^4 + t x^2), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}, $$ with real parameters $\tau$ and $t$. We derive a fourth-order nonlinear discrete equation satisfied by $\beta_n$, which is shown to be a special case of {the second} member of the discrete Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy. Further, we analyse differential and differential-difference equations satisfied by the recurrence coefficients. The emphasis is to offer a comprehensive study of the intricate evolution in the behaviour of these recurrence coefficients as the pair of parameters $(\tau,t)$ change. A comprehensive numerical and computational analysis is carried out for critical parameter ranges, and graphical plots are presented to illustrate the behaviour of the recurrence coefficients as well as the complexity of the associated Volterra lattice hierarchy. The corresponding symmetric sextic Freud polynomials are shown to satisfy a second-order differential equation with rational coefficients. The moments of the weight are examined in detail, including their integral representations, differential equations, and recursive structure. Closed-form expressions for moments are obtained in several special cases, and asymptotic expansions for the recurrence coefficients are provided. The results highlight rich algebraic and analytic structures underlying the symmetric sextic Freud weight and its connections to integrable systems.</description>
