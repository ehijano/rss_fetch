      <title>Linearly Stable Generalizations of ESFR Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy stable flux reconstruction (ESFR) method encompasses an infinite family of high-order, linearly stable schemes and thus provides a flex- ible and efficient framework for achieving high levels of accuracy on unstruc- tured grids. One remarkable property of ESFR schemes is their ability to be expressed equivalently as linearly filtered discontinuous Galerkin (FDG) schemes. In this study, we introduce Sobolev Stable discontinuous Galerkin (SSDG) schemes, a new conservative and linearly stable generalization of ESFR schemes via the FDG framework. Additionally, we review existing generalizations of the ESFR method and consider their relationship with the FDG framework. The linear properties of SSDG schemes are studied via Von Neumann analysis and compared to those of the existing extended ESFR (EESFR) method. It is found that while SSDG and EESFR schemes exhibit fundamentally different dispersive and dissipative behaviors, they can achieve a similar increase in CFL limit and exhibit a similar spectral order of accuracy. Moreover, it is seen that the range of scheme parameters over which SSDG schemes can be used to increase the explicit time-stepping limit is much larger than for EESFR schemes. Finally, it is observed that the order of accuracy of EESFR schemes under h-refinement is generally p + 1 while that of SSDG schemes is p.</description>

      <title>Fast spectral separation method for kinetic equation with anisotropic non-stationary collision operator retaining micro-model fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalized, data-driven collisional operator for one-component plasmas, learned from molecular dynamics simulations, to extend the collisional kinetic model beyond the weakly coupled regime. The proposed operator features an anisotropic, non-stationary collision kernel that accounts for particle correlations typically neglected in classical Landau formulations. To enable efficient numerical evaluation, we develop a fast spectral separation method that represents the kernel as a low-rank tensor product of univariate basis functions. This formulation admits an $O(N \log N)$ algorithm via fast Fourier transforms and preserves key physical properties, including discrete conservation laws and the H-theorem, through a structure-preserving central difference discretization. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model accurately captures plasma dynamics in the moderately coupled regime beyond the standard Landau model while maintaining high computational efficiency and structure-preserving properties.</description>

      <title>Reduced order method based Anderson-type acceleration method for nonlinear least square problems and large scale ill-posed problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the Anderson's type acceleration method for numerical optimizations. Most mathematical modeling problems can be formulated as constrained optimization. The necessary optimality condition is written as a fixed point problem in a Banach space. Anderson's acceleration method improves the convergence of the standard fixed point iteration by minimizing the total sum of residuals and updating solutions through an optimal linear combination of a sequence of iterates. Thus, it is a form of iterative method of retard which uses the history of solutions as a reduced order element method (ROM). The weights are determined optimally by the least squares problem based on the total residual. We analyze Anderson's method and the reduced order method (ROM) for nonlinear least squares problems of minimizing |F(x)| squared. That is, the solution is approximated by a linear combination of sequentially generated solutions, and then we minimize the equation error on the linear manifold spanned by the iterates. We use the reduced order Gauss Newton method to solve the least squares problem for |F(x)| squared on the linear solution manifold. For the linear equation case it is similar to Anderson's method. Anderson's method approximates the solution to the nonlinear ROM. We consider variable step size gradient and quasi Newton methods and the variable fixed point iteration to generate the solution basis, then combine these with ROM acceleration. It converges very rapidly if the condition number of matrix A is not large. The variable iterate with ROM acceleration is nearly optimal, and ROM also regularizes and stabilizes the convergence. We also consider a randomly overlapped Kaczmarz type method and develop an acceleration approach for large scale ill posed linear systems. Finally, we analyze the convergence of the ROM to the operator equation.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Space-Time Two-Grid Compact Difference Scheme for the Two-Dimensional Viscous Burgers' Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an efficient space-time two-grid compact difference (ST-TGCD) scheme for solving the two-dimensional (2D) viscous Burgers' equation subject to initial and periodic boundary conditions. The proposed approach combines a compact finite difference discretization with a two-grid strategy to achieve high computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. In the coarse-grid stage, a fixed-point iteration is employed to handle the nonlinear system, while in the fine-grid stage, linear temporal and cubic spatial Lagrange interpolations are used to construct initial approximations. The final fine-grid solution is refined through a carefully designed linearized correction scheme. Rigorous analysis establishes unconditional convergence of the method, demonstrating second-order accuracy in time and fourth-order accuracy in space. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical results and show that the ST-TGCD scheme reduces CPU time by more than 70\% compared with the traditional nonlinear compact difference (NCD) method, while maintaining comparable accuracy. These findings confirm the proposed scheme as a highly efficient alternative to conventional nonlinear approaches.</description>

      <title>A Novel Preconditioning Framework for Solving Nonlinear PDEs based on Fenchel-Rockafellar Duality and Transformed Primal-Dual Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A DualTPD method is proposed for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. The method is characterized by three main features. First, decoupling via Fenchel--Rockafellar duality is achieved, so that nonlinear terms are discretized by discontinuous finite element spaces, yielding block-diagonal mass matrices and closed-form updates. Second, improved convergence is obtained by applying transformed primal--dual (TPD) dynamics to the nonlinear saddle-point system, which yields strongly monotone behavior. Third, efficient preconditioners are designed for the elliptic-type Schur complement arising from the separated differential operators, and multigrid solvers are applied effectively. Extensive numerical experiments on elliptic $p$-Laplacian and nonlinear $H(\curl)$ problems are presented, showing significant efficiency gains with global, mesh-independent convergence.</description>

      <title>Second order explicit stabilized multirate method for stiff differential equations with error control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit stabilized methods are highly efficient time integrators for large and stiff systems of ordinary differential equations especially when applied to semi-discrete parabolic problems. However, when local spatial mesh refinement is introduced, their efficiency decreases, since the stiffness is driven by only the smallest mesh element. A natural approach is to split the system into fast stiff and slower mildly stiff components. In this context, [A. Abdulle, M.J. Grote and G. Rosilho de Souza 2022] proposed the order one multirate explicit stabilized method (mRKC). We extend their approach to second order and introduce the new multirate ROCK2 method (mROCK2), which achieves high precision and allows a step-size strategy with error control. Numerical methods including the heat equation with local spatial mesh refinements confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the scheme.</description>

      <title>Rational methods for abstract linear initial boundary value problems without order reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an $A$-stable rational approximation to $e^z$ of order $p$, numerical procedures are suggested to time integrate abstract, well-posed IBVPs, with time-dependent source term $f$ and boundary value $g$. These procedures exhibit the optimal order $p$ and can be implemented by using just one single evaluation of $f$ and $g$ per step, i.e., no evaluations of the derivatives of data are needed, and are of practical use at least for $p\le 6$. The full discretization is also studied and the theoretical results are corroborated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we design and analyze a hybrid high-order (HHO) finite element approximation for the solution of a nonlocal nonlinear problem of Kirchhoff type. The HHO method involves arbitrary-order polynomial approximations on structured and unstructured polytopal meshes. We establish the existence of a unique discrete solution to the nonlocal nonlinear discrete problem. We derive an optimal-order error estimate in the discrete energy norm. The discrete system is solved using Newton's iterations on the sparse matrix system. We perform numerical tests to substantiate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>High order Tensor-Train-Based Schemes for High-Dimensional Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fully discrete scheme to solve a class of high-dimensional Mean Field Games systems. Our approach couples semi-Lagrangian (SL) time discretizations with Tensor-Train (TT) decompositions to tame the curse of dimensionality. By reformulating the classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck equations as a sequence of advection-diffusion-reaction subproblems within a smoothed policy iteration, we construct both first and second order in time SL schemes. The TT format and appropriate quadrature rules reduce storage and computational cost from exponential to polynomial in the dimension. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our TT-accelerated SL methods achieve their theoretical convergence rates, exhibit modest growth in memory usage and runtime with dimension, and significantly outperform grid-based SL in accuracy per CPU second.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of Sobolev Gradient flows for the rotating Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the numerical approximation of the ground state of rotating Bose--Einstein condensates, formulated as the minimization of the Gross--Pitaevskii energy functional under a mass conservation constraint. To solve this problem, we consider three Sobolev gradient flow schemes: the $H_0^1$ scheme, the $a_0$ scheme, and the $a_u$ scheme. Convergence of these schemes in the non-rotating case was established by Chen et al., and the rotating $a_u$ scheme was analyzed in Henning et al. In this work, we prove the global convergence of the $H_0^1$ and $a_0$ schemes in the rotating case, and establish local linear convergence for all three schemes near the ground state. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Waveholtz Iteration on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyse the Waveholtz method, a time-domain iterative method for solving the Helmholtz iteration, in the constant-coefficient case in all of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that the difference between a Waveholtz iterate and the outgoing Helmholtz solution satisfies a Helmholtz equation with a particular kind of forcing. For this forcing, we prove a frequency-explicit estimate in weighted Sobolev norms, that shows a decrease of the differences as $1/\sqrt{n}$ in terms of the iteration number $n$. This guarantees the convergence of the real parts of the Waveholtz iterates to the real part of the outgoing solution of the Helmholtz equation.</description>

      <title>Longer time accuracy for the Ladyzhenskya model with the EMAC formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we incorporate the EMAC formulation into the Ladyzhenskaya model (LM), a large eddy simulation (LES) of incompressible flows. The EMAC formulation, which conserves energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum even with weak enforcement of incompressibility, has been shown to provide tangible benefits over the popular skew-symmetric for direct numerical simulation and regularized models of the Navier Stokes equations (NSE). The combination of EMAC with the LM addresses the known over-dissipation issues associated with the classical Smagorinsky model (SM). We develop a finite element discretization for the EMAC-LM system and analyze its stability and derive numerical error estimates, showing improved long-time behavior compared to the standard LM approach, particularly due to EMAC's favorable Gronwall constant independent of the Reynolds number. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that the EMAC-LM model yields more accurate flow structures, especially at high Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-preserving conservative semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin schemes for the Vlasov-Poisson system in the quasi-neutral limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discretize the Vlasov-Poisson system using conservative semi-Lagrangian (CSL) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes that are asymptotic preserving (AP) in the quasi-neutral limit. The proposed method (CSLDG) relies on two key ingredients: the CSLDG discretization and a reformulated Poisson equation (RPE). The use of the CSL formulation ensures local mass conservation and circumvents the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition, while the DG method provides high-order accuracy for capturing fine-scale phase space structures of the distribution function. The RPE is derived by the Poisson equation coupled with moments of the Vlasov equation. The synergy between the CSLDG and RPE components makes it possible to obtain reliable numerical solutions, even when the spatial and temporal resolution might not fully resolve the Debye length. We rigorously prove that the proposed method is asymptotically stable, consistent and satisfies AP properties. Moreover, its efficiency is maintained across non-quasi-neutral and quasi-neutral regimes. These properties of our approach are essential for accurate and robust numerical simulation of complex electrostatic plasmas. Several numerical experiments verify the accuracy, stability and efficiency of the proposed CSLDG schemes.</description>

      <title>Automotive Crash Dynamics Modeling Accelerated with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design, traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training. The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity, demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.</description>

      <title>Minimisation of Submodular Functions Using Gaussian Zeroth-Order Random Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the minimisation problem of submodular functions and investigate the application of a zeroth-order method to this problem. The method is based on exploiting a Gaussian smoothing random oracle to estimate the smoothed function gradient. We prove the convergence of the algorithm to a global $\epsilon$-approximate solution in the offline case and show that the algorithm is Hannan-consistent in the online case with respect to static regret. Moreover, we show that the algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{NP_N^\ast})$ dynamic regret, where $N$ is the number of iterations and $P_N^\ast$ is the path length. The complexity analysis and hyperparameter selection are presented for all the cases. The theoretical results are illustrated via numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Second-order discretization of Dyson series: iterative method, numerical analysis and applications in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general strategy to discretize the Dyson series without applying direct numerical quadrature to high-dimensional integrals, and extend this framework to open quantum systems. The resulting discretization can also be interpreted as a Strang splitting combined with a Taylor expansion. Based on this formulation, we develop a numerically exact iterative method for simulation system-bath dynamics. We propose two numerical schemes, which are first-order and second-order in time step $\Delta t$ respectively. We perform a rigorous numerical analysis to establish the convergence orders of both schemes, proving that the global error decreases as $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)$ for the first- and second-order methods, respectively. In the second-order scheme, we can safely omitted most terms arising from the Strang splitting and Taylor expansion while maintaining second-order accuracy, leading to a substantial reduction in computational complexity. For the second-order method, we achieves a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(M^3 2^{2K_{\max}} K_{\max}^2)$ and a space complexity of $\mathcal{O}(M^2 2^{2K_{\max}} K_{\max})$ where $M$ denotes the number of system levels and $K_{\max}$ the number of time steps within the memory length. Compared with existing methods, our approach requires substantially less memory and computational effort for multilevel systems ($M\geqslant 3$). Numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the validity and efficiency of our method.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Bilevel Optimization with Gradient Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization (BLO) offers a principled framework for hierarchical decision-making and has been widely applied in machine learning tasks such as hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning. While existing BLO methods are mostly developed in Euclidean spaces, many real-world problems involve structural constraints. In this paper, we propose a Riemannian bilevel optimization (RBLO) algorithm that incorporates a bilevel descent aggregation (BDA) scheme to jointly coordinate upper- and lower-level updates. Concretely, first we abstract the constraints in the BLO to a manifold structure and then transform the constrained BLO be a unconstrained RBLO problem. Second, to address limitations of existing RBLO methods, particularly the restrictive assumptions required for convergence, we reformulate the bilevel problem using smooth manifold mappings and provide a convergence analysis under the conditions of geodesic convexity and Lipschitz smoothness. Finally, we recall the multi-view hypergraph spectral clustering task, and evaluate the proposed approach on 3sources data sets. The numerical results validate the superior performance over Euclidean and manifold-based baselines.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flows for the $p$-Laplacian Arising from Biological Network Models: A Novel Dynamical Relaxation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a scalar partial differential equation model for the formation of biological transportation networks. Starting from a discrete graph-based formulation on equilateral triangulations, we rigorously derive the corresponding continuum energy functional as the $\Gamma$-limit under network refinement and establish the existence of global minimizers. The model possesses a gradient-flow structure whose steady states coincide with solutions of the $p$-Laplacian equation. Building on this connection, we implement finite element discretizations and propose a novel dynamical relaxation scheme that achieves optimal convergence rates in manufactured tests and exhibits mesh-independent performance, with the number of time steps, nonlinear iterations, and linear solves remaining stable under uniform mesh refinement. Numerical experiments confirm both the ability of the scalar model to reproduce biologically relevant network patterns and its effectiveness as a computationally efficient relaxation strategy for solving $p$-Laplacian equations for large exponents $p$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimisation (BO) is a standard approach for sample-efficient global optimisation of expensive black-box functions, yet its scalability to high dimensions remains challenging. Here, we investigate nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques that reduce the problem to a sequence of low-dimensional Latent-Space BO (LSBO). While early LSBO methods used (linear) random projections (Wang et al., 2013), building on Grosnit et al. (2021), we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for LSBO, focusing on deep metric loss for structured latent manifolds and VAE retraining to adapt the encoder-decoder to newly sampled regions. We propose some changes in their implementation, originally designed for tasks such as molecule generation, and reformulate the algorithm for broader optimisation purposes. We then couple LSBO with Sequential Domain Reduction (SDR) directly in the latent space (SDR-LSBO), yielding an algorithm that narrows the latent search domains as evidence accumulates. Implemented in a GPU-accelerated BoTorch stack with Matern-5/2 Gaussian process surrogates, our numerical results show improved optimisation quality across benchmark tasks and that structured latent manifolds improve BO performance. Additionally, we compare random embeddings and VAEs as two mechanisms for dimensionality reduction, showing that the latter outperforms the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to combine SDR with VAE-based LSBO, and our analysis clarifies design choices for metric shaping and retraining that are critical for scalable latent space BO.

      <title>Theoretical Refinement of CLIP by Utilizing Linear Structure of Optimal Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information (PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI. We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across several retrieval and classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural ODE Operator Networks for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a scalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for continuous optimization problems have a rich history of design and innovation over the past several decades, in which mathematical analysis of their convergence and complexity properties plays a central role. Besides their theoretical properties, optimization algorithms are interesting also for their practical usefulness as computational tools for solving real-world problems. There are often gaps between the practical performance of an algorithm and what can be proved about it. These two facets of the field -- the theoretical and the practical -- interact in fascinating ways, each driving innovation in the other. This work focuses on the development of algorithms in two areas -- linear programming and unconstrained minimization of smooth functions -- outlining major algorithm classes in each area along with their theoretical properties and practical performance, and highlighting how advances in theory and practice have influenced each other in these areas. In discussing theory, we focus mainly on non-asymptotic complexity, which are upper bounds on the amount of computation required by a given algorithm to find an approximate solution of problems in a given class.</description>

      <title>Subspace method of moments for ab initio 3-D single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a widely used technique for recovering the 3-D structure of biological molecules from a large number of experimentally generated noisy 2-D tomographic projection images of the 3-D structure, taken from unknown viewing angles. Through computationally intensive algorithms, these observed images are processed to reconstruct the 3-D structures. Many popular computational methods rely on estimating the unknown angles as part of the reconstruction process, which becomes particularly challenging at low signal-to-noise ratios. The method of moments (MoM) offers an alternative approach that circumvents the estimation of viewing orientations of individual projection images by instead estimating the underlying distribution of the viewing angles, and is robust to noise given sufficiently many images. However, the method of moments typically entails computing higher-order moments of the projection images, incurring significant computational and memory costs. To mitigate this, we propose a new approach called the subspace method of moments (SubspaceMoM), which compresses the first three moments using data-driven low-rank tensor techniques as well as expansion into a suitable function basis. The compressed moments can be efficiently computed from the set of projection images using numerical quadrature and can be employed to jointly reconstruct the 3-D structure and the distribution of viewing orientations. We illustrate the practical applicability of SubspaceMoM through numerical experiments using up to the third-order moment on synthetic datasets with a simplified cryo-EM image formation model, which significantly improves the reconstruction resolution compared to previous MoM approaches.</description>

      <title>Mimetic finite difference schemes for transport operators with divergence-free advective field and applications to plasma physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In wave propagation problems, finite difference methods implemented on staggered grids are commonly used to avoid checkerboard patterns and to improve accuracy in the approximation of short-wavelength components of the solutions. In this study, we develop a mimetic finite difference (MFD) method on staggered grids for transport operators with divergence-free advective field that is proven to be energy-preserving in wave problems. This method mimics some characteristics of the summation-by-parts (SBP) operators framework, in particular it preserves the divergence theorem at the discrete level. Its design is intended to be versatile and applicable to wave problems characterized by a divergence-free velocity. As an application, we consider the electrostatic shear Alfv\'en waves (SAWs), appearing in the modeling of plasmas. These waves are solved in a magnetic field configuration recalling that of a tokamak device. The study of the generalized eigenvalue problem associated with the SAWs shows the energy conservation of the discretization scheme, demonstrating the stability of the numerical solution.</description>

      <title>A second-order numerical scheme for optimal control of non-linear Fokker-Planck equations and applications in social dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a second-order numerical scheme to address the solution of optimal control problems constrained by the evolution of nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations arising from socio-economic dynamics. In order to design an appropriate numerical scheme for control realization, a coupled forward-backward system is derived based on the associated optimality conditions. The forward equation, corresponding to the Fokker-Planck dynamics, is discretized using a structure preserving scheme able to capture steady states. On the other hand, the backward equation, modeled as a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman problem, is solved via a semi-Lagrangian scheme that supports large time steps while preserving stability. Coupling between the forward and backward problems is achieved through a gradient descent optimization strategy, ensuring convergence to the optimal control. Numerical experiments demonstrate second-order accuracy, computational efficiency, and effectiveness in controlling different examples across various scenarios in social dynamics. This approach provides a reliable computational tool for the study of opinion manipulation and consensus formation in socially structured systems.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient norm preserving numerical schemes for micromagnetic energy minimization based on SAV method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, two efficient and magnetization norm preserving numerical schemes based on the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method are developed for calculating the ground state in micromagnetic structures. The first SAV scheme is based on the original SAV method for the gradient flow model, while the second scheme features an updated scalar auxiliary variable to better align with the associated energy. To address the challenging constraint of pointwise constant magnetization length, an implicit projection method is designed, and verified by both SAV schemes. Both proposed SAV schemes partially preserve energy dissipation and exhibit exceptional efficiency, requiring two linear systems with constant coefficients to be solved. The computational efficiency is further enhanced by applying the Discrete Cosine Transform during the solving process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our SAV schemes outperform commonly used numerical methods in terms of both efficiency and stability.</description>

      <title>Faithful-Newton Framework: Bridging Inner and Outer Solvers for Enhanced Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Newton-type methods enjoy fast local convergence and strong empirical performance, but achieving global guarantees comparable to first-order methods remains challenging. Even for simple strongly convex problems, no straightforward variant of Newton's method matches the global complexity of gradient descent. While more sophisticated variants can improve iteration complexity, they typically require solving difficult subproblems with high per-iteration costs, leading to worse overall complexity. These limitations stem from treating the subproblem as an afterthought, either as a black box, yielding overly complex and impractical formulations, or in isolation, without regard to its role in advancing the optimization of the main objective. By tightening the integration between the inner iterations of the subproblem solvers and the outer iterations of the optimization algorithm, we introduce simple Newton-type variants, called Faithful-Newton framework, which, in a sense, remain faithful to the overall simplicity of classical Newton's method by retaining simple linear system subproblems. The key conceptual difference, however, is that the quality of the subproblem solution is directly assessed based on its effectiveness in reducing optimality, which in turn enables desirable convergence complexities across a variety of settings. Under standard assumptions, we show that our variants, depending on parameter choices, achieve global superlinear convergence, condition-number-independent linear convergence, and/or local quadratic convergence, even when using inexact Newton steps, for strongly convex problems; and competitive iteration complexity for general convex problems. Numerical experiments further demonstrate that our proposed methods perform competitively compared with several alternative Newton-type approaches.</description>

      <title>On the computation of tensor functions under tensor-tensor multiplications with linear maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the computation of both algebraic and non-algebraic tensor functions under the tensor-tensor multiplication with linear maps. In the case of algebraic tensor functions, we prove that the asymptotic exponent of both the tensor-tensor multiplication and the tensor polynomial evaluation problem under this multiplication is the same as that of the matrix multiplication, unless the linear map is injective. As for non-algebraic functions, we define the tensor geometric mean and the tensor Wasserstein mean for pseudo-positive-definite tensors under the tensor-tensor multiplication with invertible linear maps, and we show that the tensor geometric mean can be calculated by solving a specific Riccati tensor equation. Furthermore, we show that the tensor geometric mean does not satisfy the resultantal (determinantal) identity in general, which the matrix geometric mean always satisfies. Then we define a pseudo-SVD for the injective linear map case and we apply it on image data compression.</description>

      <title>Plug and Play Splitting Techniques for Poisson Image Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plug and Play (PnP) methods achieve remarkable results in the framework of image restoration problems for Gaussian data. Nonetheless, the theory available for the Gaussian case cannot be extended to the Poisson case, due to the non-Lipschitz gradient of the fidelity function, the Kullback-Leibler functional, or the absence of closed-form solution for the proximal operator of such term, leading to employ iterative solvers for the inner subproblem. In this work we extend the idea of PIDSplit+ algorithm, exploiting the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, to PnP scheme: this allows to provide a closed form solution for the deblurring step, with no need for iterative solvers. The convergence of the method is assured by employing a firmly non expansive denoiser. The proposed method, namely PnPSplit+, is tested on different Poisson image restoration problems, showing remarkable performance even in presence of high noise level and severe blurring conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Dynamic Domain Decomposition Physics-Informed Neural Networks (D3PINNs), for solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). In this framework, solutions of time-dependent PDEs are dynamically captured. First, an approximate solution is obtained by the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) containing the domain decomposition, then the time derivative terms in the PDE will be retained and the other terms associated with the solution will be replaced with the approximate solution. As a result, the PDE reduces to an ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Finally, the time-varying solution will be solved by the classical numerical methods for ODEs. D3PINNs retain the computational efffciency and ffexibility inherent to PINNs and enhance the ability for capturing solutions of time-dependent PDEs. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Fast Multipole Method with Complex Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present a variant of the fast multipole method (FMM) for efficiently evaluating standard layer potentials on geometries with complex coordinates in two and three dimensions. The complex scaled boundary integral method for the efficient solution of scattering problems on unbounded domains results in complex point locations upon discretization. Classical real-coordinate FMMs are no longer applicable, hindering the use of this approach for large-scale problems. Here we develop the complex-coordinate FMM based on the analytic continuation of certain special function identities used in the construction of the classical FMM. To achieve the same linear time complexity as the classical FMM, we construct a hierarchical tree based solely on the real parts of the complex point locations, and derive convergence rates for truncated expansions when the imaginary parts of the locations are a Lipschitz function of the corresponding real parts. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach through several numerical examples and illustrate its application for solving large-scale time-harmonic water wave problems and Helmholtz transmission problems.</description>

      <title>Iterative energy reduction Galerkin methods and variational adaptivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical points of energy functionals, which are of broad interest, for instance, in physics and chemistry, in solid and quantum mechanics, in material science, or in general diffusion-reaction models arise as solutions to the associated Euler-Lagrange equations. While classical computational solution methods for such models typically focus solely on the underlying partial differential equations, we propose an approach that also incorporates the energy structure itself. Specifically, we examine (linearized) iterative Galerkin discretization schemes that ensure energy reduction at each step, and utilize the computable discrete residual to determine an appropriate stopping point. Additionally, we provide necessary conditions, which are applicable to a wide class of problems, that guarantee convergence to critical points of the PDE as the discrete spaces are enriched. Moreover, in the specific context of finite element discretizations, we present a very generally applicable adaptive mesh refinement strategy - the so-called variational adaptivity approach - which, rather than using classical a posteriori estimates, is based on exploiting local energy reductions. The theoretical results are validated for several computational experiments in the context of nonlinear diffusion-reaction models, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Numerical and analytical modeling of heat equation in current-carrying conductors using the heat equation implemented using Finite-JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current-carrying conductors inevitably experience resistive heating due to the finite electrical conductivity of the material. The resulting temperature distribution within the wire has essential implications for structural integrity, efficiency, and long-term reliability of electronic and power systems. In this work, we model the spatiotemporal evolution of heat in a current-carrying wire using the classical heat conduction equation. In a two-dimensional formulation, heat transport is considered both along and across the conductor. The governing partial differential equation is discretized using finite-difference methods implemented using Finite-JAX under appropriate initial and boundary conditions, including the Dirichlet condition relevant to practical scenarios. Time integration is performed using the explicit scheme, and stability constraints are systematically examined. To assess the accuracy of the numerical approach, we compare the computed temperature fields with the exact analytical solution of the heat equation for canonical geometry. Results show that the numerical prediction converges toward the analytical solution, with error norms decreasing at the expected order of accuracy. This study demonstrates how the heat equation provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for modeling resistive heating in conductors.</description>

      <title>Optimal Convergence Rate of Lie-Trotter Approximation for Quantum Thermal Averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05188v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lie--Trotter product formula is a foundational approximation for the quantum partition function, yet obtaining rigorous error bounds for the unbounded Hamiltonians common in physics remains a significant challenge. This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems. For a particle in a smooth, periodic potential, we establish an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$ for both the partition function and thermal averages, where $N$ is the number of imaginary time steps. We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Cross-Model Verification of Wall-Bounded Flows using Finite-JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of wall-bounded flows remains central to advancing both theoretical understanding and computational methods in fluid mechanics. In this study, we perform a numerical simulation of channel flow using a complementary approach: a high-performance, differentiable finite-difference solver developed in JAX (Finite-JAX) and an analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes Equations, also referred to as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The solver is applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, along with appropriate boundary conditions, to capture canonical flow features such as velocity profiles and pressure gradients. Cross-model verification is conducted by systematically comparing numerical results between Finite-JAX and the analytical solution, with a focus on velocity distributions. In addition, numerical results are benchmarked against analytical solutions for laminar regimes, allowing for the direct quantification of verification accuracy errors. Our findings demonstrate that cross-model verification not only strengthens confidence in simulation fidelity but also provides a pathway for integrating differentiable solvers with established computational fluid dynamics platforms, paving the way for future fluid flow research.</description>
