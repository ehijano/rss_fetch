      <title>Half Pound Filter for Real-Time Animation Blending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Half Pound Filter (HPF) as a modification of the 1 Euro Filter (1EF) and algorithms for automatic data-driven tuning and for filter triggering based on motion derivative boundary checks. An application of the filter is presented in the context of human animation replay for real-time simulations, where switches in animation clips cause discontinuities that must be hidden by filtering the bone trajectory without introducing noticeable artifacts. The quality of the filtering will be compared with other common animation filtering techniques using an example case drawn fromthe LaFAN1 dataset, showing that the resulting animation is replayed with higher fidelity by evaluating the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Normalized Power Spectrum Similarity (NPSS) for each setup. Performances will be evaluated using both a standard predetermined triggerpoint and blending distance and the automatic blending trigger and recovery system.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Forecasting of Dynamic Scenes with Motion-aware Gaussian Grouping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting dynamic scenes remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, as limited observations make it difficult to capture coherent object-level motion and long-term temporal evolution. We present Motion Group-aware Gaussian Forecasting (MoGaF), a framework for long-term scene extrapolation built upon the 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. MoGaF introduces motion-aware Gaussian grouping and group-wise optimization to enforce physically consistent motion across both rigid and non-rigid regions, yielding spatially coherent dynamic representations. Leveraging this structured space-time representation, a lightweight forecasting module predicts future motion, enabling realistic and temporally stable scene evolution. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MoGaF consistently outperforms existing baselines in rendering quality, motion plausibility, and long-term forecasting stability.

      <title>DynamicGTR: Leveraging Graph Topology Representation Preferences to Boost VLM Capabilities on Graph QAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as versatile solutions for zero-shot question answering (QA) across various domains. However, enabling VLMs to effectively comprehend structured graphs and perform accurate, efficient QA remains challenging. Existing approaches typically rely on one single graph topology representation (GTR), such as fixed-style visual images or unified text descriptions. This ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy often neglects model-specific and task-specific preferences, resulting in inaccurate or over-lengthy responses to graph-related queries. To address this, we propose the $\mbox{DynamicGTR}$ framework, which dynamically selects the optimal GTR for each query during inference, thereby enhancing the zero-shot graph QA capabilities of VLMs with a customizable accuracy and brevity trade-off. Extensive experiments show that DynamicGTR not only improves VLM-based graph algorithm QA performance but also successfully transfers the experience trained from synthetic graph algorithm tasks to real-world applications like link prediction and node classification, without any additional training. Additionally, DynamicGTR demonstrates strong transferability across tasks, domains, and models, suggesting its potential as a flexible solution for broad graph scenarios.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Semantic Collapse in Generative Personalization with Test-Time Embedding Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the semantic collapsing problem in generative personalization, an under-explored topic where the learned visual concept ($V$) gradually shifts from its original textual meaning and comes to dominate other concepts in multi-concept input prompts. This issue not only reduces the semantic richness of complex input prompts like "a photo of $V$ wearing glasses and playing guitar" into simpler, less contextually rich forms such as "a photo of $V$" but also leads to simplified output images that fail to capture the intended concept. We identify the root cause as unconstrained optimisation, which allows the learned embedding $V$ to drift arbitrarily in the embedding space, both in direction and magnitude. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective training-free method that adjusts the magnitude and direction of pre-trained embedding at inference time, effectively mitigating the semantic collapsing problem. Our method is broadly applicable across different personalization methods and demonstrates significant improvements in text-image alignment in diverse use cases.
