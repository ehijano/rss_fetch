      <title>Mechanochemical bistability of intestinal organoids enables robust morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How pattern and form are generated in a reproducible manner during embryogenesis remains poorly understood. Intestinal organoid morphogenesis involves a number of mechanochemical regulators, including cell-type specific cytoskeletal forces and osmotically-driven lumen volume changes. However, whether and how these forces are coordinated in time and space via feedbacks to ensure robust morphogenesis remains unclear. Here, we propose a minimal physical model of organoid morphogenesis with local cellular mechano-sensation, where lumen volume changes can impact epithelial shape via both direct mechanical (passive) and indirect mechanosensitive (active) mechanisms. We show how mechano-sensitive feedbacks on cytoskeletal tension generically give rise to morphological bistability, where both bulged (open) and budded (closed) crypt states are possible and dependent on the history of volume changes. Such bistability can explain several paradoxical experimental observations, such as the importance of the timing of lumen shrinkage and robustness of the final morphogenetic state to mechanical perturbations. More quantitatively, we performed mechanical and pharmacological experiments to validate the key modelling assumptions and make quantitative predictions on organoid morphogenesis. This suggests that bistability arising from feedbacks between cellular tensions and fluid pressure could be a general mechanism to allow for the coordination of multicellular shape changes in developing systems.</description>

      <title>From cell intercalation to flow, the importance of T1 transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the context of epithelial monolayers, T1 transitions, also known as cell-intercalations, are topological rearrangements of cells that contribute to fluidity of the epithelial monolayers. We use a multi-phase field model to show that the ensemble-averaged flow profile of a T1 transition exhibits a saddle point structure, where large velocities are localised near cells undergoing T1 transitions, contributing to vortical flow. This tissue fluidisation corresponds to the dispersion of cells relative to each other. While the temporal evolution of the mean pair-separation distance between initially neighbouring cells depends on specific model details, the mean pair-separation distance increases linearly with the number of T1 transitions, in a way that is robust to model parameters.</description>

      <title>Design principles of transcription factors with intrinsically disordered regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcription Factors (TFs) are proteins crucial for regulating gene expression. Effective regulation requires the TFs to rapidly bind to the correct target, enabling the cell to respond timely to various stimuli such as nutrient availability or toxin presence. At the same time, the search process is limited by slow diffusive movement and 'false' targets in DNA - segments of DNA sequences that are similar to the true target. In eukaryotic cells most TFs have an Intrinsically Disordered Region (IDR), which is a long, flexible polymeric tail comprised of hundreds of amino acids. Recent experimental findings indicate that the IDR of certain TFs plays a crucial role in the search process. However, the principles underlying the IDR's role remain unclear. Here, we reveal key design principles of the IDR related to TF binding affinity and search time. Our results indicate a significant enhancement in both of these aspects attributed to the presence of the IDR. Additionally, we propose experiments to verify these theoretical predictions.</description>
