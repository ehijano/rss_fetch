      <title>Fourier Decay from $L^2$-Flattening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach for establishing rates of decay for the Fourier transform of a wide class of dynamically defined measures. Among the key features of the method is the systematic use of the $L^2$-flattening theorem obtained in~\cite{Khalil-Mixing}, coupled with non-concentration estimates for the derivatives of the underlying dynamical system. This method yields polylogarithmic Fourier decay for Diophantine self-similar measures, and polynomial decay for Patterson-Sullivan measures of convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds, Gibbs measures associated to non-integrable $C^2$ conformal systems, as well as stationary measures for carpet-like non-conformal iterated function systems. Applications include essential spectral gaps on convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds, fractal uncertainty principles, and equidistribution properties of typical vectors in fractal sets.</description>

      <title>Extended normal forms for one-dimensional border-collision bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The border-collision normal form describes the local dynamics in continuous systems with switches when a fixed point intersects a switching surface. For one-dimensional cases where the bifurcation creates or destroys only fixed points and period-two orbits, we show that the standard local equivalence of normal forms, topological conjugacy, can be replaced by differentiable conjugacy provided an extra term is added to the normal form. In these cases topological conjugacy is so weak that a range of values can be used for the coefficients in the normal form. The extension to differentiable conjugacy explains why the usual choice of slopes in the standard normal form is privileged. This highlights the importance of differentiable conjugacies and the need for extended normal forms.</description>

      <title>Oscillating and nonsummable Radon-Nikodym cocycles along the forward geodesic of measure-class-preserving transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the least-deletion map on the Cantor space, namely the map that changes the first 1 in a binary sequence to 0, and construct product measures on $2^\mathbb{N}$ so that the corresponding Radon-Nikodym cocycles oscillate or converge to zero nonsummably along the forward geodesic of the map. These examples answer two questions of Tserunyan and Tucker-Drob. We analyze the oscillating example in terms of random walks on $\mathbb{Z}$, using the Chung-Fuchs theorem.</description>

      <title>On the existence of periodic invariant curves for analytic families of twist maps and billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that in any analytic one-parameter family of twist maps of the annulus, homotopically invariant curves filled with periodic points corresponding to a given rotation number, either exist for all values of the parameters or at most for a discrete subset. Moreover, we show that the set of analytic twist maps having such an invariant curve of a given rotation number is a strict analytic subset of the set of analytic twist maps. The first result extends, in dimension 2, a previous result by Arnaud, Massetti and Sorrentino. We then apply our result to rational caustics of billiards, considering several models such as Birkhoff billiards, outer billiards and symplectic billiards.</description>

      <title>On the number of poles of the dynamical zeta functions for billiard flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the number of the poles of the meromorphic continuation of the dynamical zeta functions $\eta_N$ and $\eta_D$ for several strictly convex disjoint obstacles satisfying non-eclipse condition. If the abscissa of convergence of $\eta_N$ is non-positive, we obtain a strip $\{z \in \mathbb C:\: {\rm Re}\: s &gt; \beta\}$ with infinite number of poles. For $\eta_D$ we prove the same result assuming the boundary real analytic. Moreover, for $\eta_N$ we obtain a characterisation of $\beta$ by the pressure $P(2G)$ of some function $G$ on the space $\Sigma_A^f$ related to the dynamical characteristics of the obstacle.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory motions, parabolic orbits and collision orbits in the planar circular restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the planar circular restricted three body problem (PCRTBP), which models the motion of a massless body under the attraction of other two bodies, the primaries, which describe circular orbits around their common center of mass. In a suitable system of coordinates, this is a two degrees of freedom Hamiltonian system. The orbits of this system are either defined for all (future or past) time or eventually go to collision with one of the primaries. For orbits defined for all time, Chazy provided a classification of all possible asymptotic behaviors, usually called final motions.
  By considering a sufficiently small mass ratio between the primaries, we analyze the interplay between collision orbits and various final motions and construct several types of dynamics.
  In particular, we show that orbits corresponding to any combination of past and future final motions can be created to pass arbitrarily close to the massive primary. Additionally, we construct arbitrarily large ejection-collision orbits (orbits which experience collision in both past and future times) and periodic orbits that are arbitrarily large and get arbitrarily close to the massive primary. Furthermore, we also establish oscillatory motions in both position and velocity, meaning that as time tends to infinity, the superior limit of the position or velocity is infinity while the inferior limit remains a real number.</description>

      <title>Accessibility of countable sets in plane embeddings of arc-like continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding embeddings of arc-like continua in the plane for which each point in a given subset is accessible. We establish that, under certain conditions on an inverse system of arcs, there exists a plane embedding of the inverse limit for which each point of a given countable set is accessible. As an application, we show that for any Knaster continuum $K$, and any countable collection $\mathcal{C}$ of composants of $K$, there exists a plane embedding of $K$ in which every point in the union of the composants in $\mathcal{C}$ is accessible. We also exhibit new embeddings of the Knaster buckethandle continuum $K$ in the plane which are attractors of plane homeomorphisms, and for which the restriction of the plane homeomorphism to the attractor is conjugate to a power of the standard shift map on $K$.</description>

      <title>The Hessian of elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Hessian transformation of a plane projective cubic corresponds to a $3$-endomorphism of a model elliptic curve. By exploiting this result, we investigate a family of functional graphs -- called Hessian graphs -- defined by the Hessian transformation. We show that, over arbitrary fields of characteristics different from $2$ and $3$, the Hessian graphs inherit distinctive features from the arithmetic of the model curve. We then specialize our analysis to the finite-field case, proving several regularities of Hessian graphs.</description>

      <title>Neural field equations with time-periodic external inputs and some applications to visual processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to present a mathematical framework for the study of flickering inputs in visual processing tasks. When combined with geometric patterns, these inputs influence and induce interesting psychophysical phenomena, such as the MacKay and the Billock-Tsou effects, where the subjects perceive specific afterimages typically modulated by the flickering frequency. Due to the symmetry-breaking structure of the inputs, classical bifurcation theory and multi-scale analysis techniques are not very effective in our context. We thus take an approach based on the input-output framework of control theory for Amari-type neural fields. This allows us to prove that, when driven by periodic inputs, the dynamics converge to a periodic state. Moreover, we study under which assumptions these nonlinear dynamics can be effectively linearised, and in this case we present a precise approximation of the integral kernel for short-range excitatory and long-range inhibitory neuronal interactions. Finally, for inputs concentrated at the center of the visual field with a flickering background, we directly relate the width of the illusory contours appearing in the afterimage with both the flickering frequency and the strength of the inhibition.</description>

      <title>An Assessment of Ensemble Kalman Filter and Azouani-Olson-Titi Algorithms for Data Assimilation: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous data assimilation (CDA) is a method that continuously integrates observational data into a dynamical system to improve model accuracy in real-time. The AOT algorithm is one of the most widely used methods in CDA due to its efficiency in incorporating observational data to enhance model accuracy. However, no research to date has evaluated the performance of the AOT algorithm compared to the most widely used DA method, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Hence, in this paper, we conduct an extensive numerical examination to evaluate and compare these two algorithms for CDA problems with measurement error, addressing this gap. By analyzing the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation, which are central to many applications and representative in CDA problems, we found a significant computational advantage of the AOT algorithm.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Equilibrium Measures under $K$-regular Polynomial Sequences and their Derivatives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K\subset\mathbb{C}$ be non-polar, compact and polynomially convex. We study the limits of equilibrium measures on preimages of compact sets, under $K$-regular sequences of polynomials, that center on $K$ and under the sequences of derivatives of all orders of such sequences. We show that under mild assumptions such limits always exist and equal the equilibrium measure on $K$. From this we derive convergence of the equilibrium distributions on the Julia sets of the sequence of polynomials and their derivatives of all orders.</description>

      <title>EKF-SINDy: Empowering the extended Kalman filter with sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measured data from a dynamical system can be assimilated into a predictive model by means of Kalman filters. Nonlinear extensions of the Kalman filter, such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), are required to enable the joint estimation of (possibly nonlinear) system dynamics and of input parameters. To construct the evolution model used in the prediction phase of the EKF, we propose to rely on the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). SINDy enables to identify the evolution model directly from preliminary acquired data, thus avoiding possible bias due to wrong assumptions and incorrect modelling of the system dynamics. Moreover, the numerical integration of a SINDy model leads to great computational savings compared to alternate strategies based on, e.g., finite elements. Last, SINDy allows an immediate definition of the Jacobian matrices required by the EKF to identify system dynamics and properties, a derivation that is usually extremely involved with physical models. As a result, combining the EKF with SINDy provides a data-driven computationally efficient, easy-to-apply approach for the identification of nonlinear systems, capable of robust operation even outside the range of training of SINDy. To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we address the identification of a linear non-autonomous system consisting of a shear building model excited by real seismograms, and the identification of a partially observed nonlinear system. The challenge arising from the use of SINDy when the system state is not entirely accessible has been relieved by means of time-delay embedding. The great accuracy and the small uncertainty associated with the state identification, where the state has been augmented to include system properties, underscores the great potential of the proposed strategy, paving the way for the setting of predictive digital twins in different fields.</description>

      <title>On postcritical sets of quadratic polynomials with a neutral fixed point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of postcritical sets of quadratic polynomials with a neutral fixed point is a main ingredient in the remarkable work of Buff and Ch\'eritat to construct quadratic Julia sets with positive area. Based on the Inou-Shishikura theory, they obtained the control for the case of rotation numbers of bounded high type. Later, Cheraghi developed several elaborate analytic techniques based on Inou-Shishikura's results and obtained the control for the case of rotation numbers of high type. In this paper, based on the pseudo-Siegel disk theory of Dudko and Lyubich, we obtained the control for the general case.</description>
