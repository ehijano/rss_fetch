      <title>Embedding lattices of quasivarieties of periodic groups into lattices of additively idempotent semiring varieties: An algebraic proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general result by Jackson (Flat algebras and the translation of universal Horn logic to equational logic, J. Symb. Log. 73(1) (2008) 90--128) implies that the lattice of all quasivarieties of groups of exponent dividing $n$ embeds into the lattice $L(\mathbf{Sr}_n)$ of all varieties of additively idempotent semirings whose multiplicative semigroups are unions of groups of exponent dividing $n$; the image of this embedding is an interval in $L(\mathbf{Sr}_n)$. We provide a new, direct, and purely algebraic proof of these facts and present a new identity basis for the top variety of the interval. In addition, we obtain new information about the lattice $L(\mathbf{Sr}_n)$, demonstrating that the properties of the lattice for $n\ge 3$ differ drastically from those previously known when $n=1$ or $2$.</description>

Abstract: We give a new elementary proof of the theorem that a natural map from Milnor's construction $F[S^1]$ to the simplicial group $\mathrm{AP}$ of pure braids is injective. Our approach is group-theoretic and does not rely on Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>On bireversible automata and commensurators of groups in automorphisms of their Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $G$ is a finitely generated group and $X$ is a Cayley graph of $G$, denote by $\mathcal{C}_1^X(G)$ the subgroup of all automorphisms of $X$ commensurating $G$ and fixing the vertex corresponding to the identity. Building on the work of Macedo\'{n}ska, Nekrashevych and Sushchansky, we observe that $\mathcal{C}_1^X(G)$ can be expressed as a directed union of groups generated by bireversible automata. We use this to to show that every cyclic subgroup of $\mathcal{C}_1^X(G)$ is undistorted and to obtain a necessary condition on $G$ for $\mathcal{C}_1^X(G)$ not to be locally finite. As a consequence, we prove that several families of groups cannot be generated by bireversible automata and show that the set of groups generated by bireversible automata is strictly contained in the set of groups generated by invertible and reversible automata.</description>

      <title>Bounded Cohomology and Unitary Representations of Automorphism Groups of Regular Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the continuous bounded cohomology of the full automorphism groups of regular trees in all positive degrees, with coefficients arising from any irreducible continuous unitary representations. To the author's knowledge, this seems to be the first instance where the continuous bounded cohomology is determined in all positive degrees with coefficients arising from any irreducible continuous unitary representations without being zero in all cases.</description>

      <title>Coarse length can be unbounded in 3-step nilpotent Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In "On the asymptotics of the growth of 2-step nilpotent groups" (J. London Math. Soc. (2), 58 (1998)), we remarked that, contrary to 2-step nilpotent simply connected Lie groups, in 3-step nilpotent simply connected Lie groups it is possible that `$\mathbb{R}$-words' in the given generators cannot be replaced by an equally long $\mathbb{R}$-word representing the same group element and having a bounded number of direction changes. In this note, we present an example for this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>The influence of the prime omega function on the product of element orders in finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and define $\rho(G) = \prod_{x \in G} o(x)$, where $o(x)$ denotes the order of the element $x \in G$. Let $\Omega$ be the prime omega function giving the number of (not necessarily distinct) prime factors of a natural number.
  In this paper, we consider the function $\Omega_{\rho}(G):= \Omega(\rho(G))$. We show that, under certain conditions, this function exhibits behavior analogous to the derivative in calculus. We establish the following results: \textbf{(Product rule)} If $A$ and $B$ are finite groups, where $\operatorname{gcd}(|A|,|B|)=1$, then $\Omega_{\rho}(A\times B) = \Omega_{\rho}(A) \cdot |B|+\Omega_{\rho}(B) \cdot |A|$. \\ \textbf{(Quotient rule)} If $P$ is a central cyclic normal Sylow $p$-subgroup of a finite group $G$, then $ \Omega_{\rho}(\dfrac{G}{P}) = \dfrac{\Omega_{\rho}(G)\cdot|P|-\Omega_{\rho}(P)\cdot |G|}{{|P|}^2}.$ \\ Moreover, we show that if $C$ is a cyclic group and $G$ is a non-cyclic group of the same order, then $\Omega_{\rho}(G) \leq \Omega_{\rho}(C)$. Finally, we show that if $G$ is a group of order $|L_2(p)|$, then $\Omega_{\rho}(G) \geqslant \Omega_{\rho}(L_2(p))$, where $p \in \{5, 11, 13\} $.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional model spaces invariant under composition operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-dimensional model spaces are quotient spaces of the Hardy space on the open unit disc, determined by finite Blaschke products. Composition operators, on the other hand, act by composing Hardy space functions with analytic self-maps of the open unit disc. Both are classical and well-studied objects in the theory of analytic function spaces. In this paper, we present a complete characterization of finite-dimensional model spaces that are invariant under composition operators. Finite cyclic groups and the prime factorizations of natural numbers play a crucial role in understanding the structure of such invariant subspaces and the associated analytic self-maps.</description>

      <title>A Lemma on Leech-like Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Leech pair is defined as a pair $(G,S)$, where $S$ is a positive definite even lattice without roots, equipped with a faithful action of a finite group $G$, such that the invariant sublattice of $S$ under the action of $G$ is trivial, and the induced action of $G$ on the discriminant group of $S$ is also trivial. This structure appears naturally when investigating hyperk\"ahler manifolds and the symplectic automorphisms acting on them. An important lemma due to Gaberdiel--Hohenegger--Volpato asserts that a Leech pair $(G,S)$ admits a primitive embedding into the Leech lattice if $rank(S)+\ell(A_S)\le 24$. However, the original proof is incomplete, as demonstrated by a counterexample given by Marquand and Muller. In this paper, we modify the original approach to provide a complete and conceptual proof of the lemma.</description>

Abstract: We study the real spectrum compactification of character varieties of finitely generated groups in semisimple Lie groups. This provides a compactification with good topological properties, and we interpret the boundary points in terms of actions on building-like spaces. Among the applications we give a general framework guaranteeing the existence of equivariant harmonic maps in building-like spaces.</description>

      <title>Linear representations, crystallographic quotients, and twisted conjugacy of virtual Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual Artin groups were recently introduced by Bellingeri, Paris, and Thiel as broad generalizations of the well-known virtual braid groups. For each Coxeter graph $\Gamma$, they defined the virtual Artin group $VA[\Gamma]$, which is generated by the corresponding Artin group $A[\Gamma]$ and the Coxeter group $W[\Gamma]$, subject to certain mixed relations inspired by the action of $W[\Gamma]$ on its root system $\Phi[\Gamma]$. There is a natural surjection $ \mathrm{VA}[\Gamma] \rightarrow W[\Gamma]$, with the kernel $PVA[\Gamma]$ representing the pure virtual Artin group. In this paper, we explore linear representations, crystallographic quotients, and twisted conjugacy of virtual Artin groups. Inspired from the work of Cohen, Wales, and Krammer, we construct a linear representation of the virtual Artin group $VA[\Gamma]$. As a consequence of this representation, we deduce that if $W[\Gamma]$ is a spherical Coxeter group, then $VA[\Gamma]/PVA[\Gamma]'$ is a crystallographic group of dimension $ |\Phi[\Gamma]|$ with the holonomy group $W[\Gamma]$. We also classify the torsion elements in $VA[\Gamma]/PVA[\Gamma]'$ and determine precisely when two elements are conjugate in this group. Further, we investigate twisted conjugacy, and prove that each right-angled virtual Artin group admit the $R_\infty$-property.</description>

      <title>On the $\Sigma^1$ and $\Sigma^2$-invariants of Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the $\Sigma^1$-conjecture for two families of Artin groups: Artin groups such that there exists a prime number $p$ dividing $\frac{l(e)}{2}$ for every edge $e$ with even label $&gt;2$ and balanced Artin groups. The family of balanced Artin groups extends two previously studied families: the one considered by Kochloukova in arXiv:2009.14269, and the family of coherent Artin groups. We state a conjecture on the $\Sigma^2$-invariant for Artin groups satisfying the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture. The conjecture is proven to be true for two significant families: $2$-dimensional and coherent Artin groups. In the $2$-dimensional case we are able to compute $\Sigma^n$ for all $n\geq 2$ and to derive finiteness properties of the derived subgroup.</description>

      <title>The $m$-partite digraphical representations of valency 3 of finite groups generated by two elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22980v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $m$ be an integer. We employ the notation $g_i$ to represent elements $(g,i)$ in the Cartesian product $G \times \mathbb{Z}_m$, where $\mathbb{Z}_m$ denotes integers modulo $m$. For given sets $T_{i,j} \subseteq G$ ($i,j \in \mathbb{Z}_m$), we construct the $m$-$Cayley$ $digraph$ $\Gamma = \mathrm{Cay}(G, T_{i,j}: i,j \in \mathbb{Z}_m)$ with vertex set $\bigcup_{i\in\mathbb{Z}_m}G_i$ (where $G_i = \{g_i | g \in G\}$) and arc set $\bigcup_{i,j}\{(g_i, (tg)_j) | t \in T_{i,j}, g \in G\}$. When $T_{i,i} = \emptyset$ for all $i \in \mathbb{Z}_m$, we call $\Gamma$ an \emph{$m$-partite Cayley digraph}. For $m$-partite Cayley digraphs, we observe that a $1$-partite Cayley digraph is necessarily an empty graph. Therefore, throughout this paper, we restrict our consideration to the case where $m \geq 2$. The digraph $\Sigma$ is regular if there exists a non-negative integer $k$ such that every vertex has out-valency and in-valency equal to $k$. All digraphs considered in this paper are regular. We say a group $G$ admits an \emph{$m$-partite digraphical representation} ($m$-PDR for short) if there exists a regular $m$-partite Cayley digraph $\Gamma$ with $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma) \cong G$.
  Based on Du et al.'s complete classification of unrestricted $m$-PDRs \cite{du4} (2022), we focus on the unresolved valency-specific cases.
  In this paper, we investigate $m$-PDRs of valency 3 for groups generated by at most two elements, and establish a complete classification of nontrivial finite simple groups admitting $m$-PDRs of valency 3 with $m\geq2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study infinite groups interpretable in power bounded $T$-convex, $V$-minimal or $p$-adically closed fields. We show that if $G$ is an interpretable definably semisimple group (i.e., has no definable infinite normal abelian subgroups) then, up to a finite index subgroup, it is definably isogenous to a group $G_1\times G_2$, where $G_1$ is a $K$-linear group and $G_2$ is a $\mathbf{k}$-linear group. The analysis is carried out by studying the interaction of $G$ with four distinguished sorts: the valued field $K$, the residue field $\mathbf{k}$, the value group $\Gamma$, and the closed $0$-balls $K/\mathcal{O}$.</description>

      <title>Functorial languages in homological algebra and lower central series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a general phenomenon in algebra that numerous functors of homological significance admit characterization as derived limits of elementary functors defined over categories of free extensions. We demonstrate that upon restriction to appropriate subcategories of the category of groups, one may express analogously more interesting functors, including homology groups with cyclic coefficients.
  Moreover, we are laying the foundations of the so-called $\mathbf{fr}_\infty$-language, extending the $\mathbf{fr}$-language of Roman Mikhailov and Sergei O. Ivanov. This language is constructed by augmenting the $\mathbf{fr}$-language through the introduction of an infinite family of letters $\mathbf{fr}$ corresponding to the lower central series $\gamma_m(R)$ of the group of relations and leads to some neat computations.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the concept of transformations among reference frames (classical or quantum). Usually transformations among classical reference frames have sharply defined parameters; geometrically they can be considered as pure states in the parameters' space, and they form a group. It is however possible that the distributions in the parameters' space are mixed state; such states form a semigroup. Similarly, transformations among quantum reference frames can be either pure or mixed. This gives rise to interesting consequences, in particular, the state of a system S can be pure with respect to a reference frame and mixed with respect to another. We argue that these nonpure transformations are natural, and give an application to the connections of time and (inverse) temperature for thermal states.</description>
