      <title>Introducing Image-Space Preconditioning in the Variational Formulation of MRI Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the present article is to enrich the comprehension of iterative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstructions, including compressed sensing (CS) and iterative deep learning (DL) reconstructions, by describing them in the general framework of finite-dimensional inner-product spaces. In particular, we show that image-space preconditioning (ISP) and data-space preconditioning (DSP) can be formulated as non-conventional inner-products. The main gain of our reformulation is an embedding of ISP in the variational formulation of the MRI reconstruction problem (in an algorithm-independent way) which allows in principle to naturally and systematically propagate ISP in all iterative reconstructions, including many iterative DL and CS reconstructions where preconditioning is lacking. The way in which we apply linear algebraic tools to MRI reconstructions as presented in this article is a novelty.
  A secondary aim of our article is to offer a certain didactic material to scientists who are new in the field of MRI reconstruction. Since we explore here some mathematical concepts of reconstruction, we take that opportunity to recall some principles that may be understood for experts, but which may be hard to find in the literature for beginners. In fact, the description of many mathematical tools of MRI reconstruction is fragmented in the literature or sometimes missing because considered as a general knowledge. Further, some of those concepts can be found in mathematic manuals, but not in a form that is oriented toward MRI. For example, we think of the conjugate gradient descent, the notion of derivative with respect to non-conventional inner products, or simply the notion of adjoint. The authors believe therefore that it is beneficial for their field of research to dedicate some space to such a didactic material.</description>

      <title>Scanner-based real-time automated volumetry reporting of the fetus, amniotic fluid, placenta and umbilical cord for fetal MRI at 0.55T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This work aims to enable real-time automated intra-uterine volumetric reporting and fetal weight estimation for fetal MRI, deployed directly on the scanner. Methods: A multi-region segmentation nnUNet was trained on 146 bSSFP images of 73 fetal subjects (coronal and axial orientations) for the parcellation of the fetal head, fetal body, placenta, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord from whole uterus bSSFP stacks. A reporting tool was then developed to integrate the segmentation outputs into an automated report, providing volumetric measurements, fetal weight estimations, and z-score visualisations. The complete pipeline was subsequently deployed on a 0.55T MRI scanner, enabling real-time inference and fully automated reporting in the duration of the acquisition. Results: The segmentation pipeline was quantitatively and retrospectively evaluated on 36 stacks of 18 fetal subjects and demonstrated sufficient performance for all labels, with high scores (&gt;0.98) for the fetus, placenta and amniotic fluid, and 0.91 for the umbilical cord. The prospective evaluation of the scanner deployment step was successfully performed on 50 cases, with the regional volumetric reports available directly on the scanner. Conclusions: This work demonstrated the feasibility of multi-regional intra-uterine segmentation, fetal weight estimation and automated reporting in real-time. This study provides a robust baseline solution for the integration of fully automated scanner-based measurements into fetal MRI reports.</description>

      <title>Noninvasive Focused Ultrasound Spinal Cord Stimulation in Humans: A Computational Feasibility Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Trans-spinal FUS (tsFUS) has recently been shown promise in modulating spinal reflexes in rodents, opening new avenues for spinal cord interventions in motor control and pain management. However, anatomical differences between rodents and human spinal cords require careful targeting strategies and transducer design adaptations for human applications. Aim: This study aims to computationally explore the feasibility of tsFUS in the human spinal cord by leveraging the intervertebral acoustic window and vertebral lamina. Method: Acoustic simulations were performed using an anatomically detailed human spinal cord model with an adapted single-element focusing transducer (SEFT) to investigate the focality and intensity of the acoustic quantities generated within the spinal cord. Results: Sonication through the intervertebral acoustic window using an adapted transducer achieved approximately 2-fold higher intensity and up to 20% greater beam overlap compared to commercial SEFT. Precise transducer positioning was critical; a 10 mm vertical shift resulted in a reduction of target intensity by approximately 7-fold. The vertebral level also substantially influenced the sonication outcomes, with the thoracic spine achieving 6-fold higher intensity than the cervical level. Sonication through the vertebral lamina resulted in approximately 2.5-fold higher intraspinal intensity in the cervical spine. Conclusion and Significance: This study presents the first systematic, anatomically realistic computational model for the feasibility of tsFUS in humans. Quantifying the trade-offs between acoustic path, vertebral level, and transducer geometry offers foundational design and procedural guidelines for the design and safety of spinal FUS protocols, supporting future studies of trans-spinal FUS in humans.</description>

      <title>Differentiation of Wild-Type and CRISPR-Modified Colon Cancer Cells Using Brillouin Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the mechanical properties of colon cancer cells through Brillouin microscopy, focusing on the differentiation between wild-type (WT) and CRISPR-modified cells. Brillouin microspectroscopy, a non-invasive technique, was employed to measure Brillouin shifts and full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of the cells in vitro. Using a custom-built confocal Brillouin microspectrometer, both WT and CRISPR-modified cells exhibited distinct mechanical responses. Statistical analysis revealed that WT cells had different stiffness and viscosity compared to CRISPR-modified cells, as indicated by their Brillouin shift and FWHM values. The data suggest that Brillouin spectroscopy offers a viable method to differentiate between normal and mutated cells at the subcellular level, providing new insights into cellular mechanical properties relevant to cancer research. These findings hold potential for advancing non-invasive diagnostic techniques and understanding cellular mechanics in oncology.</description>

      <title>3D Single-shot CEST imaging at 3T Based on True FISP Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To simultaneously fit multiple-pool effects, spectrally selective 3D CEST imaging typically requires single-shot readouts to save time. However, to date, FLASH and EPI have been the primary pulse sequences used for this purpose. They suffer from low SNR or image distortion related to B0 field inhomogeneity. In this work, we developed a 3D single-shot CEST sequence using true fast imaging with steady-state precession (True FISP) readout, also known as bSSFP, and optimized the scanning parameters through simulations. The performance of the CEST sequence was validated using an egg white phantom, ten healthy volunteers, and a patient with a brain tumor on a 3T human scanner. Subsequently, the proposed CEST sequence using True FISP was compared with the commonly used FLASH-based CEST sequence, focusing on SNR and image contrast, while maintaining identical pre-saturation modes, repetition time, echo time and scan time. In the simulation experiments, the maximum CEST signal obtained from the True FISP was significantly greater than that obtained from the FLASH sequence. In the egg white phantom, the SNRs of amide proton transfer (APT) and nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) effect images obtained from the True FISP were 68.3% and 57.0% higher than those obtained from the FLASH sequence, respectively. In healthy volunteers, saturated images collected with the True FISP sequence at 3.5 ppm showed an approximate 84% increase in mean temporal SNR compared to those collected with the FLASH sequence. Compared to the FLASH sequence, the CEST images obtained from the True FISP sequence could display more detailed brain tissue structures of both normal individuals and the patient with a brain tumor. Therefore, due to the high SNR inherent in the sequence, True FISP has the potential to be used for fast and high-quality 3D image readout of CEST contrasts in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Solution for Whole-Brain multi-pool CEST Imaging at 3T based on single-shot True FISP readout: Towards Homogeneous, Multi-Parameter and High Repeatability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and validate a comprehensive, rapid, and reproducible solution for whole-brain, multi-pool CEST imaging at 3T, overcoming key barriers to clinical translation such as long acquisition times and inaccuracies from field inhomogeneities. Methods: This study integrated a single-shot 3D True FISP readout sequence for efficient whole-brain CEST data acquisition. A streamlined workflow was developed to acquire B0, B1, and T1 maps for correction. To overcome the time-consuming nature of traditional B1 correction, we implemented a machine learning-based method to perform rapid B1 correction using data from a single B1 power acquisition. Data were analyzed using a four-pool Lorentzian model to derive quantitative metrics, including MTRLD and the AREX. The method's accuracy was validated in phantoms and its test-retest reproducibility was assessed in healthy volunteers across 96 brain regions. Results: The True FISP sequence acquired high-quality, whole-brain images free of major artifacts. The neural network accurately replicated the gold-standard three-point B1 correction, achieving excellent intraclass correlation (ICC &gt; 0.97) in human subjects. The AREX metric successfully corrected for T1 and MT confounders, reducing the CV from 35.4% to 9.2% in phantoms. The complete pipeline, including Z-spectrum and correction maps, took approximately 9 minutes. The method demonstrated high region-level reproducibility, with the average CV for APT_AREX under 10% for most brain regions across test-retest scans. Conclusion: This study presents a validated, end-to-end solution for whole-brain, multi-pool CEST imaging. By combining an efficient sequence with a rapid, AI-driven correction pipeline and robust quantitative analysis, our method delivers high-fidelity, reproducible, and quantitative multi-parameter maps of brain metabolism in a clinically acceptable timeframe.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We set up a mathematical model for a DC current in a human tissue that shows an attenuation effect in an extended circuit. We give a positive lower bound on the time duration over which this is guaranteed to happen in terms of the parameters of the model. We also discuss shielding and coupling in the context of electrical aspects of biological processes.</description>
