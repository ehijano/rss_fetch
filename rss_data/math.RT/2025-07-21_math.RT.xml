      <title>A remark on automorphisms of tensor spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tensor space is a vector space equipped with a finite collection of multi-linear forms. In recent years, a rich theory of infinite dimensional tensor spaces has emerged. In this note, we show that a large class of permutation groups can occur as the automorphism groups of such tensor spaces. Using this, we show that a tensor space can behave somewhat pathologically as a representation of its automorphism group.</description>

      <title>Parabolic geometric Eisenstein series and constant term functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a compatibility between parabolic restriction of Whittaker sheaves and restriction of representations under the geometric Casselman-Shalika equivalence. To do this, we establish various Hecke structures on geometric Eisenstein series functors, generalizing results of Braverman-Gaitsgory in the case of a principal parabolic. Moreover, we relate compactified and non-compactified geometric Eisenstein series functors via Koszul duality.
  We sketch a proof that the spectral-to-automorphic geometric Langlands functor commutes with constant term functors.</description>

      <title>Degenerations of families of bands and strings for gentle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a gentle algebra. For every collection of string and band diagrammes, we consider the constructible subset of the variety of representations containing all modules with this underlying diagramme. We study degenerations of such sets. We show that these sets are defined by vectors of integers which we call $h$-vectors and which are related to a restricted version of the hom-order. We provide combinatorial criteria for the existence of a degeneration, involving the removal of an arrow or the resolving of a type of configuration called "reaching".</description>

      <title>Borel--Serre type bordifications and Canonical Pairs for Loop groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To the symmetric space of the (positive half) of a real loop group, we attach a Borel--Serre type bordification and equip it with a Hausdorff topology. The attached boundary, indexed by certain rational parabolics of the loop group, is shown to be homotopic to an affine, rational Tits building. A loop analogue of an arithmetic group is also shown to act continuously on the bordification and its quotient by this action is studied using the reduction theory of H. Garland. While the quotient is no longer compact (as in the Borel--Serre construction from finite-dimensions) we relate the non-compactness to the center of the loop group. We also introduce a notion of semi-stability for loop groups, following works of Harder--Narasimhan, Behrend, and most recently Chaudouard, and use this to describe a partition of our loop symmetric space. This partition is then related to the rational bordification and its quotient.</description>

      <title>Nesting behind $\hat{Z}$-invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the spirit of arXiv:2501.12985, we propose an abelian categorification of $\hat{Z}$-invariants for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds. It provides a blueprint for the expected dictionary between these $3$-manifolds and log VOAs; that is, the contribution from 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory via 3d-3d correspondence is recursively binary encoded in the abelian category of modules over the hypothetical log VOA, and is decoded by the recursive application of the theory of Feigin--Tipunin construction. In particular, the nested Weyl-type character formulas provide generalized characters reconstructing $\hat{Z}$. Our theory also implies vast extensions of W-algebras in a new direction.</description>

      <title>Kronecker Coefficients, Crystals, and Bitableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What might a combinatorial interpretation of the Kronecker coefficients even look like? We introduce a class of combinatorial objects called bitableaux, which we believe are a natural candidate, and we formulate a purely combinatorial problem which if resolved would give a combinatorial interpretation of the Kronecker coefficients. We make some partial progress on this problem -- enough to extract a combinatorial expansion for a Kronecker product of Schur functions in the monomial basis. We also explain how in this framework finding a combinatorial interpretation for Kronecker coefficients can be thought of as looking for a generalization of the RSK and dual RSK insertion algorithms.</description>

      <title>Construction of Young modules and filtration multiplicities for Brauer algebras of type $C$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the permutation modules and Young modules for Brauer algebras of type $C$ by extending the representation theory of the group algebra of hyperoctahedral groups. Additionally, we develop a stratifying system for Brauer algebras of type $C$, thereby extending the work of Hemmer-Nakano in \cite{HN} on Hecke algebras. This framework allows us to determine when the multiplicities of cell modules in any filtration are well-defined. As a result, we prove that if the characteristic of the field is neither $2$ nor $3$, then every permutation module of the Brauer algebra of type $C$ decomposes into a direct sum of indecomposable Young modules. We also establish certain cohomological criteria for the group algebra of the hyperoctahedral groups, which are necessary to prove the results for the Brauer algebras of type $C$.</description>

      <title>Higher Siegel--Weil formula for unitary groups II: corank one terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the higher Siegel--Weil formula for \emph{corank one} terms, relating (1) the $r^{\rm th}$ central derivatives of corank one Fourier coefficients of Siegel--Eisenstein series, and (2) the degrees of special cycles of virtual dimension 0 on the moduli stack of Hermitian shtukas with $r$ legs. Notably, the formula holds for all $r$, regardless of the order of vanishing of the Eisenstein series. This extends earlier work of Feng--Yun--Zhang, who proved the higher Siegel--Weil formula for the non-singular (corank zero) terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a split connected reductive group over the ring of integers of a finite unramified extension $K$ of $\mathbf{Q}_p$. Under a standard assumption on the Coxeter number of $G$, we compute the cohomology algebra of $G(\mathcal{O}_K)$ and its Iwahori subgroups, with coefficients in the residue field of $K$. Our methods involve a new presentation of some graded Lie algebras appearing in Lazard's theory of saturated $p$-valued groups, and a reduction to coherent cohomology of the flag variety in positive characteristic. We also consider the case of those inner forms of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ that give rise to the Morava stabilizer groups in stable homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>Shape and class of Bruhat Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Bruhat intervals in affine Weyl groups by viewing them as regions of alcoves. In type $\widetilde{A}_2$ we show that each interval coincides with a generalized permutohedron minus a star-shaped polygon, and we prove a subtler version inside the dominant chamber of type $\widetilde{A}_n$. Motivated by this geometry, we conjecture that whenever two Bruhat intervals are isomorphic, there exists an isomorphism realized by a piecewise isometry. We prove this when both endpoints are dominant in $\widetilde{A}_2$ and obtain partial results in $\widetilde{A}_n$. In the course of proving these results, we made the surprising observation that much of the information contained in a Bruhat interval is already encoded in a tiny portion of it.</description>

      <title>Highest weight theory for minimal finite $W$-superalgebras and related Whittaker categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{g}_{\bar0}+\mathfrak{g}_{\bar1}$ be a basic classical Lie superalgebra over $\mathbb{C}$, and $e=e_{\theta}\in\mathfrak{g}_{\bar0}$ with $-\theta$ being a minimal root of $\mathfrak{g}$. Set $U(\mathfrak{g},e)$ to be the minimal finite $W$-superalgebras associated with the pair $(\mathfrak{g},e)$. In this paper we study the highest weight theory for $U(\mathfrak{g},e)$, introduce the Verma modules and give a complete isomorphism classification of finite-dimensional irreducible modules, via the parameter set consisting of pairs of weights and levels. Those Verma modules can be further described via parabolic induction from Whittaker modules for $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ or $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ respectively, depending on the detecting parity of $\textsf{r}:=\dim\mathfrak{g}(-1)_{\bar1}$. We then introduce and investigate the BGG category $\mathcal{O}$ for $U(\mathfrak{g},e)$, establishing highest weight theory, as a counterpart of the works for finite $W$-algebras by Brundan-Goodwin-Kleshchev and Losev, respectively.
  In comparison with the non-super case, the significant difference here lies in the situation when $\textsf{r}$ is odd, which is a completely new phenomenon. The difficulty and complicated computation arise from there.</description>

      <title>Basic quasi-reductive root data and supergroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.18065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate pairs $(G,Y)$, where $G$ is a reductive algebraic group and
  $Y$ a purely-odd $G$-superscheme, asking when a pair corresponds to a quasi-reductive algebraic supergroup $\mathbb{G}$, that is, $\mathbb{G}_{\text{ev}}$ is isomorphic to $G$, and the quotient $\mathbb{G}\slash \mathbb{G}_{\text{ev}}$ is $G$-equivariantly isomorphic to $Y$. We prove that, if $Y$ satisfies certain conditions (basic quasi-reductive root data),
  then the question has a positive answer given by an existence and uniqueness theorem.
  The corresponding supergroups are said to be basic quasi-reductive, which can be classified, up to isogeny. We then decide the structure of connected quasi-reductive algebraic supergroups provided that: (i) the root system does not contain $0$; (ii) $\mathfrak{g}:=\text{Lie}(\mathbb{G})$ admits a non-degenerate even symmetric bilinear form. (iii) all odd reflections are invertible. Remarkably, those supergroups are exactly basic quasi-reductive supergroups of monodromy type.</description>

      <title>Lie-Cartan modules and cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a sequel to [Duan-Shu-Yao], we introduce here a category $\mathscr{LC}$ arising from the BGG category $\mathcal{O}$ defined in [Duan-Shu-Yao] for Lie algebras of polynomial vector fields. The objects of $\mathscr{LC}$ are so-called Lie-Cartan modules which admit both Lie-module structure and compatible $R$-module structure ($R$ denotes the corresponding polynomial ring). This terminology is natural, coming from affine connections in differential geometry through which the structure sheaves in topology and the vector fields in geometry are integrated for differential manifolds.
  In this paper, we study Lie-Cartan modules and their categorical and cohomology properties. The category $\mathscr{LC}$ is abelian, and a ``highest weight category" with depths. Notably, the set of co-standard objects in the category $\mathcal{O}$ turns out to represent the isomorphism classes of simple objects of $\mathscr{LC}$. We then establish the cohomology for this category (called the $\mathscr{uLC}$-cohomology), extending Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology theory. Another notable result says that in the fundamental case $\mathfrak{g}= W(n)$, the extension ring $\text{Ext}^\bullet_{\mathscr{uLC}}(R,R)$ for the polynomial algebra $R$ in the $\mathscr{uLC}$-cohomology is isomorphic to the usual cohomology ring $H^\bullet(\mathfrak{gl}(n))$ of the general linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a Lie group, and $H\subset G$ a closed subgroup. Let $\pi$ be an irreducible unitary representation of $G$. In this paper, we briefly discuss the orbit method and its application to the branching problem $\pi|_{H}$. We use the Gan-Gross-Prasad branching law for $(G, H)= ( U(p,q), U(p, q-1) )$ as an example to illustrate the relation between $\pro_{\f u(p, q-1)}^{\f u(p,q)} \mc O(\lambda)$ and the branching law of the discrete series $D_{\lambda}|_{U(p,q-1)}$ for $\lambda$ an regular elliptic element. We also discuss some results regarding branching laws and wave front sets. The presentation of this paper does not follow the historical timeline of development.</description>

      <title>The Cayley Transform on Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Cayley transform is a birational map between a quadratic matrix group and its Lie algebra, which was first discovered by Cayley in 1846. Because of its essential role in both pure and applied mathematics, the classical Cayley transform has been generalized from various perspectives. This paper is concerned with a representation theoretic generalization of the classical Cayley transform. The idea underlying this work is that the applicability of the classical Cayley transform heavily depends on how the Lie group is represented. The goal is to characterize irreducible representations of a Lie group, to which the classical Cayley transform is applicable. To this end, we first establish criteria of the applicability for a general Lie group. If the group is semisimple, we further obtain a geometric condition on the weight diagram of such representations. Lastly, we provide a complete classification for classical complex simple Lie groups and their compact real forms. Except for the previously known examples, spin representations of $\mathrm{Spin}(8)$ are the only ones on our list.</description>

      <title>Breuil-M\'ezard conjectures for central division algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:1808.06851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate an analogue of the Breuil-M\'ezard conjecture for the group of units of a central division algebra over a $p$-adic local field, and we prove that it follows from the conjecture for $\mathrm{GL}_n$. To do so we construct a transfer of inertial types and Serre weights between the maximal compact subgroups of these two groups, in terms of Deligne-Lusztig theory, and we prove its compatibility with mod $p$ reduction, via the inertial Jacquet-Langlands correspondence and certain explicit character formulas. We also prove analogous statements for $\ell$-adic coefficients.</description>

      <title>Restriction of $p$-adic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Q}_p)$ to parahoric subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.12827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Without using the $p$-adic Langlands correspondence, we prove that for many finite length smooth representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Q}_p)$ on $p$-torsion modules the $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Q}_p)$-linear morphisms coincide with the morphisms that are linear for the normalizer of a parahoric subgroup. We identify this subgroup to be the Iwahori subgroup in the supersingular case, and $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Z}_p)$ in the principal series case. As an application, we relate the action of parahoric subgroups to the action of the inertia group of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbf{Q}}_p/\mathbf{Q}_p)$, and we prove that if an irreducible Banach space representation $\Pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Q}_p)$ has infinite $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Z}_p)$-length then a twist of $\Pi$ has locally algebraic vectors. This answers a question of Dospinescu. We make the simplifying assumption that $p &gt; 3$ and that all our representations are generic.</description>

      <title>Invariants of persistence modules defined by order-embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main objectives of topological data analysis is the study of discrete invariants for persistence modules, in particular when dealing with multiparameter persistence modules. In many cases, the invariants studied for these non-totally ordered posets $P$ can be obtained from restricting a given module to a subposet $X$ of $P$ that is totally ordered (or more generally, of finite representation type), and then computing the barcode (or the general direct sum decomposition) over $X$.
  We consider in this paper general order-preserving embeddings of representation-finite subposets $X$ into $P$ and study systematically the invariants obtained by decomposing the restriction of a given $P$-module $M$ to $X$ into its indecomposable summands. The restriction functor from $\mathrm{mod}\ P$ to $\mathrm{mod}\ X$ is well-studied, and it is known to be exact and admits both left and right adjoint functors, known as induction and co-induction functors. This allows us to obtain new homological insights, and also to re-interpret previous results. We use this approach also to determine bases of the image of these invariants, thus generalizing the concept of signed barcodes which is considered in the literature in relation to stability results.
  It turns out that considering only order-embeddings of one fixed poset $X$ into the poset $P$, and studying the set of all indecomposables obtained from $X$ introduces a lot of redundancy. We therefore also study iterated embeddings of several posets of increasing sizes, while limiting attention to only some indecomposables (that have not been obtained from embedding of smaller posets previously).</description>

      <title>Formal Degrees and Parabolic Induction: the Maximal Generic Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the compatibility of the formal degree conjecture and the parabolic induction process in the simplest nontrivial case for quasi-split $p$-adic groups. For a generic discrete series $\pi$ induced from an irreducible supercuspidal $\sigma$ of a maximal Levi subgroup, we compute the quotient $d(\pi)/d(\sigma)$ of formal degrees under some assumptions. As an application, we verify the conjecture for discrete series of split $\mathrm{G}_2$ supported on maximal Levi subgroups.</description>
