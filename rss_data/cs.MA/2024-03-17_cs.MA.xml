      <title>V2AIX: A Multi-Modal Real-World Dataset of ETSI ITS V2X Messages in Public Road Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connectivity is a main driver for the ongoing megatrend of automated mobility: future Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) will connect road vehicles, traffic signals, roadside infrastructure, and even vulnerable road users, sharing data and compute for safer, more efficient, and more comfortable mobility. In terms of communication technology for realizing such vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, the WLAN-based peer-to-peer approach (IEEE 802.11p, ITS-G5 in Europe) competes with C-V2X based on cellular technologies (4G and beyond). Irrespective of the underlying communication standard, common message interfaces are crucial for a common understanding between vehicles, especially from different manufacturers. Targeting this issue, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has been standardizing V2X message formats such as the Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM). In this work, we present V2AIX, a multi-modal real-world dataset of ETSI ITS messages gathered in public road traffic, the first of its kind. Collected in measurement drives and with stationary infrastructure, we have recorded more than 230 000 V2X messages from more than 1800 vehicles and roadside units in public road traffic. Alongside a first analysis of the dataset, we present a way of integrating ETSI ITS V2X messages into the Robot Operating System (ROS). This enables researchers to not only thoroughly analyze real-world V2X data, but to also study and implement standardized V2X messages in ROS-based automated driving applications. The full dataset is publicly available for noncommercial use at v2aix.ika.rwth-aachen.de.</description>

      <title>What Makes Good Collaborative Views? Contrastive Mutual Information Maximization for Multi-Agent Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent perception (MAP) allows autonomous systems to understand complex environments by interpreting data from multiple sources. This paper investigates intermediate collaboration for MAP with a specific focus on exploring "good" properties of collaborative view (i.e., post-collaboration feature) and its underlying relationship to individual views (i.e., pre-collaboration features), which were treated as an opaque procedure by most existing works. We propose a novel framework named CMiMC (Contrastive Mutual Information Maximization for Collaborative Perception) for intermediate collaboration. The core philosophy of CMiMC is to preserve discriminative information of individual views in the collaborative view by maximizing mutual information between pre- and post-collaboration features while enhancing the efficacy of collaborative views by minimizing the loss function of downstream tasks. In particular, we define multi-view mutual information (MVMI) for intermediate collaboration that evaluates correlations between collaborative views and individual views on both global and local scales. We establish CMiMNet based on multi-view contrastive learning to realize estimation and maximization of MVMI, which assists the training of a collaboration encoder for voxel-level feature fusion. We evaluate CMiMC on V2X-Sim 1.0, and it improves the SOTA average precision by 3.08% and 4.44% at 0.5 and 0.7 IoU (Intersection-over-Union) thresholds, respectively. In addition, CMiMC can reduce communication volume to 1/32 while achieving performance comparable to SOTA. Code and Appendix are released at https://github.com/77SWF/CMiMC.</description>

      <title>Single- and Multi-Agent Private Active Sensing: A Deep Neuroevolution Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on one centralized and one decentralized problem of active hypothesis testing in the presence of an eavesdropper. For the centralized problem including a single legitimate agent, we present a new framework based on NeuroEvolution (NE), whereas, for the decentralized problem, we develop a novel NE-based method for solving collaborative multi-agent tasks, which interestingly maintains all computational benefits of single-agent NE. The superiority of the proposed EAHT approaches over conventional active hypothesis testing policies, as well as learning-based methods, is validated through numerical investigations in an example use case of anomaly detection over wireless sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Coordination in Noncooperative Multiplayer Matrix Games via Reduced Rank Correlated Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordination in multiplayer games enables players to avoid the lose-lose outcome that often arises at Nash equilibria. However, designing a coordination mechanism typically requires the consideration of the joint actions of all players, which becomes intractable in large-scale games. We develop a novel coordination mechanism, termed reduced rank correlated equilibria, which reduces the number of joint actions to be considered and thereby mitigates computational complexity. The idea is to approximate the set of all joint actions with the actions used in a set of pre-computed Nash equilibria via a convex hull operation. In a game with n players and each player having m actions, the proposed mechanism reduces the number of joint actions considered from O(m^n) to O(mn). We demonstrate the application of the proposed mechanism to an air traffic queue management problem. Compared with the correlated equilibrium-a popular benchmark coordination mechanism-the proposed approach is capable of solving a queue management problem involving four thousand times more joint actions. In the meantime, it yields a solution that shows a 58.5% to 99.5% improvement in the fairness indicator and a 1.8% to 50.4% reduction in average delay cost compared to the Nash solution, which does not involve coordination.</description>

      <title>Scalable Distributed Optimization of Multi-Dimensional Functions Despite Byzantine Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of distributed optimization requires a group of networked agents to compute a parameter that minimizes the average of their local cost functions. While there are a variety of distributed optimization algorithms that can solve this problem, they are typically vulnerable to "Byzantine" agents that do not follow the algorithm. Recent attempts to address this issue focus on single dimensional functions, or assume certain statistical properties of the functions at the agents. In this paper, we provide two resilient, scalable, distributed optimization algorithms for multi-dimensional functions. Our schemes involve two filters, (1) a distance-based filter and (2) a min-max filter, which each remove neighborhood states that are extreme (defined precisely in our algorithms) at each iteration. We show that these algorithms can mitigate the impact of up to $F$ (unknown) Byzantine agents in the neighborhood of each regular agent. In particular, we show that if the network topology satisfies certain conditions, all of the regular agents' states are guaranteed to converge to a bounded region that contains the minimizer of the average of the regular agents' functions.</description>

      <title>Transforming Competition into Collaboration: The Revolutionary Role of Multi-Agent Systems and Language Models in Modern Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores the dynamic influence of computational entities based on multi-agent systems theory (SMA) combined with large language models (LLM), which are characterized by their ability to simulate complex human interactions, as a possibility to revolutionize human user interaction from the use of specialized artificial agents to support everything from operational organizational processes to strategic decision making based on applied knowledge and human orchestration. Previous investigations reveal that there are limitations, particularly in the autonomous approach of artificial agents, especially when dealing with new challenges and pragmatic tasks such as inducing logical reasoning and problem solving. It is also considered that traditional techniques, such as the stimulation of chains of thoughts, require explicit human guidance. In our approach we employ agents developed from large language models (LLM), each with distinct prototyping that considers behavioral elements, driven by strategies that stimulate the generation of knowledge based on the use case proposed in the scenario (role-play) business, using a discussion approach between agents (guided conversation). We demonstrate the potential of developing agents useful for organizational strategies, based on multi-agent system theories (SMA) and innovative uses based on large language models (LLM based), offering a differentiated and adaptable experiment to different applications, complexities, domains, and capabilities from LLM.</description>
