      <title>Singularities of Dirac-Coulomb propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study singularities of propagators and $N$-point functions for Dirac fields in a Coulomb potential, possibly with a $t$-dependent smooth part for $|t|&lt;T&lt;\infty$. We show that the in and out Dirac-Coulomb vacua are Hadamard states for $r\neq 0$. Furthermore, we prove that the relative charge density of any two Hadamard states is well-defined as a locally integrable function including near $r=0$. The results are based on a diffractive propagation of singularities theorem for the Dirac-Coulomb system previously obtained by the first and third authors, generalized here to the case of $t$-dependent potentials.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Hartree dynamics for a N-particles fermionic 2D system interacting via long-range electric and magnetic two-body singular potentials in a dilute regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a 2-dimensional system of N fermions interacting through a pairwise electric and magnetic singular interactions with Slater initial data preserves its Slater structure over time when N gets large. In other words, the wave function of the system can be approximated by a Slater determinant whose orbitals evolves according to a coupled system of N Chern-Simons- Schr\"odinger type effective equations. The result holds in a dilute regime where the density is of order one on a large volume proportional to the number of particles. The pairwise magnetic feature of the system implies to deal with the diagonalization of three-body potentials which is the main mathematical innovation of the paper.</description>

      <title>Analysis of travelling wave equations in sorption processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This works presents a mathematical model of an adsorption column to study the evolution of contaminant concentration and adsorbed quantity along the column's longitudinal axis. The model, described by a system of partial differential equations (PDEs), is analysed using a travelling wave approach, which transforms the system into a second-order ordinary differential equation dependent on the inverse P\'eclet number, typically small. The model is simplified by means of a singular perturbation to a leading-order approximation by assuming a negligible inverse P\'eclet number, which can be regarded as a slow-fast system. By analytical continuation, we conclude that, at least for small values of the inverse P\'eclet number, the concentration varies from the clean state of the adsorbent matrix to a full saturation. We present numerical simulations to illustrate the analytical results for different P\'eclet number values and conduct a sensitivity analysis that demonstrates the system's robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a reduction procedure for determining generalized travelling waves for first order quasilinear hyperbolic nonhomogeneous systems. The basic idea is to look for solutions of the governing model which satisfy a further set of differential constraints. Some applications are given for a barotropic fluid with a source term.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and positivity of Hawking quasi-local energy on area-constrained critical surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key test for any quasi-local energy in general relativity is that it be nonnegative and satisfy a rigidity property; if it vanishes, the region enclosed is flat. We show that the Hawking energy, when evaluated on its natural area-constrained critical surfaces, henceforth called "Hawking surfaces", satisfies both properties under the dominant energy condition. In the time-symmetric case, where Hawking surfaces coincide with area-constrained Willmore surfaces, we extend positivity and rigidity to include electric charge, a nonzero cosmological constant, and higher dimensions. In the fully dynamical (non-time-symmetric) case, we establish the first nonnegativity and rigidity theorems for the Hawking energy in this general setting. These results confirm the Hawking energy consistency with basic physical principles and address several longstanding ambiguities and criticisms.</description>

      <title>Some classes of finite-dimensional ladder operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study some special classes of ladder operators in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In particular we consider a truncated version of quons, their {\em psudo-}version, and a third family of operators acting on a closed chain. In this latter situation, we discuss the existence of what could be considered {\em discrete coherent states}, as suitable eigenvectors of the annihilation operator of the chain. We see that, under reasonable assumptions, a resolution of the identity can be recovered, involving these states, together with a biorthogonal family of vectors, which turn out to be eigenstates of the raising operator of the chain.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Index in String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of `quantum entanglement index' with the aim to compute it for black hole horizons in string theory at one-loop order using the stringy replica method. We consider the horizon of BTZ black holes to construct the relevant conical orbifolds, labeled by an odd integer $N$, and compute the partition function as a function of $N$, corresponding to the fractional indexed R\'enyi entropy. We show that it is free of tachyons and naturally finite both in the ultraviolet and the infrared, even though it is generically ultraviolet divergent in the field theory limit. Thus, the index provides a useful diagnostic of the entanglement structure of string theory without the need for analytic continuation in $N$.</description>

      <title>Mass-gap description of heavy impurities in Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified theory that connects the quasiparticle picture of Fermi polarons for mobile impurities to the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe for static impurities. By operator reordering of the underlying many-body Hamiltonian, we obtain a modified fermionic dispersion relation that features a recoil-induced energy gap, which we call the `mass gap'. We show that the resulting mean-field Hamiltonian exhibits an in-gap state for finite impurity mass, which takes a key role in Fermi polaron and molecule formation. We identify the mass gap as the microscopic origin of the quasiparticle weight of Fermi polarons and derive a power-law scaling of the weight with the impurity-to-fermion mass ratio. The associated in-gap state is shown to give rise to the emergence of the polaron-to-molecule transition away from the limiting case of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in which the transition is absent.</description>

      <title>Einstein's Electron and Local Branching: Unitarity Does not Require Many-Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the 1927 thought experiment of Einstein on electron diffraction, using a single-electron source and an opaque hemispheric detector array, now achievable with modern sensors. In this fully enclosed system, where no signals escape the hemisphere, we provide a direct empirical comparison of the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) and the Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI). Both maintain unitarity without invoking wavefunction collapse, as in the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI), but differ ontologically: MWI proposes irreversible global branching into parallel worlds, while BHSI describes local, potentially reversible branching into decohered subspaces. In this setup, all quantum events (branching, engagement, disengagement, and relocation) occur entirely within the local system, and the Born rule, naturally emerging through branch weights, can be observed in detector statistics. To explore branching dynamics more thoroughly, we suggest an enhanced dual-layer experimental setup with an inner transparent detector. Because the electron transit time between layers is shorter than the average response times of the inner sensors, this allows for a crucial test of measurement timing and potential anomalies, such as delayed or uncommitted choices. Our analysis challenges the notion that unitarity necessitates parallel worlds, instead advocating for a simpler view: local, unitary branching without collapse or global splitting.</description>

      <title>The noisy voter model with general initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the noisy voter model with $q\geq 2$ states and noise probability $\theta$ on arbitrary bounded-degree $n$-vertex graphs $G$ with subexponential growth of balls (e.g., finite subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^d$). Cox, Peres and Steif (2016) showed for the binary case $q=2$ (and a wider class of chains) that, when starting from a worst-case initial state, this Markov chain has total variation cutoff at $t_n=\frac1{2\theta}\log n$. The second author and Sly (2021) analyzed faster initial conditions for Glauber dynamics for the 1D Ising model, which is the noisy voter for $q=2$ and $G=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. They showed that the ``alternating'' initial state is the fastest one if $\theta\geq \frac23$, and conjectured that this holds for all values of the noise $\theta$.
  Here we show that for every graph $G$ as above and all $\theta,q$ and initial states $x_0$, the noisy voter model exhibits cutoff at an explicit function of the autocorrelation of the model started at $x_0$. Consequently, for $G=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ and $q=2$ (Glauber dynamics for the 1D Ising model), we confirm the conjecture of [LS21] that the alternating initial condition is asymptotically fastest for all $\theta$. Analogous results hold in $\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ for $q=2$ and all $d\geq 1$ (``checkerboard'' initial conditions are fastest) as well as for $d=1$ and all $q\geq 2$ (``rainbow'' initial conditions are fastest).</description>

      <title>Stability for multiple Lamb dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the class of nonnegative vorticities on the half-plane, we establish the Lyapunov stability of finite sums of Lamb dipoles under the initial assumptions that the dipoles are sufficiently separated and that the faster dipoles are positioned to the right of the slower ones. Our approach combines sharp energy estimates near the Lamb dipoles with a Lagrangian bootstrapping scheme, enabling us to quantify the exchanges of circulation, enstrophy, impulse, and energy between various parts of the solution. The strategy of the proof is robust, and we present several potential extensions of the result.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and long-time behavior of a bulk-surface Cahn--Hilliard model with non-degenerate mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a bulk-surface Cahn--Hilliard model with non-degenerate mobility and singular potentials in two dimensions. Following the ideas of the recent work by Conti, Galimberti, Gatti, and Giorgini [Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations, 64(3):Paper No. 87, 32, 2025] for the Cahn--Hilliard equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, we show the uniqueness of weak solutions together with a continuous dependence estimate for sufficiently regular mobility functions. Next, under weaker assumptions on the mobility functions, we show the existence of a weak solution that exhibits the propagation of uniform-in-time regularity and satisfies the instantaneous separation property. Lastly, we consider the long-time behavior and prove that the unique weak solution converges to a solution of the stationary bulk-surface Cahn--Hilliard equation. Our approach for the uniqueness proof relies on a new well-posedness and regularity theory for a bulk-surface elliptic system with non-constant coefficients, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Flat-band thermodynamics reveals enhanced performance across Otto, Carnot, and Stirling cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits remarkable electronic properties under external magnetic fields, notably the emergence of flat Landau levels. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of MATBG's operational phase diagram under three distinct quantum thermodynamic cycles, i.e., Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC), Quantum Carnot Cycle (QCC), and Quantum Stirling Cycle (QSC). Employing the continuum eight-band model, we evaluate the thermodynamic performance of MATBG across multiple operational modes: heat engine, refrigerator, cold pump, and Joule pump, and benchmark it against other graphene systems such as monolayer graphene, AB-Bernal stacked bilayer graphene, and non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings reveal that MATBG demonstrates superior heat engine performance in QSC, while achieving high efficiency albeit with reduced work output in QOC. Even though the performance of MATBG as a cold pump or refrigerator is modest in QOC and QSC, it shows notable improvement as a refrigerator in QCC. Additionally, we identify a highly reversible Joule pump mode in both QSC and QOC under strict adiabaticity, underscoring the unique thermodynamic behavior of MATBG.</description>

      <title>Trace and Observability Inequalities for Laplace Eigenfunctions on the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate trace and observability inequalities for Laplace eigenfunctions on the d-dimensional torus, with respect to arbitrary Borel measures $\mu$. Specifically, we characterize the measures $\mu$ for which the inequalities
  $$ \int |u|^2 d \mu \lesssim \int |u|^2 d x \quad \text{(trace)}, \qquad \int |u|^2 d \mu \gtrsim \int |u|^2 d x \quad \text{(observability)}$$
  hold uniformly for all eigenfunctions $u$ of the Laplacian. Sufficient conditions are derived based on the integrability and regularity of $\mu$, while necessary conditions are formulated in terms of the dimension of the support of the measure. These results generalize classical theorems of Zygmund and Bourgain--Rudnick to higher dimensions. Applications include results in the spirit of Cantor--Lebesgue theorems, constraints on quantum limits, and control theory for the Schr\"odinger equation. Our approach combines several tools: the cluster structure of lattice points on spheres; decoupling estimates; and the construction of eigenfunctions exhibiting strong concentration or vanishing behavior, tailored respectively to the trace and observability inequalities.</description>

      <title>Three-local Conserved Charge Implies Quantum Integrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the conservation of a charge operator supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher order conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This establishes Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture as a theorem, ending the folklore that the existence of higher conserved charges imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>

Abstract: Spin helix states-characterized by their spatially modulated spin textures-are exact eigenstates of the one-dimensional anisotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model under specific parameter conditions. In this work, we extend this framework by constructing exact spin helix eigenstates for the fully anisotropic XYZ Heisenberg model with arbitrary spatial dimensions and arbitrary spin quantum numbers. Our results demonstrate that some non-trivial exact eigenstates can persist beyond the integrable regime. The XXZ and XY cases are also analyzed to clarify the conditions for the emergence of spin helix eigenstates and their key properties. Our results broaden the class of analytically tractable exact eigenstates in non-integrable systems and deepen understanding of spin modulation states in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Tables of practical invariants for distinguishing multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses to what extent the census of multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 7, proposed by the software package Anyonica and the anyonwiki website, can be regarded as a proper classification. The questions of correctness and completeness are briefly discussed, and the question of inequivalence of the provided categories is resolved under the assumption that all proposed data is correct. This is done by providing tables of small sets of invariants for these categories, for which (a) their invariance under automorphisms can be checked manually, and (b) the (in)equivalence of two skeletal fusion categories can be checked manually. These invariants can also be used to identify the category on the anyonwiki that corresponds to one for which the skeletal data is known.</description>

      <title>What bordism-theoretic anomaly cancellation can do for U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a bordism computation to show that the $E_{7(7)}(\mathbb{R})$ U-duality symmetry of 4d $\mathcal N = 8$ supergravity could have an anomaly invisible to perturbative methods; then we show that this anomaly is trivial. We compute the relevant bordism group using the Adams and Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences, and we show the anomaly vanishes by computing $\eta$-invariants on the Wu manifold, which generates the bordism group.</description>

      <title>On stability of solitons and their attraction for a rotating charge with fixed mass center in the Maxwell field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the system of Maxwell equations and Lorentz torque equation which describes a motion of charge in electromagnetic field. Under certain symmetry conditions on charge distribution and on initial fields the mass center of the charge remains fixed and the charge rotates around it. The system admits stationary soliton-type solutions. We study the Lyapunov and the orbital stability of the solitons exploiting the energy conservation law. We also show, by the angular momentum argument, that there is no attraction to a soliton of finite angular momentum on the surface of states of the same angular momentum.

      <title>A Simple and Efficient Joint Measurement Strategy for Estimating Fermionic Observables and Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple scheme to estimate fermionic observables and Hamiltonians relevant in quantum chemistry and correlated fermionic systems. Our approach is based on implementing a measurement that jointly measures noisy versions of any product of two or four Majorana operators in an $N$ mode fermionic system. To realize our measurement we use: (i) a randomization over a set of unitaries that realize products of Majorana fermion operators; (ii) a unitary, sampled at random from a constant-size set of suitably chosen fermionic Gaussian unitaries; (iii) a measurement of fermionic occupation numbers; (iv) suitable post-processing. Our scheme can estimate expectation values of all quadratic and quartic Majorana monomials to $\epsilon$ precision using $\mathcal{O}(N \log(N)/\epsilon^2)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log(N)/\epsilon^2)$ measurement rounds respectively, matching the performance offered by fermionic classical shadows. In certain settings, such as a rectangular lattice of qubits which encode an $N$ mode fermionic system via the Jordan-Wigner transformation, our scheme can be implemented in circuit depth $\mathcal{O}(N^{1/2})$ with $\mathcal{O}(N^{3/2})$ two-qubit gates, offering an improvement over fermionic and matchgate classical shadows that require depth $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ two-qubit gates. By benchmarking our method on exemplary molecular Hamiltonians and observing performances comparable to fermionic classical shadows, we demonstrate a novel, competitive alternative to existing strategies.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for the Dynamical Foundation of the Fractional Brownian Motion and Related Models of Anomalous Diffusion with Random Diffusion Coefficient and Time-Dependent Random Hurst parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalous diffusion is an established phenomenon but still a theoretical challenge in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Physical models are built incrementally, and the most recent and most general family is based on the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) with a random diffusion coefficient (superstatistical fBm) together with a time-dependent random Hurst parameter. We provide here a dynamical foundation for such general family of models. We consider a dynamical system describing the motion of a test-particle surrounded by $N$ Brownian particles with different masses. This dynamic is governed by underdamped Langevin equations. Physical principles of conservation of momentum and energy are met. We prove that, in the limit $N\to\infty$, the test-particle diffuses in time according to a quite general (non-Markovian) Gaussian process whose covariance function is determined by the distribution of the masses of the surround-particles. In particular, with proper choices of the distribution of the masses of the surround-particles, we obtain fBm together with a number of other special cases of interest in modelling anomalous diffusion including time-dependent anomalous exponent. Furthermore, when the ensemble heterogeneity of the surround-particles embodying the environment becomes non-uniform and joins with the individual inhomogeneity of the test-particles, we show that, in the limit $N\to\infty$, the test-particle diffuses in time according to a quite general conditionally Gaussian process that can be calibrated into a fBm with random diffusion coefficient and random time-dependent Hurst parameter. We conclude our study by reporting the generalised Kolmogorov--Fokker--Planck equations associated to these highly general processes.</description>

Abstract: We consider the valence bond solid (VBS) state built of singlet pairs of fundamental representations and projected onto adjoint representations of the exceptional Lie group G$_2$. The two-point correlation function in the VBS state is non-vanishing only for nearest neighbours, but possesses finite string order. We construct a parent Hamiltonian for the VBS state, which constitutes the G$_2$ analog of the famous AKLT chain.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy theorem separating complete integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$ in terms of the presence or absence of local conserved quantities. We prove a dichotomy theorem that whether a single quantity is zero or not sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system has $k$-local conserved quantities for all $k$ (completely integrable), or (ii) this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity (non-integrable). This result excludes the possibility of an intermediate system with some but not all local conserved quantities, which solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.grability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

Abstract: We develop and prove new geometric and algebraic characterisations for locations of constituent skyrmions, as well as their signed multiplicity, using Sutcliffe's JNR ansatz. Some low charge examples, and their similarity to BPS monopoles, are discussed. In addition, we provide Julia code for the further numerical study and visualisation of JNR skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Making rare events typical in $d$-dimensional chaotic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the deterministic nature of chaotic systems, fluctuations in their trajectories arise solely from the choice of initial conditions. Some of these dynamical fluctuations may lead to extremely unlikely scenarios. Understanding the impact of such rare events and the trajectories that give rise to them is of significant interest across disciplines. Yet, identifying the initial conditions responsible for those events is a challenging task due to the inherent sensitivity to small perturbations of chaotic dynamics. In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 227201 (2023)], this challenge was addressed by finding the effective dynamics that make rare events typical for one-dimensional chaotic maps. Here we extend such large-deviation framework to $d$-dimensional chaotic maps. Specifically, for any such map, we propose a method to find an effective topologically-conjugate map which reproduces the rare-event statistics in the long-time limit. We demonstrate the applicability of this result using several observables of paradigmatic examples of two-dimensional chaos, namely the two-dimensional tent map and Arnold's cat map.</description>

      <title>Physical models realizing the transformer architecture of large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 marked the most striking advancement in natural language processing. The transformer is a model architecture relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. However, we believe there is a gap in our theoretical understanding of what the transformer is, and how it works physically. From a physical perspective on modern chips, such as those chips under 28nm, modern intelligent machines should be regarded as open quantum systems beyond conventional statistical systems. Thereby, in this paper, we construct physical models realizing large language models based on a transformer architecture as open quantum systems in the Fock space over the Hilbert space of tokens. Our physical models underlie the transformer architecture for large language models.</description>
