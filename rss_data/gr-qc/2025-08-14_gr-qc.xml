      <title>Study on deflection angle, shadow, quasinormal modes, and greybody factor of the black hole surrounded by quintessence in Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study focuses on investigating the deflection angle in the weak-field approximation, shadow, quasinormal modes using Lyapunov exponents, and lower bound of the greybody factor for a charged black hole surrounded by a quintessence field in Rastall gravity. The weak deflection angles are calculated using the Gauss-Bonnet method. They decrease with increasing impact parameter b and charge Q, but gradually increase with increasing black hole mass m. Notably, the presence of a surrounding quintessence field in Rastall gravity leads to a higher deflection angle compared to Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordstrom black holes with positive Nq. The photon sphere and shadow of the black hole are analysed concerning the charge Q and mass m; they shrink as Q increases and expand with increasing m. We further analyse the quasinormal modes of the black hole, explicitly derive the coordinate time Lyapunov exponent {\lambda}c and the quasinormal frequency {\omega}. In the eikonal limit, the Lyapunov exponent ensures that the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes can be expressed by the frequency and instability time scale of the unstable null circular geodesics. Additionally, we derive the lower bounds of the greybody factor Gb; it decreases for increasing charge Q, while the increasing mass m enhances it. Importantly, all the findings reduce to those of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole for Nq=0 and to the Schwarzschild black hole for Nq=Q=0.</description>

      <title>Cosmic structure formation in massive conformal gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of matter density perturbations in the framework of massive conformal gravity (MCG). Starting from the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, we find the continuity and Euler equations for the conformal perfect fluid that fills the MCG universe. We then obtain the perturbed MCG cosmological equations, from which we derive the equation that determines the growth of matter fluctuations in the MCG universe. The resulting growth equation shows that MCG enhances cosmic structure formation at high redshifts and suppresses it at low redshifts when compared to the {\Lambda}CDM cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Some geometrical aspects of gravitational waves using continuum mechanics analogy: State of the art and potential consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the authors employ the analogy between continuum mechanics and general relativity to investigate, from the perspective of elasticity and crystal plasticity, the deformations of space measured by LIGO/VIRGO interferometers during the passage of gravitational waves over Earth. The results of different innovative or existing mechanical models are compared with each other and compared with the observations in the framework of general relativity and Einstein-Cartan theory. Despite limitations, there is a convergence of results: the polarizations of gravitational waves can be viewed as expressions of an equivalent elastic media deformation tensor. Additionally, an anisotropy of space properties is unavoidable at the measurement point of the gravitational wave if we rely on the current first-order general relativity, which predict that gravitational waves generate deformations only in transverse planes. It is demonstrated that the classical polarizations of general relativity can be associated with a state of pure torsion in the analogous elastic medium and acted upon by the rotation of massive bodies such as black holes. This approach involves a transverse isotropic medium composed of independent sheets that deform perpendicularly to the direction of propagation of these waves. Considering geometric torsion in general relativity, associated with plastic crystallography, allows for the examination of complementary polarizations in the direction of wave propagation. This makes it possible to connect these sheets and reconstruct a complete, coherent 3D environment.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave distance estimation using intrinsic signal properties: dark sirens as distance indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GWs) provide a powerful means for cosmological distance estimation, circumventing the systematic uncertainties associated with traditional electromagnetic (EM) indicators. This work presents a model for estimating distances to binary black hole (BBH) mergers using only GW data, independent of EM counterparts or galaxy catalogs. By utilizing the intrinsic properties of the GW signal, specifically the strain amplitude and merger frequency, our model offers a computationally efficient preliminary distance estimation approach that could complements existing Bayesian parameter estimation pipelines. In this work, we examine a simplified analytical expression for the GW luminosity distance derived from General Relativity (GR), based on the leading-order quadrupole approximation. Without incorporating post-Newtonian (PN) or numerical relativity (NR) corrections, or modeling spin, eccentricity, or inclination, we test how closely this expression can reproduce distances reported by full Bayesian inference pipelines. We apply our model to 87 events from the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogues (GWTC), computing distances for these sources. Our results demonstrate consistent agreement with GWTC-reported distances, further supported by graphical comparisons that highlight the model's performance across multiple events.</description>

      <title>A Unified Dynamical Systems Framework for Cosmology in $f(Q)$ Gravity: Generic Features Beyond the Coincident Gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified dynamical systems framework for spatially flat FLRW cosmology in $f(Q)$ gravity, covering all three connection branches via a single set of Hubble-normalised variables without fixing $f(Q)$ \textit{a priori}. This connection-agnostic, model-independent approach enables direct comparison across branches and reveals generic structural features that are not apparent in model or connection-specific analyses. Beyond fixed points, we identify invariant submanifolds, model-independent trajectories, and viable phase-space regions common to multiple branches. For a broad class of viable $f(Q)$ models, we find generic de Sitter attractors and matter-dominated points in non-coincident branches, ensuring late-time acceleration without fine-tuning. An invariant submanifold is shown to reproduce $\Lambda$CDM-like backgrounds despite dynamics distinct from GR, offering a geometric origin for cosmic acceleration detectable only at the perturbation level. On this submanifold, a first integral enables analytic reconstruction of the dynamical connection and uncovers hidden conservation laws. While trivial connections display strong parameter dependence, nontrivial branches often exhibit parameter-independent behaviour. We also analyse the variation of the effective gravitational coupling $\kappa_{\text{eff}}=\frac{1}{f_Q}$ across branches, providing observational constraints that bridge theory and data. Applying the framework to $f(Q)=\alpha Q+\beta(-Q)^n$, we recover late-time acceleration and $\Lambda$CDM-like behaviour without vacuum energy. Finally, we propose a general route for extending dynamical systems analysis to broader classes of $f(Q)$ models using the $m_i$-hierarchy method, which enables closure of the autonomous system for models previously inaccessible to standard approaches.</description>

      <title>Rotational Properties of Superradiant Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superradiance enables scalar fields to extract energy and angular momentum from a rotating black hole (BH), leading to the formation of a BH-condensate system. The condensate appears to exhibit global rotation as a rigid body, with phase propagation occurring only in the azimuthal direction, such a picture leads to unphysical superluminal velocities at large distances. In this work, we demonstrate that the apparent rotation is a collective effect arising from local radial, polar, and azimuthal motions. In the region sufficiently far from the BH, the condensate exhibits a radial velocity magnitude that approaches $ (r_g\mu/\bar{n}) \sin (2\omega t-2 \varphi)$, while the polar and azimuthal velocity magnitudes asymptotically decline as $\propto 1/r$.</description>

      <title>Foundational Structure of Local Amplitudes in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been recently renewed interest in the quantisation of gravity by considering local subsystems on light-like hypersurfaces. The main purpose of this paper is to present a theory-independent perspective on these developments assuming only basic knowledge of quantum theory and general relativity. In addition, we present a top-down approach to constructing local amplitudes in causal diamonds. The fundamental building block is a slab of light-like geometry (e.g. a segment of a light cone embedded into spacetime). Each slab is a three-dimensional light-like hypersurface bounded by two cuts, its past and future corners. After briefly reviewing the timeless formalism of quantum theory, we equip each null slab a with a kinematical Hilbert space that factorizes into constituents associated to the three-dimensional interior and its two corners. Upon assuming the existence of vacuum states for the bulk and boundary symmetries and a fundamental projector onto physical states, we explain how to introduce local amplitudes by contracting boundary states according to the pattern of a causal diamond. Finally, we show that the resulting local transition amplitudes satisfy Ward identities and charge conservation for the underlying symmetries. The paper closes with a summary and discussion for how different approaches to quantum gravity can realise our proposal in practice.</description>

      <title>Modeling of non-rotating neutron stars in 5D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the modeling of anisotropic magnetized static neutron stars within the framework of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (5D EGB) gravity. While Einstein's gravity has traditionally been employed to examine neutron stars, recent observational advancements have revealed its limitations in accurately describing high-mass astronomical objects-particularly in predicting or explaining certain observed neutron star masses. In response, this research seeks to address the limitations of Einstein's gravity in characterizing high-mass neutron stars by modifying the gravitational action and incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. This term holds significant dynamical relevance in higher dimensions, particularly within the context of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity explored in this study, thereby providing a more realistic description of gravitational phenomena under extreme conditions. By deriving the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and utilizing the AV18 potential, we analyze the profiles of metric functions, density and pressure, gradients of density and pressure, the anisotropic function and its trace, mass-function and compactness, the mass-radius curve, surface redshift function, equation of state parameters, and radial and tangential sound speeds. Additionally, stability factors, adiabatic indices, and energy conditions are examined. The results indicate that all conditions are satisfied for specific values of the coupling constant, confirming the physical stability of the model. Furthermore, higher dimensions enhance resistance to gravitational collapse, resulting in an increase in the maximum mass predicted by the proposed model. Ultimately, calculations show that the modified Buchdahl inequality is satisfied as well.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first study of the throttling process and heat engine efficiency of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter charged and rotating black strings in the extended phase space. For the throttling process, we calculate the Joule-Thomson coefficient and inversion temperature. We also depict the inversion and isenthalpic curves in the temperature-pressure plane, thereby identifying the corresponding cooling and heating regions. For the black string heat engine, we obtain analytical expressions for the efficiency of the Carnot and rectangular engine cycles and draw their diagrams in terms of some relevant thermodynamics variables.</description>

      <title>Instant Folded Strings, Dark Energy and a Cyclic Bouncing Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a wholly self-consistent, complete cyclic bouncing cosmology based on components drawn from string theory and constructed in a way that is under perturbative control throughout (e.g., with temperature much less than the string scale and string coupling $g_s \ll 1$ at all times). The cyclic evolution is governed by standard dilaton-gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensions with a perturbatively generated potential and a coupling between the dilaton and a second field that becomes massless at $\phi= \phi_{ESP}$, resulting in an enhanced symmetry point (ESP) that prevents the dilaton from running all the way to zero coupling. A central role is played by instant folded strings (IFSs) - fundamental strings with the unusual property of being much lighter than the string mass while extending far beyond the string length, and violating the Null Energy Condition (NEC). IFSs are produced classically when the string coupling grows with time, which occurs at two critical points in each cycle. In turn, they fulfill a dual function: enabling cosmological bounces and initiating transient epochs of dark-energy domination that naturally transition into slow contraction. The resulting cosmology eliminates the cosmic singularity and multiverse problems of big bang inflationary models and robustly predicts time-varying IFS-induced dark energy and the absence of primordial B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy in models close to $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this communication we address whether or not there is an equivalence between the kinematical and dynamical descriptions of the spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We address this by investigating whether an almost $\Lambda$CDM expansion history ($j(z)\approx1$) corresponds to an almost $\Lambda$CDM model ($w_{\rm DE}(z)\approx-1$) by considering two particular explicit examples. At least for the cases considered, this turns out not to be the case. Instead, what we find is that an almost $\Lambda$CDM cosmic evolution rather corresponds to an \emph{almost unified dark fluid model}. Considering that one never gets the exact condition $j(z)=1$ from any cosmographic data sets, this raises further questions on whether the $\Lambda$CDM model is the best candidate for the standard model of the evolution of the universe.</description>

      <title>Strong lensing and Hawking spectra of charged black hole under Lorentz violation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the strong gravitational lensing effects around the Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m-like black hole (RN-like BH) in bumblebee gravity. We calculate the lensing quantities such as deflection angle, radius of the photon sphere, angular separation, relativistic image characteristics, Einstein ring and time delay. By taking the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) like Sgr A*, M87*, NGC 1332, NGC 4649 etc. as RN-like BH, we compute the lensing observables and compare with the observables associated with the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole (RNBH). The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of massless Dirac field perturbation of Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m-de Sitter-like (RNdS-like) BH are also calculated. We discuss the behaviour of both real and imaginary parts of QNM frequencies with varying of $Q$ and $L$. It shows the damping rate and the oscillation frequency decrease with increasing $L$ but it has the opposite effect for the increase of $Q$. We further explore the detectability of QNMs by LIGO and LISA, and study the impact of $L$ and $Q$ on the detectable BH mass range. Further, we investigate the behaviour of greybody factor (GF) of RNdS-like BH in bumblebee gravity and find that the probability of wave transmission increases with increasing $L$ but decreases with the increase of $Q$. The behaviour of absorption cross section and sparsity of Hawking radiation for different values of $L$ and $Q$ are also analysed graphically.</description>

      <title>General Boosted Black Holes: A First Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain an approximate solution of Einstein field equations which describes a general boosted Kerr-Newman black hole relative to a Lorentz frame at future null infinity. The boosted black hole is obtained from a general twisting metric whose boost emerges from the BMS group. Employing a standard procedure we build the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor with the Kerr boosted metric together with its timelike Killing vector as the electromagnetic potential. We demonstrate that our solution satisfies Einstein field equations up to a fourth-order expansion in $1/r$, indicating that the spacetime closely resembles a Kerr-Newman black hole whose boost points in a arbitrary direction. Spacetime structures of the general black hole -- namely the event horizon and ergosphere -- are examined in Bondi-Sachs coordinates. For a proper timelike observer we show that the electric field generated by the boosted black hole exhibits a purely radial behavior, whereas the magnetic field develops a complex structure characterized by two pronounced lobes oriented opposite to the boost direction.</description>

      <title>Can a $\xi R \phi^2$ non-minimal coupling contribute to the non-relativistic gravitational potential?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the contribution of the $\sqrt{-g}\xi R\phi^2$ non-minimal interaction for a massive scalar to the gravitational potential, found via the non-relativistic 2-2 scattering with one and two graviton exchanges up to one loop order. Such coupling can be most naturally motivated from the renormalisation of a scalar field theory with quartic self interaction in a curved spacetime. This coupling is qualitatively different from the minimal ones, like $\sim \sqrt{G} h^{\mu\nu}T_{\mu\nu}$, as the vertices corresponding to the former does not explicitly contain any scalar momenta, but instead explicitly contains the momentum of the graviton. We show that the insertion of one/two graviton-two scalar non-minimal vertices in the standard 2-2 scattering Feynman diagrams does not yield any contribution for the potential up to one loop, owing to the aforesaid explicit appearance of graviton's transfer momentum in the numerator of the Feynman amplitude. In order to complement this effect, the most natural choice seems to consider the three graviton vertex generated by the $\sim \Lambda \sqrt{-g}/G$ term in the action, where $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant. This vertex does not contain explicitly any graviton momentum. With this, and assuming short scale scattering much small compared to the Hubble horizon, we compute the seagull, the vacuum polarisation and the fish diagrams and obtain the non-relativistic scattering amplitudes. They indeed yield a two body gravitational potential at order $\xi \Lambda G^2$. We further point out some qualitative differences of this potential with that of the standard result of $\xi =0$.</description>

      <title>On the Replica Problem in Supersymmetric SYK Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the replica problem for Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. First, we consider $n-$replicas of the non-supersymmetric SYK model, finding that this $n$-replica model is solvable only under specific conditions. We then introduce the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry and utilize the superconformal symmetry to develop a ``multi-ordered trick" that covers the replica structure. By incorporating ordered off-diagonal couplings, we study the resulting thermal phase structure under higher-order interactions. The Lorentzian time dynamics is analyzed, and we plot the time evolution of the effective action. Furthermore, we investigate emergent superconformal symmetry in the low-energy limit of the replicated theory. In the superconformal limit, we propose an ordered super-Schwarzian action and derive reparameterization relations for the ordered coordinates. Corresponding constraints are derived for holographic matching to $\mathcal{N}=1$ super-Jackiw-Teitelboim(SJT) gravity. We numerically calculate the modular thermodynamics (modular entropy, the $n$-dependent relative entropy, and the entanglement capacity) using fully diagonal methods. Our result provide a framework for studying $n$-replica wormholes with supersymmetric SYK model.</description>

      <title>Gravity Is Induced By Renormalization Group Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the holographic renormalization group (RG) setting in which a 4-dimensional ($4d$) quantum field theory at a finite cutoff corresponds to/is described by the Einstein gravity on a part of AdS$_{5}$ space, cutoff at a finite radius. This holographic setting has interesting and important implications for the $4d$ field theory: Deformation of the field theory by a certain combination involving the square of its energy-momentum tensor can be alternatively viewed as formulating the field theory on a background with a dynamical metric. Explicitly, starting with a non-gravitating $4d$ field theory in the UV, flowing to the IR, quantum effects that we compute using the classical $5d$ Einstein gravity theory, induce an effective $4d$ Einstein gravity theory. In other words, we show that gravity is not a fundamental force and is an effective description of quantum effects in the IR limit.</description>

      <title>Trapping, chaos and averaging in bubbling AdS spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss chaos and ensemble averaging in 1/2 BPS bubbling $AdS$ spaces of Lin, Lunin and Maldacena (LLM) by studying trapped and escaping null geodesics and estimating their decay rates. We find typical chaotic scattering behavior and confirm the Pesin relation between escape rates, Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. On the other hand, for geodesics in coarse-grained (grayscale) LLM geometries (which exhibit a naked singularity) chaos is strongly suppressed, which is consistent with orbits and escape rates averaged over microscopic backgrounds. Also the singularities in these grayscale geometries produce an attractive potential and have some similarities to black hole throats trapping geodesics for a long time. Overall, averaging over the ensembles of LLM geometries brings us closer toward the typical behavior of geodesics in black hole backgrounds, but some important differences remain, in particular the existence of a threshold timescale when the averaging fails.</description>

      <title>A Long-Baseline Atom Interferometer at CERN LHC Point 4: Implementation Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the feasibility study in CERN-PBC Report-2018-002 (Arduini et al. 2018), this report supported by the Physics Beyond Colliders (PBC) Study Group describes the technical implementation of modifications to the PX46 shaft at LHC Point 4 during LS3 (June 2026 - June 2030) that would enable it to accommodate the installation and operation of a vertical long-baseline Atom Interferometer during Run 4 without affecting LHC operations. We specify in detail the necessary civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and design of a mobile elevator platform. Our comprehensive technical assessment identifies no fundamental obstacles or showstoppers to implementation. Refined cost estimates and a critical-path schedule confirm that, from formal approval, all interventions can be completed within a 1.5-year window. These preparations would ensure seamless, concurrent operation of the Atom Interferometer experiment and the HL-LHC, with all technical challenges successfully addressed through established engineering solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cooling of isolated dark-matter-admixed neutron stars, employing a realistic nuclear equation of state and realistic nuclear pairing gaps, together with fermionic dark matter of variable particle mass and dark-matter fraction. The related parameter space is scanned for the stellar structural and cooling properties. We find that a consistent description of all current cooling data requires fast direct Urca cooling and reasonable proton 1S0 gaps. but no neutron 3P2 pairing. Dark matter affects the cooling properties by a modification of the nuclear density profiles, but also changes stellar radius and maximum mass. Possible signals of a large dark matter content could be a very massive but slow-cooling star or a very light but fast-cooling star.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a geometrical formulation of nonlinear electrodynamics by expressing its principal symbol as an optical metric-induced object. Under the assumption of no birefringence, we show that the evolution of linear perturbations can be recast as a covariant divergence on a curved, field-dependent background, enabling the application of quantum field theory techniques as in Maxwell's theory in curved backgrounds. This geometric reformulation opens a new route for analogue models potentially implementable in laboratory via tailored nonlinear metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Neutron Stars in Starobinsky Gravity with Causal Hybrid Stellar Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stellar structure of neutron stars in the framework of Starobinsky gravity, characterized by a quadratic correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action, $f(R) = R + \alpha R^2$. In order to {\em preserve causality throughout\/} the star, we adopt a two-phase hybrid construction for the stellar matter, in which the core region consists of deconfined quark matter described by the MIT bag model, while the outer layers are composed of hadronic matter represented by unified equations of state such as SLy4, BSk20, and BSk21. Within this framework, we derive the modified field equations with static spherical symmetry, and numerically integrate the corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations with the chosen hybrid equations of state. Our analyses show that, unlike in general relativity, the Ricci scalar remains nonzero outside the stellar surface, and gradually falls to zero beyond 50 km, while the stellar surface remains within 10--12 km for the hybrid equations of state considered. This extended Ricci scalar profile arises from the extra degree of freedom (scalaron) inherent in Starobinsky gravity, which also contributes to the gravitational mass outside the star, causing the ADM mass measured at infinity to exceed the stellar mass at the surface. Nevertheless, the key physical relationships, such as the mass-central density and mass-radius curves, remain consistent with what is expected physically. Notably, we find that the maximum stable mass of neutron stars increases with the Starobinsky parameter $\alpha$, with the combined MIT-BSk21 model supporting an ADM mass of up to $2.07 \, M_\odot$ for $\alpha = 10\,r_g^2$. This theoreical limit for a nonrotating neutron star suggests that a rotating configuration could reach mass thresholds in the range of $2.48$ to $2.59 \, M_\odot$, considering that rapid rotation can enhance the maximum mass by approximately 20--25\%.</description>

      <title>Powerful Radio Sources as Probes of Black Hole Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powerful jetted radio sources for which the luminosity in directed kinetic energy has been empirically determined, independent of assumptions, are considered. The total outflow lifetime of each source determined in the context of detailed cosmological studies was found to depend only upon the luminosity in directed kinetic energy ($L$). The distributions of $L$, total outflow lifetime, and total outflow energy each have a broad range of values, as do the supermassive black hole masses. The total outflow energy relative to the black hole mass is a small number with a small dispersion. Three explanations of these remarkable results are considered. This could indicate (1) the efficiencies with which black hole irreducible mass is increased and spin mass energy is extracted during the outflow event, (2) that the merger of two supermassive black holes occurs over a timescale commensurate with the independently determined outflow lifetime and that these mergers lead to the production of the low-frequency gravitational wave background, or (3) that feedback shuts off black hole accretion due to energy injected into the ambient medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching for radio pulsars orbiting around the Galactic centre black hole (BH), Sagittarius A$^\star$ (Sgr A$^\star$), represents a holy grail goal for large-area radio telescopes, in particular for the Square Kilometre Array. Follow-up timing observation of such a PSR-Sgr A$^\star$ binary system with an orbital period $\lesssim O(1\,{\rm year})$ will bring forward a handful of new tests on different aspects of fundamental physics that are barely accessible with other means. However, mass perturbation in the Galactic centre harms the gravitational cleanness of PSR-Sgr A$^\star$ systems. In order to flexibly account for perturbations, a numerical pulsar timing model is gradually being built, which can be used to probe the spacetime around Sgr A$^\star$ BH and study the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Inflation with Interacting Noises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic $\delta N$ formalism is a powerful tool to calculate the cosmological correlators non-perturbatively. However, it requires the initial data for the amplitude of the noise on the initial flat hypersurface which for a free theory during inflation is fixed to be $\frac{H}{2 \pi}$. In this work, we study the setups where the underlying theory involves interactions and the stochastic noises inherit these interactions. We extend the stochastic $\delta N$ formalism to these setups and rewrite the corresponding Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations in which the QFT corrections in the amplitude of the noises are taken into account. As an example, in the three-phase SR-USR-SR setup which is employed for PBHs formation, the modification in the amplitude of noise is calculated from the one-loop corrections in power spectrum via in-in formalism. We show that in these setups the amplitude of the stochastic noise is modified to $\frac{H}{2 \pi} \Big(1+ \frac{ \Delta {\cal P}_{\cal R} }{ {\cal P}^{(0)}_{ {\cal R} } }\Big)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ in which $ \frac{\Delta {\cal P}_{\cal R} }{ {\cal P}^{(0)}_{{\cal R} } }$ is the fractional one-loop correction in power spectrum.</description>

      <title>GW231123: a Possible Primordial Black Hole Origin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW231123, the heaviest binary black hole merger detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration to date, lies in the pair-instability mass gap and exhibits unusually high component spins. In this letter, we show that both merging black holes may have a primordial origin with smaller initial masses. The observed masses and, crucially, the spins of GW231123 are naturally accommodated within the most vanilla primordial black hole framework, once cosmological accretion is taken into account. Interestingly, the parameter space needed to explain the inferred GW231123 rate is at the edge of the exclusion region from Xray and CMB observations, suggesting that this interpretation can be either confirmed or ruled out. The upcoming O5 observing run by the collaboration should detect ${\cal O}(20)$ similar events, testing their mass-spin correlation, while next-generation detectors would be capable of observing high redshift events, as predicted in this scenario.</description>

      <title>Solutions And Gradient Of The Conformal Ricci Bourguignon Soliton On Vaidya Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive the complete and explicit solution for the conformal Ricci-Bourguignon soliton on Vaidya spacetime. We provide the closed-form expression for the vector field and establish the necessary conditions for the existence of the scalar potential, for which we also derive an explicit form. Our solution to the underlying system of linear partial differential equations proves that such solitons exist if and only if the mass function vanishes, forcing the metric to reduce to flat Minkowski spacetime (Schwarzschild, $m=0$). Synthesizing prior works, we show that the established classification of the soliton as shrinking, steady, or expanding is justified by the principles of linear stability. These findings refine the set of possible solitons within the non-linear theory of geometric flows by proving they are only admissible in the non-radiating vacuum limit, thereby enhancing the reliability of such models.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we numerically construct initial data sets for cosmological space-times with a spatial topology of $\mathbb{T}^3$, which are generally inhomogeneous. To do so, we implement a pseudo-spectral approach based on the discrete Fourier transform for numerically solving Einstein's constraint equations in an algebraic-hyperbolic form. We explore the advantages and disadvantages of this method by comparing the numerical solutions with known analytical initial data sets. Additionally, we perform an stability analysis of the system to gain deeper understanding of the problem. Finally, we numerically obtain new families of initial data sets through manipulation of the original system by imposing restrictions in some of the variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore semiclassical stellar collapse scenarios with pressure within the framework of effective loop quantum gravity. The objective of this work is to generalize existent models of semiclassical dust collapse and examine the role of pressure in the formation of shell-crossing singularities in a semiclassical context. Numerical investigations show that the shell-focusing singularity characterizing the end state of any classical stellar collapse is here resolved by quantum gravitational effects and replaced by a bounce of the star. However, they also show that shell-crossing singularities remain a general feature of these models and that the inclusion of pressure does not alter the qualitative picture emerging from semiclassical models of inhomogeneous dust collapse. Given the absence of a shell-focusing singularity and the possibility of extending spacetime in the future of the trapped region formed by gravitational collapse, the investigation of the causal structure of the spacetime describing the semiclassical collapse of a star is inevitably tied to a better understanding of the physics of these shell-crossing singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate rotating black hole solutions within a scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity framework that incorporates a squared Gauss-Bonnet term. By employing a quadratic exponential coupling function between the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, we derive both the standard General Relativity solutions and novel scalarized black hole configurations. Utilizing a pseudo spectral method to solve the coupled field equations, we examine how black hole spin and coupling constants influence the existence and properties of these solutions. Our findings reveal that both the rotation of the black hole and the squared coupling term effectively constrain the parameter space available for scalarization. Moreover, we demonstrate that, over a wide range of parameters, scalarized black holes exhibit higher entropy than Kerr black holes of equivalent mass and spin, indicating that they are thermodynamically favored. These results significantly expand the phase space of black holes in modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Optical Signatures of Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg AdS/dS Black Holes in the light of Event Horizon Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of the supermassive black holes $ M87^{*} $ and Sgr A$^{*}$ by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have sparked intensified interest in studying the optical appearance of black holes (BHs). Inspired by this, we carry out a study on the optical features of Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-Anti de Sitter/de Sitter (EEH-AdS/dS) BHs, including the trajectories of photons, shadow geometrical shape, energy emission rate, and deflection of light in this spacetime. Since, due to the nonlinear electrodynamics effects, photons propagate along null geodesics in an effective metric rather than the background metric, we first derive the effective metric of the EEH-AdS/dS BH. Then we study the null geodesics of the resulting effective metric and eventually compute the size of the EEH-AdS/dS BH shadow. To validate our results, we confront our results with the extracted information from EHT data of the supermassive BHs $ M87^{*} $ and estimate lower bounds for the shadow radius.</description>

      <title>An interstellar mission to test astrophysical black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes are the sources of the strongest gravitational fields that can be found today in the Universe and are ideal laboratories for testing Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the strong field regime. In this letter, I show that the possibility of an interstellar mission to send a small spacecraft to the nearest black hole, although very speculative and extremely challenging, is not completely unrealistic. Certainly we do not have the necessary technology today, but it may be available in the next 20-30 years. The mission may last 80-100 years, but we would be able to obtain very valuable information about black holes and General Relativity that might be difficult to obtain in other ways.</description>

      <title>Stable soliton dark matter wormhole in non-minimally coupled $f({\cal Q},{\cal T})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry can indeed help in constructing stable, traversable, wormholes (WHs) without requiring exotic matter under certain conditions. In models like $f({\cal Q},{\cal T})={\cal Q}+\beta {\cal T}$ gravity, where ${\cal Q}$ is the non-metricity scalar, and ${\cal T}$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, the coupling between matter and geometry introduces additional degrees of freedom in terms of the parameter $\beta$. These can mimic the effects of exotic matter or even replace it entirely under specific parameter choice. The analysis involves deriving WH shape functions based on two dark matter (DM) density profiles: a solitonic core at the center of DM halos, and the outer halo follows the universal Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile of cold DM (CDM). The wormhole solutions derived in these models satisfy important geometric conditions like: Flaring-out condition (necessary for traversability) and asymptotic flatness condition. For large positive coupling parameter, the null energy condition (NEC) can be satisfied at the wormhole throat, meaning exotic matter is not needed, while the wormhole is no longer Lorentzian and the flaring-out condition is broken. However, for large negative coupling parameter, the NEC can be satisfied, allowing for healthy wormholes without exotic matter, provided the coupling strength remains within certain bounds. In the latter case, the NEC is broken only effectively. We investigate the stability of the obtained wormhole solutions by virtue of a modified version of Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, which includes a new force due to matter-geometry non-minimal, showing that these wormholes can be dynamically stable.</description>

      <title>Horizon tracking for asynchronous parallel black hole simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of gravitational wave science, next-generation detectors will be substantially more accurate than the current suite of detectors. Numerical relativity simulations of binary black hole (BBH) gravitational waveforms must become faster, more efficient, and more accurate to be used in analyses of these next-generation detections. One approach, which the $\texttt{SpECTRE}$ code employs, is using spectral methods for accuracy along with asynchronous task-based parallelism to avoid idle time in simulations and make the most efficient use of computational resources. When writing an asynchronous application, algorithms must be redesigned compared to their synchronous counterparts. To illustrate this process, we present novel methods for dynamically tracking the apparent horizons in evolutions of BBH mergers using a feedback control system, all in the context of asynchronous parallelism. We also briefly detail how these methods can be applied to binary neutron star simulations performed with asynchronous parallelism.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Observatories in AdS$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional general relativity with a negative cosmological constant in the presence of a finite size boundary, $\Gamma$, for both Euclidean and Lorentzian signature. As our boundary condition, we consider the `conformal' boundary condition that fixes the conformal class of the induced metric at $\Gamma$ and the trace of the extrinsic curvature, $K(x^m)$. In Lorentzian signature, we must supplement these with appropriate initial data comprising the standard Cauchy data along a spatial slice and, in addition, initial data for a boundary mode that appears due to the presence of the finite size boundary. We perform a linearised analysis of the gravitational field equations for both an $S^2\times \mathbb{R}$ as well as a Minkowskian, $\mathbb{R}^{1,2}$, boundary. In the $S^2\times \mathbb{R}$ case, in addition to the usual AdS$_4$ normal modes, we uncover a novel linearised perturbation, $\boldsymbol{\omega}(x^m)$, which can exhibit complex frequencies at sufficiently large angular momentum. Upon moving $\Gamma$ toward the infinite asymptotic AdS$_4$ boundary, the complex frequencies appear at increasingly large angular momentum and vanish altogether in the strict limit. In the $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$ case, although we uncover an analogous novel perturbation, we show it does not exhibit complex frequencies. In Euclidean signature, we show that $K(x^m)$ plays the role of a source for $\boldsymbol{\omega}(x^m)$. When close to the AdS$_4$ asymptotic boundary, we speculate on the holographic interpretation of $\boldsymbol{\omega}(x^m)$.</description>

      <title>Gauge symmetry and partially Lagrangian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19447v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a classical field theory whose equations of motion follow from the least action principle, but the class of admissible trajectories is restricted by differential equations. The key element of the proposed construction is the complete gauge symmetry of these additional equations. The unfree variation of the trajectories reduces to the infinitesimal gauge symmetry transformation of the equations, restricting the trajectories. We explicitly derive the equations that follow from the requirement that this gauge variation of the action vanishes. The system of equations for conditional extrema is not a Lagrangian system as such, but it admits an equivalent Hamiltonian formulation with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The bracket is degenerate, in general. Alternatively, the equations restricting the dynamics could be added to the action with Lagrange multipliers with unrestricted variation of the original variables. In this case, we would arrive at the Lagrangian equations for the original variables involving Lagrange multipliers and for Lagrange multipliers themselves. In general, these two methods are not equivalent because the multipliers can bring extra degrees of freedom compared to the case of equations derived by unfree variation of the action. We illustrate the general method with two examples. The first example is a particle in a central field with varying trajectories restricted by the equation of conservation of angular momentum. The phase space acquires one more dimension, and there is an extra conserved quantity $K$ which is responsible for the precession of trajectories. The second example is linearized gravity with the Einstein-Hilbert action, and the class of varying fields is restricted by the linearized Nordstr\"om equation. This conditional extrema problem is shown to lead to the linearized Cotton gravity equations.</description>

      <title>Population Synthesis of Gravitational Wave Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of gravitational wave source populations and their progenitors is an endeavor more than eighty years in the making. This is in part due to a wide variety of theoretical uncertainties that must be taken into account when describing how stellar populations evolve over cosmic time to produce double stellar remnant binaries. Population synthesis software has been developed as a means to investigate these uncertainties under a wide variety of physical assumptions and stellar population formation environments. In this chapter we discuss the development history of population synthesis software with a special focus on work aimed at understanding the formation of gravitational wave populations. We detail the assortment of population synthesis tools in use today that simulate GW populations which are born and evolve in different astrophysical environments. We further discuss the GW population rates and features associated with each environment that have been predicted for both ground and space-based GW detectors. We finish with considerations of future work that combines possible constraints from electromagnetic surveys that may provide key findings that break current degeneracies in population synthesis predictions of GW source populations.</description>

      <title>Conservative Dynamics of Relativistic Binaries Beyond Einstein Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the conservative dynamics of spinless compact objects in a general effective theory of gravity which includes a metric and an arbitrary number of scalar fields, through $\mathcal{O}(G^{3})$. Departures from Einstein gravity, which preserve general coordinate and local Lorentz invariance, are characterized by higher-derivative terms in a Lagrangian whose coupling constants scale as powers of a ``new-physics'' length scale, $\ell$. For a purely metric theory we compute the contributions from the the leading and subleading higher-curvature curvature corrections. In four dimensions these are cubic and quartic curvature terms, i.e. orders $\ell^4$ and $\ell^6$. We also study a general multi-scalar-tensor theory of gravity to order $\ell^{4}$, which includes both Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) and dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) higher-order couplings. Specifically, we compute the radial action in a post-Minkowskian approximation for scattering orbits, to two-loop order. The result encodes the fully relativistic dynamics of the compact objects, and serves as a generating function for gauge-invariant orbital observables for both bound and unbound binary systems. Where overlapping post-Newtonian results are available, we've verified agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons, predicted in scenarios beyond the Standard Model and viable dark matter (DM) candidates, can form superradiant clouds around spinning black holes influencing their dynamics. Using century-long monitored OJ287 supermassive black hole binary we set first DM-independent, dynamical constraints on their masses $\mu = (8.5-22) \times 10^{-22}$ eV. These dynamical constraints, driven by boson cloud friction, are robust against DM-model uncertainties and offer a novel ultralight boson probe. We show that analogous superradiant dynamics across the cosmic population of supermassive black hole systems could help resolve final-parsec evolution stalling problem and imprint a detectable suppression and break in the gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Bimetric gravity improves the fit to DESI BAO and eases the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the latest combination of DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (Planck 2018 + ACT), and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) compilations (Pantheon+, Union3, and DES Y5) favor a dynamical dark energy component, and explore if such a scenario can simultaneously help resolve the Hubble tension. We contrast two frameworks: the widely used phenomenological $w_0 w_a$CDM model, and bimetric gravity, a fundamental modification of general relativity that naturally gives rise to phantom dark energy. The $w_0 w_a$CDM model is moderately preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, at the $2$-$4 \, \sigma$ level, when fitting DESI DR2 + CMB + SNe Ia, but it exacerbates the Hubble tension. By comparison, bimetric gravity provides a modest improvement in fit quality, at the $1 \, \sigma$ level, but, by inferring $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 0.4 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, it partially eases the Hubble tension, from a $5 \,\sigma$ discrepancy to a $3.7 \, \sigma$ tension. Including locally calibrated SNe Ia brings the overall preference for the bimetric model over $\Lambda$CDM to the $2 \, \sigma$ level, comparable to that of the $w_0 w_a$CDM model when including the local SN Ia calibration.</description>

      <title>The Chiral Limit of Fully Nonlinear Minimal Massive Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study 3D Anti de Sitter Minimal Massive Gravity in two regimes: a) at the chiral limit where one of the boundary Brown-Henneaux central charges vanishes and two modes become null and b) in the regime that one of the two charges is much larger than the other. At the chiral point, we go beyond the known free-theory analysis to prove that these modes decouple completely also in the full MMG Lagrangian and field equations. We also use the full action to ascertain if the interacting theory becomes infinitely strongly coupled in the neighborhood of the chiral limit, where the theory is anyway not unitary. We show that this is not the case at tree level but that a strong coupling pathology appears in loops, starting at a loop level determined by the number of external legs in the bulk Feynman diagrams. Finally, we show that there is no strong coupling problem in the second regime where, instead, the two boundary fields and the field propagating in the bulk decouple from one another.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a consistent three-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory as a vector-tensor theory within the generalized Proca class by employing a regularization procedure based on the Weyl geometry, which was introduced recently in arXiv:2504.13084. We then obtain an asymptotically AdS$_3$, static, and circularly symmetric black hole solution with primary Proca hair. Afterwards, we investigate the effect of the scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet coupling constructed previously by different regularization schemes. We further generalize these solutions by incorporating an electric charge. As special cases, we find a regular black hole solution in addition to charged and uncharged stealth BTZ black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Embedding Signature-Changing Manifolds: A Braneworld and Kaluza-Klein Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of semi-Riemannian manifolds characterized by smooth metric signature changes with a transverse radical, This class includes spacetimes relevant to cosmological models such as the Hartle-Hawking "no boundary" proposal, where a Riemannian manifold transitions smoothly into a Lorentzian spacetime without boundaries or singularities. For this class, we prove the existence of global isometric embeddings into higher-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spaces. We then strengthen this result by demonstrating that a specific type of global isometric embedding, which we term an $\mathcal{H}$-global embedding, also exists into both Minkowski space and Misner space. For the canonical $n$-dimensional signature-changing model, we explicitly construct a full global isometric embedding into $(n+1)$-dimensional Minkowski and Misner spaces, a significantly stronger result than an $\mathcal{H}$-global embedding for this specific case. This embedding framework provides new geometric tools for studying signature change and braneworlds through the geometry of submanifolds embedded in a bulk, thus presenting a mathematically well-defined approach to these phenomena.</description>
