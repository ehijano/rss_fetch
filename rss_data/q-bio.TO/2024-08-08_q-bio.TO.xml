      <title>Resolving the kinetics of an ensemble of muscle myosin motors via a temperature-dependent fitting procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A data fitting procedure is devised and thoroughly tested to provide self-consistent estimates of the relevant mechanokinetic parameters involved in a plausible scheme underpinning the output of an ensemble of myosin II molecular motors mimicking the muscle contraction. The method builds on a stochastic model accounting for the force exerted by the motor ensemble operated both in the low and high force-generating regimes corresponding to different temperature ranges. The proposed interpretative framework is successfully challenged against simulated data, meant to mimic the experimental output of a unidimensional synthetic nanomachine powered by pure muscle myosin isoforms.</description>

      <title>Mechanics of poking a cyst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indentation tests are classical tools to determine material properties. For biological samples such as cysts of cells, however, the observed force-displacement relation cannot be expected to follow predictions for simple materials. Here, by solving the Pogorelov problem of a point force indenting an elastic shell for a purely nonlinear material, we discover that complex material behaviour can even give rise to new scaling exponents in this force-displacement relation. In finite-element simulations, we show that these exponents are surprisingly robust, persisting even for thick shells indented with a sphere. By scaling arguments, we generalise our results to pressurised and pre-stressed shells, uncovering additional new scaling exponents. We find these predicted scaling exponents in the force-displacement relation observed in cyst indentation experiments. Our results thus form the basis for inferring the mechanisms that set the mechanical properties of these biological materials.</description>

      <title>Computational modelling of bone growth and mineralization surrounding biodegradable Mg-based and permanent Ti implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In silico testing of implant materials is a research area of high interest, as cost- and labour-intensive experiments may be omitted. However, assessing the tissue-material interaction mathematically and computationally can be very complex, in particular when functional, such as biodegradable, implant materials are investigated. In this work, we expand and refine suitable existing mathematical models of bone growth and magnesium-based implant degradation based on ordinary differential equations. We show that we can simulate the implant degradation, as well as the osseointegration in terms of relative bone volume fraction and changes in bone ultrastructure when applying the model to experimental data from titanium and magnesium-gadolinium implants for healing times up to 32 weeks. By conducting a parameter study we further show that a lack of data at early time points has little influence on the simulation outcome. Moreover, we show that the model is predictive in terms of relative bone volume fraction with mean absolute errors below 6%</description>

      <title>GP-VLS: A general-purpose vision language model for surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surgery requires comprehensive medical knowledge, visual assessment skills, and procedural expertise. While recent surgical AI models have focused on solving task-specific problems, there is a need for general-purpose systems that can understand surgical scenes and interact through natural language. This paper introduces GP-VLS, a general-purpose vision language model for surgery that integrates medical and surgical knowledge with visual scene understanding. For comprehensively evaluating general-purpose surgical models, we propose SurgiQual, which evaluates across medical and surgical knowledge benchmarks as well as surgical vision-language questions. To train GP-VLS, we develop six new datasets spanning medical knowledge, surgical textbooks, and vision-language pairs for tasks like phase recognition and tool identification. We show that GP-VLS significantly outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on surgical vision-language tasks, with 8-21% improvements in accuracy across SurgiQual benchmarks. GP-VLS also demonstrates strong performance on medical and surgical knowledge tests compared to open-source alternatives. Overall, GP-VLS provides an open-source foundation for developing AI assistants to support surgeons across a wide range of tasks and scenarios. The code and data for this work is publicly available at gpvls-surgery-vlm.github.io.</description>
