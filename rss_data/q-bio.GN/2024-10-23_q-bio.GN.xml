      <title>Hierarchical Classification for Predicting Metastasis Using Elastic-Net Regularization on Gene Expression Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastasis is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality and remains challenging to detect during early stages. Accurate identification of cancers likely to metastasize can improve treatment strategies and patient outcomes. This study leverages publicly available gene expression profiles from primary cancers, with and without distal metastasis, to build predictive models. We utilize elastic net regularization within a hierarchical classification framework to predict both the tissue of origin and the metastasis status of primary tumors. Our elastic net-based hierarchical classification achieved a tissue-of-origin prediction accuracy of 97%, and a metastasis prediction accuracy of 90%. Notably, mitochondrial gene expression exhibited significant negative correlations with metastasis, providing potential biological insights into the underlying mechanisms of cancer progression.</description>

      <title>DNAHLM -- DNA sequence and Human Language mixed large language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are already many DNA large language models, but most of them still follow traditional uses, such as extracting sequence features for classification tasks. More innovative applications of large language models, such as prompt engineering, RAG, and zero-shot or few-shot prediction, remain challenging for DNA-based models. The key issue lies in the fact that DNA models and human natural language models are entirely separate; however, techniques like prompt engineering require the use of natural language, thereby significantly limiting the application of DNA large language models. This paper introduces a hybrid model trained on the GPT-2 network, combining DNA sequences and English text to explore the potential of using prompts and fine-tuning in DNA models. The model has demonstrated its effectiveness in DNA related zero-shot prediction and multitask application.</description>

      <title>AskBeacon -- Performing genomic data exchange and analytics with natural language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16700v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabling clinicians and researchers to directly interact with global genomic data resources by removing technological barriers is vital for medical genomics. AskBeacon enables Large Language Models to be applied to securely shared cohorts via the GA4GH Beacon protocol. By simply "asking" Beacon, actionable insights can be gained, analyzed and made publication-ready.</description>

      <title>Expected Density of Random Minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimizer schemes, or just minimizers, are a very important computational primitive in sampling and sketching biological strings. Assuming a fixed alphabet of size $\sigma$, a minimizer is defined by two integers $k,w\ge2$ and a total order $\rho$ on strings of length $k$ (also called $k$-mers). A string is processed by a sliding window algorithm that chooses, in each window of length $w+k-1$, its minimal $k$-mer with respect to $\rho$. A key characteristic of the minimizer is the expected density of chosen $k$-mers among all $k$-mers in a random infinite $\sigma$-ary string. Random minimizers, in which the order $\rho$ is chosen uniformly at random, are often used in applications. However, little is known about their expected density $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$ besides the fact that it is close to $\frac{2}{w+1}$ unless $w\gg k$.
  We first show that $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$ can be computed in $O(k\sigma^{k+w})$ time. Then we attend to the case $w\le k$ and present a formula that allows one to compute $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$ in just $O(w^2)$ time. Further, we describe the behaviour of $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$ in this case, establishing the connection between $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$, $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k+1,w)$, and $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w+1)$. In particular, we show that $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)&lt;\frac{2}{w+1}$ (by a tiny margin) unless $w$ is small. We conclude with some partial results and conjectures for the case $w&gt;k$.</description>

      <title>DNABERT-S: Pioneering Species Differentiation with Species-Aware DNA Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce DNABERT-S, a tailored genome model that develops species-aware embeddings to naturally cluster and segregate DNA sequences of different species in the embedding space. Differentiating species from genomic sequences (i.e., DNA and RNA) is vital yet challenging, since many real-world species remain uncharacterized, lacking known genomes for reference. Embedding-based methods are therefore used to differentiate species in an unsupervised manner. DNABERT-S builds upon a pre-trained genome foundation model named DNABERT-2. To encourage effective embeddings to error-prone long-read DNA sequences, we introduce Manifold Instance Mixup (MI-Mix), a contrastive objective that mixes the hidden representations of DNA sequences at randomly selected layers and trains the model to recognize and differentiate these mixed proportions at the output layer. We further enhance it with the proposed Curriculum Contrastive Learning (C$^2$LR) strategy. Empirical results on 23 diverse datasets show DNABERT-S's effectiveness, especially in realistic label-scarce scenarios. For example, it identifies twice more species from a mixture of unlabeled genomic sequences, doubles the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) in species clustering, and outperforms the top baseline's performance in 10-shot species classification with just a 2-shot training. Model, codes, and data are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/MAGICS-LAB/DNABERT_S}.</description>

      <title>Cross-modality Matching and Prediction of Perturbation Responses with Labeled Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is now possible to conduct large scale perturbation screens with complex readout modalities, such as different molecular profiles or high content cell images. While these open the way for systematic dissection of causal cell circuits, integrated such data across screens to maximize our ability to predict circuits poses substantial computational challenges, which have not been addressed. Here, we extend two Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport methods to incorporate the perturbation label for cross-modality alignment. The obtained alignment is then employed to train a predictive model that estimates cellular responses to perturbations observed with only one measurement modality. We validate our method for the tasks of cross-modality alignment and cross-modality prediction in a recent multi-modal single-cell perturbation dataset. Our approach opens the way to unified causal models of cell biology.</description>
