      <title>Analog In-Memory Computing with Uncertainty Quantification for Efficient Edge-based Medical Imaging Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the role of the emerging Analog In-memory computing (AIMC) paradigm in enabling Medical AI analysis and improving the certainty of these models at the edge. It contrasts AIMC's efficiency with traditional digital computing's limitations in power, speed, and scalability. Our comprehensive evaluation focuses on brain tumor analysis, spleen segmentation, and nuclei detection. The study highlights the superior robustness of isotropic architectures, which exhibit a minimal accuracy drop (0.04) in analog-aware training, compared to significant drops (up to 0.15) in pyramidal structures. Additionally, the paper emphasizes IMC's effective data pipelining, reducing latency and increasing throughput as well as the exploitation of inherent noise within AIMC, strategically harnessed to augment model certainty.</description>

      <title>FocusMAE: Gallbladder Cancer Detection from Ultrasound Videos with Focused Masked Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, automated Gallbladder Cancer (GBC) detection has gained the attention of researchers. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methodologies relying on ultrasound sonography (US) images exhibit limited generalization, emphasizing the need for transformative approaches. We observe that individual US frames may lack sufficient information to capture disease manifestation. This study advocates for a paradigm shift towards video-based GBC detection, leveraging the inherent advantages of spatiotemporal representations. Employing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) for representation learning, we address shortcomings in conventional image-based methods. We propose a novel design called FocusMAE to systematically bias the selection of masking tokens from high-information regions, fostering a more refined representation of malignancy. Additionally, we contribute the most extensive US video dataset for GBC detection. We also note that, this is the first study on US video-based GBC detection. We validate the proposed methods on the curated dataset, and report a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy of 96.4% for the GBC detection problem, against an accuracy of 84% by current Image-based SOTA - GBCNet, and RadFormer, and 94.7% by Video-based SOTA - AdaMAE. We further demonstrate the generality of the proposed FocusMAE on a public CT-based Covid detection dataset, reporting an improvement in accuracy by 3.3% over current baselines. The source code and pretrained models are available at: https://github.com/sbasu276/FocusMAE.</description>

      <title>Robust COVID-19 Detection in CT Images with CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of medical imaging, particularly for COVID-19 detection, deep learning models face substantial challenges such as the necessity for extensive computational resources, the paucity of well-annotated datasets, and a significant amount of unlabeled data. In this work, we introduce the first lightweight detector designed to overcome these obstacles, leveraging a frozen CLIP image encoder and a trainable multilayer perception (MLP). Enhanced with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for robustness and a loss landscape flattening strategy for improved generalization, our model is tailored for high efficacy in COVID-19 detection. Furthermore, we integrate a teacher-student framework to capitalize on the vast amounts of unlabeled data, enabling our model to achieve superior performance despite the inherent data limitations. Experimental results on the COV19-CT-DB dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing baseline by up to 10.6% in `macro' F1 score in supervised learning. The code is available at https://github.com/Purdue-M2/COVID-19_Detection_M2_PURDUE.</description>

      <title>7T MRI Synthesization from 3T Acquisitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised deep learning techniques can be used to generate synthetic 7T MRIs from 3T MRI inputs. This image enhancement process leverages the advantages of ultra-high-field MRI to improve the signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios of 3T acquisitions. In this paper, we introduce multiple novel 7T synthesization algorithms based on custom-designed variants of the V-Net convolutional neural network. We demonstrate that the V-Net based model has superior performance in enhancing both single-site and multi-site MRI datasets compared to the existing benchmark model. When trained on 3T-7T MRI pairs from 8 subjects with mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), our model achieves state-of-the-art 7T synthesization performance. Compared to previous works, synthetic 7T images generated from our pipeline also display superior enhancement of pathological tissue. Additionally, we implement and test a data augmentation scheme for training models that are robust to variations in the input distribution. This allows synthetic 7T models to accommodate intra-scanner and inter-scanner variability in multisite datasets. On a harmonized dataset consisting of 18 3T-7T MRI pairs from two institutions, including both healthy subjects and those with mild TBI, our model maintains its performance and can generalize to 3T MRI inputs with lower resolution. Our findings demonstrate the promise of V-Net based models for MRI enhancement and offer a preliminary probe into improving the generalizability of synthetic 7T models with data augmentation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new dataset in the medical field of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), called TBI-IT, which includes both electronic medical records (EMRs) and head CT images. This dataset is designed to enhance the accuracy of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and treatment of TBI. This dataset, built upon the foundation of standard text and image data, incorporates specific annotations within the EMRs, extracting key content from the text information, and categorizes the annotation content of imaging data into five types: brain midline, hematoma, left cerebral ventricle, right cerebral ventricle and fracture. TBI-IT aims to be a foundational dataset for feature learning in image segmentation tasks and named entity recognition.</description>

      <title>Deep unfolding Network for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution with Automatic Exposure Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of high spatial resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) and low spatial resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) has been recognized as an effective method for HSI super-resolution (HSI-SR). However, both HSI and MSI may be acquired under extreme conditions such as night or poorly illuminating scenarios, which may cause different exposure levels, thereby seriously downgrading the yielded HSISR. In contrast to most existing methods based on respective low-light enhancements (LLIE) of MSI and HSI followed by their fusion, a deep Unfolding HSI Super-Resolution with Automatic Exposure Correction (UHSR-AEC) is proposed, that can effectively generate a high-quality fused HSI-SR (in texture and features) even under very imbalanced exposures, thanks to the correlation between LLIE and HSI-SR taken into account. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the state-of-the-art overall performance of the proposed UHSR-AEC, including comparison with some benchmark peer methods.</description>

      <title>Randomized Principal Component Analysis for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-dimensional feature space of the hyperspectral imagery poses major challenges to the processing and analysis of the hyperspectral data sets. In such a case, dimensionality reduction is necessary to decrease the computational complexity. The random projections open up new ways of dimensionality reduction, especially for large data sets. In this paper, the principal component analysis (PCA) and randomized principal component analysis (R-PCA) for the classification of hyperspectral images using support vector machines (SVM) and light gradient boosting machines (LightGBM) have been investigated. In this experimental research, the number of features was reduced to 20 and 30 for classification of two hyperspectral datasets (Indian Pines and Pavia University). The experimental results demonstrated that PCA outperformed R-PCA for SVM for both datasets, but received close accuracy values for LightGBM. The highest classification accuracies were obtained as 0.9925 and 0.9639 by LightGBM with original features for the Pavia University and Indian Pines, respectively.</description>

      <title>Biophysics Informed Pathological Regularisation for Brain Tumour Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved brain tumour segmentation techniques; however, the results still lack confidence and robustness as they solely consider image data without biophysical priors or pathological information. Integrating biophysics-informed regularisation is one effective way to change this situation, as it provides an prior regularisation for automated end-to-end learning. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that designs brain tumour growth Partial Differential Equation (PDE) models as a regularisation with deep learning, operational with any network model. Our method introduces tumour growth PDE models directly into the segmentation process, improving accuracy and robustness, especially in data-scarce scenarios. This system estimates tumour cell density using a periodic activation function. By effectively integrating this estimation with biophysical models, we achieve a better capture of tumour characteristics. This approach not only aligns the segmentation closer to actual biological behaviour but also strengthens the model's performance under limited data conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive experiments on the BraTS 2023 dataset, showcasing significant improvements in both precision and reliability of tumour segmentation.</description>

      <title>VM-UNET-V2 Rethinking Vision Mamba UNet for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of medical image segmentation, models based on both CNN and Transformer have been thoroughly investigated. However, CNNs have limited modeling capabilities for long-range dependencies, making it challenging to exploit the semantic information within images fully. On the other hand, the quadratic computational complexity poses a challenge for Transformers. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have been recognized as a promising method. They not only demonstrate superior performance in modeling long-range interactions, but also preserve a linear computational complexity. Inspired by the Mamba architecture, We proposed Vison Mamba-UNetV2, the Visual State Space (VSS) Block is introduced to capture extensive contextual information, the Semantics and Detail Infusion (SDI) is introduced to augment the infusion of low-level and high-level features. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the ISIC17, ISIC18, CVC-300, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir, CVC-ColonDB and ETIS-LaribPolypDB public datasets. The results indicate that VM-UNetV2 exhibits competitive performance in medical image segmentation tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/nobodyplayer1/VM-UNetV2.</description>

      <title>XReal: Realistic Anatomy and Pathology-Aware X-ray Generation via Controllable Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale generative models have demonstrated impressive capacity in producing visually compelling images, with increasing applications in medical imaging. However, they continue to grapple with the challenge of image hallucination and the generation of anatomically inaccurate outputs. These limitations are mainly due to the sole reliance on textual inputs and lack of spatial control over the generated images, hindering the potential usefulness of such models in real-life settings. We present XReal, a novel controllable diffusion model for generating realistic chest X-ray images through precise anatomy and pathology location control. Our lightweight method can seamlessly integrate spatial control in a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model without fine-tuning, retaining its existing knowledge while enhancing its generation capabilities. XReal outperforms state-of-the-art x-ray diffusion models in quantitative and qualitative metrics while showing 13% and 10% anatomy and pathology realism gain, respectively, based on the expert radiologist evaluation. Our model holds promise for advancing generative models in medical imaging, offering greater precision and adaptability while inviting further exploration in this evolving field. A large synthetically generated data with annotations and code is publicly available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/XReal.</description>

      <title>A Modified da Vinci Surgical Instrument for OCE based Elasticity Estimation with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery has advantages compared to conventional laparoscopic procedures, e.g., precise movement of the surgical instruments, improved dexterity, and high-resolution visualization of the surgical field. However, mechanical tissue properties may provide additional information, e.g., on the location of lesions or vessels. While elastographic imaging has been proposed, it is not readily available as an online modality during robot-assisted surgery. We propose modifying a da~Vinci surgical instrument to realize optical coherence elastography (OCE) for quantitative elasticity estimation. The modified da~Vinci instrument is equipped with piezoelectric elements for shear wave excitation and we employ fast optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to track propagating wave fields, which are directly related to biomechanical tissue properties. All high-voltage components are mounted at the proximal end outside the patient. We demonstrate that external excitation at the instrument shaft can effectively stimulate shear waves, even when considering damping. Comparing conventional and deep learning-based signal processing, resulting in mean absolute errors of 19.27 kPa and 6.29 kPa, respectively. These results illustrate that precise quantitative elasticity estimates can be obtained. We also demonstrate quantitative elasticity estimation on ex-vivo tissue samples of heart, liver and stomach, and show that the measurements can be used to distinguish soft and stiff tissue types.</description>

      <title>Advanced Tumor Segmentation in Medical Imaging: An Ensemble Approach for BraTS 2023 Adult Glioma and Pediatric Tumor Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated segmentation proves to be a valuable tool in precisely detecting tumors within medical images. The accurate identification and segmentation of tumor types hold paramount importance in diagnosing, monitoring, and treating highly fatal brain tumors. The BraTS challenge serves as a platform for researchers to tackle this issue by participating in open challenges focused on tumor segmentation. This study outlines our methodology for segmenting tumors in the context of two distinct tasks from the BraTS 2023 challenge: Adult Glioma and Pediatric Tumors. Our approach leverages two encoder-decoder-based CNN models, namely SegResNet and MedNeXt, for segmenting three distinct subregions of tumors. We further introduce a set of robust postprocessing to improve the segmentation, especially for the newly introduced BraTS 2023 metrics. The specifics of our approach and comprehensive performance analyses are expounded upon in this work. Our proposed approach achieves third place in the BraTS 2023 Adult Glioma Segmentation Challenges with an average of 0.8313 and 36.38 Dice and HD95 scores on the test set, respectively.</description>

      <title>StainFuser: Controlling Diffusion for Faster Neural Style Transfer in Multi-Gigapixel Histology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stain normalization algorithms aim to transform the color and intensity characteristics of a source multi-gigapixel histology image to match those of a target image, mitigating inconsistencies in the appearance of stains used to highlight cellular components in the images. We propose a new approach, StainFuser, which treats this problem as a style transfer task using a novel Conditional Latent Diffusion architecture, eliminating the need for handcrafted color components. With this method, we curate SPI-2M the largest stain normalization dataset to date of over 2 million histology images with neural style transfer for high-quality transformations. Trained on this data, StainFuser outperforms current state-of-the-art GAN and handcrafted methods in terms of the quality of normalized images. Additionally, compared to existing approaches, it improves the performance of nuclei instance segmentation and classification models when used as a test time augmentation method on the challenging CoNIC dataset. Finally, we apply StainFuser on multi-gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and demonstrate improved performance in terms of computational efficiency, image quality and consistency across tiles over current methods.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Data Consistency Induced Discrepancy in Cascaded Diffusion Models for Sparse-view CT Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse-view Computed Tomography (CT) image reconstruction is a promising approach to reduce radiation exposure, but it inevitably leads to image degradation. Although diffusion model-based approaches are computationally expensive and suffer from the training-sampling discrepancy, they provide a potential solution to the problem. This study introduces a novel Cascaded Diffusion with Discrepancy Mitigation (CDDM) framework, including the low-quality image generation in latent space and the high-quality image generation in pixel space which contains data consistency and discrepancy mitigation in a one-step reconstruction process. The cascaded framework minimizes computational costs by moving some inference steps from pixel space to latent space. The discrepancy mitigation technique addresses the training-sampling gap induced by data consistency, ensuring the data distribution is close to the original manifold. A specialized Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is employed to process image gradients in separate directions, offering a more targeted approach to regularization. Experimental results across two datasets demonstrate CDDM's superior performance in high-quality image generation with clearer boundaries compared to existing methods, highlighting the framework's computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Event-based Asynchronous HDR Imaging by Temporal Incident Light Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Range (DR) is a pivotal characteristic of imaging systems. Current frame-based cameras struggle to achieve high dynamic range imaging due to the conflict between globally uniform exposure and spatially variant scene illumination. In this paper, we propose AsynHDR, a Pixel-Asynchronous HDR imaging system, based on key insights into the challenges in HDR imaging and the unique event-generating mechanism of Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS). Our proposed AsynHDR system integrates the DVS with a set of LCD panels. The LCD panels modulate the irradiance incident upon the DVS by altering their transparency, thereby triggering the pixel-independent event streams. The HDR image is subsequently decoded from the event streams through our temporal-weighted algorithm. Experiments under standard test platform and several challenging scenes have verified the feasibility of the system in HDR imaging task.</description>

      <title>Region-based U-net for accelerated training and enhanced precision in deep brain segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation of brain structures on MRI is the primary step for further quantitative analysis of brain diseases. Manual segmentation is still considered the gold standard in terms of accuracy; however, such data is extremely time-consuming to generate. This paper presents a deep learning-based segmentation approach for 12 deep-brain structures, utilizing multiple region-based U-Nets. The brain is divided into three focal regions of interest that encompass the brainstem, the ventricular system, and the striatum. Next, three region-based U-nets are run in parallel to parcellate these larger structures into their respective four substructures. This approach not only greatly reduces the training and processing times but also significantly enhances the segmentation accuracy, compared to segmenting the entire MRI image at once. Our approach achieves remarkable accuracy with an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.901 and 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 1.155 mm. The method was compared with state-of-the-art segmentation approaches, demonstrating a high level of accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Faster Projected GAN: Towards Faster Few-Shot Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to solve the problems of long training time, large consumption of computing resources and huge parameter amount of GAN network in image generation, this paper proposes an improved GAN network model, which is named Faster Projected GAN, based on Projected GAN. The proposed network is mainly focuses on the improvement of generator of Projected GAN. By introducing depth separable convolution (DSC), the number of parameters of the Projected GAN is reduced, the training speed is accelerated, and memory is saved. Experimental results show that on ffhq-1k, art-painting, Landscape and other few-shot image datasets, a 20% speed increase and a 15% memory saving are achieved. At the same time, FID loss is less or no loss, and the amount of model parameters is better controlled. At the same time, significant training speed improvement has been achieved in the small sample image generation task of special scenes such as earthquake scenes with few public datasets.</description>

      <title>D-YOLO a robust framework for object detection in adverse weather conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adverse weather conditions including haze, snow and rain lead to decline in image qualities, which often causes a decline in performance for deep-learning based detection networks. Most existing approaches attempts to rectify hazy images before performing object detection, which increases the complexity of the network and may result in the loss in latent information. To better integrate image restoration and object detection tasks, we designed a double-route network with an attention feature fusion module, taking both hazy and dehazed features into consideration. We also proposed a subnetwork to provide haze-free features to the detection network. Specifically, our D-YOLO improves the performance of the detection network by minimizing the distance between the clear feature extraction subnetwork and detection network. Experiments on RTTS and FoggyCityscapes datasets show that D-YOLO demonstrates better performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. It is a robust detection framework for bridging the gap between low-level dehazing and high-level detection.</description>

      <title>Perspective-Equivariant Imaging: an Unsupervised Framework for Multispectral Pansharpening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ill-posed image reconstruction problems appear in many scenarios such as remote sensing, where obtaining high quality images is crucial for environmental monitoring, disaster management and urban planning. Deep learning has seen great success in overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. However, these inverse problems rarely come with ground truth data, highlighting the importance of unsupervised learning from partial and noisy measurements alone. We propose perspective-equivariant imaging (EI), a framework that leverages perspective variability in optical camera-based imaging systems, such as satellites or handheld cameras, to recover information lost in ill-posed optical camera imaging problems. This extends previous EI work to include a much richer non-linear class of group transforms and is shown to be an excellent prior for satellite and urban image data, where perspective-EI achieves state-of-the-art results in multispectral pansharpening, outperforming other unsupervised methods in the literature.

      <title>Cloud gap-filling with deep learning for improved grassland monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uninterrupted optical image time series are crucial for the timely monitoring of agricultural land changes. However, the continuity of such time series is often disrupted by clouds. In response to this challenge, we propose a deep learning method that integrates cloud-free optical (Sentinel-2) observations and weather-independent (Sentinel-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, using a combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture to generate continuous Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. We emphasize the significance of observation continuity by assessing the impact of the generated time series on the detection of grassland mowing events. We focus on Lithuania, a country characterized by extensive cloud coverage, and compare our approach with alternative interpolation techniques (i.e., linear, Akima, quadratic). Our method surpasses these techniques, with an average MAE of 0.024 and R^2 of 0.92. It not only improves the accuracy of event detection tasks by employing a continuous time series, but also effectively filters out sudden shifts and noise originating from cloudy observations that cloud masks often fail to detect.</description>

      <title>EGIC: Enhanced Low-Bit-Rate Generative Image Compression Guided by Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce EGIC, an enhanced generative image compression method that allows traversing the distortion-perception curve efficiently from a single model. EGIC is based on two novel building blocks: i) OASIS-C, a conditional pre-trained semantic segmentation-guided discriminator, which provides both spatially and semantically-aware gradient feedback to the generator, conditioned on the latent image distribution, and ii) Output Residual Prediction (ORP), a retrofit solution for multi-realism image compression that allows control over the synthesis process by adjusting the impact of the residual between an MSE-optimized and GAN-optimized decoder output on the GAN-based reconstruction. Together, EGIC forms a powerful codec, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion and GAN-based methods (e.g., HiFiC, MS-ILLM, and DIRAC-100), while performing almost on par with VTM-20.0 on the distortion end. EGIC is simple to implement, very lightweight, and provides excellent interpolation characteristics, which makes it a promising candidate for practical applications targeting the low bit range.</description>

      <title>IBVC: Interpolation-driven B-frame Video Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learned B-frame video compression aims to adopt bi-directional motion estimation and motion compensation (MEMC) coding for middle frame reconstruction. However, previous learned approaches often directly extend neural P-frame codecs to B-frame relying on bi-directional optical-flow estimation or video frame interpolation. They suffer from inaccurate quantized motions and inefficient motion compensation. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective structure called Interpolation-driven B-frame Video Compression (IBVC). Our approach only involves two major operations: video frame interpolation and artifact reduction compression. IBVC introduces a bit-rate free MEMC based on interpolation, which avoids optical-flow quantization and additional compression distortions. Later, to reduce duplicate bit-rate consumption and focus on unaligned artifacts, a residual guided masking encoder is deployed to adaptively select the meaningful contexts with interpolated multi-scale dependencies. In addition, a conditional spatio-temporal decoder is proposed to eliminate location errors and artifacts instead of using MEMC coding in other methods. The experimental results on B-frame coding demonstrate that IBVC has significant improvements compared to the relevant state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, our approach can save bit rates compared with the random access (RA) configuration of H.266 (VTM). The code will be available at https://github.com/ruhig6/IBVC.</description>

      <title>Brain decoding: toward real-time reconstruction of visual perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past five years, the use of generative and foundational AI systems has greatly improved the decoding of brain activity. Visual perception, in particular, can now be decoded from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) with remarkable fidelity. This neuroimaging technique, however, suffers from a limited temporal resolution ($\approx$0.5 Hz) and thus fundamentally constrains its real-time usage. Here, we propose an alternative approach based on magnetoencephalography (MEG), a neuroimaging device capable of measuring brain activity with high temporal resolution ($\approx$5,000 Hz). For this, we develop an MEG decoding model trained with both contrastive and regression objectives and consisting of three modules: i) pretrained embeddings obtained from the image, ii) an MEG module trained end-to-end and iii) a pretrained image generator. Our results are threefold: Firstly, our MEG decoder shows a 7X improvement of image-retrieval over classic linear decoders. Second, late brain responses to images are best decoded with DINOv2, a recent foundational image model. Third, image retrievals and generations both suggest that high-level visual features can be decoded from MEG signals, although the same approach applied to 7T fMRI also recovers better low-level features. Overall, these results, while preliminary, provide an important step towards the decoding -- in real-time -- of the visual processes continuously unfolding within the human brain.</description>

Abstract: Nailfold capillaroscopy is widely used in assessing health conditions, highlighting the pressing need for an automated nailfold capillary analysis system. In this study, we present a pioneering effort in constructing a comprehensive nailfold capillary dataset-321 images, 219 videos from 68 subjects, with clinic reports and expert annotations-that serves as a crucial resource for training deep-learning models. Leveraging this dataset, we finetuned three deep learning models with expert annotations as supervised labels and integrated them into a novel end-to-end nailfold capillary analysis pipeline. This pipeline excels in automatically detecting and measuring a wide range of size factors, morphological features, and dynamic aspects of nailfold capillaries. We compared our outcomes with clinical reports. Experiment results showed that our automated pipeline achieves an average of sub-pixel level precision in measurements and 89.9% accuracy in identifying morphological abnormalities. These results underscore its potential for advancing quantitative medical research and enabling pervasive computing in healthcare. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/THU-CS-PI-LAB/ANFC-Automated-Nailfold-Capillary.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Regularization on Magnitude with Deep Priors for 3D Near-Field MIMO Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-field radar imaging systems are used in a wide range of applications such as concealed weapon detection and medical diagnosis. In this paper, we consider the problem of reconstructing the three-dimensional (3D) complex-valued reflectivity distribution of the near-field scene by enforcing regularization on its magnitude. We solve this inverse problem by using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. For this, we provide a general expression for the proximal mapping associated with such regularization functionals. This equivalently corresponds to the solution of a complex-valued denoising problem which involves regularization on the magnitude. By utilizing this expression, we develop a novel and efficient plug-and-play (PnP) reconstruction method that consists of simple update steps. Due to the success of data-adaptive deep priors in imaging, we also train a 3D deep denoiser to exploit within the developed PnP framework. The effectiveness of the developed approach is demonstrated for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) imaging under various compressive and noisy observation scenarios using both simulated and experimental data. The performance is also compared with the commonly used direct inversion and sparsity-based reconstruction approaches. The results demonstrate that the developed technique not only provides state-of-the-art performance for 3D real-world targets, but also enables fast computation. Our approach provides a unified general framework to effectively handle arbitrary regularization on the magnitude of a complex-valued unknown and is equally applicable to other radar image formation problems (including SAR).</description>

      <title>GaussianImage: 1000 FPS Image Representation and Compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) recently achieved great success in image representation and compression, offering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds with 10-1000 FPS, assuming sufficient GPU resources are available. However, this requirement often hinders their use on low-end devices with limited memory. In response, we propose a groundbreaking paradigm of image representation and compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting, named GaussianImage. We first introduce 2D Gaussian to represent the image, where each Gaussian has 8 parameters including position, covariance and color. Subsequently, we unveil a novel rendering algorithm based on accumulated summation. Remarkably, our method with a minimum of 3$\times$ lower GPU memory usage and 5$\times$ faster fitting time not only rivals INRs (e.g., WIRE, I-NGP) in representation performance, but also delivers a faster rendering speed of 1500-2000 FPS regardless of parameter size. Furthermore, we integrate existing vector quantization technique to build an image codec. Experimental results demonstrate that our codec attains rate-distortion performance comparable to compression-based INRs such as COIN and COIN++, while facilitating decoding speeds of approximately 1000 FPS. Additionally, preliminary proof of concept shows that our codec surpasses COIN and COIN++ in performance when using partial bits-back coding.</description>

Abstract: Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, causing a large proportion of skin cancer deaths. However, melanoma diagnoses by pathologists shows low interrater reliability. As melanoma is a cancer of the melanocyte, there is a clear need to develop a melanocytic cell segmentation tool that is agnostic to pathologist variability and automates pixel-level annotation. Gigapixel-level pathologist labeling, however, is impractical. Herein, we propose a means to train deep neural networks for melanocytic cell segmentation from hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections and paired immunohistochemistry (IHC) of adjacent tissue sections, achieving a mean IOU of 0.64 despite imperfect ground-truth labels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic scene understanding with Minimalist Optical Systems (MOS) in mobile and wearable applications remains a challenge due to the corrupted imaging quality induced by optical aberrations. However, previous works only focus on improving the subjective imaging quality through the Computational Imaging (CI) technique, ignoring the feasibility of advancing semantic segmentation. In this paper, we pioneer the investigation of Semantic Segmentation under Optical Aberrations (SSOA) with MOS. To benchmark SSOA, we construct Virtual Prototype Lens (VPL) groups through optical simulation, generating Cityscapes-ab and KITTI-360-ab datasets under different behaviors and levels of aberrations. We look into SSOA via an unsupervised domain adaptation perspective to address the scarcity of labeled aberration data in real-world scenarios. Further, we propose Computational Imaging Assisted Domain Adaptation (CIADA) to leverage prior knowledge of CI for robust performance in SSOA. Based on our benchmark, we conduct experiments on the robustness of classical segmenters against aberrations. In addition, extensive evaluations of possible solutions to SSOA reveal that CIADA achieves superior performance under all aberration distributions, bridging the gap between computational imaging and downstream applications for MOS.

      <title>AdaptiveClick: Clicks-aware Transformer with Adaptive Focal Loss for Interactive Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) has emerged as a promising technique for decreasing annotation time. Substantial progress has been made in pre- and post-processing for IIS, but the critical issue of interaction ambiguity, notably hindering segmentation quality, has been under-researched. To address this, we introduce AdaptiveClick -- a click-aware transformer incorporating an adaptive focal loss that tackles annotation inconsistencies with tools for mask- and pixel-level ambiguity resolution. To the best of our knowledge, AdaptiveClick is the first transformer-based, mask-adaptive segmentation framework for IIS. The key ingredient of our method is the Click-Aware Mask-adaptive transformer Decoder (CAMD), which enhances the interaction between click and image features. Additionally, AdaptiveClick enables pixel-adaptive differentiation of hard and easy samples in the decision space, independent of their varying distributions. This is primarily achieved by optimizing a generalized Adaptive Focal Loss (AFL) with a theoretical guarantee, where two adaptive coefficients control the ratio of gradient values for hard and easy pixels. Our analysis reveals that the commonly used Focal and BCE losses can be considered special cases of the proposed AFL. With a plain ViT backbone, extensive experimental results on nine datasets demonstrate the superiority of AdaptiveClick compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/lab206/AdaptiveClick.</description>

      <title>NM-FlowGAN: Modeling sRGB Noise with a Hybrid Approach based on Normalizing Flows and Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling and synthesizing real sRGB noise is crucial for various low-level vision tasks, such as building datasets for training image denoising systems. The distribution of real sRGB noise is highly complex and affected by a multitude of factors, making its accurate modeling extremely challenging. Therefore, recent studies have proposed methods that employ data-driven generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GAN) and Normalizing Flows. These studies achieve more accurate modeling of sRGB noise compared to traditional noise modeling methods. However, there are performance limitations due to the inherent characteristics of each generative model. To address this issue, we propose NM-FlowGAN, a hybrid approach that exploits the strengths of both GAN and Normalizing Flows. We simultaneously employ a pixel-wise noise modeling network based on Normalizing Flows, and spatial correlation modeling networks based on GAN. In our experiments, our NM-FlowGAN outperforms other baselines on the sRGB noise synthesis task. Moreover, the denoising neural network, trained with synthesized image pairs from our model, also shows superior performance compared to other baselines. Our code is available at: \url{https://github.com/YoungJooHan/NM-FlowGAN}.</description>

Abstract: Terrain surface roughness, often described abstractly, poses challenges in quantitative characterisation with various descriptors found in the literature. This study compares five commonly used roughness descriptors, exploring correlations among their quantified terrain surface roughness maps across three terrains with distinct spatial variations. Additionally, the study investigates the impacts of spatial scales and interpolation methods on these correlations. Dense point cloud data obtained through Light Detection and Ranging technique are used in this study. The findings highlight both global pattern similarities and local pattern distinctions in the derived roughness maps, emphasizing the significance of incorporating multiple descriptors in studies where local roughness values play a crucial role in subsequent analyses. The spatial scales were found to have a smaller impact on rougher terrain, while interpolation methods had minimal influence on roughness maps derived from different descriptors.</description>
