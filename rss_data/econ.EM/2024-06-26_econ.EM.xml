      <title>Efficient two-sample instrumental variable estimators with change points and near-weak identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider estimation and inference in a linear model with endogenous regressors where the parameters of interest change across two samples. If the first-stage is common, we show how to use this information to obtain more efficient two-sample GMM estimators than the standard split-sample GMM, even in the presence of near-weak instruments. We also propose two tests to detect change points in the parameters of interest, depending on whether the first-stage is common or not. We derive the limiting distribution of these tests and show that they have non-trivial power even under weaker and possibly time-varying identification patterns. The finite sample properties of our proposed estimators and testing procedures are illustrated in a series of Monte-Carlo experiments, and in an application to the open-economy New Keynesian Phillips curve. Our empirical analysis using US data provides strong support for a New Keynesian Phillips curve with incomplete pass-through and reveals important time variation in the relationship between inflation and exchange rate pass-through.</description>

      <title>Forecast Relative Error Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of relative error decomposition measures that are well-suited for the analysis of shocks in nonlinear dynamic models. They include the Forecast Relative Error Decomposition (FRED), Forecast Error Kullback Decomposition (FEKD) and Forecast Error Laplace Decomposition (FELD). These measures are favourable over the traditional Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD) because they account for nonlinear dependence in both a serial and cross-sectional sense. This is illustrated by applications to dynamic models for qualitative data, count data, stochastic volatility and cyberrisk.</description>

      <title>Estimation and Inference for CP Tensor Factor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional tensor-valued data have recently gained attention from researchers in economics and finance. We consider the estimation and inference of high-dimensional tensor factor models, where each dimension of the tensor diverges. Our focus is on a factor model that admits CP-type tensor decomposition, which allows for non-orthogonal loading vectors. Based on the contemporary covariance matrix, we propose an iterative simultaneous projection estimation method. Our estimator is robust to weak dependence among factors and weak correlation across different dimensions in the idiosyncratic shocks. We establish an inferential theory, demonstrating both consistency and asymptotic normality under relaxed assumptions. Within a unified framework, we consider two eigenvalue ratio-based estimators for the number of factors in a tensor factor model and justify their consistency. Through a simulation study and two empirical applications featuring sorted portfolios and international trade flows, we illustrate the advantages of our proposed estimator over existing methodologies in the literature.</description>

      <title>Gaussian and Student's $t$ mixture vector autoregressive model with application to the effects of the Euro area monetary policy shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.13648v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new mixture vector autoregressive model based on Gaussian and Student's $t$ distributions is introduced. As its mixture components, our model incorporates conditionally homoskedastic linear Gaussian vector autoregressions and conditionally heteroskedastic linear Student's $t$ vector autoregressions. For a $p$th order model, the mixing weights depend on the full distribution of the preceding $p$ observations, which leads to attractive practical and theoretical properties such as ergodicity and full knowledge of the stationary distribution of $p+1$ consecutive observations. A structural version of the model with statistically identified shocks is also proposed. The empirical application studies the effects of the Euro area monetary policy shock. We fit a two-regime model to the data and find the effects, particularly on inflation, stronger in the regime that mainly prevails before the Financial crisis than in the regime that mainly dominates after it. The introduced methods are implemented in the accompanying R package gmvarkit.</description>

      <title>Modelling Large Dimensional Datasets with Markov Switching Factor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09828v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a novel large dimensional approximate factor model with regime changes in the loadings driven by a latent first order Markov process. By exploiting the equivalent linear representation of the model, we first recover the latent factors by means of Principal Component Analysis. We then cast the model in state-space form, and we estimate loadings and transition probabilities through an EM algorithm based on a modified version of the Baum-Lindgren-Hamilton-Kim filter and smoother that makes use of the factors previously estimated. Our approach is appealing as it provides closed form expressions for all estimators. More importantly, it does not require knowledge of the true number of factors. We derive the theoretical properties of the proposed estimation procedure, and we show their good finite sample performance through a comprehensive set of Monte Carlo experiments. The empirical usefulness of our approach is illustrated through three applications to large U.S. datasets of stock returns, macroeconomic variables, and inflation indexes.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Autoregressions in Short T Panel Data Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a first-order autoregressive panel data model with individual-specific effects and heterogeneous autoregressive coefficients defined on the interval (-1,1], thus allowing for some of the individual processes to have unit roots. It proposes estimators for the moments of the cross-sectional distribution of the autoregressive (AR) coefficients, assuming a random coefficient model for the autoregressive coefficients without imposing any restrictions on the fixed effects. It is shown the standard generalized method of moments estimators obtained under homogeneous slopes are biased. Small sample properties of the proposed estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments and compared with a number of alternatives, both under homogeneous and heterogeneous slopes. It is found that a simple moment estimator of the mean of heterogeneous AR coefficients performs very well even for moderate sample sizes, but to reliably estimate the variance of AR coefficients much larger samples are required. It is also required that the true value of this variance is not too close to zero. The utility of the heterogeneous approach is illustrated in the case of earnings dynamics.</description>

      <title>Causal Models for Longitudinal and Panel Data: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey we discuss the recent causal panel data literature. This recent literature has focused on credibly estimating causal effects of binary interventions in settings with longitudinal data, emphasizing practical advice for empirical researchers. It pays particular attention to heterogeneity in the causal effects, often in situations where few units are treated and with particular structures on the assignment pattern. The literature has extended earlier work on difference-in-differences or two-way-fixed-effect estimators. It has more generally incorporated factor models or interactive fixed effects. It has also developed novel methods using synthetic control approaches.</description>

      <title>Minimax-Regret Sample Selection in Randomized Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized controlled trials are often run in settings with many subpopulations that may have differential benefits from the treatment being evaluated. We consider the problem of sample selection, i.e., whom to enroll in a randomized trial, such as to optimize welfare in a heterogeneous population. We formalize this problem within the minimax-regret framework, and derive optimal sample-selection schemes under a variety of conditions. Using data from a COVID-19 vaccine trial, we also highlight how different objectives and decision rules can lead to meaningfully different guidance regarding optimal sample allocation.</description>
