      <title>A categorical approach to inverse semigroups, \'etale groupoids, and their C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a category of inverse semigroup actions and a category of \'etale groupoids. We show that there are three functors which send inverse semigroups to their spectral actions, inverse semigroup actions to their transformation groupoids, and \'etale groupoids to their groupoid C*-algebras, respectively. The composition of these functors is naturally equivalent to the already known functor which sends inverse semigroups to their C*-algebras. This result is a categorical version of the theorem by Paterson which states that the inverse semigroup C*-algebras coincide the groupoid C*-algebras of the universal groupoids. We also construct a functor from the category of \'etale groupoids to the category of inverse semigroup actions sending \'etale groupoids to their slice actions, and show that this functor is right adjoint to the functor sending inverse semigroup actions to their transformation groupoids.</description>

      <title>Pure C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every C*-algebra that is (m,n)-pure in the sense of Winter is already pure, that is, its Cuntz semigroup is almost unperforated and almost divisible. More generally, we show that even weaker comparison and divisibility properties automatically lead to pureness. We use this to show that, under a mild comparison assumption, pureness is automatic for C*-algebras that are either nowhere scattered with real rank zero or stable rank one, or simple, unital, non-elementary, with a unique quasitrace.
  As an application to the non-simple Toms-Winter conjecture, we show that every C*-algebra with the Global Glimm Property and finite nuclear dimension is pure. It follows that a separable, locally subhomogeneous C*-algebras with stable rank one and topological dimension zero is pure if and only if it is $\mathcal{Z}$-stable, if and only if it is nowhere scattered and has finite nuclear dimension.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative topological boundaries and amenable invariant random intermediate subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an analogue of the topological boundary of discrete groups $\Gamma$, we define the noncommutative topological boundary of tracial von Neumann algebras $(M, \tau)$ and apply it to generalize the main results of [AHO23], showing that for a trace-preserving action $\Gamma \curvearrowright (A, \tau_A)$ on an amenable tracial von Neumann algebra, any $\Gamma$-invariant amenable intermediate subalgebra between $A$ and $\Gamma \ltimes A$ is necessarily a subalgebra of $\mathrm{Rad}(\Gamma) \ltimes A$. By taking $(A, \tau_A) = L^\infty(X, \nu_X)$ for a free pmp action $\Gamma \curvearrowright (X, \nu_X)$, we obtain a similar result for the invariant subequivalence relations of $\mathcal{R}_{\Gamma \curvearrowright X}$.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Stieltjes algebras, decomposable Fourier multipliers and amenability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra $\mathrm{B}(G)$ of a discrete group $G$ is isometrically isomorphic to the algebra $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{dec}}(G)$ of decomposable Fourier multipliers on the group von Neumann algebra $\mathrm{VN}(G)$. In contrast, we show that $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{dec}}(G) \neq \mathrm{B}(G)$ for some classes of non-discrete locally compact groups, while we prove that $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{dec}}(G) = \mathrm{B}(G)$ holds for any (unimodular) inner amenable locally compact group. To prove these results, we leverage groupoid theory and investigate the problem of whether a contractive projection exists, preserving complete positivity, from the space of normal completely bounded operators on $\mathrm{VN}(G)$ onto the space $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{cb}}(G)$ of completely bounded Fourier multipliers. We provide an affirmative solution in the inner amenable case and demonstrate that such projections do not exist for non-amenable connected locally compact groups. Further, we investigate whether the space $\mathfrak{M}^{p,\mathrm{cb}}(G)$ of completely bounded Fourier multipliers on the noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-space $\mathrm{L}^p(\mathrm{VN}(G))$ is complemented in the space of completely bounded operators, where $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. Using doubling metrics on Lie groups and structural results from the solution to Hilbert's fifth problem, we establish that any (unimodular) amenable locally compact group admits compatible bounded projections at the levels $p=1$ and $p=\infty$, which has applications to decomposable Fourier multipliers. Moreover, we present a new characterization of amenability and exhibit a completely bounded Fourier multiplier acting on the von Neumann algebra of a free group, which is not approximable by weak* continuous decomposable operators, thereby improving a result of de Canni\`ere and Haagerup.</description>

      <title>Classical harmonic analysis viewed through the prism of noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to bridge noncommutative geometry with classical harmonic analysis on Banach spaces, focusing primarily on both classical and noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$ spaces. Introducing a notion of Banach Fredholm module, we define new abelian groups, $\mathrm{K}^{0}(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{B})$ and $\mathrm{K}^{1}(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{B})$, of $\mathrm{K}$-homology associated with an algebra $\mathcal{A}$ and a suitable class $\mathscr{B}$ of Banach spaces, such as the class of $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. We establish index pairings of these groups with the $\mathrm{K}$-theory groups of the algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Subsequently, by considering (noncommutative) Hardy spaces, we uncover the natural emergence of Hilbert transforms, leading to Banach Fredholm modules and culminating in index theorems. Moreover, by associating each reasonable sub-Markovian semigroup of operators with a &lt;&lt;Banach noncommutative manifold&gt;&gt;, we explain how this leads to (possibly kernel-degenerate) Banach Fredholm modules, thereby revealing the role of vectorial Riesz transforms in this context. Overall, our approach significantly integrates the analysis of operators on $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces into the expansive framework of noncommutative geometry, offering new perspectives.</description>

      <title>Entropies and Poisson boundaries of random walks on groups with rapid decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable group and $\mu$ a probability measure on $G$. We build a new framework to compute asymptotic quantities associated with the $\mu$-random walk on $G$, using methods from harmonic analysis on groups and Banach space theory, most notably the complex interpolation. It is shown that under mild conditions, the Lyapunov exponent of the $\mu$-random walk with respect to a weight $\omega$ on $G$ can be computed in terms of the asymptotic behavior of the spectral radius of $\mu$ in an ascending class of weighted group algebras, and we prove that for natural choices of $\omega$ and $\mu$, the Lyapunov exponent vanishes. Also, we show that the Avez entropy of the $\mu$-random walk can be realized as the Lyapunov exponent of $\mu$ with respect to a suitable weight.
  Next, by considering the spectral radius in the algebras of $p$-pseudofunctions on $G$, we introduce a new asymptotic quantity, which we call convolution entropy. We show that for groups with the property of rapid decay, the convolution entropy coincides with the Avez entropy. Subsequently, we apply our results to stationary dynamical systems consisting of an action of a group with the property of rapid decay on a probability space. We prove that whenever the associated Koopman representation is weakly contained in the left-regular representation of the group, then the Avez entropy coincides with the Furstenberg entropy of the stationary space. This gives a characterization of (Zimmer) amenability for actions of rapid decay groups on stationary spaces.</description>
