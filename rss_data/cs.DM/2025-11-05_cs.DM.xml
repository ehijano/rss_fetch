      <title>Fixed-parameter tractability and hardness for Steiner rooted and locally connected orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a Steiner strongly $k$-arc-connected orientation is particularly relevant in network design and reliability, as it guarantees robust communication between a designated set of critical nodes. Kir\'aly and Lau (FOCS 2006) introduced a rooted variant, called the Steiner Rooted Orientation problem, where one is given an undirected graph on $n$ vertices, a root vertex, and a set of $t$ terminals. The goal is to find an orientation of the graph such that the resulting directed graph is Steiner rooted $k$-arc-connected. This problem generalizes several classical connectivity results in graph theory, such as those on edge-disjoint paths and spanning-tree packings. While the maximum $k$ for which a Steiner strongly $k$-arc-connected orientation exists can be determined in polynomial time via Nash-Williams' orientation theorem, its rooted counterpart is significantly harder: the problem is NP-hard when both $k$ and $t$ are part of the input. In this work, we provide a complete understanding of the problem with respect to these two parameters. In particular, we give an algorithm that solves the problem in time $f(k,t)\cdot n^{O(1)}$, establishing fixed-parameter tractability with respect to the number of terminals $t$ and the target connectivity $k$. We further show that the problem remains NP-hard if either $k$ or $t$ is treated as part of the input, meaning that our algorithm is essentially optimal from a parameterized perspective. Importantly, our results extend far beyond the Steiner setting: the same framework applies to the more general orientation problem with local connectivity requirements, establishing fixed-parameter tractability when parameterized by the total demand and thereby covering a wide range of arc-connectivity orientation problems.</description>

      <title>SPHERE: Spherical partitioning for large-scale routing optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study shortest-path routing in large weighted, undirected graphs, where expanding search frontiers raise time and memory costs for exact solvers. We propose \emph{SPHERE}, a source-target-aware heuristic that identifies an $s$-$t$ overlap: vertices that are close to both $s$ and $t$ in hop count. Selecting an anchor $a$ in this overlap partitions the task into two subproblems with unchanged problem-topology, $s\to a$ and $a\to t$; if either remains large, the procedure recurses on its induced subgraph. Because the cut lies inside the overlap, concatenating the resulting subpaths yields a valid $s\to t$ route without boundary repair. SPHERE is independent of the downstream solver (e.g., Dijkstra) and exposes parallelism across subproblems. On large networks, it achieves faster runtimes and smaller optimality gaps than Louvain-based routing and a METIS-based pipeline, even on graphs with more than a million nodes and edges, while also outperforming Dijkstra in runtime.</description>

      <title>Numbering Combinations for Compact Representation of Many-to-Many Relationship Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an approach to implement specific relation-ship set between two entities called combinatorial relationship set. For the combinatorial relationship set B between entity sets G and I the mapping cardinality is many-to-many. Additionally, entities from G can be uniquely encoded with a pair of values (h, k) generated with the procedure for numbering combinations of entities from I. The encoding procedure is based on combinatorial number system that provides a representation of all possible k -combinations of a set of n elements by a single number. In general many-to-many relationship sets are represented by a relation or table, while the combinatorial relationship is not physically stored as separate table. However, all information is encapsulated into a single column added to G. The new column is a candidate key in G. Additional operation named Rank-Join to fundamental relational-algebra is presented to combine information from g and i associated with a combinatorial relationship set. Motivation for combinatorial relationship originates from challenges in designing and implementing multivalued dimensions and bridge tables in data-warehouse models.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Circuits and Neural Networks for Regular Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that there exist uniform $(+,\times,/)$-circuits of size $O(n^3)$ to compute the basis generating polynomial of regular matroids on $n$ elements. By tropicalization, this implies that there exist uniform $(\max,+,-)$-circuits and ReLU neural networks of the same size for weighted basis maximization of regular matroids. As a consequence in linear programming theory, we obtain a first example where taking the difference of two extended formulations can be more efficient than the best known individual extended formulation of size $O(n^6)$ by Aprile and Fiorini. Such differences have recently been introduced as virtual extended formulations. The proof of our main result relies on a fine-tuned version of Seymour's decomposition of regular matroids which allows us to identify and maintain graphic substructures to which we can apply a local version of the star-mesh transformation.</description>

      <title>Emerging consecutive pattern avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we study the {\em asymptotic popularity}, that is, the limit probability to find a given consecutive pattern at a random position in a random permutation in the eighteen classes of permutations avoiding at least two length 3 consecutive patterns. We show that for ten classes, this popularity can be readily deduced from the structure of permutations. By combining analytical and bijective approaches, we study in details two more involved cases. The problem remains open for five classes.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Fast $(3+\varepsilon)$-approximation for Constrained Correlation Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Constrained Correlation Clustering, the goal is to cluster a complete signed graph in a way that minimizes the number of negative edges inside clusters plus the number of positive edges between clusters, while respecting hard constraints on how to cluster certain friendly or hostile node pairs. Fischer et al. [FKKT25a] recently developed a $\tilde{O}(n^3)$-time 16-approximation algorithm for this problem. We settle an open question posed by these authors by designing an algorithm that is equally fast but brings the approximation factor down to $(3+\varepsilon)$ for arbitrary constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. Although several new algorithmic steps are needed to obtain our improved approximation, our approach maintains many advantages in terms of simplicity. In particular, it relies mainly on rounding a (new) covering linear program, which can be approximated quickly and combinatorially. Furthermore, the rounding step amounts to applying the very familiar Pivot algorithm to an auxiliary graph. Finally, we develop much simpler algorithms for instances that involve only friendly or only hostile constraints.</description>

      <title>Curves, points, incidences and covering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a point set, mostly a grid in our case, we seek upper and lower bounds on the number of curves that are needed to cover the point set. We say a curve covers a point if the curve passes through the point. We consider such coverings by monotonic curves, lines, orthoconvex curves, circles, etc. We also study a problem that is converse of the covering problem -- if a set of $n^2$ points in the plane is covered by $n$ lines then can we say something about the configuration of the points?</description>

      <title>On the Parameterized Complexity of Grundy Domination and Zero Forcing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two different problem families that deal with domination in graphs. On the one hand, we focus on dominating sequences. In such a sequence, every vertex dominates some vertex of the graph that was not dominated by any earlier vertex in the sequence. The problem of finding the longest dominating sequence is known as $\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$. Depending on whether the closed or the open neighborhoods are used for domination, there are three other versions of this problem. We show that all four problem variants are $\mathsf{W[1]}$-complete when parameterized by the solution size. On the other hand, we consider the family of zero forcing problems which form the parameterized duals of the Grundy domination problems. In these problems, one looks for the smallest set of vertices initially colored blue such that certain color change rules are able to color all other vertices blue. Bhyravarapu et al. [IWOCA 2025] showed that one of these problems, known as $\mathsf{Zero~Forcing~Set}$, is in $\mathsf{FPT}$ when parameterized by the treewidth or the solution size. We extend their treewidth result to the other three variants of zero forcing and their respective Grundy domination problems. Our algorithm also implies an $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithm for $\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$ when parameterized by the number of vertices that are not in the dominating sequence.</description>
