      <title>Frequency Shift in Binary Lensing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing with binary lensing is one of the channels for detecting exoplanets. Due to the degeneracy of the lens parameters for the binary microlensing, additional features such as parallax and finite-size effects need to identify the lens parameters. The frequency-shift effect as the relativistic analogy of the gravity assist for the photons, is an extra observation that provides additional constraint between the lens parameters . In this work, we extend the application of the frequency shift effect to binary microlensing and derive the frequency shift during the lensing and caustic crossing. The frequency shift for the binary lens is of the order of ${\Delta\nu}/{\nu}\sim 10^{-12}$. We also investigate the feasibility of detecting this effect by employing Cross-Correlation methods .</description>

      <title>The possible origin of three Apollo asteroids 3200 Phaethon, 2005UD, and 1999YC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\textit{Aims.}$ We study the possible dynamical background of three Apollo asteroids: 3200 Phaethon, 2005 UD, and 1999 YC. The source regions under consideration are the asteroid families (2) Pallas, in the outer belt, and two inner-belt families (329) Svea and (142) Polana. We also aim to explain some of the contradictions in the literature in regards to the origin of Phaethon. $\textit{Methods.}$ Our methodology relies on the precise dynamical mapping of several mean motion resonances (MMRs), which are considered the main transport channels. This approach allows the clear detection of chaotic structures in an MMR and efficient selection of test asteroids for diffusion. We tracked the orbital evolution of the selected particles over 5 million years and registered all their eventual entries into the orbital neighborhood of the asteroids 3200 Phaethon, 2005 UD and 1999 YC. We performed massive calculations for different orbital and integration parameters using Orbit9 and Rebound software packages. $\textit{Results.}$ We observed possible connections between three targeted Apollo asteroids and asteroid families we considered as their sources. The (2) Pallas family has the highest chance of being the origin of targeted asteroids, and (142) Polana has the lowest. The amount of transported material largely depends on the integrator, the integration step, and even the choice of the initial epoch, though to a lesser extent. There is a systematic discrepancy between the results obtained with Orbit9 and Rebound regarding the efficiency of the transport, but they show good agreement over delivery times and dynamical maps. A non-negligible number of objects approached all three target asteroids, which could indicate that the breakup of the precursor body occurred during its dynamical evolution.</description>

      <title>The physical mechanism of the streaming instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main hurdle of planet formation theory is the metre-scale barrier. One of the most promising ways to overcome it is via the streaming instability (SI). Unfortunately, the mechanism responsible for the onset of this instability remains mysterious. It has recently been shown that the SI is a Resonant Drag Instability (RDI) involving inertial waves. We build on this insight and clarify the physical picture of how the SI develops, while bolstering this picture with transparent mathematics. Like all RDIs, the SI is built on a feedback loop: in the `forward action', an inertial wave concentrates dust into clumps; in the `backward reaction', those drifting dust clumps excite an inertial wave. Each process breaks into two mechanisms, a fast one and a slow one. At resonance, each forward mechanism can couple with a backward mechanism to close a feedback loop. Unfortunately, the fast-fast loop is stable, so the SI uses the fast-slow and slow-fast loops. Despite this last layer of complexity, we hope that our explanation will help understand how the SI works, in which conditions it can grow, how it manifests itself, and how it saturates.</description>

      <title>Debiasing astro-Photometric Observations with Corrections Using Statistics (DePhOCUS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric measurements allow the determination of an asteroid's absolute magnitude, which often represents the sole means to infer its size. Photometric observations can be obtained in a variety of filters that can be unique to a specific observatory. Those observations are then calibrated into specific bands with respect to reference star catalogs. In order to combine all the different measurements for evaluation, photometric observations need to be converted to a common band, typically V-band. Current band-correction schemes in use by IAU's Minor Planet Center, JPL's Center for Near Earth Object Studies and ESA's NEO Coordination Centre use average correction values for the apparent magnitude derived from photometry of asteroids as the corrections are dependent on the typically unknown spectrum of the object to be corrected. By statistically analyzing the photometric residuals of asteroids, we develop a new photometric correction scheme that does not only consider the band, but also accounts for reference catalog and observatory. We describe a new statistical photometry correction scheme for asteroid observations with debiased corrections. Testing this scheme on a reference group of asteroids, we see a 36% reduction in the photometric residuals. Moreover, the new scheme leads to a more accurate and debiased determination of the H-G magnitude system and, in turn, to more reliable inferred sizes. We discuss the significant shift in the corrections with this "DePhOCUS" debiasing system, its limitations, and the impact for photometric and physical properties of all asteroids, especially Near-Earth Objects.</description>

      <title>Quiet Please: Detrending Radial Velocity Variations from Stellar Activity with a Physically Motivated Spot Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For solar-type stars, spots and their associated magnetic regions induce radial velocity perturbations through the Doppler rotation signal and the suppression of convective blueshift -- collectively known as rotation-modulation. We developed the Rotation-Convection (RC) model: a method of detrending and characterizing rotation-modulation, using only cross-correlation functions or 1-dimensional spectra, without the need for continuous high cadence measurements. The RC method uses a simple model for the anomalous radial velocity induced by an active region and has two inputs: stellar flux (or a flux proxy) and the relative radial velocity between strongly and weakly absorbed wavelengths (analogous to the bisector-inverse slope). On NEID solar data (three month baseline), the RC model lowers the amplitude of rotationally-modulated stellar activity to below the meter-per-second level. For the standard star HD 26965, the RC model detrends the activity signal to the meter-per-second level for HARPS, EXPRES, and NEID observations, even though the temporal density and timespan of the observations differs by an order of magnitude between the three datasets. In addition to detrending, the RC model also characterizes the rotation-modulation signal. From comparison with the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we confirmed that the model accurately recovers and separates the rotation and convection radial velocity components. We also mapped the amplitude of the rotation and convection perturbations as a function of height within the stellar atmosphere. Probing stellar atmospheres with our revised spot model will fuel future innovations in stellar activity mitigation, enabling robust exoplanet detection.</description>

      <title>Planet migration in massive circumbinary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most stars are in multiple systems, with the majority of those being binaries. A large number of planets have been confirmed in binary stars and therefore it is important to understand their formation and dynamical evolution. We perform simulations to investigate the migration of wide-orbit giant planets (semi-major axis 100 AU) in massive circumbinary discs (mass 0.1 M$_{\odot}$) that are marginally gravitationally unstable, using the three-dimensional Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic code SEREN. We vary the binary parameters to explore their effect on planet migration. We find that a planet in a massive circumbinary disc initially undergoes a period of rapid inward migration before switching to a slow outward migration, as it does in a circumstellar disc. However, the presence of the binary enhances planet migration and mass growth. We find that a high binary mass ratio (binary with equal mass stars) results in more enhanced outward planet migration. Additionally, larger binary separation and/or higher binary eccentricity results to a faster outward planet migration and stronger planet growth. We conclude that wide-orbit giant planets attain wider final orbits due to migration around binary stars than around single stars.</description>

      <title>Rossby Wave Instability and Substructure Formation in 3D Non-Ideal MHD Wind-Launching Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rings and gaps are routinely observed in the dust continuum emission of protoplanetary discs (PPDs). How they form and evolve remains debated. Previous studies have demonstrated the possibility of spontaneous gas rings and gaps formation in wind-launching disks. Here, we show that such gas substructures are unstable to the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI) through numerical simulations. Specifically, shorter wavelength azimuthal modes develop earlier, and longer wavelength ones dominate later, forming elongated (arc-like) anti-cyclonic vortices in the rings and (strongly magnetized) cyclonic vortices in the gaps that persist until the end of the simulation. Highly elongated vortices with aspect ratios of 10 or more are found to decay with time in our non-ideal MHD simulation, in contrast with the hydro case. This difference could be caused by magnetically induced motions, particularly strong meridional circulations with large values of the azimuthal component of the vorticity, which may be incompatible with the columnar structure preferred by vortices. The cyclonic and anti-cyclonic RWI vortices saturate at moderate levels, modifying but not destroying the rings and gaps in the radial gas distribution of the disk. In particular, they do not shut off the poloidal magnetic flux accumulation in low-density regions and the characteristic meridional flow patterns that are crucial to the ring and gap formation in wind-launching disks. Nevertheless, the RWI and their associated vortices open up the possibility of producing non-axisymmetric dust features observed in a small fraction of protoplanetary disks through non-ideal MHD, although detailed dust treatment is needed to explore this possibility.</description>
