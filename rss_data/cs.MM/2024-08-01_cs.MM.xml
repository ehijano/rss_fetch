      <title>Open-Vocabulary Audio-Visual Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-visual semantic segmentation (AVSS) aims to segment and classify sounding objects in videos with acoustic cues. However, most approaches operate on the close-set assumption and only identify pre-defined categories from training data, lacking the generalization ability to detect novel categories in practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a new task: open-vocabulary audio-visual semantic segmentation, extending AVSS task to open-world scenarios beyond the annotated label space. This is a more challenging task that requires recognizing all categories, even those that have never been seen nor heard during training. Moreover, we propose the first open-vocabulary AVSS framework, OV-AVSS, which mainly consists of two parts: 1) a universal sound source localization module to perform audio-visual fusion and locate all potential sounding objects and 2) an open-vocabulary classification module to predict categories with the help of the prior knowledge from large-scale pre-trained vision-language models. To properly evaluate the open-vocabulary AVSS, we split zero-shot training and testing subsets based on the AVSBench-semantic benchmark, namely AVSBench-OV. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong segmentation and zero-shot generalization ability of our model on all categories. On the AVSBench-OV dataset, OV-AVSS achieves 55.43% mIoU on base categories and 29.14% mIoU on novel categories, exceeding the state-of-the-art zero-shot method by 41.88%/20.61% and open-vocabulary method by 10.2%/11.6%.

      <title>ESIQA: Perceptual Quality Assessment of Vision-Pro-based Egocentric Spatial Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of eXtended Reality (XR), head-mounted shooting and display technology have experienced significant advancement and gained considerable attention. Egocentric spatial images and videos are emerging as a compelling form of stereoscopic XR content. Different from traditional 2D images, egocentric spatial images present challenges for perceptual quality assessment due to their special shooting, processing methods, and stereoscopic characteristics. However, the corresponding image quality assessment (IQA) research for egocentric spatial images is still lacking. In this paper, we establish the Egocentric Spatial Images Quality Assessment Database (ESIQAD), the first IQA database dedicated for egocentric spatial images as far as we know. Our ESIQAD includes 500 egocentric spatial images, containing 400 images captured with the Apple Vision Pro and 100 images generated via an iPhone's "Spatial Camera" app. The corresponding mean opinion scores (MOSs) are collected under three viewing modes, including 2D display, 3D-window display, and 3D-immersive display. Furthermore, based on our database, we conduct a benchmark experiment and evaluate the performance of 22 state-of-the-art IQA models under three different viewing modes. We hope this research can facilitate future IQA research on egocentric spatial images. The database is available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/ESIQA.</description>

      <title>Design and Development of Laughter Recognition System Based on Multimodal Fusion and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to design and implement a laughter recognition system based on multimodal fusion and deep learning, leveraging image and audio processing technologies to achieve accurate laughter recognition and emotion analysis. First, the system loads video files and uses the OpenCV library to extract facial information while employing the Librosa library to process audio features such as MFCC. Then, multimodal fusion techniques are used to integrate image and audio features, followed by training and prediction using deep learning models. Evaluation results indicate that the model achieved 80% accuracy, precision, and recall on the test dataset, with an F1 score of 80%, demonstrating robust performance and the ability to handle real-world data variability. This study not only verifies the effectiveness of multimodal fusion methods in laughter recognition but also highlights their potential applications in affective computing and human-computer interaction. Future work will focus on further optimizing feature extraction and model architecture to improve recognition accuracy and expand application scenarios, promoting the development of laughter recognition technology in fields such as mental health monitoring and educational activity evaluation</description>

      <title>Can LLMs "Reason" in Music? An Evaluation of LLMs' Capability of Music Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Music, akin to language, can be encoded in discrete symbols. Recent research has extended the application of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama2 to the symbolic music domain including understanding and generation. Yet scant research explores the details of how these LLMs perform on advanced music understanding and conditioned generation, especially from the multi-step reasoning perspective, which is a critical aspect in the conditioned, editable, and interactive human-computer co-creation process. This study conducts a thorough investigation of LLMs' capability and limitations in symbolic music processing. We identify that current LLMs exhibit poor performance in song-level multi-step music reasoning, and typically fail to leverage learned music knowledge when addressing complex musical tasks. An analysis of LLMs' responses highlights distinctly their pros and cons. Our findings suggest achieving advanced musical capability is not intrinsically obtained by LLMs, and future research should focus more on bridging the gap between music knowledge and reasoning, to improve the co-creation experience for musicians.</description>

      <title>Learning Video Context as Interleaved Multimodal Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narrative videos, such as movies, pose significant challenges in video understanding due to their rich contexts (characters, dialogues, storylines) and diverse demands (identify who, relationship, and reason). In this paper, we introduce MovieSeq, a multimodal language model developed to address the wide range of challenges in understanding video contexts. Our core idea is to represent videos as interleaved multimodal sequences (including images, plots, videos, and subtitles), either by linking external knowledge databases or using offline models (such as whisper for subtitles). Through instruction-tuning, this approach empowers the language model to interact with videos using interleaved multimodal instructions. For example, instead of solely relying on video as input, we jointly provide character photos alongside their names and dialogues, allowing the model to associate these elements and generate more comprehensive responses. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we validate MovieSeq's performance on six datasets (LVU, MAD, Movienet, CMD, TVC, MovieQA) across five settings (video classification, audio description, video-text retrieval, video captioning, and video question-answering). The code will be public at https://github.com/showlab/MovieSeq.</description>

      <title>Towards Natural Language-Guided Drones: GeoText-1652 Benchmark with Spatial Relation Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12751v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigating drones through natural language commands remains challenging due to the dearth of accessible multi-modal datasets and the stringent precision requirements for aligning visual and textual data. To address this pressing need, we introduce GeoText-1652, a new natural language-guided geo-localization benchmark. This dataset is systematically constructed through an interactive human-computer process leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) driven annotation techniques in conjunction with pre-trained vision models. GeoText-1652 extends the established University-1652 image dataset with spatial-aware text annotations, thereby establishing one-to-one correspondences between image, text, and bounding box elements. We further introduce a new optimization objective to leverage fine-grained spatial associations, called blending spatial matching, for region-level spatial relation matching. Extensive experiments reveal that our approach maintains a competitive recall rate comparing other prevailing cross-modality methods. This underscores the promising potential of our approach in elevating drone control and navigation through the seamless integration of natural language commands in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Attribute-driven Disentangled Representation Learning for Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommendation algorithms forecast user preferences by correlating user and item representations derived from historical interaction patterns. In pursuit of enhanced performance, many methods focus on learning robust and independent representations by disentangling the intricate factors within interaction data across various modalities in an unsupervised manner. However, such an approach obfuscates the discernment of how specific factors (e.g., category or brand) influence the outcomes, making it challenging to regulate their effects. In response to this challenge, we introduce a novel method called Attribute-Driven Disentangled Representation Learning (short for AD-DRL), which explicitly incorporates attributes from different modalities into the disentangled representation learning process. By assigning a specific attribute to each factor in multimodal features, AD-DRL can disentangle the factors at both attribute and attribute-value levels. To obtain robust and independent representations for each factor associated with a specific attribute, we first disentangle the representations of features both within and across different modalities. Moreover, we further enhance the robustness of the representations by fusing the multimodal features of the same factor. Empirical evaluations conducted on three public real-world datasets substantiate the effectiveness of AD-DRL, as well as its interpretability and controllability.</description>
