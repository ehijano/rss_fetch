      <title>Deep learning enhanced initial model prediction in elastic FWI: application to marine streamer data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-frequency data are essential to constrain the low-wavenumber model components in seismic full-waveform inversion (FWI). However, due to acquisition limitations and ambient noise it is often unavailable. Deep learning (DL) can learn to map from high frequency model updates of elastic FWI to a low-wavenumber model update, producing an initial model estimation as if it was available from low-frequency data. We train a FusionNET-based convolutional neural network (CNN) on a synthetic dataset to produce an initial low-wavenumber model from a set of model updates produced by FWI on the data with missing low frequencies. We validate this DL-fused approach using a synthetic benchmark with data generated in an unrelated model to the training dataset. Finally, applying our trained network to estimate an initial low-wavenumber model based on field data, we see that elastic FWI starting from such a 'DL-fused' model update shows improved convergence on real-world marine streamer data.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sequential Decision-Making in Geosteering: A Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trajectory adjustment decisions throughout the drilling process, called geosteering, affect subsequent choices and information gathering, thus resulting in a coupled sequential decision problem. Previous works on applying decision optimization methods in geosteering rely on greedy optimization or approximate dynamic programming (ADP). Either decision optimization method requires explicit uncertainty and objective function models, making developing decision optimization methods for complex and realistic geosteering environments challenging to impossible. We use the Deep Q-Network (DQN) method, a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) method that learns directly from the decision environment, to optimize geosteering decisions. The expensive computations for RL are handled during the offline training stage. Evaluating DQN needed for real-time decision support takes milliseconds and is faster than the traditional alternatives. Moreover, for two previously published synthetic geosteering scenarios, our results show that RL achieves high-quality outcomes comparable to the quasi-optimal ADP. Yet, the model-free nature of RL means that by replacing the training environment, we can extend it to problems where the solution to ADP is prohibitively expensive to compute. This flexibility will allow applying it to more complex environments and make hybrid versions trained with real data in the future.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Framework for History Matching CO2 Storage with 4D Seismic and Monitoring Well Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geological carbon storage entails the injection of megatonnes of supercritical CO2 into subsurface formations. The properties of these formations are usually highly uncertain, which makes design and optimization of large-scale storage operations challenging. In this paper we introduce a history matching strategy that enables the calibration of formation properties based on early-time observations. Early-time assessments are essential to assure the operation is performing as planned. Our framework involves two fit-for-purpose deep learning surrogate models that provide predictions for in-situ monitoring well data and interpreted time-lapse (4D) seismic saturation data. These two types of data are at very different scales of resolution, so it is appropriate to construct separate, specialized deep learning networks for their prediction. This approach results in a workflow that is more straightforward to design and more efficient to train than a single surrogate that provides global high-fidelity predictions. The deep learning models are integrated into a hierarchical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) history matching procedure. History matching is performed on a synthetic case with and without 4D seismic data, which allows us to quantify the impact of 4D seismic on uncertainty reduction. The use of both data types is shown to provide substantial uncertainty reduction in key geomodel parameters and to enable accurate predictions of CO2 plume dynamics. The overall history matching framework developed in this study represents an efficient way to integrate multiple data types and to assess the impact of each on uncertainty reduction and performance predictions.</description>
