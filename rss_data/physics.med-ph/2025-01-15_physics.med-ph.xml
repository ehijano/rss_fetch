      <title>Correlation Between DNA Double-Strand Break Distribution in 3D Genome and Radiation-Induced Cell Death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The target theory is the most classical hypothesis explaining radiation-induced cell death, yet the physical or biological nature of the "target" remains ambiguous. This study hypothesizes that the distribution of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the 3D genome is a pivotal factor affecting the probability of radiation-induced cell death. We propose that clustered DSBs in DNA segments with high interaction frequencies are more susceptible to leading to cell death than isolated DSBs. Topologically associating domain (TAD) can be regarded as the reference unit for evaluating the impact of DSB clustering in the 3D genome. To quantify this correlation between the DSB distribution in 3D genome and radiation-induced effect, we constructed a model that abstracts DNA interactions on the aspect of TADs. Utilizing track-structure Monte Carlo simulations, we calculated the incidence of each DSB case across a variety of radiation doses and linear energy transfers (LETs). Our simulation results suggest that clustered DSBs in a single TAD or distributed in TADs with frequent interaction are substantially more likely to induce cell death than isolated DSBs. These two DSB cases are also associated with cell death and the stochastic effects caused by high-LET irradiation. Our study highlights the critical role of the 3D genome structure in the underlying mechanisms of radiobiological effects. Our hypothesis contributes novel insights into the mechanisms governing radiobiological effects and provides a valuable reference for the development of mechanistic models capable of predicting cell survival under varying doses and LETs.</description>

      <title>4D fabrication of shape-changing systems for tissue engineering: state of the art and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, four-dimensional (4D) fabrication has emerged as a powerful technology capable of revolutionizing the field of tissue engineering. This technology represents a shift in perspective from traditional tissue engineering approaches, which generally rely on static-or passive-structures (e.g., scaffolds, constructs) unable of adapting to changes in biological environments. In contrast, 4D fabrication offers the unprecedented possibility of fabricating complex designs with spatiotemporal control over structure and function in response to environment stimuli, thus mimicking biological processes. In this review, an overview of the state of the art of 4D fabrication technology for the obtainment of cellularized constructs is presented, with a focus on shape-changing soft materials. First, the approaches to obtain cellularized constructs are introduced, also describing conventional and non-conventional fabrication techniques with their relative advantages and limitations. Next, the main families of shape-changing soft materials, namely shape-memory polymers and shape-memory hydrogels are discussed and their use in 4D fabrication in the field of tissue engineering is described. Ultimately, current challenges and proposed solutions are outlined, and valuable insights into future research directions of 4D fabrication for tissue engineering are provided to disclose its full potential.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for the progression of dental caries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model for the progression of dental caries is derived. The analysis starts at the microscopic reaction and diffusion process. The local equations are averaged to derive a set of macroscopic equations. The global system includes features such as anisotropic diffusion and local changes in the geometry due to the enamel melting. The equations are then solved numerically. The simulations highlight the effect of anisotropy. In addition we draw conclusions on the progression rate of caries, and discuss them in light of a number of experiments.</description>

      <title>An Open Source Validation System for Continuous Arterial Blood Pressure Measuring Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the blood pressure waveform is becoming a more frequently studied area. The development of sensor technologies opens many new ways to be able to measure high-quality signals. The development of such an aim-specific sensor can be time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to test or validate with known and consistent waveforms. In this paper, we present an open source blood pressure waveform simulator with an open source Python validation package to reduce development costs for early-stage sensor development and research. The simulator mainly consists of 3D printed parts which technology has become a widely available and cheap solution. The core part of the simulator is a 3D printed cam that can be generated based on real blood pressure waveforms. The validation framework can create a detailed comparison between the signal waveform used to design the cam and the measured time series from the sensor being validated. The presented simulator proved to be robust and accurate in short- and long-term use, as it produced the signal waveform consistently and accurately. To validate this solution, a 3D force sensor was used, which was proven earlier to be able to measure high-quality blood pressure waveforms on the radial artery at the wrist. The results showed high similarity between the measured and the nominal waveforms, meaning that comparing the normalized signals, the RMSE value ranged from $0.0276 \pm 0.0047$ to $0.0212 \pm 0.0023$, and the Pearson correlation ranged from $0.9933 \pm 0.0027$ to $0.9978 \pm 0.0005$. Our validation framework is available at https://github.com/repat8/cam-bpw-sim. Our hardware framework, which allows reproduction of the presented solution, is available at https://github.com/repat8/cam-bpw-sim-hardware. The entire design is an open source project and was developed using free software.</description>

      <title>Single-step method for the immobilization of hydroxyapatite on 3D-printed porous polyetherketoneketone implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of tissue engineering structures (scaffolds) for the reconstruction of bone tissue defects is the relevant task of modern biomedical materials science. Compared to metal-based structures, polymer constructs provide numerous advantages, among them - better processibility and metallosis avoidance. Owing to its high mechanical performance and biocompatibility, polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) became a promising material for the development of such structures. Previously, a method for the immobilization of hydroxyapatite (HAp) on PEKK surface was proposed by our group for the enhancement of stem cell adhesion. In the present study, we propose a single-step method of HAp immobilization on the surface of 3D-printed porous PEKK implants. The proposed approach allowed to preserve the morphology (pore diameter, width of the printed lines) of the pristine implants. With that, up to 35.0+-14.0 % of the sample surface were coated with HAp particles, which resulted in improved hydrophilicity (0 degrees water contact angle). The calcium and phosphorus content on the surface of the modified samples was up to 17.4+-4.1 and 8.0+-1.7 wt. %, respectively. Importantly, the proposed modification preserved compressive strength of the 3D-printed porous PEKK implants. HAp immobilization provided better adhesion of stem cells (from 121+-40 cells/mm2 to 234+-8 cells/mm2) and induce their osteogenic differentiation.</description>
