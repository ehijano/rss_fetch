      <title>Theoretical investigation of real-fluid effects on the oxidation of hydrogen and syngas in high-pressure flow reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the high-pressure pyrolysis and oxidation of hydrogen and syngas is essential for developing accurate combustion models under real engine conditions. Accordingly, flow reactors have been increasingly used in these fundamental combustion research at high-pressure conditions to achieve chemical kinetic modeling. However, these previous chemical kinetic modeling for pyrolysis and oxidation has almost been completely conducted based on ideal gas assumption, which might fail at high-pressure conditions when real-fluid behaviors become pronounced. Elucidating whether this is the case is urgent given the high demand for high-pressure combustion and propulsion technologies. Toward this, this study establishes a first-of-its-kind real-fluid modelling framework for high-pressure flow reactors, where the physical molecular interactions in real fluids are represented via coupling ab initio intermolecular potentials with high-order Virial equation of state and further with real-fluid thermochemistry, real-fluid chemical equilibrium, and real-fluid conservation laws of species, mass, and momentum. Using the developed framework, real-fluid effects in high-pressure flow reactors are quantified through case studies of hydrogen and syngas oxidation, covering pressure of 10-500 bar, temperature of 601-946 K, equivalence ratio of 0.0009-12.07, and dilution ratio of 5.9%-99.5%. The results reveal the strong real-fluid effects in high-pressure flow reactors, where ignoring them can lead to considerable errors in the simulated mole fractions, which are higher than typical levels of measurements uncertainty in flow reactors. These errors can lead to misinterpretation of the fundamental oxidation chemistry in high-pressure flow reactors and pose significant errors in the developed chemistry models, which should be adequately accounted for in future high-pressure flow reactor studies.</description>

      <title>Imaging and controlling electron motion and chemical structural dynamics of biological system in real time and space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) has found widespread applications in physics, chemistry, and materials science, enabling real-space imaging of dynamics on ultrafast timescales. Recent advances have pushed the temporal resolution of UEM into the attosecond regime, enabling the attomicroscopy technique to directly visualize electron motion. In this work, we extend the capabilities of this powerful imaging tool to investigate ultrafast electron dynamics in a biological system by imaging and controlling light induced electronic and chemical changes in the conductive network of multicellular cable bacteria. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we first observed a laser induced increase in {\pi}-electron density, accompanied by spectral peak broadening and a blueshift features indicative of enhanced conductivity and structural modification. We also traced the effect of ultrafast laser pumping on bulk plasmon electron oscillations by monitoring changes in the plasmon like resonance peak. Additionally, we visualized laser induced chemical structural changes in cable bacteria in real space. The imaging results revealed carbon enrichment alongside a depletion of nitrogen and oxygen, highlighting the controllability of chemical dynamics. Moreover, time resolved EELS measurements further revealed a picosecond scale decay and recovery of both {\pi}-electron and plasmonic features, attributed to electron phonon coupling. In addition to shedding light on the mechanism of electron motion in cable bacteria, these findings demonstrate ultrafast modulation and switching of conductivity, underscoring their potential as bio-optoelectronic components operating on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Structure of Aqueous Alkylamine mixtures: a Computer Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous alkylamine mixtures are studied by computer simulations in order to understand the microscopic origin of the water rich side prominent x-ray scattering pre-peaks reported in a recent study. These pre-peaks are puzzling in view of the apparently contradicting facts that neat amines show pre-peaks much weaker than neat alkanols, while water-rich aqueous alcohols do not. These observations can be intuitively rationalized by noting that the amine head group have two hydrogen atoms when the hydroxyl group have only one, but they oppose the following two facts: i) computer simulations show micro-heterogeneity for both systems; ii) amines mix with water better than alcohols, both over larger concentrations and alkyl tails lengths.
  The study of the atom-atom pair correlation functions and related structure factors allows to understand the microscopic molecular details. The most interesting observation is that the amine head groups accumulate preferentially at the surface of the water domains, and increasingly better with longer alkyl tail, thus allowing to stabilize both the water and alkylamine domains, hence avoiding macroscopic demixing, except at high water concentrations when amines are scarce to achieve efficient surface saturation. The amine domains appear as disordered bilayers. Hence, aqueous amines are analogous to an inverse micelle melt and as precursor micro-emulsion.
  This stable micro-segregation produces large domain oscillations in the long range part of the correlation functions, translating into positive pre-peaks and negative anti-peaks in the related structure factors, the latter which contribute destructively to produce the prominent scattering pre-peak observed in the x-ray experiments.
  The model dependence is shown to be quite important, both for water and solute models. The CHARMM-AA model associated with the SPC/E model seems to be a good compromise.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Exploration of the Diene-Transmissive Hetero-Diels-Alder Strategy Toward Boron-Functionalized Octahydroquinolines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A diene-transmissive hetero-Diels-Alder strategy, grounded in previous experimental works and employing boronated dienophiles, is proposed for the synthesis of boron-bearing octahydroquinolines. To assess its feasibility, three representative reactions were investigated, and their thermodynamics were evaluated in toluene and acetonitrile at various temperatures using the WB97X-D level of theory. The peri-, regio-, stereo-, and $\pi$-facial selectivities were predicted. The reactions mechanisms were elucidated through exploration of the reaction pathways. The predictions are consistent with available experimental work, and show the reactions are feasible with low to moderate polarity. The results also demonstrate that the reactions selectivity can in some cases be tuned by judicious choice of reaction conditions to deliver specific products with high selectivity.</description>

      <title>A Path towards Thresholdless Colloidal Quantum Dot Lasers by Solving Decades of Mythology on Optical Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semiconductor quantum dot (CQD) was first conceived in the 1980s as offering potential for future lasers. Following high quality solution phase synthesis of colloidal CQD (CCQD) in 1993, optical gain was first demonstrated in 2000 via stimulated emission (SE) measurements. Decades of phenomenology have given rise to a Standard Model of optical gain in CCQD based upon two assumptions: a biexciton is required to achieve optical gain, and short biexciton lifetimes limit the efficient development of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). The Standard Model predicts the solution to efficient ASE is slowing Auger recombination, a task which now consumes the CCQD field. Here, we show that the Standard Model is physically incorrect, leading to misdirected materials development. Inspection of the phenomenology reveals a Simple Model which uniquely reproduces all observed phenomena. The Simple Model provides the physical foundation for developing CCQD lasers with quantum leaps in performance, including thresholdless gain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective deployment and application of advanced methodologies for quantum chemistry is inherently linked to the optimal usage of emerging and highly diversified computational resources. This paper examines the synergistic utilization of Micron memory technologies and Azure Quantum Element cloud computing in Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) simulations leveraging coupled-cluster (CC) downfolded/effective Hamiltonians based on the double unitary coupled cluster (DUCC) Ansatz. We analyze the performance of the DMRG-DUCC workflow, emphasizing the proper choice of hardware that reflects the numerical overheads associated with specific components of the workflow. We report a hybrid approach that takes advantage of Micron CXL hardware for the memory capacity intensive CC downfolding phase while employing AQE cloud computing for the less resource-intensive DMRG simulations. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the scalable ExaChem suite of electronic simulations conducted on Micron prototype systems.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Surrogates for Free Energy Computation of Complex Chemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover, Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of biochemistry and materials simulations.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Rotational Diffusion and Swing Motion of Dumbbell Probes in Two Dimensional Colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two dimensional (2D) colloids exhibit intriguing phase behaviors distinct from those in three dimensions, as well as dynamic heterogeneity reminiscent of glass-forming liquids. Here, using discontinuous molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the reporting dynamics of dicolloidal dumbbell probes in 2D colloids across the liquid-hexatic phase transition, where hexagonal bond-orientational order (HBOO) extends to quasi-long-ranged one. The rotational dynamics of dumbbell probes faithfully capture the structural and dynamical features of the host: Brownian in the isotropic liquid, and non-Gaussian in the hexatic and solid phases, reflecting both HBOO and dynamic heterogeneity of the medium. In the 2D hexatic and solid phases, probe rotation reflects heterogeneity as the dumbbells sample multiple dynamical domains of the host system: in mobile domains, they undergo rotational jumps of $\pi/3$ in accordance with HBOO, whereas in immobile domains they librate within cages formed by surrounding discs. Such non-Gaussianity disappears upon reentrant melting of the host medium driven by size polydispersity, highlighting a close connection between HBOO and probe dynamics. Furthermore, probe dynamics reveal both coupling (at a single particle level) and decoupling (at an ensemble-averaged level) between translation and rotation: swing motion emerges as their primary diffusion mode, while the Debye-Stokes-Einstein relation breaks down regardless of how the rotational diffusion coefficient is defined.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based noise attenuation technique to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus potentially saving millions of CPU hours for modeling a single XRTS measurement of matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Transformers Discover Molecular Structure Without Graph Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25 dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures for molecular modeling.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning techniques have found their way into computational chemistry as indispensable tools to accelerate atomistic simulations and materials design. In addition, machine learning approaches hold the potential to boost the predictive power of computationally efficient electronic structure methods, such as density functional theory, to chemical accuracy and to correct for fundamental errors in density functional approaches. Here, recent progress in applying machine learning to improve the accuracy of density functional and related approximations is reviewed. Promises and challenges in devising machine learning models transferable between different chemistries and materials classes are discussed with the help of examples applying promising models to systems far outside their training sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modified Marrone-Treanor model for dissociation with rate parameters derived exclusively from quasiclassical trajectory calculations on ab initio potential energy surfaces. Analysis of the trajectory dataset for reactant O2 and N2 diatoms sampled from Boltzmann internal energy distributions over a wide T,Tv range indicates that a modified version of the classical Marrone-Treanor two-temperature model captures the most relevant physics of shock-heated dissociating diatomic species very well. We find that simple correction factors account for non-Boltzmann depletion effects observed in direct molecular simulations employing the same potentials. The concentration-dependent functional form proposed for these correction factors ensures that depletion effects vanish at chemical equilibrium. Based on comparisons in isothermal and adiabatic heat baths we verify that the resulting two-temperature dissociation model accurately reproduces all major features observed in the direct molecular simulations, while remaining computationally inexpensive enough for large-scale computational fluid dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Attosecond-resolved probing of recolliding electron wave packets in liquids and aqueous solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-harmonic spectroscopy (HHS) in liquids promises real-time access to ultrafast electronic dynamics in the native environment of chemical and biological processes. While electron recollision has been established as the dominant mechanism of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in liquids, resolving the underlying electron dynamics has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate attosecond-resolved measurements of recolliding electron wave packets, extending HHS from neat liquids to aqueous solutions. Using phase-controlled two-colour fields, we observe a linear scaling of the two-colour delay that maximizes even-harmonic emission with photon energy, yielding slopes of 208+/-55 as/eV in ethanol and 124+/-42 as/eV in water, the latter matching ab initio simulations (125+/-48 as/eV). In aqueous salt solutions, we uncover interference minima whose appearance depends on solute type and concentration, arising from destructive interference between solute and solvent emission. By measuring the relative phase of solvent and solute HHG, we retrieve a variation of electron transit time by 113+/-32 as/eV, consistent with our neat-liquid results. These findings establish HHS as a powerful attosecond-resolved probe of electron dynamics in disordered media, opening transformative opportunities for studying ultrafast processes such as energy transfer, charge migration, and proton dynamics in liquids and solutions.</description>

In conventional QSCI, Slater determinants used for the wave function expansion are sampled by iteratively performing approximate wave function preparation and subsequent measurement in the computational basis, and then the subspace Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized on a classical computer. In this approach, preparation of a high-quality approximate wave function is necessary to accurately compute total energies. Here we propose a Hamiltonian simulation-based QSCI (HSB-QSCI) to avoid this difficulty, by sampling the Slater determinants from quantum states generated by the real-time evolution of approximate wave functions. We provide numerical simulations for the lowest spin-singlet and triplet states of oligoacenes (benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene), phenylene-1,4-dinitrene, and hexa-1,2,3,4,5-pentaene. We found that the HSB-QSCI is applicable not only to molecules where the Hartree--Fock provides a good approximation of the ground state, but also to strongly correlated systems where preparing a high-quality approximate wave function is hard. Hardware demonstrations of the HSB-QSCI are also reported for carbyne molecules expressed by up to 36 qubits, using an IBM Quantum processor. The HSB-QSCI captures more than 99.18\% of the correlation energies in the active space by considering about 1\% of all the Slater determinants in 36 qubit systems, illustrating the ability of the proposed method to efficiently consider important electronic configurations.</description>

      <title>Mol-LLaMA: Towards General Understanding of Molecules in Large Molecular Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13449</link>

Abstract: Understanding molecules is key to understanding organisms and driving advances in drug discovery, requiring interdisciplinary knowledge across chemistry and biology. Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in task transfer, they often struggle to accurately analyze molecular features due to limited knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this issue, we present Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules and exhibits explainability and reasoning ability. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental molecular features, taking into account the essential abilities for molecular reasoning. Further, to improve molecular understanding, we propose a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and providing informative responses, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.

      <title>Fokker-Planck Score Learning: Efficient Free-Energy Estimation under Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate free-energy estimation is essential in molecular simulation, yet the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) commonly used in computer simulations have rarely been explicitly exploited. Equilibrium methods such as umbrella sampling, metadynamics, and adaptive biasing force require extensive sampling, while non-equilibrium pulling with Jarzynski's equality suffers from poor convergence due to exponential averaging. Here, we introduce a physics-informed, score-based diffusion framework: by mapping PBC simulations onto a Brownian particle in a periodic potential, we derive the Fokker-Planck steady-state score that directly encodes free-energy gradients. A neural network is trained on non-equilibrium trajectories to learn this score, providing a principled scheme to efficiently reconstruct the potential of mean force (PMF). On benchmark periodic potentials and small-molecule membrane permeation, our method is up to one order of magnitude more efficient than umbrella sampling.</description>
