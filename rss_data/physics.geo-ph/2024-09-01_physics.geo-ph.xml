      <title>Composition, Structure and Origin of the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16840</link>

Abstract: Here we critically examine the geophysical and geochemical properties of the Moon in order to identify the extent to which dynamical scenarios satisfy these observations. New joint inversions of existing lunar geophysical data (mean mass, moment of inertia, and tidal response) assuming a laterally- and vertically homogeneous lunar mantle show that, in all cases, a core with a radius of 300$\pm$20 km ($\sim$0.8 to 1.5 % the mass of the Moon) is required. However, an Earth-like Mg# (0.89) in the lunar mantle results in core densities (7800$\pm$100 kg/m$^3$) consistent with that of Fe-Ni alloy, whereas FeO-rich compositions (Mg# = 0.80--0.84) require lower densities (6100$\pm$800 kg/m$^3$). Geochemically, we use new data on mare basalts to reassess the bulk composition of the Moon for 70 elements, and show that the lunar core likely formed near 5 GPa, 2100 K and $\sim$1 log unit below the iron-w\"ustite buffer. Moreover, the Moon is depleted relative to the Earth's mantle in elements with volatilities higher than that of Li, with this volatile loss likely having occurred at low temperatures (1400$\pm$100 K), consistent with mass-dependent stable isotope fractionation of moderately volatile elements (e.g., Zn, K, Rb). The identical nucleosynthetic (O, Cr, Ti) and radiogenic (W) isotope compositions of the lunar and terrestrial mantles, strongly suggest the two bodies were made from the same material, rather than from an Earth-like impactor. Rb-Sr in FANs and Lu-Hf and Pb-Pb zircon ages point Moon formation close to $\sim$4500 Ma. Taken together, there is no unambiguous geochemical or isotopic evidence for the role of an impactor in the formation of the Moon, implying perfect equilibration between the proto-Earth and Moon-forming material or alternative scenarios for its genesis.</description>

      <title>Microstructural characterization to reveal evidence of shock deformation in a Campo del Cielo meteorite fragment</title>

Abstract: The study of meteorites and their microstructures is a topic which spans multiple fields of research, such as meteoritics and materials science. For materials scientists and engineers, the extreme and unusual conditions which these microstructures form allow for insight into materials which would exist at the edge of our thermomechanical processing abilities. One such microstructure found in low-shock event iron meteorites is Neumann bands. These bands are an array of lenticular deformation twins that form throughout the Fe-Ni matrix with numerous intersections, resulting in many high stress and strain regions within the material's surface. The existence of these regions and the shocks that formed them encourage atypical strain accommodating mechanisms and structural changes of the material. However, direct investigation of the deformation twin intersections and the microstructural behaviour in and around these regions has been limited. In this work, investigation of these regions in a Campo del Cielo meteorite fragment, with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and forescatter electron (FSE) imaging, revealed two primary findings: high-intensity pattern doubling mirrored across the {110} band at twin-twin intersection and microband formation across the sample surface, which suggest multilayer twinning and constraint of the crystal structure at points of twin-twin intersection. Microbands were found to form along the {110} plane and in regions near Neumann bands. The simultaneous existence of Neumann bands (microtwins) and microbands is presented here for a BCC material, and it is believed the Neumann band and microbands formed during different types and/or shock events. The presence of both Neumann bands and microbands within a BCC iron meteorite is previously unreported and may be valuable in furthering our understanding of shock deformation within iron-based materials.</description>

      <title>Fully Coupled Implicit Hydro-Mechanical Multiphase Flow Simulation in Deformable Porous Media Using DEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of multiphase flow dynamics in porous media is crucial for optimizing subsurface engineering applications like geological carbon sequestration. However, studying the micro-mechanisms of multiphase fluid--grain interactions in the laboratory is challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining mechanical data such as force and displacement. Transitional discrete element method models coupled with pore networks offer insights into these interactions but struggle with accurate pressure prediction during pore expansion from fracturing and efficient simulation during the slow drainage of compressible fluids. To address these limitations, we develop an advanced two-way coupled hydro-mechanical discrete element method model that accurately and efficiently captures fluid--fluid and fluid--grain interactions in deformable porous media. Our model integrates an unconditionally stable implicit finite volume approach, enabling significant timesteps for advancing fluids. A pressure-volume iteration scheme dynamically balances injection-induced pressure buildup with substantial pore structure deformation, while flow front-advancing criteria precisely locate the fluid--fluid interface and adaptively refine timesteps, particularly when capillary effects block potential flow paths. The model is validated against benchmark Hele-Shaw experiments in both rigid and deformable porous media, providing quantitative insights into the micro-mechanisms governing multiphase flow. For the first time, grain-scale inputs such as viscous and capillary pressures, energies, contact forces, and flow resistances are utilized to provide a detailed understanding of micro-scale fluid--fluid and fluid--grain flow patterns and their transitions.</description>

      <title>Joining simplified physics models with coarse grids to speed-up intractable 3D time-domain simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full 3D modelling of time-domain electromagnetic data requires tremendous computational resources. Consequently, simplified physics models prevail in geophysics, using a much faster but approximate (1D) forward model. We propose to join the accuracy of a 1D simplified physics model with the flexibility of coarse grids to reduce the modelling errors, thereby avoiding the full 3D accurate simulations. We exemplify our approach on airborne time-domain electromagnetic data, comparing the modelling error with the standard 3% measurement noise. We find that the modelling error depends on the specific subsurface model (electrical conductivity values, angle representing the deviation of the 1D assumption) and the specific (temporal) discretization. In our example, the computation time is decreased by a factor of 27. Our approach can offer an alternative for surrogate models, statistical relations derived from large 3D datasets, to replace the full 3D simulations.</description>
