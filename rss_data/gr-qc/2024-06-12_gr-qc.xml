      <title>Holographic description of unified early and late universe in viscous mimetic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the mimetic matter model proposed by Chamseddine and Mukhanov (J. High Energy Phys. 11, 135, 2013), utilizing the holographic principle to coherently describe both the early and late universe when bulk viscosity is present in the inhomogeneous equation of state. Our examination of the universe's evolution is based on the generalized infrared-cutoff holographic dark energy model detailed by Nojiri and Odintsov (Eur. Phys. J. C 77, 528, 2017) within the context of the flat FRW model. From a holographic perspective, we derive the energy conservation equation incorporating mimetic matter through a viscous holographic fluid model. Furthermore, we analyze various scenarios of bulk viscosity by assuming a constant equation of state parameter and derive the infrared cut-off expression in terms of the particle horizon. We demonstrate that within the framework of mimetic gravity, there is a class of solutions comparable to those in General Relativity, with an additional contribution from a non-relativistic mimetic matter component. These solutions can effectively describe dark matte</description>

      <title>Probing fundamental physics with Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals: a full Bayesian inference for scalar charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are key sources for the future space-based gravitational wave detector LISA, and are considered promising probes of fundamental physics. Here, we present the first complete Bayesian analysis of EMRI signals in theories with an additional massless scalar, which could arise in an extension of General Relativity or of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. We develop a waveform model accurate at adiabatic order for equatorial eccentric orbits around spinning black holes. Using full Bayesian inference, we forecast LISA's ability to probe the presence of new fundamental fields with EMRI observations.</description>

      <title>Universal Relations for Rotating Scalar and Vector Boson Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic stars represent a hypothetical exotic type of compact stellar objects that could be observed from the gravitational signal of coalescing binaries in current and future gravitational wave detectors. There are two main families of bosonic stars, which depend on the nature that governs the particles that build them: Einstein-Klein-Gordon and Proca Stars. We study the multipolar structure for both families of rotating objects, using realistic potentials with the aim of finding possible universal relations and, thus, a method that allows us to distinguish between these and other compact objects in the gravitational wave paradigm. We also show how certain relevant observables can be obtained for these hypothetical but well-motivated astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Tests of general relativity at the fourth post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently computed post-Newtonian (PN) gravitational-wave phasing up to 4.5PN order accounts for several novel physical effects in compact binary dynamics such as the {\it tail of the memory, tails of tails of tails and tails of mass hexadecupole and current octupole moments}. Therefore, it is instructive to assess the ability of current-generation (2G) detectors such as LIGO/Virgo, next-generation (XG) ground-based gravitational wave detectors such as Cosmic Explorer/Einstein Telescope and space-based detectors like LISA to test the predictions of PN theory at these orders. Employing Fisher information matrix, we find that the projected bounds on the deviations from the logarithmic PN phasing coefficient at 4PN is ${\cal O}(10^{-2})$ and ${\cal O}(10^{-1})$ for XG and 2G detectors, respectively. Similarly, the projected bounds on other three PN coefficients that appear at 4PN and 4.5PN are ${\cal O}(10^{-1}-10^{-2})$ for XG and ${\cal O}(1)$ for 2G detectors. LISA observations of supermassive BHs could provide the tightest constraints on these four parameters ranging from ${\cal O}(10^{-4}-10^{-2})$. The variation in these bounds are studied as a function of total mass and the mass ratio of the binaries in quasi-circular orbits. These new tests are unique probes of higher order nonlinear interactions in compact binary dynamics and their consistency with the predictions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Strong deflection limit analysis of black hole lensing in inhomogeneous plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates gravitational lensing effects in the presence of plasma in the strong deflection limit, which corresponds to light rays circling around a compact object and forming higher-order images. While previous studies of this case have predominantly focused on the deflection of light in a vacuum or in the presence of a homogeneous plasma, this work introduces an analytical treatment for the influence of a non-uniform plasma. After recalling the exact expression for the deflection angle of photons in a static, asymptotically flat and spherically symmetric spacetime filled with cold non-magnetized plasma, a strong deflection limit analysis is presented. Particular attention is then given to the case of a Schwarzschild spacetime, where the deflection angle of photons for different density profiles of plasma is obtained. Moreover, perturbative results for an arbitrary power-law radial density profile are also presented. These formulae are then applied to the calculation of the positions and magnifications of higher-order images, concluding that the presence of a non-uniform plasma reduces both their angular size and their magnifications, at least within the range of the power-law indices considered. These findings contribute to the understanding of gravitational lensing in the presence of plasma, offering a versatile framework applicable to various asymptotically flat and spherically symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>On the Effects of Non-metricity in an Averaged Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the covariant averaging scheme of macroscopic gravity, the process of averaging breaks the metricity of geometry. We reinterpret the back-reaction within macroscopic gravity in terms of the non-metricity of averaged geometry. This interpretation extends the effect of back-reaction beyond mere dynamics to kinematics of geodesic bundles. With a 1+3 decomposition of the spacetime, we analyse how geometric flows are modified by deriving the Raychaudhuri and Sachs equations. We also present the modified forms of Gauss and Codazzi equations. Finally, we derive an expression for the angular diameter distance in Friedmann Lema\^itre Robertson Walker universe and show that non-metricity modifies it only through the Hubble parameter. Thus, we caution against overestimating the influence of back-reaction on the distances.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacetime wormholes are evidently an essential component of the construction of a time machine. Within the context of general relativity, such objects require, for their formation, exotic matter -- matter that violates at least one of the standard energy conditions. Here, we explore the possibility that higher-curvature gravity theories might permit the construction of a wormhole without any matter at all. In particular, we consider the simplest form of a generalized quasi topological theory in four spacetime dimensions, known as Einsteinian Cubic Gravity. This theory has a number of promising features that make it an interesting phenomenological competitor to general relativity, including having non-hairy generalizations of the Schwarzschild black hole and linearized equations of second order around maximally symmetric backgrounds. By matching series solutions near the horizon and at large distances, we find evidence that strong asymptotically AdS wormhole solutions can be constructed, with strong curvature effects ensuring that the wormhole throat can exist.</description>

      <title>Resonant behavior and stability of a linear three-mirror cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of Fabry-Perot cavities in gravitational-wave detectors has been pivotal to improving their sensitivity, allowing the observation of an increasing number of cosmological events with higher signal-to-noise ratio. Notably, Fabry-Perot cavities play a key role in the frequency-dependent squeezing technique, which provides a reduction of quantum noise over the whole observation frequency spectrum. In this context, linear three-mirror cavities could be of interest because of the additional control that they can provide.
  In this paper, we develop a complete model to describe the stability behavior and the properties of transmitted and reflected fields of a linear three-mirror cavity aiming to be used for design purposes. In particular, simulations are carried out to show the evolution of the characteristic "double-peak" as a function of cavity parameters, which is one of the key features of this system. We show that the double-peak shape is almost freely adjustable, either in terms of spacing between maxima, their relative height and their intrinsic width. This is made possible by changing the mirrors' reflectivity coefficients and their spacing. However, the amount of achievable realistic configurations is limited by the stability conditions of the cavity. In particular, if the middle mirror is not close enough to the center of the cavity, it could be difficult to obtain a stable three-mirror cavity. Different geometries have been studied to obtain a stable cavity system.</description>

      <title>Supertranslation ambiguity in post-Minkowskian expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supertranslation ambiguity of angular momentum is a long-standing problem in general relativity. In the context of post-Minkowskian expansion, the supertranslation ambiguity arises the puzzle of the angular momentum loss to start at $\cO(G^2)$ or at $\cO(G^3)$ in gravitational scattering. In this paper, we propose a generic prescription to fix the supertranslation ambiguity at the linear order in post-Minkowskian expansion which will uniquely determine the angular momentum loss.</description>

      <title>Light rings and causality for nonsingular ultracompact objects sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study observational signatures of nonsingular ultracompact objects regularized by nonlinear electrodynamics. The phenomenon of birefringence causes photons of different polarizations to propagate with respect to two distinct metrics, which manifests itself in the appearance of additional light rings surrounding the ultracompact object. We analyze the observational consequences of this result and illustrate our findings based on three regular black hole models commonly considered in the literature. We find that, for certain ranges of the minimal length scale parameter, nonsingular horizonless ultracompact objects may possess an odd number of light rings, contrary to what is expected based on topological arguments premised on matter satisfying the null energy condition. We comment on the interrelation of this result with respect to the necessity of violating the null energy condition for the formation of nonsingular ultracompact objects via gravitational collapse and discuss the viability of nonlinear electrodynamics as an effective description of their properties. In addition, we compare the phase velocities of polarized light rays propagating in nonsingular geometries sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics to the corresponding phase velocity in the Schwarzschild spacetime and demonstrate that regularizing the singularity by means of a theory that does not adhere to the Maxwell weak-field limit may lead to the emergence of acausal regions.</description>

      <title>A new type of $f(\mathcal{T})$ gravity from Barrow entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, two originally separate adjustments for the Friedmann equations are concurrently considered. Firstly, the fractal structure of the black hole horizon region is imposed by the Barrow entropy. The second adjustment is the $f(\mathcal{T})$ gravity, which is based on a teleparallel framework generalization of the Einstein-Hilbert action, where $\mathcal{T}$ is the scalar torsion. This can be considered as a Barrow entropy modification of the $f(\mathcal{T})$ gravity thus yielding a new model. Gravity thermodynamics hypothesis principles are used to integrate these two models under a unified framework. We derive the modified Friedmann equation and note the corrections obtained. To understand the implications of such dual modifications, an application is analyzed and a particular $f(\mathcal{T})$ toy model is chosen for the purpose. The equation of the state parameter of the resulting model, the dimensionless density parameters of matter and dark energy, and the deceleration parameter are explored to check the viability of the new model. A discussion of the dynamic evolution of the universe follows from these results. It is seen that the results comply with the observations. The newly developed model is promising and demands further study.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the effect of higher dimensions on the black hole silhouette, deflection angles, and PINN approximated quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher dimensions on the properties of Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black holes, focusing on the photonsphere, black hole shadow, deflection angles, and quasinormal modes (QNMs). We find that these properties diminish as the dimensionality ($n$) of the black hole increases. Analysis of the shadow radius measured by the Event Horizon Telescope suggests non-integer dimensions around $n\lessgtr4$. We derive an analytic formula for the weak field deflection angle, highlighting the need for advanced sensitive detection devices to observe lensed images influenced by higher dimensions. Our study of QNMs using physics-informed neural networks and the WKB method reveals a convergence towards known relationships between QNM frequencies and photon-sphere orbit frequencies. Despite the energetic nature of perturbing fields in higher dimensions, their damping increases. This suggests a complex interplay between dimensionality and the dynamics of black hole phenomena.</description>

      <title>Cosmological particle production in a quantum field simulator as a quantum mechanical scattering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of quantum field excitations or particles in cosmological spacetimes is a hallmark prediction of curved quantum field theory. The generation of cosmological perturbations from quantum fluctuations in the early universe constitutes an important application. The problem can be quantum-simulated in terms of structure formation in an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with time-dependent s-wave scattering length. Here, we explore a mapping between cosmological particle production in general (D+1)-dimensional spacetimes and scattering problems described by the non-relativistic stationary Schr\"odinger equation in one dimension. Through this mapping, intuitive explanations for emergent spatial structures in both the BEC and the cosmological system can be obtained for a large class of analogue cosmological scenarios, ranging from power-law expansions to periodic modulations. The investigated cosmologies and their scattering analogues are tuned to be implemented in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum field simulator.</description>

      <title>Quadratic perturbations of the Schwarzschild black hole: The algebraically special sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quadratic algebraically special perturbations (ASPs) of the Schwarzschild black hole. Their dynamics are derived from the expansion up to second order in perturbation of the most general algebraically special twisting vacuum solution of general relativity. Following this strategy, we present analytical expressions for the axial-axial, polar-polar and polar-axial source terms entering in the dynamical equations. We show that these complicated inhomogeneous equations can be solved analytically and we present explicit expressions for the profiles of the quadratic ASPs. As expected, they exhibit exponential growth both at the past and future horizons even in the non-linear regime. We further use this result to analyze the quadratic zero modes and their interpretation in terms of quadratic corrections to mass and spin of the Schwarzschild black hole. The present work provides a direct extension beyond the linear regime of the original work by Couch and Newman.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents analytical black hole solutions for a coupled Einstein-Born-Infeld-Scalar gravity system in AdS spacetime with two different non-minimal coupling functions $f(z)$. For both solutions, we establish the regularity of the scalar field and curvature scalars outside the horizon. For one of the considered coupling cases, thermodynamic analysis in the canonical ensemble reveals stability across all temperatures, while the other case exhibits the Hawking/Page phase transition between the stable large phase of the black hole and thermal-AdS. We investigate the effect of the scalar hair parameter and black hole charge on the phase transition temperature and observe that the critical values of the scalar hair and the charge parameters constrain the feasibility of Hawking/Page phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain novel traversable, static, and spherically symmetric wormhole solutions, derived from the effective energy density and isotropic pressure resulting from the Casimir effect, corrected by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC). The goal is to explore the interplay between competing quantum gravity effects and quantum vacuum phenomena in the emergence of non-trivial spacetime structures. We examine features such as traversability, embedding diagrams, energy conditions, curvature, and stability of the obtained solutions. Additionally, we analyze the junction conditions required to integrate the wormhole spacetime with an external Schwarzschild spacetime and calculate the amount of exotic matter needed to maintain the wormhole. Finally, we evaluate the conditions under which this latter remains visible or is hidden by the event horizon associated with the Schwarzschild spacetime.</description>

Abstract: Geodesic scattering of a test particle off a Schwarzschild black hole can be parameterized by the speed-at-infinity $v$ and the impact parameter $b$, with a "separatrix", $b=b_c(v)$, marking the threshold between scattering and plunge. Near the separatrix, the scattering angle diverges as $\sim\log(b-b_c)$. The self-force correction to the scattering angle (at fixed $v,b$) diverges even faster, like $\sim A_1(v)b_c/(b-b_c)$. Here we numerically calculate the divergence coefficient $A_1(v)$ in a scalar-charge toy model. We then use our knowledge of $A_1(v)$ to inform a resummation of the post-Minkowskian expansion for the scattering angle, and demonstrate that the resummed series agrees remarkably well with numerical self-force results even in the strong-field regime. We propose that a similar resummation technique, applied to a mass particle subject to a gravitational self-force, can significantly enhance the utility and regime of validity of post-Minkowsian calculations for black-hole scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revise general relativity (GR) from the perspective of calculus for moving surfaces (CMS). While GR is intrinsically constructed in pseudo-Riemannian geometry, a complete understanding of moving manifolds requires embedding in a higher dimension. It can only be defined by extrinsic Gaussian differential geometry and its extension to moving surfaces, known as CMS. Following the recent developments in CMS, we present a new derivation for the Einstein field equation and demonstrate the fundamental limitations of GR. Explicitly, we show that GR is an approximation of moving manifold equations and only stands for dominantly compressible space-time. While GR, with a cosmological constant, predicts an expanding universe, CMS shows fluctuation between inflation and collapse. We also show that the specific solution to GR with cosmological constant is constant mean curvature shapes. In the end, by presenting calculations for incompressible but deforming two-dimensional spheres, we indicate that material points moving with constant spherical velocities move like waves, strongly suggesting a resolution of the wave-corpuscular dualism problem.</description>

      <title>Quasistationary hair for binary black hole initial data in scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent efforts to numerically simulate compact objects in alternative theories of gravity have largely focused on the time-evolution equations. Another critical aspect is the construction of constraint-satisfying initial data with precise control over the properties of the systems under consideration. Here, we augment the extended conformal thin sandwich framework to construct quasistationary initial data for black hole systems in scalar Gauss-Bonnet theory and numerically implement it in the open-source SpECTRE code. Despite the resulting elliptic system being singular at black hole horizons, we demonstrate how to construct numerical solutions that extend smoothly across the horizon. We obtain quasistationary scalar hair configurations in the test-field limit for black holes with linear/angular momentum as well as for black hole binaries. For isolated black holes, we explicitly show that the scalar profile obtained is stationary by evolving the system in time and compare against previous formulations of scalar Gauss-Bonnet initial data. In the case of the binary, we find that the scalar hair near the black holes can be markedly altered by the presence of the other black hole. The initial data constructed here enables targeted simulations in scalar Gauss-Bonnet simulations with reduced initial transients.</description>

      <title>Einstein Gravity from Einstein Action: Counterterms and Covariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field equations of general relativity can be derived from the Einstein action, which is quadratic in connection coefficients, rather than the standard action involving the Gibbons-Hawking-York term and counterterm. We show that it is possible to construct a new counterterm directly for the Einstein action, which removes divergences and naturally introduces a flat reference spacetime. The total action is then covariant under simultaneous transformation of both the spacetime and reference tetrads, and argue that this is analogous to the Gibbons-Hawking action. We then explore different perspectives arising naturally from different uses of the reference tetrad, and explore implications of viewing gravity as fundamentally described in terms of non-covariant connection coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graviton S-matrix has a famous soft pole. We show that the S-matrix for cylindrical gravitational waves has a soft zero. The soft pole for ordinary gravitons comes from a Ward identity for supertranslation symmetry at asymptotic infinity. We show that the soft zero for cylindrical gravitational waves comes from a Ward identity for Geroch symmetry at asymptotic infinity. Because it is a zero rather than a pole, there is no memory effect. Overall, this soft zero is a manifestation of Geroch symmetry and of the extraordinary simplicity of cylindrical gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a scenario with a transient phase of cosmological acceleration that could potentially be realized in asymptotic corners of String Theory moduli space. A very steep scalar potential is temporarily stabilized by the effect of a nonzero density of heavy states, leading to acceleration, in what amounts to a cosmological version of the Chameleon mechanism. The density of heavy states is diluted by cosmological expansion, weakening their effect. After roughly one $e$-fold their effect can no longer stabilize the potential, and the accelerating phase ends. We also study a scenario where there is no potential and the transient acceleration is achieved by the counterbalancing effects of light and heavy towers of states. In both cases we show that it is not possible to obtain more than $\mathcal{O}(1)$ $e$-folds without transplanckian field excursions. We also discuss the general EFT constraints on these models and explore a number of first attempts at concrete embeddings of the scenario in String Theory. These all turn out to face significant challenges.</description>

      <title>Stellar-Mass Black Holes with Dark Matter Mini-Spikes: Evidence of a Primordial Origin?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of three nearby black hole low-mass X-ray binaries have suggested possible evidence of dark matter density spikes. It has long been established that cold dark matter should form dense spikes around intermediate-mass and supermassive black holes due to adiabatic compression of the surrounding dark matter halo. Lighter black holes formed from stellar collapse, however, are not expected to develop such spikes, and so it is unclear how the stellar-mass black holes in these binaries could have acquired such features. Given that primordial black holes are expected to form ultra-dense dark matter mini-spikes, in this Letter we explore the possibility that these stellar-mass black holes may actually have a primordial origin.</description>

      <title>The cosmology of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity: constraining the background and perturbed dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe and the evolution of cosmic structures within the context of a specific \( f(R, L_m) \) gravity model, formulated as \( f(R, L_m) = \lambda R + \beta L_m^\alpha + \eta \). To study the cosmological viability of the model, we employed the latest cosmic measurement datasets: i) 57 observational Hubble parameter data points (\texttt{OHD}); ii) 1048 distance moduli data points (\texttt{SNIa}); iii) a combined dataset (\texttt{OHD+SNIa}); and large scale structure datasets, including iv) 14 growth rate data points (\texttt{f}); and v) 30 redshift space distortion data points (\texttt{f}$\sigma_8$). These datasets facilitated the constraint of the \( f(R, L_m) \)-gravity model via MCMC simulations, followed by a comparative analysis with the \(\Lambda\)CDM model. A comprehensive statistical analysis has been conducted to evaluate the \( f(R, L_m) \)-gravity model's efficacy in explaining both the accelerated expansion of the universe and the growth of cosmic structures.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cosmological Model Selection with Interpretable Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach using neural networks (NNs) to differentiate between cosmological models, especially in the case where they are nested and the additional model parameters are close to zero, making it difficult to discriminate them with traditional approaches. Our method complements Bayesian analyses for cosmological model selection, which heavily depend on the chosen priors and average the unnormalized posterior over potentially large prior volumes. By analyzing simulated realistic data sets of the growth rate of the large scale structure (LSS) of the Universe, based on current galaxy-clustering survey specifications, for the cosmological constant and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model, we demonstrate the potential of NNs to enhance the extraction of meaningful information from cosmological LSS data. We find that the NN can successfully distinguish between $\Lambda$CDM and the $f(R)$ models, by predicting the correct model with approximately $97\%$ overall accuracy, thus demonstrating that NNs can maximise the potential of current and next generation surveys to probe for deviations from general relativity.</description>

Abstract: We extend the analytic description of complex no-boundary solutions in the context of inflation to large field models. We discuss the Kontsevich-Segal-Witten (KSW) criterion and find it is satisfied in small field models, while in large field models it depends on an integral involving $V'(\phi)$ over the range of inflation. It follows that the criterion does not truly constrain inflationary phenomenology since one can complete any inflaton potential beyond observable scales so as to satisfy KSW.</description>

Abstract: We simulate the response of a Storage Ring Gravitational-Wave Observatory (SRGO) to astrophysical millihertz (mHz) gravitational waves (GWs), numerically obtaining its sensitivity curve and optimal choices for some controllable experiment parameters. We also generate synthetic noisy GW data and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to perform parameter estimation of the source properties and their degeneracies. We show that a single SRGO could potentially localize the GW source in the sky using Earth's rotation. We also study the source sky localization area, mass and distance estimation errors as functions of noise, data sampling rate, and observing time. Finally, we discuss, along with its implications, the capacity of an SRGO to detect and constrain the parameters of millihertz GW events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on how the production and polarization of gravitational waves are affected by spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking, which is driven by a self-interacting vector field. Specifically, we examine the impact of a smooth quadratic potential and a non-minimal coupling, discussing the constraints and causality features of the linearized Einstein equation. To analyze the polarization states of a plane wave, we consider a fixed vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the vector field. Remarkably, we verify that a space-like background vector field modifies the polarization plane and introduces a longitudinal degree of freedom. In order to investigate the Lorentz violation effect on the quadrupole formula, we use the modified Green function. Finally, we show that the space-like component of the background field leads to a third-order time derivative of the quadrupole moment, and the bounds for the Lorentz-breaking coefficients are estimated as well.</description>

Abstract: A fully relativistic three-dimensional Cauchy-characteristic matching (CCM) algorithm is implemented for physical degrees of freedom in a numerical relativity code SpECTRE. The method is free of approximations and can be applied to any physical system. We test the algorithm with various scenarios involving smooth data, including the propagation of Teukolsky waves within a flat background, the perturbation of a Kerr black hole with a Teukolsky wave, and the injection of a gravitational-wave pulse from the characteristic grid. Our investigations reveal no numerical instabilities in the simulations. In addition, the tests indicate that the CCM algorithm effectively directs characteristic information into the inner Cauchy system, yielding higher precision in waveforms and smaller violations of Bondi-gauge constraints, especially when the outer boundary of the Cauchy evolution is at a smaller radius.</description>

Abstract: We study the ringdown signal of black holes formed in prompt-collapse binary neutron star mergers. We analyze data from $47$ numerical relativity simulations. We show that the $(\ell=2,m=2)$ and $(\ell=2,m=1)$ multipoles of the gravitational wave signal are well fitted by decaying damped exponentials, as predicted by black-hole perturbation theory. We show that the ratio of the amplitude in the two modes depends on the progenitor binary mass ratio $q$ and reduced tidal parameter $\tilde\Lambda$. Unfortunately, the numerical uncertainty in our data is too large to fully quantify this dependency. If confirmed, these results will enable novel tests of general relativity in the presence of matter with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

Abstract: Highly magnetized neutron stars exhibit the vacuum non-linear electrodynamics effects, which can be well described using the one-loop effective action for quantum electrodynamics. In this context, we study the propagation and polarization of pulsar radio emission, based on the post-Maxwellian Lagrangian from the Heisenberg-Euler-Schwinger action. Given the refractive index obtained from this Lagrangian, we determine the leading-order corrections to both the propagation and polarization vectors due to quantum refraction via perturbation analysis. In addition, the effects on the orthogonality between the propagation and polarization vectors and the Faraday rotation angle, all due to quantum refraction are investigated. Furthermore, from the dual refractive index and the associated polarization modes, we discuss quantum birefringence, with the optical phenomenology analogous to its classical counterpart.</description>

      <title>Striking the right tone: toward a self-consistent framework for measuring black hole ringdowns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ringdown portion of a binary black hole merger consists of a sum of modes, each containing an infinite number of tones that are exponentially damped sinusoids. In principle, these can be measured as gravitational-waves with observatories like LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, however in practice it is unclear how many tones can be meaningfully resolved. We investigate the consistency and resolvability of the overtones of the quadrupolar $\ell = m = 2$ mode by starting at late times when the gravitational waveform is expected to be well-approximated by the $\ell m n = 220$ tone alone. We present a Bayesian inference framework to measure the tones in numerical relativity data. We measure tones at different start times, checking for consistency: we classify a tone as stably recovered if and only if the 95\% credible intervals for amplitude and phase at time $t$ overlap with the credible intervals at all subsequent times. We test a set of tones including the first four overtones of the fundamental mode and the 320 tone and find that the 220 and 221 tones can be measured consistently with the inclusion of additional overtones. The 222 tone measurements can be stabilised when we include the 223 tone, but only in a narrow time window, after which it is too weak to measure. The 223 tone recovery appears to be unstable, and does not become stable with the introduction of the 224 tone. We find that $N=3$ tones can be stably recovered simultaneously. However, when analysing $N \geq 4$ tones, the amplitude of one tone is consistent with zero. Thus, within our framework, one can identify only $N=3$ tones with non-zero amplitude that are simultaneously stable.</description>

      <title>Coherence limits in lattice atom interferometry at the one-minute scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum metrology and quantum simulation, a coherent non-classical state must be manipulated before unwanted interactions with the environment lead to decoherence. In atom interferometry, the non-classical state is a spatial superposition, where each atom coexists in multiple locations as a collection of phase-coherent partial wavepackets. These states enable precise measurements in fundamental physics and inertial sensing. However, atom interferometers usually use atomic fountains, where the available interrogation time is limited to around 3 seconds for a 10 m fountain. Here, we realise an atom interferometer with a spatial superposition state that is maintained for as long as 70 seconds. We analyse the theoretical and experimental limits to coherence arising from collective dephasing of the atomic ensemble. This reveals that the decoherence rate slows down markedly at hold times that exceed tens of seconds. These gains in coherence may enable gravimetry measurements, searches for fifth forces or fundamental probes into the non-classical nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>The Ternary Structure of Lie Algebroid Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the heap of linear connections on anchored vector bundles and Lie algebroids. Naturally, this covers the example of affine connections on a manifold. We present some new interpretations of classical results via this ternary structure of connections. Endomorphisms of linear connections are studied, and their ternary structure, in particular the endomorphism truss, is explicitly presented. We remark that the use of ternary structures in differential geometry is novel and that the endomorphism truss of linear connections provides a concrete geometric example of a truss.</description>

      <title>Space-based Gravitational Wave Observatories Will Be Able to Use Eccentricity to Unveil Stellar-mass Binary Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measurement of eccentricity would provide strong constraints on the formation channel of stellar-mass binary black holes. However, current ground-based gravitational wave detectors will, in most cases, not be able to measure eccentricity due to orbital circularization. Space-based observatories, in contrast, can determine binary eccentricity at 0.01Hz to $e_{0.01}\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^{-4}) $. Directly observing stellar-mass binary black holes with space-based observatories remains a challenging problem. However, observing such systems with ground-based detectors allows the possibility to identify the same signal in archival data from space-based observatories in the years previous. Since ground-based detectors provide little constraints on eccentricity, including eccentricity in the archival search will increase the required number of filter waveforms for the archival search by 5 orders of magnitudes [from $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^3)$ to $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^8)$], and will correspondingly need $ \sim8\times10^5 $ core hours (and $ \sim 10^5$ GB of memory), even for a mild upper limit on eccentricity of $0.1$. In this work, we have constructed the first template bank for an archival search of space-based gravitational wave detectors, including eccentricity. We have demonstrated that even though the inclusion of eccentricity brings extra computational burden, an archival search including eccentricity will be feasible in the time frame of planned space-based observatories, and will provide strong constraints on the eccentricities of stellar-mass binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Half the Schwarzschild Entropy From Strominger and Vafa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a regular bound state of two extremal black holes in type IIB supergravity with opposite charges. The bound state resembles the Schwarzschild black hole from the asymptotics to the photon ring and has the same mass and charges as the Schwarzschild black hole. On the one hand, we show that the bound-state entropy admits a microscopic description in terms of branes and antibranes in string theory. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the entropy approaches half of the Schwarzschild entropy as the mass becomes significantly larger than the Kaluza-Klein scales used to regularize the geometry. This opens up the possibility of a brane/antibrane interpretation of the Schwarzschild entropy in string theory.</description>

      <title>The interacting vacuum and tensions: a comparison of theoretical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse three interacting vacuum dark energy models with the aim of exploring whether the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions can be simultaneously resolved in such models. We present the first ever derivation of the covariant gauge-invariant perturbation formalism for the interacting vacuum scenario, and, for the sub-class of geodesic cold dark matter models, connect the evolution of perturbation variables in this approach to the familiar cosmological observables. We show how $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ evolve in three interacting vacuum models: firstly, a simple linear coupling between the vacuum and cold dark matter; secondly, a coupling which mimics the behaviour of a Chaplygin gas; and finally a coupling which mimics the Shan--Chen fluid dark energy model. We identify, if any, the regions of parameter space which would correspond to a simultaneous resolution of both tensions in these models. When constraints from observational data are added, we show how all the models described are constrained to be close to their $\Lambda$CDM limits.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation of IR divergences and holography in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a renormalisation procedure for IR divergences of tree-level in-in late-time de Sitter correlators. These divergences are due to the infinite volume of spacetime and are analogous to the divergences that appear in AdS dealt with by holographic renormalisation. Regulating the theory using dimensional regularisation, we show that one can remove all infinities by adding local counterterms at the future boundary of dS in the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral. The counterterms amount to renormalising the late-time bulk field. We frame the discussion in terms of bulk scalar fields in dS, using tree-level correlators of massless and conformal scalars for illustration. The relation to AdS via analytic continuation is discussed, and we show that different versions of the analytic continuation appearing in the literature are equivalent to each other. In AdS, one needs to add counterterms that are related to conformal anomalies, and also to renormalise the source part of the bulk field. The analytic continuation to dS projects out the traditional AdS counterterms, and links the renormalisation of the sources to the renormalisation of the late-time bulk field. We use these results to establish holographic formulae that relate tree-level dS in-in correlators to CFT correlators at up to four points, and we provide two proofs: one using the connection between the dS wavefunction and the partition function of the dual CFT, and a second by direct evaluation of the in-in correlators using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. The renormalisation of the bulk IR divergences is mapped by these formulae to UV renormalisation of the dual CFT via local counterterms, providing structural support for a possible duality. We also recast the regulated holographic formulae in terms of the AdS amplitudes of shadow fields, but show that this relation breaks down when renormalisation is required.</description>

      <title>Spatially localized scalar structures on hyperscaling violating geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate probe scalar field models preserving covariance on fixed, static background geometries that present hyperscaling violation properties. We develop a first-order framework that rises from restrictions on the dynamical and hyperscaling violating exponents. The results show that stable, analytical kink-like solutions and their respective energy densities can be obtained for a general class of models. In the canonical model, in particular, these solutions minimize the energy of the system.</description>

      <title>Partial tidal disruptions of spinning eccentric white dwarfs by spinning intermediate mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs, $\sim 10^2-10^5M_{\odot}$) are often dubbed as the missing link between stellar mass ($\lesssim 10^2M_{\odot}$) and super-massive ($\gtrsim 10^{5-6} M_{\odot}$) black holes. Observational signatures of these can result from tidal disruptions of white dwarfs (WDs), which would otherwise be captured as a whole by super-massive black holes. Recent observations indicate that IMBHs might be rapidly spinning, while it is also known that isolated white dwarfs might have large spins, with spin periods of the order of minutes. Here, we aim to understand the effects of ``coupling'' between black hole and stellar spin, focussing on the tidal disruption of spinning WDs in the background of spinning IMBHs. Using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, we perform a suite of numerical simulations of partial tidal disruptions, where spinning WDs are in eccentric orbits about spinning IMBHs. We take a hybrid approach, where we integrate the Kerr geodesic equations while being in a regime where we can treat the internal stellar fluid dynamics in the Newtonian limit. We observe strong dependence of quantities like the core mass and the mass differences between tidal tails on such coupled spin effects. However, observable quantities such as mass fallback rates and gravitational wave amplitudes show minimal variations with these, in the parameter range that we consider.</description>

      <title>Sengupta Transformations and Carrollian Relativistic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A detailed and systematic formulation of Carrollian relativity is provided. Based on the transformations, first provided by Sengupta [19], we construct a mapping between Lorentz relativistic and Carrollian relativistic vectors. Using this map the Carroll theory is built from the standard Maxwell action. We show that we get self-consistent equations of motion from the action, both in electric and magnetic limits. We introduce Carroll electric and magnetic fields. A new set of maps is derived that connects Carroll electric and magnetic fields with the usual Maxwell ones and yields Carroll equations in terms of fields. Consistency of results with the potential formulation is shown. Carroll version of symmetries like duality, gauge, shift, Noether and boost are treated in details and their implications elaborated. Especially, boost symmetry provides a link to the various maps used in this paper.</description>

      <title>Towards bit threads in general gravitational spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of the generalized entanglement wedge was recently proposed by Bousso and Penington, which states that any bulk gravitational region $a$ possesses an associated generalized entanglement wedge $E(a) \supset a$ on a static Cauchy surface $M$ in general gravitational spacetimes, where $E(a)$ may contain an entanglement island $I(a)$. It suggests that the fine-grained entropy for bulk region $a$ is given by the generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$. Motivated by this proposal, we extend the quantum bit thread description to general gravitational spacetimes, no longer limited to the AdS spacetime. By utilizing the convex optimization techniques, a dual flow description for the generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$ of a bulk gravitational region $a$ is established on the static Cauchy surface $M$, such that $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$ is equal to the maximum flux of any flow that starts from the boundary $\partial M$ and ends at bulk region $a$, or equivalently, the maximum number of bit threads that connect the boundary $\partial M$ to the bulk region $a$. In addition, the nesting property of flows is also proved. Thus the basic properties of the entropy for bulk regions, i.e. the monotonicity, subadditivity, Araki-Lieb inequality and strong subadditivity, can be verified from flow perspectives by using properties of flows, such as the nesting property. Moreover, in max thread configurations, we find that there exists some lower bounds on the bulk entanglement entropy of matter fields in the region $E(a)\setminus a$, particularly on an entanglement island region $I(a) \subset (E(a)\setminus a)$, as required by the existence of a nontrivial generalized entanglement wedge. Our quantum bit thread formulation may provide a way to investigate more fine-grained entanglement structures in general spacetimes.</description>
