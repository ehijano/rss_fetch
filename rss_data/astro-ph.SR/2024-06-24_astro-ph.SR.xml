      <title>Detecting and Classifying Flares in High-Resolution Solar Spectra with Supervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flares are a well-studied aspect of the Sun's magnetic activity. Detecting and classifying solar flares can inform the analysis of contamination caused by stellar flares in exoplanet transmission spectra. In this paper, we present a standardized procedure to classify solar flares with the aid of supervised machine learning. Using flare data from the RHESSI mission and solar spectra from the HARPS-N instrument, we trained several supervised machine learning models, and found that the best performing algorithm is a C-Support Vector Machine (SVC) with non-linear kernels, specifically Radial Basis Functions (RBF). The best-trained model, SVC with RBF kernels, achieves an average aggregate accuracy score of 0.65, and categorical accuracy scores of over 0.70 for the no-flare and weak-flare classes, respectively. In comparison, a blind classification algorithm would have an accuracy score of 0.33. Testing showed that the model is able to detect and classify solar flares in entirely new data with different characteristics and distributions from those of the training set. Future efforts could focus on enhancing classification accuracy, investigating the efficacy of alternative models, particularly deep learning models, and incorporating more datasets to extend the application of this framework to stars that host exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Continuum And Line Emission From Accretion Shocks at T Tauri Stars I. Correlations With Shock Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourteen models are calculated with the shock velocity ranging from 200 to 330 km s$^{-1}$ and pre-shock hydrogen nucleon density ranging from $2.5\times 10^{12}$ to $4\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$. Among them the summed emergent flux of all spectral lines accounts for about 0.1-0.3 of the total veiling flux. The hydrogen Balmer continuum accounts for 0.17-0.1, while a nearly constant fraction close to 0.5 comes from emission produced by the stellar atmosphere. The main results derived from the veiling continuum energy distributions are two strong correlations: 1) the Balmer jump (BJ) increases as $F_K$, the shock kinetic energy flux, decreases; 2) at a fixed fraction of surface coverage by accretion shocks $r_{\lambda}$, the ratio of veiling to photospheric continuum flux at wavelength $\lambda$, decreases as $F_K$ decreases. Using the BJ - $F_K$ and $r_{4500}$ - $F_K$ relations, the observed excess continua of 10 T Tauri stars are modelled. For BP Tau and 3 Orion stars our accretion luminosities are higher than published values by a factor of a few. For the 6 Chamaeleon I stars our observed accretion luminosities are about 27 - 78\% higher than corresponding published values. Comparison of model results on the HeI $\lambda$5876$~$flux with observed data indicates that, while those stars with dominant $\lambda$5876$~$narrow components can be readily accounted for by the calculated models, those with much stronger broad components cannot, and suggests that for the latter objects the bulk of their excess continua at 5876$~$do not originate from accretion shocks.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an alternative to the Monte Carlo method for dust continuous radiative transfer simulations: the Quasi-Monte Carlo method. We briefly discuss what it is, its history, and possible implementations. We compare the Monte Carlo method with four pseudo-random number generators and five Quasi-Monte Carlo implementations using different low-discrepancy sequences and the Hammersley set. For the comparison, we study different test matter geometries and problems. We present comparison results for single scatterings of radiation from a point source, multiple scatterings of radiation from a point source, and single scatterings of radiation from a spherical star. In all cases, Quasi-Monte Carlo shows better convergence than Monte Carlo. In several test cases, the gain in computation time to achieve a fixed error value reached 40 times. We obtained ten times speed up in many of the considered tests.</description>

      <title>Oscillation Frequencies of Moderately Rotating Delta Scuti Stars: Asymmetric Mode Splittings Due to Non-spherical Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that the observed pressure-mode rotational splittings of slowly/moderately rotating Delta Scuti stars and Beta Cephei stars mostly have a positive asymmetry. That is, the left frequency spacing is larger than the right spacing in the dipole mode splitting triplets and the $l=2$ mode splitting multiplets (considering $m=1, 0, -1$ modes only). This is in agreement with the second-order perturbative effect of the rotational non-spherical distortion: both the prograde and retrograde modes have their frequencies shifted towards lower values relative to the $m=0$ modes. We thus study the rotational perturbation both in the first and second order, as well as the near-degeneracy mode coupling effect in MESA models representing Delta Scuti stars. For faster rotators, the near-degeneracy mode coupling between the nearest radial and quadrupole modes can significantly shift the $m=0$ modes, reduce the splitting asymmetry, and even change its sign. We find the theoretical splitting asymmetry from the second-order non-spherical distortion is larger than observed asymmetry. To facilitate future detections, we predict correlations between splitting asymmetry, splitting amplitude, and pulsation frequency. We also discuss additional factors that can influence splitting asymmetry, including embedded magnetic fields, resonant mode coupling, and binarity.</description>

      <title>Multiple misaligned outflows and warped accretion flows in the proto-multiple system Per-emb-8 and 55</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the formation process of multiple systems, we have analyzed the ALMA archival data of the 1.3 mm continuum, $^{12}$CO (2-1) and C$^{18}$O (2-1) emission in a proto-multiple system consisting of a Class 0 protostar Per-emb-8 and a Class I protobinary Per-emb-55 $A$ and $B$. The 1.3 mm continuum emission is likely to primarily trace their protostellar disks, and the Keplerian disk rotation is observed in Per-emb-8 and Per-emb-55 $A$ in the emission lines. In Per-emb-8, we identify two arm-like structures with a length of $\sim$ 1000 au connecting the eastern and western of its disk in the continuum and C$^{18}$O emission. Our analysis suggests that these arm-like structures are most likely infalling flows. In the $^{12}$CO emission, we discover a second bipolar outflow associated with Per-emb-8. The two bipolar outflows in Per-emb-8 are possibly launched along the normal axes of the misaligned inner and outer parts of its warped protostellar disk. In Per-emb-55, we find that the red- and blueshifted lobes of its bipolar outflow are misaligned by 90$^\circ$. The presence of the warped disk, multiple misaligned outflows, and asymmetric infalling flows suggest complex dynamics in proto-multiple systems, and these could be related to the tidal interactions between the companions and/or the turbulent environments forming this proto-multiple system.</description>

      <title>J-PLUS: The fraction of calcium white dwarfs along the cooling sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) DR2 photometry in twelve optical bands over 2176 deg2 to estimate the fraction of white dwarfs with presence of CaII H+K absorption along the cooling sequence. We compared the J-PLUS photometry against metal-free theoretical models to estimate the equivalent width in the J0395 passband of 10 nm centered at 395 nm (EW_J0395), a proxy to detect calcium absorption. A total of 4399 white dwarfs within 30000 &gt; Teff &gt; 5500 K and mass M &gt; 0.45 Msun were analyzed. Their EW_J0395 distribution was modeled using two populations, corresponding to polluted and non-polluted systems, to estimate the fraction of calcium white dwarfs (f_Ca) as a function of Teff. The probability for each individual white dwarf of presenting calcium absorption, pca, was also computed. The comparison with both the measured Ca/He abundance and the metal pollution from spectroscopy shows that EW_J0395 correlates with the presence of calcium. The fraction of calcium white dwarfs increases from f_Ca = 0 at Teff = 13500 K to f_Ca = 0.15 at Teff = 5500 K. We compare our results with the fractions derived from the 40 pc spectroscopic sample and from SDSS spectra. The trend found in J-PLUS observations is also present in the 40 pc sample, however SDSS shows a deficit of metal-polluted objects at Teff &lt; 12000 K. Finally, we found 39 white dwarfs with pca &gt; 0.99. Twenty of them have spectra presented in previous studies, whereas we observed six additional targets. These 26 objects were all confirmed as metal-polluted systems. The J-PLUS optical data provide a robust statistical measurement for the presence of CaII H+K absorption in white dwarfs. We find a 15 +- 3 % increase in the fraction of calcium white dwarfs from Teff = 13500 K to 5500 K, which reflects their selection function in the optical from the total population of metal-polluted systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting eclipsing double white dwarfs with electromagnetic and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic double white dwarfs are predominant sources of gravitational waves in the millihertz frequencies accessible to space-borne gravitational wave detectors. With advances in multi-messenger astronomy, an increasing number of double white dwarf systems will be discovered through both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. In this paper, we simulated two populations of double white dwarfs originating from different star formation histories (hereafter referred to as Model 1 and Model 2) using the binary population synthesis method. We predicted the number of double white dwarfs in our Galaxy detectable by TianQin and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) individually, as well as through their joint observation. In addition, we performed an analysis to evaluate the accuracy of the parameter estimation using the Fisher information matrix. Furthermore, we predicted the number of eclipsing double white dwarfs detectable by Gaia and LSST. Our study found that over the nominal mission durations, TianQin, LISA, and their joint observation can detect $5\times10^3$ ($1\times10^4$), $1.7\times10^4$ ($3.3\times10^4$), and $1.8\times10^4$ ($3.5\times10^4$) double white dwarfs with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 7 in Model 1 (Model 2), respectively. Gaia and LSST are expected to detect 67 (186) and 273 (554) eclipsing double white dwarfs in Model 1 (Model 2) with orbital period less than 30 hours, respectively. We also found that several dozen eclipsing double white dwarfs can be detected jointly through electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Stellar Winds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar winds form an integral part of astronomy. The solar wind affects Earth's magnetosphere, while the winds of hot massive stars are highly relevant for galactic feedback through their mechanical wind energy. In different parts of the stellar HR diagram different forces dominate. On the hot side of the HRD radiative forces on ionised gas particles are active, while on the cool side molecular and dust opacities take over. Moreover, due to the convective envelopes, alternative physical ingredients may start to dominate. I will describe the basic equation of motion and give a few examples, mostly focusing on the winds from massive stars. Here mass-loss rates significantly affect the stellar evolution all the way to core collapse as a supernova and/or black hole formation event.</description>

      <title>Why are non-radial solar eruptions less frequent than radial ones?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections from the Sun are not always initiated along a radial trajectory; such non-radial eruptions are well known to be caused by the asymmetry of the pre-eruption magnetic configuration, which is primarily determined by the uneven distribution of magnetic flux at the photosphere. Therefore, it is naturally expected that the non-radial eruptions should be rather common, at least as frequent as radial ones, given the typically asymmetrical nature of photospheric magnetic flux. However, statistical studies have shown that only a small fraction of eruptions display non-radial behavior. Here we aim to shed light on this counterintuitive fact, based on a series of numerical simulations of eruption initiation in bipolar fields with different asymmetric flux distributions. As the asymmetry of the flux distribution increases, the eruption direction tends to deviate further away from the radial path, accompanied by a decrease in eruption intensity. In case of too strong asymmetry, no eruption is triggered, indicating that excessively inclined eruptions cannot occur. Therefore, our simulations suggest that asymmetry plays a negative role in producing eruption, potentially explaining the lesser frequency of non-radial solar eruptions compared to radial ones. With increasing asymmetry, the degree of non-potentiality the field can attain is reduced. Consequently, the intensity of the pre-eruption current sheet decreases, and reconnection becomes less efficient, resulting in weaker eruptions.</description>

      <title>Projection factor and radii of Type II Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type II Cepheids are old pulsating stars that can be used to trace the distribution of an old stellar population and to measure distances to globular clusters and galaxies within several megaparsecs. One method that can be used to measure the distances of Type II Cepheids relies on period-luminosity relations, which are quite widely explored in the literature. The semi-geometrical Baade-Wesselink technique is another method that allows distances of radially pulsating stars, such as Type II Cepheids, to be measured if the so-called projection factor is known. Using the surface brightness-colour relation version of the Baade-Wesselink technique, we determined the projection factors and radii of eight nearby BL Her type stars. We adopted accurate distances of target stars from Gaia Data Release 3. Time series photometry in the V and K bands have been collected with two telescopes located at the Rolf Chini Cerro Murphy Observatory, while spectroscopic data have been obtained with instruments hosted by the European Southern Observatory. The measured projection factors for the stars with good quality data are in the range between 1.21 and 1.36. The typical uncertainty of projection factors is 0.1. The mean value is 1.330$\pm$0.058, which gives the uncertainty of $\sim$4%. The main sources of uncertainty on the p-factors are statistical errors of the Baade-Wesselink fit and parallax. In the case of radii, the biggest contribution to the error budget comes from the K band photometry systematic uncertainty and parallax. The determined radii allowed us to construct the period-radius relation for BL Her stars. Our period-radius relation is in good agreement with the previous empirical calibration, while two theoretical calibrations found in the literature agree with our relation within 2$\sigma$. We also confirm that BL Her and RR Lyr stars obey an apparent common period-radius relation.</description>

      <title>Modelling the connection between propagating disturbances and solar spicules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propagating (intensity) disturbances (PDs) are well reported in observations of coronal loops and polar plumes in addition to recent links with co-temporal spicule activity in the solar atmosphere. However, despite being reported in observations, they are yet to be studied in depth and understood from a modelling point of view. In this work, we present results from a 3D MHD numerical model featuring a stratified solar atmosphere which is perturbed by a p-mode wave driver at the photosphere, subsequently forming spicules described by the rebound shock model. Features with striking characteristics to those of detected PDs appear consistent with the co-temporal transition region dynamics and spicular activity resulting from nonlinear wave steepening and shock formation. Furthermore, the PDs can be interpreted as slow magnetoacoustic pulses propagating along the magnetic field, rather than high speed plasma upflows, carrying sufficient energy flux to at least partially heat the lower coronal plasma. Using forward modelling, we demonstrate the similarities between the PDs in the simulations and those reported in observations from IRIS and SDO/AIA. Our results suggest that, in the presented model, the dynamical movement of the transition region is a result of wave dynamics and shock formation in the lower solar atmosphere, and that PDs are launched co-temporally with the rising of the transition region, regardless of the wave-generating physical mechanisms occurring in the underlying lower solar atmosphere. However, it is clear that signatures of PDs appear much clearer when a photospheric wave driver is included. Finally, we present the importance of PDs in the context of providing a source for powering the (fast) solar wind</description>

      <title>North-PHASE: Studying Periodicity, Hot Spots, Accretion Stability and Early Evolution in young stars in the northern hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the overview and first results from the North-PHASE Legacy Survey, which follows six young clusters for five years, using the 2 deg$^2$ FoV of the JAST80 telescope from the Javalambre Observatory (Spain). North-PHASE investigates stellar variability on timescales from days to years for thousands of young stars distributed over entire clusters. This allows us to find new YSO, characterise accretion and study inner disk evolution within the cluster context. Each region (Tr37, CepOB3, IC5070, IC348, NGC2264, and NGC1333) is observed in six filters (SDSS griz, u band, and J0660, which covers H$\alpha$), detecting cluster members as well as field variable stars. Tr37 is used to prove feasibility and optimise the variability analysis techniques. In Tr37, variability reveals 50 new YSO, most of them proper motion outliers. North-PHASE independently confirms the youth of astrometric members, efficiently distinguishes accreting and non-accreting stars, reveals the extent of the cluster populations along Tr37/IC1396 bright rims, and detects variability resulting from rotation, dips, and irregular bursts. The proper motion outliers unveil a more complex star formation history than inferred from Gaia alone, and variability highlights previously hidden proper motion deviations in the surrounding clouds. We also find that non-YSO variables identified by North-PHASE cover a different variability parameter space and include long-period variables, eclipsing binaries, RR Lyr, and $\delta$ Scuti stars. These early results also emphasize the power of variability to complete the picture of star formation where it is missed by astrometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pade code has been developed to treat hydrodynamic turbulence in protoplanetary disks. It solves the compressible equations of motion in cylindrical coordinates. Derivatives are computed using non-diffusive and conservative fourth-order Pade differencing, which has higher resolving power compared to both dissipative shock-capturing schemes used in most astrophysics codes, as well as non-diffusive central finite-difference schemes of the same order. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is used for time stepping. A previously reported error-corrected Fargo approach is used to reduce the time step constraint imposed by rapid Keplerian advection. Artificial bulk viscosity is used when shock-capturing is required. Tests for correctness and scaling with respect to the number of processors are presented. Finally, efforts to improve efficiency and accuracy are suggested.</description>

      <title>Compaction during fragmentation and bouncing produces realistic dust grain porosities in protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: In protoplanetary discs, micron-sized dust grows to form millimetre- to centimetre-sized pebbles but encounters several barriers during its evolution. Collisional fragmentation and radial drift impede further dust growth to planetesimal size. Fluffy grains have been hypothesised to solve these problems. While porosity leads to faster grain growth, the implied porosity values obtained from previous simulations were larger than suggested by observations. Aims: In this paper, we study the influence of porosity on dust evolution taking into account growth, bouncing, fragmentation, compaction, rotational disruption and snow lines, in order to understand their impact on dust evolution. Methods: We develop a module for porosity evolution for the 3D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code Phantom that accounts for dust growth and fragmentation. This mono-disperse model is integrated into both a 1D code and the 3D code to capture the overall evolution of dust and gas. Results: We show that porosity helps dust growth and leads to the formation of larger solids than when considering compact grains, as predicted by previous work. Our simulations taking into account compaction during fragmentation show that large millimetre grains are still formed, but are 10 to 100 times more compact. Thus, mm sizes with typical filling factors of ~0.1 match the values measured on comets or via polarimetric observations of protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>Mind the Trap: Non-negligible effect of volatile trapping in ice on C/O ratios in protoplanetary disks and exoplanetary atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of bulk ices (H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$) to trap volatiles has been well studied in any experimental sense, but largely ignored in protoplanetary disk and planet formation models as well as the interpretation of their observations. We demonstrate the influence of volatile trapping on C/O ratios in planet-forming environments. We created a simple model of CO, CO$_{2}$, and H$_{2}$O snowlines in protoplanetary disks and calculated the C/O ratio at different radii and temperatures. We included a trapping factor, which partially inhibits the release of volatiles (CO, CO$_{2}$) at their snowline and releases them instead, together with the bulk ice species (H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$). Our aim has been to assess its influence on trapping solid-state and gas phase C/O ratios throughout planet-forming environments. Volatile trapping significantly affects C/O ratios in protoplanetary disks. Variations in the ratio are reduced and become more homogeneous throughout the disk when compared to models that do not include volatile trapping. Trapping reduces the proportion of volatiles in the gas and, as such, reduces the available carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules for gaseous accretion to planetary atmospheres. Volatile trapping is expected to also affect the elemental hydrogen and nitrogen budgets. Volatile trapping is an overlooked, but important effect to consider when assessing the C/O ratios in protoplanetary disks and exoplanet atmospheres. Due to volatile trapping, exoplanets with stellar C/O have the possibility to be formed within the CO and CO$_{2}$ snowline.</description>

      <title>Flux-Rope Mediated Turbulent Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new model of magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence, applicable when the magnetic helicity is non-zero. The new model differs from the Lazarian-Vishniac turbulent reconnection theory by emphasizing the role of locally coherent magnetic structures, whose existence is shown to be permitted by the properties of magnetic field line separation in turbulent plasma. Local coherence allows storage of magnetic helicity inside the reconnection layer and we argue that helicity conservation produces locally coherent twisted flux ropes. We then introduce the "Alfv\'en horizon" to explain why the global reconnection rate can be governed by locally coherent magnetic field structure instead of by field line wandering, formally extending to 3D the principle that reconnection can be made fast by fragmentation of the global current layer. Coherence is shown to dominate over field line dispersion if the anisotropy of the turbulence at the perpendicular scale matching the thickness of a marginally stable current layer exceeds the aspect ratio of the current layer. Finally, we conjecture that turbulence generated within the reconnection layer may produce a balance of anisotropies that maintains the system in the flux-rope mediated regime. The new model successfully accounts for the major features of 3D numerical simulations of self-generated turbulent reconnection, including reconnection rates of 0.01 in resistive MHD and 0.1 with collisionless physics.</description>

      <title>PRODIGE -- Planet-forming disks in Taurus with NOEMA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to constrain the gas density and temperature distributions as well as gas masses in several T Tauri protoplanetary disks located in Taurus. We use the 12CO, 13CO, and C18O (2-1) isotopologue emission observed at 0.9 with the IRAM NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) as part of the MPG-IRAM Observatory Program PRODIGE (PROtostars and DIsks: Global Evolution PIs: P. Caselli &amp; Th. Henning). Our sample consists of Class II disks with no evidence of strong radial substructures. We use thesedata to constrain the thermal and chemical structure of these disks through theoretical models for gas emission. To fit the combined optically thick and thin CO line data in Fourier space, we developed the DiskCheF code, which includes the parameterized disk physical structure, machine-learning (ML) accelerated chemistry, and the RADMC-3D line radiative transfer module. A key novelty of DiskCheF is the fast and feasible ML-based chemistry trained on the extended grid of the disk physical-chemical models precomputed with the ANDES2 code. This ML approach allows complex chemical kinetics models to be included in a time-consuming disk fitting without the need to run a chemical code. We present a novel approach to incorporate chemistry into disk modeling without the need to explicitly calculate a chemical network every time. Using this new disk modeling tool, we successfully fit the 12CO, 13CO, and C18O (2-1) data from the CI, CY, DL, DM, DN, and IQ Tau disks. The combination of optically thin and optically thick CO lines allows us to simultaneously constrain the disk temperature and mass distribution, and derive the CO-based gas masses. These values are in reasonable agreement with the disk dust masses rescaled by a factor of 100 as well as with other indirect gas measurements.</description>

      <title>Survey of extended Main Sequence Turn-offs in Galactic Open Clusters: Stellar rotations from Gaia RVS spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of extended main-sequence turn-offs (eMSTO) in star clusters younger than 2 Gyr still challenges our current understanding of stellar evolution. Exploiting data from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), we investigate eMSTOs in a large sample of 32 Galactic open clusters younger than 2.4 Gyr. We first validate Gaia rotational velocities from Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) spectra by comparing them with literature values and assessing their correlation with magnetic activity measurements from LAMOST spectra. We detect a general positive correlation between turn-off color and projected stellar rotation, with slow-rotating stars predominantly found on the bluer side of the turn-off. Comparing our observations with theoretical models, we find that the eMSTO morphology is well-reproduced by a single population formed with a high rotation rate, and observed with rotation axis inclination ranging between 0$^\circ$ (pole-on) and 90$^\circ$ (edge-on). This contrasts with observations of Magellanic Clouds clusters, where a population of non-rotating stars appears to be ubiquitous in clusters younger than 700 Myr. However, we note that our interpretation, while successfully explaining the overall eMSTO morphology, cannot fully explain the observed projected rotational velocities. Additionally, two young clusters, NGC 3532 and NGC 2287, exhibit moderate evidence of a split main sequence in color and rotation, suggesting a possible small spread in the initial rotation rate. Finally, we advise caution in determining the ages of young clusters from non-rotating isochrones, as neglecting the effects of stellar rotation can impact the isochrone dating by up to factors of 5-20%.</description>

      <title>The VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea eXtended (VVVX) ESO public survey: Completion of the observations and legacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ESO public survey VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea (VVV) surveyed the inner Galactic bulge and the adjacent southern Galactic disk from $2009-2015$. Upon its conclusion, the complementary VVV eXtended (VVVX) survey has expanded both the temporal as well as spatial coverage of the original VVV area, widening it from $562$ to $1700$ sq. deg., as well as providing additional epochs in $JHK_{\rm s}$ filters from $2016-2023$. With the completion of VVVX observations during the first semester of 2023, we present here the observing strategy, a description of data quality and access, and the legacy of VVVX. VVVX took $\sim 2000$ hours, covering about 4% of the sky in the bulge and southern disk. VVVX covered most of the gaps left between the VVV and the VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) areas and extended the VVV time baseline in the obscured regions affected by high extinction and hence hidden from optical observations. VVVX provides a deep $JHK_{\rm s}$ catalogue of $\gtrsim 1.5\times10^9$ point sources, as well as a $K_{\rm s}$ band catalogue of $\sim 10^7$ variable sources. Within the existing VVV area, we produced a $5D$ map of the surveyed region by combining positions, distances, and proper motions of well-understood distance indicators such as red clump stars, RR Lyrae, and Cepheid variables. In March 2023 we successfully finished the VVVX survey observations that started in 2016, an accomplishment for ESO Paranal Observatory upon 4200 hours of observations for VVV+VVVX. The VVV+VVVX catalogues complement those from the Gaia mission at low Galactic latitudes and provide spectroscopic targets for the forthcoming ESO high-multiplex spectrographs MOONS and 4MOST.</description>

      <title>Exploring Simple-Population and Multiple-Population Globular Clusters in the Outer Galactic Halo using the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pseudo two-color diagram, known as chromosome map (ChM), is a valuable tool for identifying globular clusters (GCs) that consist of single or multiple stellar populations (MPs). Recent surveys of Galactic GCs using the ChM have provided stringent observational constraints on the formation of GCs and their stellar populations. However, these surveys have primarily focused on GCs at moderate distances from the Galactic center and composed of MPs. In this paper, we present the first detailed study of the stellar composition of four GCs in the outer halo of the Milky Way: Arp 2, Ruprecht 106, Terzan 7, and Terzan 8. Our analysis is based on highprecision photometry obtained from images collected with the Hubble Space Telescope in the F275W, F336W, F438W, F606W, and F814W bands. We find that Ruprecht 106 and Terzan 7 are composed solely of a single stellar population, whereas Arp 2 and Terzan 8 host both first- and second-population stars. In these clusters, the second population comprises about half and one-third of the total number of GC stars, respectively. The results from this paper and the literature suggest that the threshold in the initial GC mass, if present, should be smaller than approximately $10^{5}$ $M_{\odot}$. The first-population stars of Arp 2 and Terzan 8, along with the stars of the simple-population GCs Ruprecht 106 and Terzan 7, exhibit intrinsic F275W - F814W color spreads corresponding to [Fe/H] variations of approximately 0.05 - 0.30 dex. This indicates that star-to-star metallicity variations are a common feature of star clusters, regardless of the presence of MPs.</description>

      <title>Lessons from the high-resolution spectroscopy of AW UMa and Epsilon CrA: Is the Lucy model valid?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A re-examination of high-resolution spectral monitoring of the W UMa-type binaries AW UMa and Epsilon CrA casts doubt on the widely utilized Lucy (1968a, 1968b) model of contact binaries. The detection of the very faint profile of the secondary component in AW UMa leads to a new spectroscopic determination of the mass ratio, q(sp) = 0.092 +/- 0.007, which is close to the previous, medium-resolution spectroscopic result of Pribulla &amp; Rucinski (2008), q(sp) = 0.101 +/- 0.006, and remains substantially different from a cluster of generally accepted photometric results by several authors, concentrated around q(ph) = 0.080 +/- 0.005. The two approaches are independent, with the spectroscopic technique being more direct yet more demanding on telescope/spectrograph resources, while the photometric determinations are accessible to smaller telescopes but entirely dependent on the Lucy model. A survey of binaries with the best-determined values of the mass ratio shows a common tendency for q(ph) &lt; q(sp). The tendency for systematically smaller values of q(ph) may result from the overfilling of the primary lobe and underfilling of the secondary lobe relative to the Roche model geometry, as predicted by the Stepien (2009) model; the tendency may be variable in time. Despite the observed moderate inter-systemic velocities, the photometric Lucy model may remain useful in providing approximate, though biased, results for the mass ratio. A complicating factor in detailed spectral analysis may be the occurrence of Enhanced Spectral-line Perturbations (ESP) projected over the secondary profiles, appearing in different numbers in the two studied binaries. The ESPs are tentatively identified within the Stepien model as collision fronts or fountains of hot, primary-component gas from the circumbinary, energy-carrying flow.</description>

      <title>The effect of stellar rotation on black hole mass and spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signature of a binary black hole (BBH) merger is dependent on its component mass and spin. If such black holes originate from rapidly rotating progenitors, the large angular momentum reserve in the star could drive a collapsar-like supernova explosion, hence substantially impacting these characteristics of the black holes in the binary. To examine the effect of stellar rotation on the resulting black hole mass and spin, we conduct a 1D general relativistic study of the end phase of the collapse. We find that the resulting black hole mass at times differs significantly from the previously assumed values. We quantify the dependence of the black hole spin magnitude on the hydrodynamics of the accretion flow, providing analytical relations for calculating the mass and spin based on the progenitor's pre-collapse properties. Depending on the nature of the accretion flow, our findings have implications for the black hole upper mass gap resulting from pair-instability supernovae, the maximum mass of a maximally rotating stellar black hole, and the maximum effective spin of a BBH formed in tidally locked helium star - black hole binary.</description>

      <title>Combining Gaia and GRAVITY: Characterising five new Directly Detected Substellar Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise mass constraints are vital for the characterisation of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. Here we present how the combination of data obtained by Gaia and GRAVITY can help enlarge the sample of substellar companions with measured dynamical masses. We show how the Non-Single-Star (NSS) two-body orbit catalogue contained in Gaia DR3 can be used to inform high-angular-resolution follow-up observations with GRAVITY. Applying the method presented in this work to eight Gaia candidate systems, we detect all eight predicted companions, seven of which were previously unknown and five are of a substellar nature. Among the sample is Gaia DR3 2728129004119806464 B, which - detected at an angular separation of (34.01 $\pm$ 0.15) mas from the host - is the closest substellar companion ever imaged. This translates to a semi-major axis of (0.938 $\pm$ 0.023) AU. WT 766 B, detected at a greater angular separation, was confirmed to be on an orbit exhibiting an even smaller semi-major axis of (0.676 $\pm$ 0.008) AU. The GRAVITY data were then used to break the host-companion mass degeneracy inherent to the Gaia NSS orbit solutions as well as to constrain the orbital solutions of the respective target systems. Knowledge of the companion masses enabled us to further characterise them in terms of their ages, effective temperatures, and radii via the application of evolutionary models. The inferred ages exhibit a distinct bias towards values younger than what is to be expected based on the literature. The results serve as an independent validation of the orbital solutions published in the NSS two-body orbit catalogue and show that the combination of astrometric survey missions and high-angular-resolution direct imaging holds great promise for efficiently increasing the sample of directly imaged companions in the future, especially in the light of Gaia's upcoming DR4 and the advent of GRAVITY+.</description>

Abstract: We present an exhaustive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of TOI-837, a F9/G0 35 Myr young star, hosting a transiting exoplanet, TOI-837b, with an orbital period of 8.32d. Utilising data from TESS and ground-based observations, we determine a planetary radius of 0.82 R_J for TOI-837b. Through detailed HARPS spectroscopic time series analysis, we derive a Doppler semi-amplitude of 35 m/s, corresponding to a planetary mass of 0.39 M_J. The derived planetary properties suggest a substantial core of approximately 70 M_E, constituting about 60% of the planet's total mass. This finding poses a significant challenge to existing theoretical models of core formation. We propose that future atmospheric observations with JWST could provide insights into resolving ambiguities of TOI-837b, offering new perspectives on its composition, formation, and evolution.</description>

      <title>Local Hamiltonian dynamics from non-local action principles and applications to binary systems in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of finite-dimensional dynamical systems whose equations of motion are derived from a non-local-in-time action principle. The action functional has a zeroth order piece derived from a local Hamiltonian and a perturbation in the form of a non-local functional of the trajectory on phase space. We prove that the dynamics of these systems admits a local Hamiltonian description to all order in the perturbation and we provide explicit formulae for the $\mathcal{N}^{\text{th}}$ order Hamiltonian and symplectic form in terms of the $(\mathcal{N}-1)^{\text{th}}$ order Hamiltonian flow. In the context of general relativity, these systems arise in the study of binary systems such as pairs of black holes or neutron stars in the small mass-ratio and post-Newtonian approximations. We provide applications of the formalism to binary systems in these regimes.</description>
