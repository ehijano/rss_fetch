      <title>Artificial or Human Intelligence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as large language models (LLMs) are already altering student learning. Unlike previous technologies, LLMs can independently solve problems regardless of student understanding, yet are not always accurate (due to hallucination) and face sharp performance cutoffs (due to emergence). Access to these tools significantly alters a student's incentives to learn, potentially decreasing the sum knowledge of humans and AI. Additionally, the marginal benefit of learning changes depending on which side of the AI frontier a human is on, creating a discontinuous gap between those that know more than or less than AI. This contrasts with downstream models of AI's impact on the labor force which assume continuous ability. Finally, increasing the portion of assignments where AI cannot be used can counteract student mis-specification about AI accuracy, preventing underinvestment. A better understanding of how AI impacts learning and student incentives is crucial for educators to adapt to this new technology.</description>

      <title>Optimal Taxation under Imperfect Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note studies optimal taxation when the use of tax revenue for public consumption is uncertain. We consider a one-period general-equilibrium economy with a representative household and a competitive firm. The government may be honest, in which case revenue is converted one-for-one into public consumption, or opportunistic, in which case nothing is delivered. We treat trust as the prior probability that the government is honest and ask how it shapes both the overall scale of taxation and the choice between a labor tax and a broad commodity (output) tax. Three results emerge. First, there is a trust threshold below which any positive tax lowers welfare. Second, above that threshold there is an equivalence frontier: a continuum of tax mixes that implement the same allocation and welfare. Third, small instrument-specific administrative or salience costs uniquely select the revenue instrument, typically favoring the cheaper broad base. An isoelastic specialization yields closed-form expressions that make the threshold, optimal rates, delivered public consumption, and welfare transparent. The framework offers a compact policy map: build credibility before raising rates, keep the base broad, and let measured trust determine the scale.</description>

      <title>Banks, Bonds, and Collateral: A Microfounded Comparison under Adverse Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Firms often choose between concentrated, renegotiable bank claims and dispersed, arm's-length market debt. I develop a tractable adverse-selection model in which both financiers can take collateral, but they differ in enforcement and coordination efficiency at default. The single primitive wedge - a higher effective liquidation rate for concentrated creditors - is sufficient to generate coexistence, a sharp cutoff in the bank-bond partition, and distinctive comparative statics. A marginal improvement in bankruptcy/insolvency efficiency or bondholder coordination reallocates issuance toward bonds, compresses loan-bond pricing gaps for safe types, and shifts default incidence and collateral intensity in predictable ways. The welfare decomposition clarifies when strengthening bank enforcement reduces deadweight liquidation losses (by moving marginal types into monitored finance) versus when improving market-side coordination dominates (by accelerating dispersed-creditor resolution). The model delivers stability-relevant predictions for default rates, recovery, covenant stringency, and issuance composition around reforms that move liquidation efficiency on either side, and it provides a disciplined mapping to empirical proxies (recoveries, covenant strength, creditor dispersion).</description>

      <title>Government Reputation in Ramsey Taxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We embed honesty-based reputation into a Ramsey taxation framework with competitive firms and households. In a static benchmark with exogenous trust, there is a sharp cutoff below which the optimal policy sets no taxes and above which the optimal tax take rises with trust. In the dynamic model, beliefs evolve through noisy public monitoring of delivered public goods; the planner's problem is well posed, the value is increasing and convex in beliefs, and optimal revenue is monotone in reputation with a trust threshold that is weakly below the static cutoff. With multiple broad instruments and symmetric monitoring, the dynamic force acts through the total revenue scale; the tax mix is indeterminate along an equivalence frontier. Blackwell-improving monitoring and greater type persistence expand the optimal scale and shift the trust threshold inward. The model delivers clear policy prescriptions for building fiscal capacity in low-trust environments and testable links between measured trust, verifiability, and revenue.</description>

      <title>Imprecision Attenuates Updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies how imprecision in noisy signals attenuates Bayesian updating toward the prior. This phenomenon is well-known under a normal prior and normal noise, where less precise signals yield posterior means closer to the prior mean. We show this effect extends to any symmetric, log-concave prior and any symmetric, quasi-concave location experiment, using a newly introduced precision order. Our main result is that for any such prior and any signal realization, the posterior mean under location experiment S is closer to the prior mean than is the posterior mean under S', if and only if S is less precise than S'. We discuss applications to cognitive imprecision, prior precision, and overconfidence.</description>
