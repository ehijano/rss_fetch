      <title>The Effect of Acute Stress on the Interpretability and Generalization of Schizophrenia Predictive Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder, and early diagnosis is key to improving outcomes. Its complexity makes predicting onset and progression challenging. EEG has emerged as a valuable tool for studying schizophrenia, with machine learning increasingly applied for diagnosis. This paper assesses the accuracy of ML models for predicting schizophrenia and examines the impact of stress during EEG recording on model performance. We integrate acute stress prediction into the analysis, showing that overlapping conditions like stress during recording can negatively affect model accuracy.
  Methods Four XGBoost models were built: one for stress prediction, two to classify schizophrenia (at rest and task), and a model to predict schizophrenia for both conditions. XAI techniques were applied to analyze results. Experiments tested the generalization of schizophrenia models using their datasets' healthy controls and independent health-screened controls. The stress model identified high-stress subjects, who were excluded from further analysis. A novel method was used to adjust EEG frequency band power to remove stress artifacts, improving predictive model performance.
  Results Our results show that acute stress vary across EEG sessions, affecting model performance and accuracy. Generalization improved once these varying stress levels were considered and compensated for during model training. Our findings highlight the importance of thorough health screening and management of the patient's condition during the process. Stress induced during or by the EEG recording can adversely affect model generalization. This may require further preprocessing of data by treating stress as an additional physiological artifact. Our proposed approach to compensate for stress artifacts in EEG data used for training models showed a significant improvement in predictive performance.</description>

      <title>SALINA: Towards Sustainable Live Sonar Analytics in Wild Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sonar radar captures visual representations of underwater objects and structures using sound wave reflections, making it essential for exploration, mapping, and continuous surveillance in wild ecosystems. Real-time analysis of sonar data is crucial for time-sensitive applications, including environmental anomaly detection and in-season fishery management, where rapid decision-making is needed. However, the lack of both relevant datasets and pre-trained DNN models, coupled with resource limitations in wild environments, hinders the effective deployment and continuous operation of live sonar analytics.
  We present SALINA, a sustainable live sonar analytics system designed to address these challenges. SALINA enables real-time processing of acoustic sonar data with spatial and temporal adaptations, and features energy-efficient operation through a robust energy management module. Deployed for six months at two inland rivers in British Columbia, Canada, SALINA provided continuous 24/7 underwater monitoring, supporting fishery stewardship and wildlife restoration efforts. Through extensive real-world testing, SALINA demonstrated an up to 9.5% improvement in average precision and a 10.1% increase in tracking metrics. The energy management module successfully handled extreme weather, preventing outages and reducing contingency costs. These results offer valuable insights for long-term deployment of acoustic data systems in the wild.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by movable antennas (MAs). A bistatic radar system, in which the base station (BS) is configured with MAs, is integrated into a multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system. Flexible beamforming is studied by jointly optimizing the antenna coefficients and the antenna positions. Compared to conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), MAs provide a new degree of freedom (DoF) in beamforming to reconfigure the field response, and further improve the received signal quality for both wireless communication and sensing. We propose a communication rate and sensing mutual information (MI) maximization problem by flexible beamforming optimization. The complex fractional objective function with logarithms are first transformed with the fractional programming (FP) framework. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to address the non-convex problem with coupled variables by alternatively solving four sub-problems. We derive the closed-form expression to update the antenna coefficients by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To improve the direct gradient ascent (DGA) scheme in updating the positions of the antennas, a 3-stage search-based projected GA (SPGA) method is proposed. Simulation results show that MAs significantly enhance the overall performance of the ISAC system, achieving 59.8\% performance gain compared to conventional ISAC system enabled by FPAs. Meanwhile, the proposed SPGA-based method has remarkable performance improvement compared the DGA method in antenna position optimization.</description>

      <title>Real-time Monitoring of Lower Limb Movement Resistance Based on Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time lower limb movement resistance monitoring is critical for various applications in clinical and sports settings, such as rehabilitation and athletic training. Current methods often face limitations in accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalizability, which hinder their practical implementation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Mobile Multi-Task Learning Network (MMTL-Net) that integrates MobileNetV3 for efficient feature extraction and employs multi-task learning to simultaneously predict resistance levels and recognize activities. The advantages of MMTL-Net include enhanced accuracy, reduced latency, and improved computational efficiency, making it highly suitable for real-time applications. Experimental results demonstrate that MMTL-Net significantly outperforms existing models on the UCI Human Activity Recognition and Wireless Sensor Data Mining Activity Prediction datasets, achieving a lower Force Error Rate (FER) of 6.8% and a higher Resistance Prediction Accuracy (RPA) of 91.2%. Additionally, the model shows a Real-time Responsiveness (RTR) of 12 milliseconds and a Throughput (TP) of 33 frames per second. These findings underscore the model's robustness and effectiveness in diverse real-world scenarios. The proposed framework not only advances the state-of-the-art in resistance monitoring but also paves the way for more efficient and accurate systems in clinical and sports applications. In real-world settings, the practical implications of MMTL-Net include its potential to enhance patient outcomes in rehabilitation and improve athletic performance through precise, real-time monitoring and feedback.</description>

      <title>A Novel Numerical Method for Relaxing the Minimal Configurations of TOA-Based Joint Sensors and Sources Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel numerical method that relaxes the minimal configuration requirements for joint sensors and sources localization (JSSL) in 3D space using time of arrival (TOA) measurements. Traditionally, the principle requires that the number of valid equations (TOA measurements) must be equal to or greater than the number of unknown variables (sensor and source locations). State-of-the-art literature suggests that the minimum numbers of sensors and sources needed for localization are four to six and six to four, respectively. However, these stringent configurations limit the application of JSSL in scenarios with an insufficient number of sensors and sources. To overcome this limitation, we propose a numerical method that reduces the required number of sensors and sources, enabling more flexible JSSL configurations. First, we formulate the JSSL task as a series of triangles and apply the law of cosines to determine four unknown distances associated with one pair of sensors and three pairs of sources. Next, by utilizing triangle inequalities, we establish the lower and upper boundaries for these unknowns based on the known TOA measurements. The numerical method then searches within these boundaries to find the global optimal solutions, demonstrating that JSSL in 3D space is achievable with only four sensors and four sources, thus significantly relaxing the minimal configuration requirements. Theoretical proofs and simulation results confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Stress Detection via Photoplethysmogram Signals: Implementation of a Combined Continuous Wavelet Transform and Convolutional Neural Network on Resource-Constrained Microcontrollers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a robust stress detection system utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for the analysis of Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Employing the WESAD dataset, we applied Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to extract informative features from wrist PPG signals, demonstrating enhanced stress detection and learning compared to conventional techniques. Notably, the CNN achieved an impressive accuracy of 93.7% after five epochs, post-implementation on a resource-constrained microcontroller. The optimization process, including pruning and Post-Train Quantization, was crucial to reduce the model size to 1.6 megabytes, overcoming the microcontroller's limited resources of 2 megabytes of Flash memory and 512 kilobytes of RAM. This optimized model not only addresses resource constraints but also outperforms traditional signal processing methods, positioning it as a promising solution for real-time stress monitoring on wearable devices.</description>

      <title>EEGPT: Unleashing the Potential of EEG Generalist Foundation Model by Autoregressive Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are pivotal in providing insights into spontaneous brain activity, highlighting their significant importance in neuroscience research. However, the exploration of versatile EEG models is constrained by diverse data formats, outdated pre-training paradigms, and limited transfer learning methods, only leading to specialist models on single dataset. In this paper, we introduce EEGPT, the first generalist EEG foundation model designed to address these challenges. First, we propose an electrode-wise modeling strategy that treats each electrode as a fundamental unit, enabling the integration of diverse EEG datasets collected from up to 138 electrodes, amassing 37.5M pre-training samples. Second, we develop the first autoregressive EEG pre-trained model, moving away from traditional masked autoencoder approaches to a next signal prediction task that better captures the sequential and temporal dependencies of EEG data. We also explore scaling laws with model up to 1.1B parameters: the largest in EEG research to date. Third, we introduce a multi-task transfer learning paradigm using a learnable electrode graph network shared across tasks, which for the first time confirms multi-task compatibility and synergy. As the first generalist EEG foundation model, EEGPT shows broad compatibility with various signal acquisition devices, subjects, and tasks. It supports up to 138 electrodes and any combination thereof as input. Furthermore, we simultaneously evaluate it on 5 distinct tasks across 12 benchmarks. EEGPT consistently outperforms existing specialist models across all downstream tasks, with its effectiveness further validated through extensive ablation studies. This work sets a new direction for generalist EEG modeling, offering improved scalability, transferability, and adaptability for a wide range of EEG applications. The code and models will be released.</description>

      <title>Feasibility Analysis of Federated Neural Networks for Explainable Detection of Atrial Fibrillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of atrial fibrillation (AFib) is challenging due to its asymptomatic and paroxysmal nature. However, advances in deep learning algorithms and the vast collection of electrocardiogram (ECG) data from devices such as the Internet of Things (IoT) hold great potential for the development of an effective solution. This study assesses the feasibility of training a neural network on a Federated Learning (FL) platform to detect AFib using raw ECG data. The performance of an advanced neural network is evaluated in centralized, local, and federated settings. The effects of different aggregation methods on model performance are investigated, and various normalization strategies are explored to address issues related to neural network federation. The results demonstrate that federated learning can significantly improve the accuracy of detection over local training. The best performing federated model achieved an F1 score of 77\%, improving performance by 15\% compared to the average performance of individually trained clients. This study emphasizes the promise of FL in medical diagnostics, offering a privacy-preserving and interpretable solution for large-scale healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Image and Radio Frequency Fusion for Optimizing Vehicle Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a multi-modal vehicle positioning framework that jointly localizes vehicles with channel state information (CSI) and images is designed. In particular, we consider an outdoor scenario where each vehicle can communicate with only one BS, and hence, it can upload its estimated CSI to only its associated BS. Each BS is equipped with a set of cameras, such that it can collect a small number of labeled CSI, a large number of unlabeled CSI, and the images taken by cameras. To exploit the unlabeled CSI data and position labels obtained from images, we design an meta-learning based hard expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Specifically, since we do not know the corresponding relationship between unlabeled CSI and the multiple vehicle locations in images, we formulate the calculation of the training objective as a minimum matching problem. To reduce the impact of label noises caused by incorrect matching between unlabeled CSI and vehicle locations obtained from images and achieve better convergence, we introduce a weighted loss function on the unlabeled datasets, and study the use of a meta-learning algorithm for computing the weighted loss. Subsequently, the model parameters are updated according to the weighted loss function of unlabeled CSI samples and their matched position labels obtained from images. Simulation results show that the proposed method can reduce the positioning error by up to 61% compared to a baseline that does not use images and uses only CSI fingerprint for vehicle positioning.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Cellular Network Selector for Vehicle Teleoperations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote control of robotic systems, also known as teleoperation, is crucial for the development of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. It allows a remote operator to view live video from AVs and, in some cases, to make real-time decisions. The effectiveness of video-based teleoperation systems is heavily influenced by the quality of the cellular network and, in particular, its packet loss rate and latency. To optimize these parameters, an AV can be connected to multiple cellular networks and determine in real time over which cellular network each video packet will be transmitted. We present an algorithm, called Active Network Selector (ANS), which uses a time series machine learning approach for solving this problem. We compare ANS to a baseline non-learning algorithm, which is used today in commercial systems, and show that ANS performs much better, with respect to both packet loss and packet latency.</description>

      <title>Single-word Auditory Attention Decoding Using Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying auditory attention by comparing auditory stimuli and corresponding brain responses, is known as auditory attention decoding (AAD). The majority of AAD algorithms utilize the so-called envelope entrainment mechanism, whereby auditory attention is identified by how the envelope of the auditory stream drives variation in the electroencephalography (EEG) signal. However, neural processing can also be decoded based on endogenous cognitive responses, in this case, neural responses evoked by attention to specific words in a speech stream. This approach is largely unexplored in the field of AAD but leads to a single-word auditory attention decoding problem in which an epoch of an EEG signal timed to a specific word is labeled as attended or unattended. This paper presents a deep learning approach, based on EEGNet, to address this challenge. We conducted a subject-independent evaluation on an event-based AAD dataset with three different paradigms: word category oddball, word category with competing speakers, and competing speech streams with targets. The results demonstrate that the adapted model is capable of exploiting cognitive-related spatiotemporal EEG features and achieving at least 58% accuracy on the most realistic competing paradigm for the unseen subjects. To our knowledge, this is the first study dealing with this problem.</description>

      <title>Radon Implicit Field Transform (RIFT): Learning Scenes from Radar Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data acquisition in array signal processing (ASP) is costly, as high angular and range resolutions require large antenna apertures and wide frequency bandwidths. Data requirements grow multiplicatively with viewpoints and frequencies, increasing collection burdens. Implicit Neural Representations (INRs)--neural network models of 3D scenes--offer compact, continuous representations with minimal data, interpolating to unseen viewpoints, potentially reducing sampling costs in ASP. We propose the Radon Implicit Field Transform (RIFT), combining a radar forward model (Generalized Radon Transform, GRT) with an INR-based scene representation learned from radar signals. This method extends to other ASP problems by replacing the GRT with appropriate algorithms. In experiments, we synthesize radar data using the GRT and train the INR model by minimizing radar signal reconstruction error. We render the scene using the trained INR and evaluate it against ground truth. We introduce new error metrics: phase-Root Mean Square Error (p-RMSE) and magnitude-Structural Similarity Index Measure (m-SSIM). Compared to traditional scene models, our RIFT model achieves up to 188% improvement in scene reconstruction with only 10% of the data. Using the same amount of data, RIFT achieves 3x better reconstruction and shows a 10% improvement when generalizing to unseen viewpoints.</description>

      <title>BUNDL: Bayesian Uncertainty-aware Deep Learning with Noisy training Labels for Seizure Detection in EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning methods are at the forefront of automated epileptic seizure detection and onset zone localization using scalp-EEG. However, the performance of deep learning methods rely heavily on the quality of annotated training datasets. Scalp EEG is susceptible to high noise levels, which in turn leads to imprecise annotations of the seizure timing and characteristics. This label noise presents a significant challenge in model training and generalization. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical framework that informs a deep learning model of label ambiguity, thereby enhancing the overall seizure detection performance. Our Bayesian UncertaiNty-aware Deep Learning, BUNDL, strategy offers a straightforward and model-agnostic method for training deep neural networks with noisy training labels that does not add any parameters to existing architectures. By integrating domain knowledge into the statistical framework, we derive a novel KL-divergence-based loss function that capitalizes on uncertainty to better learn seizure characteristics from scalp EEG. Additionally, we explore the impact of improved seizure detection on the task of automated onset zone localization. We validate BUNDL using a comprehensive simulated EEG dataset and two publicly available datasets, TUH and CHB-MIT. BUNDL consistently improves the performance of three base models on simulated data under seven types of label noise and three EEG signal-to-noise ratios. Similar improvements were observed in the real-world TUH and CHB-MIT datasets. Finally, we demonstrate that BUNDL improves the accuracy of seizure onset zone localization. BUNDL is specifically designed to address label ambiguities, enabling the training of reliable and trustworthy models for epilepsy evaluation.</description>

      <title>UniMTS: Unified Pre-training for Motion Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion time series collected from mobile and wearable devices such as smartphones and smartwatches offer significant insights into human behavioral patterns, with wide applications in healthcare, automation, IoT, and AR/XR due to their low-power, always-on nature. However, given security and privacy concerns, building large-scale motion time series datasets remains difficult, preventing the development of pre-trained models for human activity analysis. Typically, existing models are trained and tested on the same dataset, leading to poor generalizability across variations in device location, device mounting orientation and human activity type. In this paper, we introduce UniMTS, the first unified pre-training procedure for motion time series that generalizes across diverse device latent factors and activities. Specifically, we employ a contrastive learning framework that aligns motion time series with text descriptions enriched by large language models. This helps the model learn the semantics of time series to generalize across activities. Given the absence of large-scale motion time series data, we derive and synthesize time series from existing motion skeleton data with all-joint coverage. Spatio-temporal graph networks are utilized to capture the relationships across joints for generalization across different device locations. We further design rotation-invariant augmentation to make the model agnostic to changes in device mounting orientations. Our model shows exceptional generalizability across 18 motion time series classification benchmark datasets, outperforming the best baselines by 340% in the zero-shot setting, 16.3% in the few-shot setting, and 9.2% in the full-shot setting.</description>

      <title>Automatic Classification of Sleep Stages from EEG Signals Using Riemannian Metrics and Transformer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: In sleep medicine, assessing the evolution of a subject's sleep often involves the costly manual scoring of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. In recent years, a number of Deep Learning approaches have been proposed to automate this process, mainly by extracting features from said signals. However, despite some promising developments in related problems, such as Brain-Computer Interfaces, analyses of the covariances between brain regions remain underutilized in sleep stage scoring.Methods: Expanding upon our previous work, we investigate the capabilities of SPDTransNet, a Transformer-derived network designed to classify sleep stages from EEG data through timeseries of covariance matrices. Furthermore, we present a novel way of integrating learned signal-wise features into said matrices without sacrificing their Symmetric Definite Positive (SPD) nature.Results: Through comparison with other State-of-the-Art models within a methodology optimized for class-wise performance, we achieve a level of performance at or beyond various State-of-the-Art models, both in single-dataset and - particularly - multi-dataset experiments.Conclusion: In this article, we prove the capabilities of our SPDTransNet model, particularly its adaptability to multi-dataset tasks, within the context of EEG sleep stage scoring - though it could easily be adapted to any classification task involving timeseries of covariance matrices.</description>

      <title>Integrating Deep Learning for Arrhythmia Detection with Automated Drug Delivery: A Comprehensive Approach to Cardiac Health Monitoring and Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrhythmias are irregularities in the hearts electrical system which cause rapid and irregular heartbeats. These heart conditions affect over 33 million people globally and significantly increase the risk of severe complications, including stroke, heart failure, and sudden death. Modern screening and treatment approaches, like 12 lead ECG tests and analyzing patient medical history, use frameworks that dont address early onset of conditions and lack sufficient information to optimize treatment plans post diagnosis. This project aimed to enhance cardiac arrhythmias early diagnosis, monitoring, analysis, and treatment using an optimized 5 step patient pathway. We developed deep learning models using ECG, PPG, and SpO2 data to monitor conditions remotely with smartwatches and document arrhythmic episodes with relevant information, including daily patterns. We synthesized these into patient reports suitable for real world clinical, providing enough information to guide treatment decisions before any new diagnostics. For critical care in a hospitalized setting or personalized home care, we developed a novel drug delivery system synchronized with a phone via Bluetooth and uses prescription based or prediction based to deliver medication intravenously at the optimal time. This approach could reduce the need for additional diagnostic tests, streamline patient management, and optimize medication schedules to better align with the individuals physiological needs, significantly improving patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Transferable Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Radio Resource Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio resource allocation often calls for the optimization of black-box objective functions whose evaluation is expensive in real-world deployments. Conventional optimization methods apply separately to each new system configuration, causing the number of evaluations to be impractical under constraints on computational resources or timeliness. Toward a remedy for this issue, this paper introduces a multi-fidelity continual optimization framework that hinges on a novel information-theoretic acquisition function. The new strategy probes candidate solutions so as to balance the need to retrieve information about the current optimization task with the goal of acquiring information transferable to future resource allocation tasks, while satisfying a query budget constraint. Experiments on uplink power control in a multi-cell multi-antenna system demonstrate that the proposed method substantially improves the optimization efficiency after processing a sufficiently large number of tasks.</description>

      <title>Non-invasive Neural Decoding in Source Reconstructed Brain Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-invasive brainwave decoding is usually done using Magneto/Electroencephalography (MEG/EEG) sensor measurements as inputs. This makes combining datasets and building models with inductive biases difficult as most datasets use different scanners and the sensor arrays have a nonintuitive spatial structure. In contrast, fMRI scans are acquired directly in brain space, a voxel grid with a typical structured input representation. By using established techniques to reconstruct the sensors' sources' neural activity it is possible to decode from voxels for MEG data as well. We show that this enables spatial inductive biases, spatial data augmentations, better interpretability, zero-shot generalisation between datasets, and data harmonisation.</description>

      <title>Contrastive random lead coding for channel-agnostic self-supervision of biosignals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive learning yields impressive results for self-supervision in computer vision. The approach relies on the creation of positive pairs, something which is often achieved through augmentations. However, for multivariate time series effective augmentations can be difficult to design. Additionally, the number of input channels for biosignal datasets often varies from application to application, limiting the usefulness of large self-supervised models trained with specific channel configurations. Motivated by these challenges, we set out to investigate strategies for creation of positive pairs for channel-agnostic self-supervision of biosignals. We introduce contrastive random lead coding (CRLC), where random subsets of the input channels are used to create positive pairs and compare with using augmentations and neighboring segments in time as positive pairs. We validate our approach by pre-training models on EEG and ECG data, and then fine-tuning them for downstream tasks. CRLC outperforms competing strategies in both scenarios in the channel-agnostic setting. For EEG, the approach additionally outperforms the state-of-the-art reference model. Notably, for EEG tasks CRLC surpasses the current state-of-the-art reference model. While, the state-of-the-art reference model is superior in the ECG task, incorporating CRLC allows us to obtain comparable results. In conclusion, CRLC helps generalization across variable channel setups when training our channel-agnostic model.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Transformer and Reinforcement Learning-based Beam Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam management is an important technique to improve signal strength and reduce interference in wireless communication systems. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using diverse sensing modalities for beam management. However, it remains a big challenge to process multi-modal data efficiently and extract useful information. On the other hand, the recently emerging multi-modal transformer (MMT) is a promising technique that can process multi-modal data by capturing long-range dependencies. While MMT is highly effective in handling multi-modal data and providing robust beam management, integrating reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances their adaptability in dynamic environments. In this work, we propose a two-step beam management method by combining MMT with RL for dynamic beam index prediction. In the first step, we divide available beam indices into several groups and leverage MMT to process diverse data modalities to predict the optimal beam group. In the second step, we employ RL for fast beam decision-making within each group, which in return maximizes throughput. Our proposed framework is tested on a 6G dataset. In this testing scenario, it achieves higher beam prediction accuracy and system throughput compared to both the MMT-only based method and the RL-only based method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is ubiquitous across various healthcare domains, such as cardiac arrhythmia detection and sleep monitoring, making ECG analysis critically essential. Traditional deep learning models for ECG are task-specific, with a narrow scope of functionality and limited generalization capabilities. Recently, foundation models (FMs), also known as large pre-training models, have fundamentally reshaped the scheme of model design and representation learning, enhancing the performance across a variety of downstream tasks. This success has drawn interest in the exploration of FMs to address ECG-based medical challenges concurrently. This survey provides a timely, comprehensive and up-to-date overview of FMs for large-scale ECG-FMs. First, we offer a brief background introduction to FMs. Then, we discuss the model architectures, pre-training methods, and adaptation approaches of ECG-FMs from a methodology perspective. Despite the promising opportunities of ECG-FMs, we also outline the challenges and potential future directions. Overall, this survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with insights into the research of ECG-FMs on theoretical underpinnings, domain-specific applications, and avenues for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Regression-Based Lithium-Ion Battery End-of-Life Prediction Model under Various Operating Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the efficient and safe use of lithium-ion batteries, diagnosing their current state and predicting future states are crucial. Although there exist many models for the prediction of battery cycle life, they typically have very complex input structures, making it very difficult and expensive to develop such models. As an alternative, in this work, a model that predicts the nominal end-of-life using only operating conditions as input is proposed. Specifically, a total of 100 battery degradation data were generated using a pseudo two-dimensional model with three major operating conditions: charging C-rate, ambient temperature and depth-of-discharge. Then, a Gaussian process regression-based model was developed to predict the nominal end-of-life using these operating conditions as the inputs. To improve the model accuracy, novel kernels were proposed, which are tailored to each operating condition. The proposed kernels reduced the lifetime prediction error by 46.62% compared to the conventional kernels.</description>

      <title>Multi-IRS Enhanced Wireless Coverage: Deployment Optimization Based on Large-Scale Channel Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) deployment problem where a number of IRSs are optimally placed in a target area to improve its signal coverage with the serving base station (BS). To achieve this, we assume that there is a given set of candidate sites in the target area for deploying IRSs and divide the area into multiple grids of identical size. Then, we derive the average channel power gains from the BS to IRS in each candidate site and from this IRS to any grid in the target area in terms of IRS deployment parameters, including its size, position, height, and orientation. Thus, we are able to approximate the average cascaded channel power gain from the BS to each grid via any IRS, assuming an effective IRS reflection gain based on the large-scale channel knowledge only. Next, we formulate a multi-IRS deployment optimization problem to minimize the total deployment cost by selecting a subset of candidate sites for deploying IRSs and jointly optimizing their heights, orientations, and numbers of reflecting elements while satisfying a given coverage rate performance requirement over all grids in the target area. To solve this challenging combinatorial optimization problem, we first reformulate it as an integer linear programming problem and solve it optimally using the branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm. In addition, we propose an efficient successive refinement algorithm to further reduce computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed lower-complexity successive refinement algorithm achieves near-optimal performance but with significantly reduced running time compared to the proposed optimal BB algorithm, as well as superior performance-cost trade-off than other baseline IRS deployment strategies.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal Non-Invasive Deep Learning Framework for Progressive Prediction of Seizures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative framework designed for progressive (granular in time to onset) prediction of seizures through the utilization of a Deep Learning (DL) methodology based on non-invasive multi-modal sensor networks. Epilepsy, a debilitating neurological condition, affects an estimated 65 million individuals globally, with a substantial proportion facing drug-resistant epilepsy despite pharmacological interventions. To address this challenge, we advocate for predictive systems that provide timely alerts to individuals at risk, enabling them to take precautionary actions. Our framework employs advanced DL techniques and uses personalized data from a network of non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. The algorithms are optimized for real-time processing on edge devices, mitigating privacy concerns and minimizing data transmission overhead inherent in cloud-based solutions, ultimately preserving battery energy. Additionally, our system predicts the countdown time to seizures (with 15-minute intervals up to an hour prior to the onset), offering critical lead time for preventive actions. Our multi-modal model achieves 95% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and 97% accuracy, averaged among 29 patients.</description>

      <title>ISDNN: A Deep Neural Network for Channel Estimation in Massive MIMO systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (massive MIMO) technology stands as a cornerstone in 5G and beyonds. Despite the remarkable advancements offered by massive MIMO technology, the extreme number of antennas introduces challenges during the channel estimation (CE) phase. In this paper, we propose a single-step Deep Neural Network (DNN) for CE, termed Iterative Sequential DNN (ISDNN), inspired by recent developments in data detection algorithms. ISDNN is a DNN based on the projected gradient descent algorithm for CE problems, with the iterative iterations transforming into a DNN using the deep unfolding method. Furthermore, we introduce the structured channel ISDNN (S-ISDNN), extending ISDNN to incorporate side information such as directions of signals and antenna array configurations for enhanced CE. Simulation results highlight that ISDNN significantly outperforms another DNN-based CE (DetNet), in terms of training time (13%), running time (4.6%), and accuracy (0.43 dB). Furthermore, the S-ISDNN demonstrates even faster than ISDNN in terms of training time, though its overall performance still requires further improvement.</description>

      <title>On-Site Precise Screening of SARS-CoV-2 Systems Using a Channel-Wise Attention-Based PLS-1D-CNN Model with Limited Infrared Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the early stages of respiratory virus outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the efficient utilize of limited nasopharyngeal swabs for rapid and accurate screening is crucial for public health. In this study, we present a methodology that integrates attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) with the adaptive iteratively reweighted penalized least squares (airPLS) preprocessing algorithm and a channel-wise attention-based partial least squares one-dimensional convolutional neural network (PLS-1D-CNN) model, enabling accurate screening of infected individuals within 10 minutes. Two cohorts of nasopharyngeal swab samples, comprising 126 and 112 samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant cases, were collected at Beijing You'an Hospital for verification. Given that ATR-FTIR spectra are highly sensitive to variations in experimental conditions, which can affect their quality, we propose a biomolecular importance (BMI) evaluation method to assess signal quality across different conditions, validated by comparing BMI with PLS-GBM and PLS-RF results. For the ATR-FTIR signals in cohort 2, which exhibited a higher BMI, airPLS was utilized for signal preprocessing, followed by the application of the channel-wise attention-based PLS-1D-CNN model for screening. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms recently reported methods in the field of respiratory virus spectrum detection, achieving a recognition screening accuracy of 96.48%, a sensitivity of 96.24%, a specificity of 97.14%, an F1-score of 96.12%, and an AUC of 0.99. It meets the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended criteria for an acceptable product: sensitivity of 95.00% or greater and specificity of 97.00% or greater for testing prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in moderate to high volume scenarios.</description>

      <title>Unleashing Dynamic Range and Resolution in Unlimited Sensing Framework via Novel Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional digitization based on the Shannon-Nyquist method, implemented via analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), faces fundamental limitations. High-dynamic-range (HDR) signals often get clipped or saturated in practice. Given a fixed bit budget, one must choose between minimizing quantization noise or accommodating HDR inputs. The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) eliminates saturation by incorporating nonlinear folding in analog hardware, resulting in modulo signals. Quantizing or digitizing modulo signals enables low quantization noise as the modulo representation maps HDR signals into low-dynamic-range (LDR) samples. In the context of USF, the core innovation of this paper is a novel, low-cost, integrator-based efficient modulo ADC hardware implementation that imposes no restrictions on folding rates, enabling significantly HDR capture. The feasibility of this design is demonstrated by hardware experiments showcasing clear advantages across different quantitative performance metrics. These include capturing HDR signals with a 60-fold increase in dynamic range, achieving up to 5 Effective Number of Bits (ENOBs), and improving Signal-to-Noise and Distortion (SINAD) by 30 dB.</description>

      <title>Age of Information-Oriented Probabilistic Link Scheduling for Device-to-Device Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on optimizing the long-term average age of information (AoI) in device-to-device (D2D) networks through age-aware link scheduling. The problem is naturally formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). However, finding the optimal policy for the formulated MDP in its original form is challenging due to the intertwined AoI dynamics of all D2D links. To address this, we propose an age-aware stationary randomized policy that determines the probability of scheduling each link in each time slot based on the AoI of all links and the statistical channel state information among all transceivers. By employing the Lyapunov optimization framework, our policy aims to minimize the Lyapunov drift in every time slot. Nonetheless, this per-slot minimization problem is nonconvex due to cross-link interference in D2D networks, posing significant challenges for real-time decision-making. After analyzing the permutation equivariance property of the optimal solutions to the per-slot problem, we apply a message passing neural network (MPNN), a type of graph neural network that also exhibits permutation equivariance, to optimize the per-slot problem in an unsupervised learning manner. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed age-aware stationary randomized policy over baselines and validate the scalability of our method.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Assisted Jamming Mitigation with Movable Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reveals the potential of movable antennas in enhancing anti-jamming communication. We consider a legitimate communication link in the presence of multiple jammers and propose deploying a movable antenna array at the receiver to combat jamming attacks. We formulate the problem as a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio maximization, by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming and antenna element positioning. Due to the non-convexity and multi-fold difficulties from an optimization perspective, we develop a deep learning-based framework where beamforming is tackled as a Rayleigh quotient problem, while antenna positioning is addressed through multi-layer perceptron training. The neural network parameters are optimized using stochastic gradient descent to achieve effective jamming mitigation strategy, featuring offline training with marginal complexity for online inference. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal anti-jamming performance thereby significantly improving the efficiency in strategy determination.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Reconstruction through a Gaussian Adaptive Selective Outlier Rejecting Smoother</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory Reconstruction (TR) is vital for accurately mapping movement patterns and validating analyses, especially in fields like robotics, biomechanics, and environmental tracking, where data might be missing or affected by outliers. Improving Trajectory estimation by employing Gaussian smoothing techniques in the presence of non-Gaussian noise is the subject of this work. We consider the case where data is collected from independent sensors. A variational Bayesian (VB) based Unscented Raunch-Tung-Striebel smoothing (URTSS) scheme is proposed which adopts a vectorized weighing mechanism for the measurement covariance matrix to selectively remove contaminated measurements at each time step. To improve our outlier mitigation, we model our outlier characteristics as a Gamma distribution and dynamically learn the parameters of this distribution from data. We verify the performance of our proposed smoother by a range of simulations and experimental data. We also propose a robustness criterion for smoothers based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and show that our proposed method complies with this criterion.</description>

      <title>Realization of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces with Space-Time Coded Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents experimental realization of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) using space-time coding metasurfaces to enable concurrent beam steering and data modulation. The proposed approach harnesses the capabilities of metasurfaces, allowing precise temporal control over individual unit cells of the RIS. We show that by employing proper binary codes manipulating the state of unit cells, the RIS can act as a digital data modulator with beam steering capability. We describe the experimental setup and computational tools, followed by validation through harmonic generation and investigation of beam steering and data modulation. Additionally, four digital modulation schemes are evaluated. By implementing customized binary codes, constellations under varying conditions are compared, showcasing the potential for real-world applications. This study offers new insights into the practical implementation of RIS for advanced wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning-Driven Wireless System for Structural Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a wireless system integrated with a machine learning (ML) model for structural health monitoring (SHM) of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) structures, primarily targeting aerospace applications. The system collects data via carbon nanotube (CNT) piezoresistive sensors embedded within CFRP coupons, wirelessly transmitting these data to a central server for processing. A deep neural network (DNN) model predicts mechanical properties and can be extended to forecast structural failures, facilitating proactive maintenance and enhancing safety. The modular design supports scalability and can be embedded within digital twin frameworks, offering significant benefits to aircraft operators and manufacturers. The system utilizes an ML model with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.14 on test data for forecasting mechanical properties. Data transmission latency throughout the entire system is less than one second in a LAN setup, highlighting its potential for real-time monitoring applications in aerospace and other industries. However, while the system shows promise, challenges such as sensor reliability under extreme environmental conditions and the need for advanced ML models to handle diverse data streams have been identified as areas for future research.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Data based Semi-Supervised Learning for Vehicle Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a multi-modal data based semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework that jointly use channel state information (CSI) data and RGB images for vehicle positioning is designed. In particular, an outdoor positioning system where the vehicle locations are determined by a base station (BS) is considered. The BS equipped with several cameras can collect a large amount of unlabeled CSI data and a small number of labeled CSI data of vehicles, and the images taken by cameras. Although the collected images contain partial information of vehicles (i.e. azimuth angles of vehicles), the relationship between the unlabeled CSI data and its azimuth angle, and the distances between the BS and the vehicles captured by images are both unknown. Therefore, the images cannot be directly used as the labels of unlabeled CSI data to train a positioning model. To exploit unlabeled CSI data and images, a SSL framework that consists of a pretraining stage and a downstream training stage is proposed. In the pretraining stage, the azimuth angles obtained from the images are considered as the labels of unlabeled CSI data to pretrain the positioning model. In the downstream training stage, a small sized labeled dataset in which the accurate vehicle positions are considered as labels is used to retrain the model. Simulation results show that the proposed method can reduce the positioning error by up to 30% compared to a baseline where the model is not pretrained.</description>

      <title>Joint Channel Selection using FedDRL in V2X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication technology is revolutionizing transportation by enabling interactions between vehicles, devices, and infrastructures. This connectivity enhances road safety, transportation efficiency, and driver assistance systems. V2X benefits from Machine Learning, enabling real-time data analysis, better decision-making, and improved traffic predictions, making transportation safer and more efficient. In this paper, we study the problem of joint channel selection, where vehicles with different technologies choose one or more Access Points (APs) to transmit messages in a network. In this problem, vehicles must learn a strategy for channel selection, based on observations that incorporate vehicles' information (position and speed), network and communication data (Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio from past communications), and environmental data (road type). We propose an approach based on Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FedDRL), which enables each vehicle to benefit from other vehicles' experiences. Specifically, we apply the federated Proximal Policy Optimization (FedPPO) algorithm to this task. We show that this method improves communication reliability while minimizing transmission costs and channel switches. The efficiency of the proposed solution is assessed via realistic simulations, highlighting the potential of FedDRL to advance V2X technology.</description>

      <title>KANsformer for Scalable Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an unsupervised deep-learning (DL) approach by integrating transformer and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) termed KANsformer to realize scalable beamforming for mobile communication systems. Specifically, we consider a classic multi-input-single-output energy efficiency maximization problem subject to the total power budget. The proposed KANsformer first extracts hidden features via a multi-head self-attention mechanism and then reads out the desired beamforming design via KAN. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the KANsformer in terms of generalization performance, transfer learning and ablation experiment. Overall, the KANsformer outperforms existing benchmark DL approaches, and is adaptable to the change in the number of mobile users with real-time and near-optimal inference.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sensor Placement for TDOA-Based Source Localization with Sensor Location Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of time difference of arrival (TDOA)-based source localization is influenced by sensor location deployment. Many studies focus on optimal sensor placement (OSP) for TDOA-based localization without sensor location noises (OSP-WSLN). In practice, there are sensor location errors due to installation deviations, etc, which implies the necessity of studying OSP under sensor location noises (OSP-SLN). There are two fundamental problems: What is the OSP-SLN strategy? To what extent do sensor location errors affect the performance of OSP-SLN? For the first one, under the assumption of the near-field and full set of TDOA, minimizing the trace of the Cramer-Rao bound is used as optimization criteria. Based on this, a concise equality, namely Eq. (18), is proven to show that OSP-SLN is equivalent to OSP-WSLN. Extensive simulations validate both equality and equivalence and respond to the second problem: not large sensor position errors give an ignorable negative impact on the performance of OSP-SLN quantified by the trace of CRB. Also, simulations show source localization accuracy with OSP-SLN outperforms that with random placement. These simulations validate our derived OSP-SLN and its effectiveness. We have open-sourced the code for community use.</description>

      <title>Wearable-Based Real-time Freezing of Gait Detection in Parkinson's Disease Using Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LIFT-PD is an innovative self-supervised learning framework developed for real-time detection of Freezing of Gait (FoG) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients, using a single triaxial accelerometer. It minimizes the reliance on large labeled datasets by applying a Differential Hopping Windowing Technique (DHWT) to address imbalanced data during training. Additionally, an Opportunistic Inference Module is used to reduce energy consumption by activating the model only during active movement periods. Extensive testing on publicly available datasets showed that LIFT-PD improved precision by 7.25% and accuracy by 4.4% compared to supervised models, while using 40% fewer labeled samples and reducing inference time by 67%. These findings make LIFT-PD a highly practical and energy-efficient solution for continuous, in-home monitoring of PD patients.</description>

      <title>Rate Region of RIS-Aided URLLC Broadcast Channels: Diagonal versus Beyond Diagonal Globally Passive RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the finite-block-length rate region of wireless systems aided by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), employing treating interference as noise. We consider three nearly passive RIS architectures, including locally passive (LP) diagonal (D), globally passive (GP) D, and GP beyond diagonal (BD) RISs. In a GP RIS, the power constraint is applied globally to the whole surface, while some elements may amplify the incident signal locally. The considered RIS architectures provide substantial performance gains compared with systems operating without RIS. GP BD-RIS outperforms, at the price of increasing the complexity, LP and GP D-RIS as it enlarges the feasible set of allowed solutions. However, the gain provided by BD-RIS decreases with the number of RIS elements. Additionally, deploying RISs provides higher gains as the reliability/latency requirement becomes more stringent.</description>

      <title>Enhanced channel estimation for near-field IRS-aided multi-user MIMO system via deep residual network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, channel estimation (CE) of intelligent reflecting surface aided near-field (NF) multi-user communication is investigated. Initially, the least square (LS) estimator and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator for the estimated channel are designed, and their mean square errors (MSEs) are derived. Subsequently, to fully harness the potential of deep residual networks (DRNs) in denoising, the above CE problem is reconceptualized as a denoising task, and a DRN-driven NF CE (DRN-NFCE) framework is proposed, and the Cram$\acute{e}$r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to serve as a benchmark for performance evaluation. In addition, to effectively capture and leverage these diverse channel features, a federated learning (FL) based global DRN-NFCE network, namely FL-DRN-NFCE, is constructed through collaborative training and joint optimization of single region DRN-NFCE (SR-DRN-NFCE) networks in different user regions. Here, users are divided into multiple regions. Correspondingly, a user region classifier based on convolutional neural network is designed to achieve the goal of matching datasets from different user regions to the corresponding SR-DRN-NFCE network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FL-DRN-NFCE framework outperforms LS, MMSE, and no residual connections in terms of MSE, and the proposed FL-DRN-NFCE method has higher CE accuracy over the SR-DRN-NFCE method.</description>

      <title>Performance of User-Assisted Nonlinear Energy Harvesting NOMA Network with Alamouti/MRC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on evaluating the outage performance of a dual-hop single-phase non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) system. The base station employs the Alamouti space-time block coding technique (Alamouti-STBC), enabling simultaneous communication with two mobile users, and the far user employs a maximal ratio combining (MRC) scheme. In this setup, the near user serves as a full-duplex (FD) (or half-duplex (HD)) energy harvesting (EH) relay, adopting decode-and-forward (DF) protocol for the far user. The study involves the development of a system model and the closed-form equations of exact and asymptotic outage probabilities (OP) over Nakagami-m fading channels with and without direct link considering a threshold-based nonlinear EH relaying model. We verify analytical results by Monte Carlo simulations and show that the presence of a direct link in the system enhances the performance of the far user considerably by mitigating the degradation caused by the self-interference in the near user.</description>

      <title>Shannon-like Interpolation with Spectral Priors and Weighted Hilbert Spaces: Beyond the Nyquist Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we draw connections between the classical Shannon interpolation of bandlimited deterministic signals and the literature on estimating continuous-time random processes from their samples (known in various communities under different names, such as Wiener-Kolmogorov filtering, Gaussian process regression, and kriging). This leads to the realization that Shannon interpolation can be interpreted as implicitly expecting that the unknown signal has uniform spectral density within its bandwidth. However, in many practical applications, we often expect more energy at some frequencies than at others. This leads us to propose novel Shannon-like interpolators that are optimal with respect to appropriately-constructed weighted Hilbert spaces, where weighting enables us to accommodate prior information about nonuniform spectral density. Although our new interpolants are derived for data obtained with any sampling rate, we observe that they are particularly useful for interpolating sub-Nyquist data. In addition to theory, we also discuss aspects of practical implementation and show illustrative examples to demonstrate the potential benefits of the approach.</description>

      <title>Large Model for Small Data: Foundation Model for Cross-Modal RF Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio-Frequency (RF)-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) rises as a promising solution for applications unamenable to techniques requiring computer visions. However, the scarcity of labeled RF data due to their non-interpretable nature poses a significant obstacle. Thanks to the recent breakthrough of foundation models (FMs), extracting deep semantic insights from unlabeled visual data become viable, yet these vision-based FMs fall short when applied to small RF datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce FM-Fi, an innovative cross-modal framework engineered to translate the knowledge of vision-based FMs for enhancing RF-based HAR systems. FM-Fi involves a novel cross-modal contrastive knowledge distillation mechanism, enabling an RF encoder to inherit the interpretative power of FMs for achieving zero-shot learning. It also employs the intrinsic capabilities of FM and RF to remove extraneous features for better alignment between the two modalities. The framework is further refined through metric-based few-shot learning techniques, aiming to boost the performance for predefined HAR tasks. Comprehensive evaluations evidently indicate that FM-Fi rivals the effectiveness of vision-based methodologies, and the evaluation results provide empirical validation of FM-Fi's generalizability across various environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The RESISTO project represents a pioneering initiative in Europe aimed at enhancing the resilience of the power grid through the integration of advanced technologies. This includes artificial intelligence and thermal surveillance systems to mitigate the impact of extreme meteorological phenomena. RESISTO endeavors to predict, prevent, detect, and recover from weather-related incidents, ultimately enhancing the quality of service provided and ensuring grid stability and efficiency in the face of evolving climate challenges. In this study, we introduce one of the fundamental pillars of the project: a monitoring system for the operating temperature of different regions within power transformers, aiming to detect and alert early on potential thermal anomalies. To achieve this, a distributed system of thermal cameras for real-time temperature monitoring has been deployed in The Do\~nana National Park, alongside servers responsible for the storing, analyzing, and alerting of any potential thermal anomalies. An adaptive prediction model was developed for temperature forecasting, which learns online from the newly available data. In order to test the long-term performance of the proposed solution, we generated a synthetic temperature database for the whole of the year 2022. Overall, the proposed system exhibits promising capabilities in predicting and detecting thermal anomalies in power electric transformers, showcasing potential applications in enhancing grid reliability and preventing equipment failures.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Deep Learning based RMT Data Inversion using Gaussian Random Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods have emerged as a powerful tool for the inversion of geophysical data. When applied to field data, these models often struggle without additional fine-tuning of the network. This is because they are built on the assumption that the statistical patterns in the training and test datasets are the same. To address this, we propose a DL-based inversion scheme for Radio Magnetotelluric data where the subsurface resistivity models are generated using Gaussian Random Fields (GRF). The network's generalization ability was tested with an out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset comprising a homogeneous background and various rectangular-shaped anomalous bodies. After end-to-end training with the GRF dataset, the pre-trained network successfully identified anomalies in the OOD dataset. Synthetic experiments confirmed that the GRF dataset enhances generalization compared to a homogeneous background OOD dataset. The network accurately recovered structures in a checkerboard resistivity model, and demonstrated robustness to noise, outperforming traditional gradient-based methods. Finally, the developed scheme is tested using exemplary field data from a waste site near Roorkee, India. The proposed scheme enhances generalization in a data-driven supervised learning framework, suggesting a promising direction for OOD generalization in DL methods.</description>

      <title>A Photonic Crystal Receiver for Rydberg Atom-Based Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom-based sensors use atoms dressed by lasers to detect and measure radio frequency electromagnetic fields. The absorptive properties of the atomic gas, configured as a Rydberg atom-based sensor, change in the presence of a radio frequency electromagnetic field. While these sensors are reasonably sensitive, the best conventional radio frequency sensors still outperform Rydberg atom-based sensors with respect to sensitivity. One approach to increase the sensitivity of Rydberg atom-based sensors is to engineer the vapor cell that contains the atomic gas. In this work, we introduce a passive, all-dielectric amplifier integrated into a Rydberg atom-based sensor vapor cell. The vapor cell is a combination of a slot waveguide and a photonic crystal. The structural features of the vapor cell yield a power amplification of ~24 dB. The radio frequency electromagnetic field is coupled adiabatically into the slot waveguide and slowed to increase the interaction between the radio frequency field and the atoms to effectively amplify the incoming signal, i.e., increase the Rabi frequency on the radio frequency transition. The work shows the utility of vapor cell engineering for atom-based quantum technologies and paves the way for other such devices.</description>

      <title>A New Non-Binary Response Generation Scheme from Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are widely used in key generation, with each PUF cell typically producing one bit of data. To enable the extraction of longer keys, a new non-binary response generation scheme based on the one-probability of PUF bits is proposed. Instead of using PUF bits directly as keys, non-binary responses are first derived by comparing the one-frequency of PUF bits with thresholds that evenly divide the area under the probability density function of the one-probability distribution and then converted to binary keys. To simplify the calculation of these thresholds, a re-scaling process is proposed and the beta distribution is used to model the one-probability distribution. Our FPGA implementation results demonstrate a significant increase in effective key length as opposed to previous works. Finally, we estimate the error rates and biases of the generated keys, and confirm the feasibility of the proposed key generation scheme.</description>

      <title>PaPaGei: Open Foundation Models for Optical Physiological Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is the most widely used non-invasive technique for monitoring biosignals and cardiovascular health, with applications in both clinical settings and consumer health through wearable devices. Current machine learning models trained on PPG signals are mostly task-specific and lack generalizability. Previous works often used single-device datasets, did not explore out-of-domain generalization, or did not release their models, hindering reproducibility and further research. We introduce PaPaGei, the first open foundation model for PPG signals. PaPaGei is pre-trained on more than 57,000 hours of 20 million unlabeled segments of PPG signals using publicly available datasets exclusively. We evaluate against popular time-series foundation models and other benchmarks on 20 tasks of 10 diverse datasets spanning cardiovascular health, sleep disorders, pregnancy monitoring, and wellbeing assessment. Our architecture incorporates novel representation learning approaches that leverage differences in PPG signal morphology across individuals, enabling it to capture richer representations than traditional contrastive learning methods. Across 20 tasks, PaPaGei improves classification and regression performance by an average of 6.3% and 2.9%, respectively, compared to other competitive time-series foundation models in at least 14 tasks. PaPaGei is more data- and parameter-efficient than other foundation models or methods, as it outperforms 70x larger models. Beyond accuracy, we also investigate robustness against different skin tones, establishing a benchmark for bias evaluations of future models. Notably, PaPaGei can be used out of the box as both a feature extractor and an encoder for other multimodal models, opening up new opportunities for multimodal health monitoring</description>

      <title>A Framework for Real-Time Volcano-Seismic Event Recognition Based on Multi-Station Seismograms and Semantic Segmentation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In volcano monitoring, effective recognition of seismic events is essential for understanding volcanic activity and raising timely warning alerts. Traditional methods rely on manual analysis, which can be subjective and labor-intensive. Furthermore, current automatic approaches often tackle detection and classification separately, mostly rely on single station information and generally require tailored preprocessing and representations to perform predictions. These limitations often hinder their application to real-time monitoring and utilization across different volcano conditions. This study introduces a novel approach that utilizes Semantic Segmentation models to automate seismic event recognition by applying a straight forward transformation of multi-channel 1D signals into 2D representations, enabling their use as images. Our framework employs a data-driven, end-to-end design that integrates multi-station seismic data with minimal preprocessing, performing both detection and classification simultaneously for five seismic event classes. We evaluated four state-of-the-art segmentation models (UNet, UNet++, DeepLabV3+ and SwinUNet) on approximately 25.000 seismic events recorded at four different Chilean volcanoes: Nevados del Chill\'an Volcanic Complex, Laguna del Maule, Villarrica and Puyehue-Cord\'on Caulle. Among these models, the UNet architecture was identified as the most effective model, achieving mean F1 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of up to 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, and demonstrating superior noise robustness and model flexibility to unseen volcano datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to simultaneously optimize indoor wireless and daylight performance by adjusting the positions of windows and the beam directions of window-deployed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for RIS-aided outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) networks utilizing large language models (LLM) as optimizers. Firstly, we illustrate the wireless and daylight system models of RIS-aided O2I networks and formulate a joint optimization problem to enhance both wireless traffic sum rate and daylight illumination performance. Then, we present a multi-modal LLM-based window optimization (LMWO) framework, accompanied by a prompt construction template to optimize the overall performance in a zero-shot fashion, functioning as both an architect and a wireless network planner. Finally, we analyze the optimization performance of the LMWO framework and the impact of the number of windows, room size, number of RIS units, and daylight factor. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed LMWO framework can achieve outstanding optimization performance in terms of initial performance, convergence speed, final outcomes, and time complexity, compared with classic optimization methods. The building's wireless performance can be significantly enhanced while ensuring indoor daylight performance.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Puncturing Patterns of 5G NR LDPC Codes for Few-Iteration Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rate-matching of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes enables a single code description to support a wide range of code lengths and rates. In 5G NR, rate matching is accomplished by extending (lifting) a base code to a desired target length and by puncturing (not transmitting) certain code bits. LDPC codes and rate matching are typically designed for the asymptotic performance limit with an ideal decoder. Practical LDPC decoders, however, carry out tens or fewer message-passing decoding iterations to achieve the target throughput and latency of modern wireless systems. We show that one can optimize LDPC code puncturing patterns for such few-iteration-constrained decoders using a method we call swapping of punctured and transmitted blocks (SPAT). Our simulation results show that SPAT yields from 0.20 dB up to 0.55 dB improved signal-to-noise ratio performance compared to the standard 5G NR LDPC code puncturing pattern for a wide range of code lengths and rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long scan time significantly hinders the widespread applications of three-dimensional multi-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance (3D-MC-CMR) imaging. This study aims to accelerate 3D-MC-CMR acquisition by a novel method based on score-based diffusion models with self-supervised learning. Specifically, we first establish a mapping between the undersampled k-space measurements and the MR images, utilizing a self-supervised Bayesian reconstruction network. Secondly, we develop a joint score-based diffusion model on 3D-MC-CMR images to capture their inherent distribution. The 3D-MC-CMR images are finally reconstructed using the conditioned Langenvin Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. This approach enables accurate reconstruction without fully sampled training data. Its performance was tested on the dataset acquired by a 3D joint myocardial T1 and T1rho mapping sequence. The T1 and T1rho maps were estimated via a dictionary matching method from the reconstructed images. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional compressed sensing and existing self-supervised deep learning MRI reconstruction methods. It also achieves high quality T1 and T1rho parametric maps close to the reference maps, even at a high acceleration rate of 14.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new, modular, open-source, Python-based 3D+time fMRI data simulation software, \emph{SNAKE-fMRI}, which stands for \emph{S}imulator from \emph{N}eurovascular coupling to \emph{A}cquisition of \emph{K}-space data for \emph{E}xploration of fMRI acquisition techniques.Unlike existing tools, the goal here is to simulate the complete chain of fMRI data acquisition, from the spatio-temporal design of evoked brain responses to various multi-coil k-space data 3D sampling strategies, with the possibility of extending the forward acquisition model to various noise and artifact sources while remaining memory-efficient.By using this \emph{in silico} setup, we are thus able to provide realistic and reproducible ground truth for fMRI reconstruction methods in 3D accelerated acquisition settings and explore the influence of critical parameters, such as the acceleration factor and signal-to-noise ratio~(SNR), on downstream tasks of image reconstruction and statistical analysis of evoked brain activity.We present three scenarios of increasing complexity to showcase the flexibility, versatility, and fidelity of \emph{SNAKE-fMRI}: From a temporally-fixed full 3D Cartesian to various 3D non-Cartesian sampling patterns, we can compare -- with reproducibility guarantees -- how experimental paradigms, acquisition strategies and reconstruction methods contribute and interact together, affecting the downstream statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Secret and Covert Communications for Multi-User Multi-Antenna Uplink UAV Systems: Design and Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by diverse secure requirements of multi-user in UAV systems, we propose a collaborative secret and covert transmission method for multi-antenna ground users to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. Specifically, based on the power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), two ground users with distinct security requirements, named Bob and Carlo, superimpose their signals and transmit the combined signal to the UAV named Alice. An adversary Willie attempts to simultaneously eavesdrop Bob's confidential message and detect whether Carlo is transmitting or not. We derive close-form expressions of the secrecy connection probability (SCP) and the covert connection probability (CCP) to evaluate the link reliability for wiretap and covert transmissions, respectively. Furthermore, we bound the secrecy outage probability (SOP) from Bob to Alice and the detection error probability (DEP) of Willie to evaluate the link security for wiretap and covert transmissions, respectively. To characterize the theoretical benchmark of the above model, we formulate a weighted multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the average of secret and covert transmission rates subject to constraints SOP, DEP, the beamformers of Bob and Carlo, and UAV trajectory parameters. To solve the optimization problem, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm using successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent (SCA-BCD) methods. Our results reveal the influence of design parameters of the system on the wiretap and covert rates, analytically and numerically.

      <title>Extended Road-Aware Line-of-Sight Probability Model for Urban Air Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As urban air mobility (UAM) emerges as a transformative solution to urban transportation, the demand for robust communication frameworks capable of supporting high-density aerial traffic becomes increasingly critical. An essential area of communications improvement is reliably characterizing and minimizing interference on UAM aircraft from other aircraft and ground vehicles. To achieve this, accurate line-of-sight (LOS) models must be used. In this work, we highlight the limitations of a LOS probability model extensively used in the literature in accurately predicting interference caused by ground vehicles. Then, we introduce a modified probability of LOS model that improves interference prediction by incorporating the urban topography and the dynamic positioning of ground vehicles on streets. Our model's parameters are derived from extensive simulations and validated through real-world urban settings to ensure reliability and applicability.</description>

      <title>Affine OCDM: Designing Chirp-based Multicarrier System with Maximum Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of maximizing multipath diversity and coding gains of orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM)-based systems. We define and study an Affine OCDM (A-OCDM) system in which a chirp parameter is adapted based on block size to enable maximum diversity offered by frequency selective channels. Unlike linear constellation precoded (LCP)-OCDM, our proposed system effectively reduces implementation complexity while harnessing the full diversity potential offered by frequency-selective channels. Additionally, we explore and characterize the upper bounds on coding gains and diversity offered by linear equalizers (LEs). To further reduce the complexity of receive equalization, we propose a subchirp grouping method to multiplex chirp systems into independent sub-blocks. Corroborating simulations are presented to verify the theoretical results and the proposed A-OCDM system is shown to exhibit similar resilience to interference, while enjoying improved error performance, compared to OCDM.</description>

      <title>Bayes-Optimal Estimation in Generalized Linear Models via Spatial Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of signal estimation in a generalized linear model (GLM). GLMs include many canonical problems in statistical estimation, such as linear regression, phase retrieval, and 1-bit compressed sensing. Recent work has precisely characterized the asymptotic minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) for GLMs with i.i.d. Gaussian sensing matrices. However, in many models there is a significant gap between the MMSE and the performance of the best known feasible estimators. In this work, we address this issue by considering GLMs defined via spatially coupled sensing matrices. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for estimation and prove that with a simple choice of spatially coupled design, the MSE of a carefully tuned AMP estimator approaches the asymptotic MMSE in the high-dimensional limit. To prove the result, we first rigorously characterize the asymptotic performance of AMP for a GLM with a generic spatially coupled design. This characterization is in terms of a deterministic recursion (`state evolution') that depends on the parameters defining the spatial coupling. Then, using a simple spatially coupled design and a judicious choice of functions for the AMP algorithm, we analyze the fixed points of the resulting state evolution and show that it achieves the asymptotic MMSE. Numerical results for phase retrieval and rectified linear regression show that spatially coupled designs can yield substantially lower MSE than i.i.d. Gaussian designs at finite dimensions when used with AMP algorithms.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10270v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction is based on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes, i.e., the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET, which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). The $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET both form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs use a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to cascade the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation that is akin to local pooling in CNNs, and which may be performed either locally or per-scale. These pooling operations are harder to define in both traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets, and geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, we are able to extract a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be used along with very simple machine learning methods (i.e., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification systems with far fewer parameters to train than most modern graph neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our MHSNs in three distinct types of problems: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</description>

      <title>The HR-Calculus: Enabling Information Processing with Quaternion Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From their inception, quaternions and their division algebra have proven to be advantageous in modelling rotation/orientation in three-dimensional spaces and have seen use from the initial formulation of electromagnetic filed theory through to forming the basis of quantum filed theory. Despite their impressive versatility in modelling real-world phenomena, adaptive information processing techniques specifically designed for quaternion-valued signals have only recently come to the attention of the machine learning, signal processing, and control communities. The most important development in this direction is introduction of the HR-calculus, which provides the required mathematical foundation for deriving adaptive information processing techniques directly in the quaternion domain. In this article, the foundations of the HR-calculus are revised and the required tools for deriving adaptive learning techniques suitable for dealing with quaternion-valued signals, such as the gradient operator, chain and product derivative rules, and Taylor series expansion are presented. This serves to establish the most important applications of adaptive information processing in the quaternion domain for both single-node and multi-node formulations. The article is supported by Supplementary Material, which will be referred to as SM.</description>

      <title>Securing MIMO Wiretap Channel with Learning-Based Friendly Jamming under Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless communications are particularly vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks due to their broadcast nature. To effectively deal with eavesdroppers, existing security techniques usually require accurate channel state information (CSI), e.g., for friendly jamming (FJ), and/or additional computing resources at transceivers, e.g., cryptography-based solutions, which unfortunately may not be feasible in practice. This challenge is even more acute in low-end IoT devices. We thus introduce a novel deep learning-based FJ framework that can effectively defeat eavesdropping attacks with imperfect CSI and even without CSI of legitimate channels. In particular, we first develop an autoencoder-based communication architecture with FJ, namely AEFJ, to jointly maximize the secrecy rate and minimize the block error rate at the receiver without requiring perfect CSI of the legitimate channels. In addition, to deal with the case without CSI, we leverage the mutual information neural estimation (MINE) concept and design a MINE-based FJ scheme that can achieve comparable security performance to the conventional FJ methods that require perfect CSI. Extensive simulations in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system demonstrate that our proposed solution can effectively deal with eavesdropping attacks in various settings. Moreover, the proposed framework can seamlessly integrate MIMO security and detection tasks into a unified end-to-end learning process. This integrated approach can significantly maximize the throughput and minimize the block error rate, offering a good solution for enhancing communication security in wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>The ESPRIT algorithm under high noise: Optimal error scaling and noisy super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subspace-based signal processing techniques, such as the Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm, are popular methods for spectral estimation. These algorithms can achieve the so-called super-resolution scaling under low noise conditions, surpassing the well-known Nyquist limit. However, the performance of these algorithms under high-noise conditions is not as well understood. Existing state-of-the-art analysis indicates that ESPRIT and related algorithms can be resilient even for signals where each observation is corrupted by statistically independent, mean-zero noise of size $\mathcal{O}(1)$, but these analyses only show that the error $\epsilon$ decays at a slow rate $\epsilon=\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^{-1/2})$ with respect to the cutoff frequency $n$ (i.e., the maximum frequency of the measurements). In this work, we prove that under certain assumptions, the ESPRIT algorithm can attain a significantly improved error scaling $\epsilon = \mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^{-3/2})$, exhibiting noisy super-resolution scaling beyond the Nyquist limit $\epsilon = \mathcal{O}(n^{-1})$ given by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. We further establish a theoretical lower bound and show that this scaling is optimal. Our analysis introduces novel matrix perturbation results, which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>SpGesture: Source-Free Domain-adaptive sEMG-based Gesture Recognition with Jaccard Attentive Spiking Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) based gesture recognition offers a natural and intuitive interaction modality for wearable devices. Despite significant advancements in sEMG-based gesture-recognition models, existing methods often suffer from high computational latency and increased energy consumption. Additionally, the inherent instability of sEMG signals, combined with their sensitivity to distribution shifts in real-world settings, compromises model robustness. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel SpGesture framework based on Spiking Neural Networks, which possesses several unique merits compared with existing methods: (1) Robustness: By utilizing membrane potential as a memory list, we pioneer the introduction of Source-Free Domain Adaptation into SNN for the first time. This enables SpGesture to mitigate the accuracy degradation caused by distribution shifts. (2) High Accuracy: With a novel Spiking Jaccard Attention, SpGesture enhances the SNNs' ability to represent sEMG features, leading to a notable rise in system accuracy. To validate SpGesture's performance, we collected a new sEMG gesture dataset which has different forearm postures, where SpGesture achieved the highest accuracy among the baselines ($89.26\%$). Moreover, the actual deployment on the CPU demonstrated a system latency below 100ms, well within real-time requirements. This impressive performance showcases SpGesture's potential to enhance the applicability of sEMG in real-world scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/guoweiyu/SpGesture/.</description>

      <title>Multi-RIS-Empowered Multiple Access: A Distributed Sum-Rate Maximization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The plethora of wirelessly connected devices, whose deployment density is expected to largely increase in the upcoming sixth Generation (6G) of wireless networks, will naturally necessitate substantial advances in multiple access schemes. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) constitute a candidate 6G technology capable to offer dynamic over-the-air signal propagation programmability, which can be optimized for efficient non-orthogonal access of a multitude of devices. In this paper, we study the downlink of a wideband communication system comprising multiple multi-antenna Base Stations (BSs), each wishing to serve an associated single-antenna user via the assistance of a Beyond Diagonal (BD) and frequency-selective RIS. Under the assumption that each BS performs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions and exclusively controls a distinct RIS, we focus on the sum-rate maximization problem and present a distributed joint design of the linear precoders at the BSs as well as the tunable capacitances and the switch selection matrices at the multiple BD RISs. The formulated non-convex design optimization problem is solved via successive concave approximation necessitating minimal cooperation among the BSs. Our extensive simulation results showcase the performance superiority of the proposed cooperative scheme over non-cooperation benchmarks, indicating the performance gains with BD RISs via the presented optimized frequency selective operation for various scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: This work explores use of a few-shot transfer learning method to train and implement a convolutional spiking neural network (CSNN) on a BrainChip Akida AKD1000 neuromorphic system-on-chip for developing individual-level, instead of traditionally used group-level, models using electroencephalographic data. Main Results: Efficacy of the above methodology to develop individual-specific braking intention predictive models by rapidly adapting the group-level model in as few as three training epochs while achieving at least 90% accuracy, true positive rate and true negative rate is presented. Further, results show the energy-efficiency of the neuromorphic hardware through a power reduction of over 97% with only a $1.3* increase in latency when using the Akida AKD1000 processor for network inference compared to an Intel Xeon central processing unit. Similar results were obtained in a subsequent ablation study using a subset of five out of 19 channels.</description>
