      <title>Bethe-ansatz diagonalization of steady state of boundary driven integrable spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of integrable spin chains undergoing boundary dissipation, can be described in terms of quasiparticles, with renormalized -- dissipatively dressed -- dispersion relation. The spectrum of the NESS is then fully accounted for by Bethe ansatz equations for a related coherent system, described by a dissipation-projected Hamiltonian of the original system. We find explicit analytic expressions for the dressed energies of $XXX$ and $XXZ$ models with effective, i.e., induced by the dissipation, diagonal boundary fields, which are U(1) invariant, as well as XXZ and XYZ models with effective non-diagonal boundary fields. In all cases, the dissipative dressing generates an extra singularity in the dispersion relation, which strongly modifies the nonequilibrium steady state spectrum with respect to the spectrum of the corresponding coherent model. This leads, in particular, to a dissipation-assisted entropy reduction, due to the suppression in the NESS spectrum of plain wave-type Bethe states in favor of Bethe states localized at the boundaries.</description>

      <title>Dynamical response and time correlation functions in random quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent response and correlation functions are studied in random quantum systems composed of infinitely many parts without mutual interaction and defined with statistically independent random matrices. The latter are taken within the three Wigner-Dyson universality classes. In these systems, the response functions are shown to be exactly given by statistical averages over the random-matrix ensemble. Analytical results are obtained for the time dependence of the mean response and correlation functions at zero and positive temperatures. At long times, the mean correlation functions are shown to have a power-law decay for GOE at positive temperatures, but for GUE and GSE at zero temperature. Otherwise, the decay is much faster in time. In relation to these power-law decays, the associated spectral densities have a dip around zero frequency. The diagrammatic method is developed to obtain higher-order response functions and the third-order response function is explicitly calculated. The response to impulsive perturbations is also considered. In addition, the quantum fluctuations of the correlation function in individual members of the ensemble are characterised in terms of their probability distribution, which is shown to change with the temperature.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Brownian particles in asymmetric confinement: Insights into Entropic Stochastic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the effect of asymmetry in the thermodynamic response (work done) of an overdamped Brownian system driven by a time-periodic field when the particle is confined inside a bilobal irregular structure. The spatial irregularity of the asymmetric confinement results in an effective asymmetric entropic bistable potential along the direction of transport. We investigate how the frequency of the periodic field and the intensity of the noise impact the average work done, focusing on its potential as a key metric for examining Entropic Stochastic Resonance (ESR). The study highlights the impact of confinement asymmetry on reducing the average work done. Furthermore, we observe a transition of average work done from a state dominated by energy to one dominated by entropy, as we manipulate the magnitude of the transverse force. In addition, an alternative quantity called the mean free flight time ($T_{MFFT}$) is proposed to describe the ESR in the presence of asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Exact Statistics of Helical Wormlike Chains with Twist-Bend Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a solution for the Green's function for the general case of a helical wormlike chain with twist-bend coupling, and demonstrate the applicability of our solution for evaluating general structural and mechanical chain properties. We find that twist-bend coupling renormalizes the persistence length and the force-extension curves relative to worm-like chains. Analysis of intrinsically twisted polymers shows that incorporation of twist-bend coupling results in the oscillatory behavior in principal tangent correlations that are observed in some studies of synthetic polymers. The exact nature of our solution provides a framework to evaluate the role of twist-bend coupling on polymer properties and motivates the reinterpretation of existing bio-polymer experimental data.</description>

      <title>Block approximations for probabilistic mixtures of elementary cellular automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic Cellular Automata are a generalization of Cellular Automata. Despite their simple definition, they exhibit fascinating and complex behaviours. The stationary behaviour of these models changes when model parameters are varied, making the study of their phase diagrams particularly interesting. The block approximation method, also known in this context as the local structure approach, is a powerful tool for studying the main features of these diagrams, improving upon Mean Field results. This work considers systems with multiple stationary states, aiming to understand how their interactions give rise to the structure of the phase diagram. Additionally, it shows how a simple algorithmic implementation of the block approximation allows for the effective study of the phase diagram even in the presence of several absorbing states.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Theoretic Framework for Free-Parafermion Solvability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a quantum spin system has an exact free-parafermion solution if its frustration graph is an oriented indifference graph. Further, we show that if the frustration graph of a model can be dipath oriented via switching operations, then the model is integrable in the sense that there is a family of commuting independent set charges. Additionally, we establish an efficient algorithm for deciding whether this is possible. Our characterisation extends that given for free-fermion solvability. Finally, we apply our results to solve three qudit spin models.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral function and nonequilibrium dynamics of the strongly interacting Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytical results on the correlation functions of strongly correlated many-body systems are rare in the literature and their importance cannot be overstated. We present determinant representations for the space-, time-, and temperature-dependent correlation functions of the strongly interacting one-dimensional Hubbard model in the presence of an external trapping potential. These representations are exact and valid in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium scenarios like the ones initiated by a sudden change of the confinement potential. In addition, they can be implemented numerically very easily significantly outperforming other numerical approaches. As applications of our results we investigate the single particle spectral functions of systems with harmonic trapping and show that dynamical quasicondensation occurs for both fermionic and bosonic spin-$1/2$ systems released from a Mott insulator state.</description>

      <title>Space-time correlations in monitored kinetically constrained discrete-time quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art quantum simulators permit local temporal control of interactions and midcircuit readout. These capabilities open the way towards the exploration of intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena. We illustrate this with a kinetically constrained many-body quantum system that has a natural implementation on Rydberg quantum simulators. The evolution proceeds in discrete time and is generated by repeatedly entangling the system with an auxiliary environment that is monitored and reset after each time-step. Despite featuring an uncorrelated infinite-temperature average stationary state, the dynamics displays coexistence of fast and slow space-time regions in stochastic realizations of the system state. The time-record of measurement outcomes on the environment serves as natural probe for such dynamical heterogeneity, which we characterize using tools from large deviation theory. Our work establishes the large deviation framework for discrete-time open quantum many-body systems as a means to characterize complex dynamics and collective phenomena in quantum processors and simulators.</description>

      <title>Relaxing towards generalized one-body Boltzmann states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isolated quantum systems follow the reversible unitary evolution; if we focus on the dynamics of local states and observables, they exhibit the irreversible relaxation behaviors. Here we study the local relaxation process in an isolated chain consisting of \emph{N} three level systems. Though the entropy of the full many body state keeps a constant, it turns out the total correlation of this system approximately exhibits a monotonically increasing behavior. More importantly, a variation analysis shows that, the total correlation entropy would achieve its theoretical maximum when each site stays in a generalized one-body Boltzmann state, which is not solely determined by the energy but also depends on the spin value of each onsite level. It turns out such a theoretical correlation maximum is highly coincident with the result obtained from the exact time dependent evolution. In this sense, the total correlation entropy well serves as an indicator for the dynamical irreversibility of the nonequilibrium relaxation in this isolated system.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo and Stabilizer States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum-Monte-Carlo technique known as the Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) relies on a crucial no-branching condition: the SSE sampling is carried out in the computational basis, and the no-branching assumption ensures that superpositions of basis-states do not appear when operators are applied. Without this proviso, the number of complex amplitudes would grow exponentially with the number of qubits and would eventually overwhelm the memory and processing power of a classical computer. However, the action of Clifford group elements on stabilizer states can be very efficiently described without resorting to an amplitude description. We explore how stabilizer states allow an extension of the SSE technique, and we give an example of a toy model that can be studied in this way.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary order transfer matrix exceptional points and van Hove singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In lattice models with quadratic finite-range Hermitian Hamiltonians, the inherently non-Hermitian transfer matrix (TM) governs the band dispersion. The van Hove singularities (VHSs) are special points in the band dispersion where the density of states (DOS) diverge. Considering a lattice chain with hopping of a finite range $n$, we find a direct fundamental connection between VHSs and exceptional points (EPs) of TM, both of arbitrary order. In particular, we show that VHSs are EPs of TM of the same order, thereby connecting two different types of critical points usually studied in widely different branches of physics. Consequently, several properties of band dispersion and VHSs can be analyzed in terms of spectral properties of TM. We further provide a general prescription to generate any order EP of the TM and therefore corresponding VHS. For a given range of hopping $n$, our analysis provides restrictions on allowed orders of EPs of TM. Finally, we exemplify all our results for the case $n=3$.</description>

      <title>Uphill drift in the absence of current in single-file diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-file diffusion is a paradigmatic model for the transport of Brownian colloidal particles in narrow one-dimensional channels, such as those found in certain porous media, where the particles cannot cross each other. We consider a system where a different external uniform potential is present to the right and left of an origin. For example, this is the case when two channels meeting at the origin have different radii. In equilibrium, the chemical potential of the particles are equal, the density is thus lower in the region with the higher potential, and by definition there is no net current in the system. Remarkably, a single-file tracer particle initially located at the origin, with position denoted by $Y(t)$, exhibits an average up-hill drift toward the region of highest potential. This drift has the late time behavior $\langle Y(t)\rangle= C t^{1/4}$, where the prefactor $C$ depends on the initial particle arrangement. This surprising result is shown analytically by computing the first two moments of $Y(t)$ through a simple and physically-illuminating method, and also via extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation of a bilayer composed by amphipathic molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the properties of bilayer fluctuations using molecular dynamics. We modeled the amphipathic molecules as a diatomic molecule, constructed a bilayer in the solvent, and observed the Fourier spectrum of its fluctuations. The results showed that $q^4$ behavior was dominant at the high temperature, whereas a crossover from $q^4$ to $q^2$ was observed at the low temperature. This behavior is complementary to the results for monolayer membranes, where $q^2$ behavior was dominant when the interfacial tension was high, whereas a crossover from $q^2$ to $q^4$ was observed when the interfacial tension was lowered~[S. Kikuchi and H. Watanabe, J. Chem. Phys., $\bm{158}$ 12 (2023)]. These results suggest that the restoring force is dominated by elasticity at high temperatures and by interfacial tension at low temperatures. We also observed radial distribution functions to investigate the structure of amphipathic molecules in bilayers. The structure of the amphipathic molecules depends on temperature in the direction horizontal to the interface, while it does not depend on temperature in the direction perpendicular to the interface. This result suggests that bilayers increase fluctuations while maintaining the membrane structure in high temperature.</description>

Abstract: Compressed sensing is a signal processing scheme that reconstructs high-dimensional sparse signals from a limited number of observations. In recent years, various problems involving signals with a finite number of discrete values have been attracting attention in the field of compressed sensing. In particular, binary compressed sensing, which restricts signal elements to binary values $\{0, 1\}$, is the most fundamental and straightforward analysis subject in such problem settings. We evaluate the typical performance of noiseless binary compressed sensing based on $L_{1}$-norm minimization using the replica method, a statistical mechanical approach. We analyze a general setting where the elements of the observation matrix follow a Gaussian distribution, including a non-zero mean. We demonstrate that the biased observation matrix indicates more reconstruction success conditions in binary compressed sensing. Our results are consistent with the outcomes of several prior studies.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity in partial differential equations and critical phenomena: renormalization group theory for interfacial hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-similar dynamics, often described by partial differential equations (PDEs) without noise terms, have been widely observed in nature and have attracted considerable attention from researchers in various fields, including physics, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, and chemical engineering. The concept of universality class and the renormalization group (RG) theory, emerged from critical phenomena, which also have been widely observed in nature, are pillars of modern physics, with guiding the recent development of physics. While self-similarity appearing in fluid dynamics reminds physicists of critical phenomena, deep connections between them have not been explored. Here, we focus on a variation of a daily phenomenon, a drop falling from a faucet, and demonstrate self-similar dynamics for the shape of liquid-air interface in confined space with a scaling law for a characteristic length scale, which leads to a clear correspondence between the present self-similar dynamics and critical phenomena by identifying critical exponents, which define a universality class. We not only show that the observed master curve describing the self-similar shape is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equations, but also develop a renormalization group (RG) theory for the governing PDE to show the fixed point of RG corresponds to the solution, which becomes stable with time due to a scaling crossover. Our results will impact on our understanding of critical, scaling, and singular behaviors widely observed in nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The survival probability of an initial Coherent Gibbs State (CGS) is a natural extension of the Spectral Form Factor (SFF) to open quantum systems. To quantify the interplay between quantum chaos and decoherence away from the semi-classical limit, we investigate the relation of this generalized SFF with the corresponding $l_1$-norm of coherence. As a working example, we introduce Parametric Quantum Channels (PQC), a discrete-time model of unitary evolution mixed with the effects of measurements or transient interactions with an environment. The Energy Dephasing (ED) dynamics arises as a specific case in the Markovian limit. We demonstrate our results in a series of random matrix models.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear wave propagation in large extra spatial dimensions and the blackbody thermal laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear wave propagation in large extra spatial dimensions (on and above $d=2$) is investigated in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics theories that depend exclusively on the invariant $\mathcal{F}\left(=-(1/4)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}\right)$. In this vein, we consider propagating waves under the influence of external uniform electric and magnetic fields. Features related to the blackbody radiation in the presence of a background constant electric field such as the generalization of the spectral energy density distribution and the Stefan-Boltzmann law are obtained. Interestingly enough, anisotropic contributions to the frequency spectrum appear in connection to the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field. In addition, the long wavelength regime and Wien's displacement law in this situation are studied. The corresponding thermodynamics quantities at thermal equilibrium, such as energy, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity densities are contemplated as well.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transition in a single-body tight-binding model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of a single free quantum particle evolving coherently on a discrete lattice in ${\rm d}$ spatial dimensions where every lattice site is additionally subject to continuous measurement of the occupation number. Our numerical results indicate that the system undergoes a Measurement-induced Phase Transition (MiPT) for ${\rm d}&gt;1$ from a $\textit{delocalized}$ to a $\textit{localized}$ phase as the measurement strength $\gamma$ is increased beyond a critical value $\gamma_{c}$. In the language of surface growth, the delocalized phase corresponds to a $\textit{smooth}$ phase while the localized phase corresponds to a $\textit{rough}$ phase. We support our numerical results with perturbative renormalization group (RG) computations which are in qualitative agreement at one-loop order.</description>

      <title>Worldsheet patching, 1-form symmetries, and "Landau-star" phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of phase transitions of gauge theories has relied heavily on simplifications that arise at the boundaries of phase diagrams, where certain excitations are forbidden. Taking 2+1 dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory as an example, the simplification can be visualized geometrically: on the phase diagram boundaries the partition function is an ensemble of closed membranes. More generally, however, the membranes have "holes" in them, representing worldlines of virtual anyon excitations. If the holes are of a finite size, then typically they do not affect the universality class, but they destroy microscopic (higher-form) symmetries and microscopic (string) observables. We demonstrate how these symmetries and observables can be restored using a "membrane patching" procedure, which maps the ensemble of membranes back to an ensemble of closed membranes. (This is closely related to the idea of gauge fixing in the "minimal gauge", though not equivalent.) Membrane patching makes the emergence of higher symmetry concrete. Performing patching in a Monte Carlo simulation with an appropriate algorithm, we show that it gives access to numerically useful observables. For example, the confinement transition can be analyzed using a correlation function that is a power law at the critical point. We analyze the quasi-locality of the patching procedure and discuss what happens at a self-dual multicritical point in the gauge-Higgs model, where the lengthscale $\ell$ characterizing the holes diverges.</description>

      <title>$(\omega_1, \omega_2)$-temporal random hyperbolic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend a recent model of temporal random hyperbolic graphs by allowing connections and disconnections to persist across network snapshots with different probabilities, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. This extension, while conceptually simple, poses analytical challenges involving the Appell $F_1$ series. Despite these challenges, we are able to analyze key properties of the model, which include the distributions of contact and intercontact durations, as well as the expected time-aggregated degree. The incorporation of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ enables more flexible tuning of the average contact and intercontact durations, and of the average time-aggregated degree, providing a finer control for exploring the effect of temporal network dynamics on dynamical processes. Overall, our results provide new insights into the analysis of temporal networks and contribute to a more general representation of real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional shape and connectivity of physical networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data describing the three-dimensional structure of physical networks is increasingly available, leading to a surge of interest in network science to explore the relationship between the shape and connectivity of physical networks. We contribute to this effort by standardizing and analyzing 15 data sets from different domains. Each network is made of tube-like objects bound together at junction points, which we treat as nodes, with the connections between them considered as links. We divide these networks into three categories: lattice-like networks, trees, and linked trees. The degree distribution of these physical networks is bounded, with most nodes having degrees one or three. Characterizing the physical properties of links, we show that links have an elongated shape and tend to follow a nearly straight trajectory, while a small fraction of links follow a winding path. These typical node and link properties must be reflected by physical network models. We also measure how confined a link is in space by comparing its trajectory to a randomized null model, showing that links that are central in the abstract network tend to be physically confined by their neighbors. The fact that the shape and connectivity of the physical networks are intertwined highlights that their three-dimensional layout must be taken into account to understand the evolution and function of physical networks.</description>

      <title>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a COP with an underlying Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph exhibits the Overlap Gap Property (OGP), then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. Given that Max-$q$-XORSAT on an Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph is known to exhibit the OGP, and since the performance of QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model matches asymptotically for Max-$q$-XORSAT on large-girth regular hypergraph, we show that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely. This suggests that a necessary condition for the validity of limit swapping in QAOA is the absence of OGP in a given combinatorial optimization problem. Furthermore, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.</description>

      <title>Studying the 3d Ising surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15914v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundaries not only are fundamental elements in nearly all realistic physical systems, but also greatly enrich the structure of quantum field theories. In this paper, we demonstrate that conformal field theory (CFT) with a boundary, known as surface CFT in three dimensions, can be studied with the setup of fuzzy sphere. We consider the example of surface criticality of the 3D Ising CFT. We propose two schemes by cutting a boundary in the orbital space or the real space to realise the ordinary and the normal surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere. We obtain the operator spectra through state-operator correspondence. We observe integer spacing of the conformal multiplets, and thus provide direct evidence of conformal symmetry. We identify the ordinary surface primary $o$, the displacement operator $\mathrm{D}$ and their conformal descendants and extract their scaling dimensions. We also study the one-point and two-point correlation functions and extract the bulk-to-surface OPE coefficients, some of which are reported for the first time. In addition, using the overlap of the bulk CFT state and the polarised state, we calculate the boundary central charges of the 3D Ising surface CFTs non-perturbatively. Other conformal data obtained in this way also agrees with prior methods.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved Stochastic Dynamics of Quantum Thermal Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steady-state quantum thermal machines are typically characterized by a continuous flow of heat between different reservoirs. However, at the level of discrete stochastic realizations, heat flow is unraveled as a series of abrupt quantum jumps, each representing an exchange of finite quanta with the environment. In this work, we present a framework that resolves the dynamics of quantum thermal machines into cycles that are classified as engine-like, cooling-like, or idle. We explore the statistics of each cycle type and its duration, enabling us to determine both the fraction of cycles useful for thermodynamic tasks and the average waiting time between cycles of the same type. Our framework presents a novel approach in characterizing thermal machines, with significant relevance to modern experiments such as mesoscopic transport using quantum dots.</description>
