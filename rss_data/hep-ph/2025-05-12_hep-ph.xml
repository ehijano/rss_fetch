      <title>Unbinned inclusive cross-section measurements with machine-learned systematic uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel methodology for addressing systematic uncertainties in unbinned inclusive cross-section measurements and related collider-based inference problems. Our approach incorporates known analytic dependencies on parameters of interest, including signal strengths and nuisance parameters. When these dependencies are unknown, as is frequently the case for systematic uncertainties, dedicated neural network parametrizations provide an approximation that is trained on simulated data. The resulting machine-learned surrogate captures the complete parameter dependence of the likelihood ratio, providing a near-optimal test statistic. As a case study, we perform a first-principles inclusive cross-section measurement of $\textrm{H}\rightarrow\tau\tau$ in the single-lepton channel, utilizing simulated data from the FAIR Universe Higgs Uncertainty Challenge. Results in Asimov data, from large-scale toy studies, and using the Fisher information demonstrate significant improvements over traditional binned methods. Our computer code ``Guaranteed Optimal Log-Likelihood-based Unbinned Method'' (GOLLUM) for machine-learning and inference is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Correlating the $B$ anomalies to $K\to \pi\nu\bar\nu$ and $B\to K\nu\bar\nu$ via leptoquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leptoquark models are prime candidates for new physics (NP) explanations of the long-standing anomalies in semi-leptonic $B$ decays; $b\to c \tau \bar\nu$ (encoded in $R(D^{(\ast)})$) and $b\to s\ell\bar\ell (\ell=e,\mu)$ transitions. Furthermore, Belle II and NA62 reported weaker-than-expected limits on $B^+ \to K^+ \nu\bar\nu$ and $K^+ \to \pi^+ \nu \bar\nu$, respectively. While the $R(D^{(\ast)})$ and $b\to s\ell \bar\ell$ measurements can be explained with NP contributions at the $O(10\%)$ level, the neutrino channels suggest that the NP effect could be comparable in size to the Standard Model one. In this context, we consider the two types of leptoquark models with minimal sets of the couplings that can best describe the semi-leptonic $B$ anomalies and lead at the same time to effects in the neutrino modes, the singlet-triplet scalar leptoquark model ($S_1+S_3$) and the singlet vector leptoquark model ($U_1$). More specifically, the neutrino channels pose non-trivial constraints on the parameter space, and we find that large effects (i.e., accounting for the current central value) in $B\to K^{(*)}\nu\bar\nu$ are only possible in the $S_1+S_3$ setup, while both models can account for the central value of $K^+\to \pi^+\nu\bar\nu$.</description>

      <title>A Fresh Look at the Diffuse ALP Background from Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proto-neutron stars, highly compact objects formed in the core of exploding supernovae (SNe), are powerful sources of axion-like particles (ALPs). In the SN core, ALPs are dominantly produced via nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung and pion conversion, resulting in an energetic ALP spectrum peaked at energies $\mathcal{O}(100)\,\rm MeV$. In this work, we revisit the diffuse ALP background, produced from all past core-collapse supernovae, and update the constraints derived from Fermi-LAT observations. Assuming the maximum ALP-nucleon coupling allowed by the SN 1987A cooling, we set the upper limit $g_{a \gamma \gamma} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-13}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$ for ALP mass $m_a\lesssim 10^{-10}\,\rm eV$, which is approximately a factor of two improvement with respect to the existing bounds. On the other hand, for $m_a \gtrsim 10^{-10}\,\rm eV$, we find that including pion conversion strengthens the bound on $g_{a\gamma \gamma}$, approximately by a factor of two compared to the constraint obtained from bremsstrahlung alone. Additionally, we present a sensitivity study for future experiments such as AMEGO-X, e-ASTROGAM, GRAMS-balloon, GRAMS-satellite, and MAST. We find that the expected constraint from MAST would be comparable to Fermi-LAT bound. However, SN 1987A constraint remains one order of magnitude stronger as compared to the bound derived from the current and future gamma-ray telescopes.</description>

      <title>The Electroweak Sphaleron Revisited: I. Static Solutions, Energy Barrier, and Unstable Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electroweak sphaleron is a static, unstable solution of the Standard Model classical field equations, representing the energy barrier between topologically distinct vacua. In this work, we present a comprehensive updated analysis of the sphaleron using current Standard Model parameters with the physical Higgs boson mass of $m_H = 125.1$ GeV and $m_W = 80.4$ GeV, rather than the $m_H = m_W$ approximation common in earlier studies. The study includes: (i) a complete derivation of the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ electroweak Lagrangian and field equations without gauge fixing constraints, (ii) high-precision numerical solutions for the static sphaleron configuration yielding a sphaleron energy $E_{\rm{sph}} \simeq 9.1$ TeV, (iii) an analysis of the minimum energy path in field space connecting the sphaleron to the vacuum (a 1D potential barrier as a function of Chern-Simons number), and (iv) calculation of the sphaleron single unstable mode with negative eigenvalue $\omega^2_{-} = -2.7m^2_W$, providing analytical fits for its eigenfunction. We find that using the measured Higgs mass modifies the unstable mode frequency, with important implications for baryon number violation rates in both early universe cosmology and potential high-energy collider signatures. These results provide essential input for accurate lattice simulations of sphaleron transitions and precision calculations of baryon number violation processes.</description>

      <title>The Electroweak Sphaleron Revisited: II. Study of Decay Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of electroweak sphaleron decay dynamics, employing both analytical techniques and high-resolution numerical simulations. Using a spherically symmetric ansatz, we reformulate the system as a $(1+1)$-dimensional problem and analyze its stability properties with current Standard Model parameters ($m_H = 125.1$ GeV, $m_W = 80.4$ GeV). We identify precisely one unstable mode with eigenvalue $\omega_{-}^2 \simeq -2.7m_W^2$ and numerically evolve the full non-linear field equations under various initial conditions. Through spectral decomposition, we quantify the particle production resulting from the sphaleron decay. Our results demonstrate that the decay process is dominated by transverse gauge bosons, which constitute approximately 80% of the total energy and multiplicity, while Higgs bosons account for only 7-8%. On average, the sphaleron decays into 49 $W$ bosons and 4 Higgs bosons. The particle spectra consistently peak at momenta $k \sim 1 - 1.5 \, m_W$, reflecting the characteristic size of the sphaleron. Remarkably, these properties remain robust across different decay scenarios, suggesting that the fundamental structure of the sphaleron, rather than specific triggering mechanisms, determines the decay outcomes. These findings provide distinctive experimental signatures of non-perturbative topological transitions in the electroweak theory, with significant implications for baryon number violation in the early universe and potentially for high-energy collider physics.</description>

      <title>A Physics Model for Origin of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we attempt to convince the reader that the origin of life was such an exceptionally unlikely event that it probably has never occurred elsewhere. This involves an explicit calculation using the laws of physics which, while speculative, may encapsulate the essential science without knowledge of biological details. Making only physics, and no biology, assumptions about the origin of the first single celled organism (SCO) on Earth, we adopt methods of quantum tunnelling to make an estimate of the probability ${\cal P}_{SCO}$ for the origin of life. We argue that before the time $t_{SCO}$ laws of physics must suffice and assume a first-order phase transition which nucleates at the first SCO production. In the classical limit where Planck's constant vanishes $h\rightarrow0$, ${\cal P}_{SCO}$ also vanishes and remains extremely small for the correct value of $h$. Thus quantum mechanics plays a central role in permitting life to form. We compare the resultant probability with the expected number of exoplanets in the Milky Way ($\sim10^{12}$) and the Visible Universe ($\sim10^{24}$) and conclude that the probability of extraterrestrial life in the Visible Universe is infinitesimal. This result suggests that the visible universe is a lonely place for humankind because extraterrestrial life will never be encountered.</description>

      <title>From oversimplified to overlooked: the case for exploring Rich Dark Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics provides a very successful description of fundamental particles and their interactions but it is incomplete, as neutrino masses, dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe indicate. In addition, the origin of masses and of the approximate fundamental symmetries call out for deeper explanations. The quest for a New SM Theory, that extends the SM to a more general theory, is ongoing. For decades the main focus has been on the TeV scale, but despite an impressive theoretical and experimental effort, no hints of new physics at such scale has been found in experiments.
  Dark sectors provide an interesting alternative to TeV scale extensions of the SM to explain the open questions in particle and astroparticle physics. Going beyond minimal models, rich dark sectors extend the SM to a complex theory with multiple particles and interactions, in analogy to the SM itself. They have a wealth of theoretical and astrophysical/cosmological consequences and can lead to phenomenological signatures that can be markedly different to that of minimal ones. These include short-lived particles and semi-visible decay signatures, as opposed to minimal models where new states are typically long-lived and purely visible or invisible resonances. Given the experimental configurations and analysis strategies, current dark sector searches might miss such signatures. We advocate a dedicated programme of searches for rich dark sectors that overcomes the assumptions on minimality and on the long lifetime of particles and encompasses a broader range of possibilities. Here, we discuss a prototype model that includes a complex structure akin to the SM: multiple generations of fermions charged under a new spontaneously-broken gauge symmetry.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Training and Representation Bridging in Reconstruction Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing low-dimensional truth labels from high-dimensional experimental data is a central challenge in any scenario that relies on robust mappings across this so-called domain gap, from multi-particle final states in high-energy physics to large-scale early-universe structure in cosmological surveys. We introduce a new method to bridge this domain gap with an intermediate, synthetic representation of truth that differs from methods operating purely in latent space, such as normalizing flows or invertible approaches, in that the synthetic data is specifically engineered to represent intrinsic detector hardware capabilities of the system at hand. The hypothesis is that by encoding physical properties of the detector response available only in full simulation, such synthetic representations result in a less lossy compression and recovery than a direct mapping from truth to experimental data. We demonstrate a first implementation of this concept with full simulation of a dual-readout crystal electromagnetic calorimeter for future collider detectors, in which the synthetic data is constructed to be the simulated detector hits corresponding to photon tracks of scintillation and Cerenkov photons. We refer to these signals as simulated observables as they would not be physical observables in a real detector, but are nonetheless representations of a real physical process. First results show that the synthetic representation naturally anchors the neural network architecture to a known physical method, in this case the dual-readout correction. We believe this strategy opens new avenues for machinistic interpretability and explainability of ML-based reconstruction methods. In the case of anomalous signal detection, we hypothesize that anomalous signals detected in networks trained on synthetic data rooted in a physical process are more likely to be indicative of a genuinely physical anomaly.</description>

      <title>Vacuum pair production under spatially asymmetric time-oscillating electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate electron-positron pair production from the quantum vacuum in spatially asymmetric, time-oscillating electric fields using the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) formalism. The field configuration combines spatially separated Sauter-type pulses with temporal oscillations, including frequency chirps and phase modulation. Our results demonstrate that spatial asymmetry significantly enhances pair production compared to symmetric fields, while optimal tuning of temporal parameters (e.g., frequency $\omega$ and chirp $b$) further amplifies the yield. For $\omega \gtrsim 0.4m$, multiphoton-dominated processes generate oscillatory momentum spectra, whereas low-frequency fields ($\omega \lesssim 0.3m$) exhibit tunneling-dominated Gaussian distributions. Chirped fields induce spectral asymmetry and interference patterns, with peak yields increasing by up to a factor of 9 for $\omega = 0.7m$ and $b = 0.5\omega/\tau$. These findings provide a pathway to optimize pair production in experimentally feasible spatiotemporal field configurations.</description>

Taking the low-energy constants from a combined analysis of elastic and inelastic pion-nucleon scattering, we find that these corrections are rather moderate.</description>

      <title>The light meson decays of $D$ wave charmonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the large non-$D\bar{D}$ branching fraction of $\psi(3770)$, we investigate the light meson decays of the $D$-wave charmonia in the present work with the meson loop mechanism. With the parameter range determined by $\psi (3770) \to \phi \eta$, our estimations of the branching fractions of the light meson decays of $\psi(3770)$ are consistent with the estimations in the literature. As for $\psi(3823)$, the partial widths of $K^\ast \bar{K}^\ast$ channel is estimated to be around 200 keV, which is the the predominant light meson decay channel of $\psi(3823)$. Our estimations also indicate that $K^{(\ast)}\bar{K}^{(\ast)}$ and $\rho \pi$ are the dominant light meson decay modes of $\psi(3842)$, while $\eta_{c2}$ dominantly decays into $\rho\rho$, $K^\ast \bar{K}^\ast$, $\omega \omega$ and $\phi\phi$.</description>

      <title>Beam single spin asymmetry $A_{LU}^{\sin \phi_R}$ of the dihadron production in SIDIS process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the longitudinal beam single-spin asymmetry $A_{LU}^{\sin \phi_R}$ of dihadron production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering process with a polarized electron beam scattering off an unpolarized proton target. The asymmetry arises from the convolutions of twist-3 PDF $e(x)$ and twist-2 DiFF $H_1^\sphericalangle$ as well as twist-2 PDF $f_1(x)$ and twist-3 DiFF $\widetilde{G}^{\sphericalangle}$. Using the spectator model calculations for the twist-3 PDF $e(x)$, the DiFFs $D_1 , H_1^\sphericalangle$, and $\widetilde{G}^{\sphericalangle}$, we estimate the BSA $A^{\sin \phi_R}_{LU}$ at the kinematical configuration of CLAS and CLAS12. We find good agreement with $z$- and $M_h$-dependencies data, though $x$- and $Q^2$- dependencies show discrepancies. We include DGLAP evolution of $e(x)$ and provide predictions for COMPASS, EIC, and EicC. The negligible contribution from $f_1(x) \otimes \widetilde{G}^{\sphericalangle}$ supports the Wandzura-Wilczek approximation, while our results highlight the importance of QCD evolution in twist-3 PDF analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the quark model and the variational method, the bound states of four heavy quarks (tetraquarks) are investigated. The basis variational wave functions are chosen in the Gaussian form. The matrix elements of the Hamiltonian are calculated analytically. Numerical calculation of the energy levels of tetraquarks is performed using a program in the Matlab system. Hyperfine structure of the spectrum is calculated. To increase the accuracy of the calculation, relativistic corrections are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Scattering Entanglement Entropy and Its Implications for Electroweak Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between the entanglement entropy in scattering processes and the dynamics of electroweak phase transitions. Recent work has shown that the scattering entanglement entropy can provide new insight into Standard Model parameters. In this study, we propose that the maximum of the entanglement entropy in scattering amplitudes may serve as a diagnostic for first-order electroweak phase transitions in the early universe. We analyze a simplified extension of the Standard Model consisting of the Higgs boson $h$ coupled to $O(N)$ real singlet scalars $S$ via the Higgs portal coupling $\lambda_{hS}$. By explicitly calculating the maximum entanglement entropy, we demonstrate that it grows with increasing $\lambda_{hS}$, and that both first-order and strong first-order electroweak phase transitions are favored in regions of parameter space with large maximum entropy. Our results suggest that entanglement-based observables may encode meaningful information about the underlying dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking and provide a novel perspective on phase transition phenomena.</description>

      <title>pNGB Higgs Naturalness at a Tipping Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scenarios where the Higgs is viewed as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) the question of naturalness finds itself, from a phenomenological perspective, at a tipping point between direct searches and precision. If, by the end of the High-Luminosity LHC operation, all experimental results were to remain consistent with the Standard Model, precision Higgs coupling measurements will begin to drive the naturalness tension. To illustrate this from a fresh perspective we construct a maximally natural `Kitchen Sink' model, throwing into the mix three approaches to symmetry-based naturalness: Supersymmetry, Twin Higgs, and pNGB Higgs models with a Gegenbauer potential. In other words, we build a `Supersymmetric Gegenbauer's Twin' model. This model not only maximises naturalness, at least from a technical perspective, but can also interpolate between all three ingredients smoothly, revealing the interplay between direct exploration and precision. Implications for FCC-ee and FCC-hh are discussed.</description>

      <title>How to tame penguins: Advancing to high-precision measurements of $\phi_d$ and $\phi_s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex phases $\phi_d$ and $\phi_s$, associated with the mixing between neutral $B_q^0$ and $\bar B_q^0$ mesons ($q\in\{d,s\}$), are key observables to test the Standard Model and search for contributions from new physics. They are conventionally determined from the measurements of mixing-induced CP violation in the decays $B_d^0\to J/\psi K^0$, $B_s^0\to J/\psi\phi$ and $B_s^0\to D_s^+D_s^-$. To reach the highest possible precision on $\phi_d$ and $\phi_s$, it is crucial that corrections from next-to-leading order effects - primarily associated with penguin decay topologies - are accounted for. The strategy adopted in this paper uses the $SU(3)$ flavour symmetry of QCD to relate the unknown contributions from penguin topologies to their counterparts in suitably-chosen control modes, where their effects are enhanced. Utilising new CP asymmetry measurements from LHCb on the decays $B_s^0\to D_s^+D_s^-$, $B_d^0\to D^+D^-$, $B^+\to J/\psi K^+$ and $B^+\to J/\psi\pi^+$, as well as from Belle-II on the decay $B_d^0\to J/\psi\pi^0$, we present the current state-of-the-art picture on controlling the penguin contributions and extract $\phi_d$ and $\phi_s$ from the corresponding observables. We explore the prospects for the end of the Belle-II and HL-LHC flavour physics programmes, and demonstrate the importance of measuring the control modes with future data.</description>

      <title>Chiral interactions, chiral states and "chiral neutrino oscillations"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In vacuum the ``chiral neutrino oscillations'', i.e. the periodic transitions between the left- and right-handed states do not occur. The produced state differs from the chiral component that appear in the Lagrangian of interactions and should be computed for each specific process. The phase difference between components of a produced neutrino is space-time independent. This neutrino state consists of only positive energy solutions of the Dirac equation and therefore the energy splitting $2E_\nu$ between the components with different helicities that would drive the chiral oscillations does not exist. Consideration in terms of neutrino propagators leads to the same conclusion. The situation is similar for the Majorana neutrinos and in the presence of flavor mixing. However, oscillations of the neutrino states produced in the chiral interactions are possible in matter with the length determined by the matter potential. Description of oscillations in terms of amplitudes of production and detection is elaborated that does not lead to any misconception. In the expanding Universe the relic neutrinos adiabatically convert to equal number densities of the left and right handed components.</description>

      <title>Constraints to Lorentz violation and ultrahigh-energy electrons in D-foamy space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We entertain the constraints that the absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation of ultrahigh-energy electrons inferred from LHAASO observations of the Crab Nebula can impose on generic models in which Lorentz symmetry of the particle vacuum is violated, as established by some recent studies in \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137034}{\emph{Phys. Lett. B} {\bf 829} (2022) 137034}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137536}{{\bf 835} (2022) 137536}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.063006}{\emph{Phys. Rev. D} {\bf108} (2023) 063006}. We demonstrate in the present paper, that implementing a phenomenological approach to the Lorentz violation, the rates of this vacuum process are substantial such that one is justified in deriving bounds on the violation scales from simple threshold analysis just as these works did. Albeit such results are likely effective then, they do not apply in the same form among scenarios. Specifically, we show that these Cherenkov constraints are naturally evaded in models of space-time foam inspired from~(supercritical) string theory, involving D-branes as space-time defects in a brane-world scenario, in which subluminous energy-dependent refractive indices of light have been suggested. We examine here two specific foam situations and find for both cases~(though, for different reasons) the potentiality that charged quanta such as electrons do \emph{not} radiate as they pass through the gravitational vacuum `medium' despite moving faster than photons.</description>

      <title>Mechanical form factors and densities of non-relativistic fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hadron physics community has been actively debating the interpretation of so-called mechanical properties of hadrons. Non-relativistic quantum-mechanical systems like the hydrogen atom have been appealed to in these debates as analogies. Since such appeals are likely to continue, it is important to have Galilei-covariant expressions for matrix elements of the energy-momentum tensor. In this work, I obtain Galilei-covariant breakdowns of such matrix elements into mechanical form factors, with a special focus on spin-half states. I additionally study the spatial densities associated with these form factors, using the pilot wave interpretation to guide their breakdown into contributions from internal structure and from quantum-mechanical effects such as wave packet dispersion. For completeness, I also obtain non-relativistic Breit frame densities.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the connection of baryon number, lepton number, and operator dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of heavy new particles beyond the Standard Model can be conveniently captured through higher-dimensional effective operators. As noted long ago by Weinberg, the amount of baryon and lepton number an operator can carry is intricately connected to its mass dimension. We derive an improved inequality for this connection and compare it to explicit operator constructions up to mass dimension 25. For the effective field theory of Standard Model plus right-handed neutrinos, our relationship is even an equality up to high mass dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of large curvature perturbations associated with the production of primordial black holes is studied in the context of a Higgs inflaton. To enable this amplification, we consider an inflationary model in which the tree-level action for gravity and the Standard Model Higgs is modified by quantum corrections, described by a series of higher-dimension operators. Finally within a minimal EFT framework, we present two viable models in which the spectrum of curvature perturbations generated by the Higgs field is consistent with CMB observations and can lead to the formation of primordial black holes in the asteroid mass range, potentially accounting for the entirety of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Axion optical induction of antiferromagnetic order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using circularly-polarized light to control quantum matter is a highly intriguing topic in physics, chemistry and biology. Previous studies have demonstrated helicity-dependent optical control of spatial chirality and magnetization $M$. The former is central for asymmetric synthesis in chemistry and homochirality in bio-molecules, while the latter is of great interest for ferromagnetic spintronics. In this paper, we report the surprising observation of helicity-dependent optical control of fully-compensated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in 2D even-layered MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, a topological Axion insulator with neither chirality nor $M$. We further demonstrate helicity-dependent optical creation of AFM domain walls by double induction beams and the direct reversal of AFM domains by ultrafast pulses. The control and reversal of AFM domains and domain walls by light helicity have never been achieved in any fully-compensated AFM. To understand this optical control, we study a novel type of circular dichroism (CD) proportional to the AFM order, which only appears in reflection but is absent in transmission. We show that the optical control and CD both arise from the optical Axion electrodynamics, which can be visualized as a Berry curvature real space dipole. Our Axion induction provides the possibility to optically control a family of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric AFMs such as Cr$_2$O$_3$, CrI$_3$ and possibly novel states in cuprates. In MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, this further opens the door for optical writing of dissipationless circuit formed by topological edge states.</description>

      <title>Di-nucleons do not form bound states at heavy pion mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a high-statistics lattice QCD calculation of the low-energy two-nucleon scattering amplitudes. In order to address discrepancies in the literature, the calculation is performed at a heavy pion mass in the limit that the light quark masses are equal to the physical strange quark mass, $m_\pi = m_K \simeq 714 $ MeV. Using a state-of-the-art momentum space method, we rule out the presence of a bound di-nucleon in both the isospin 0 (deuteron) and 1 (di-neutron) channels, in contrast with many previous results that made use of compact hexaquark creation operators. In order to diagnose the discrepancy, we add such hexaquark interpolating operators to our basis and find that they do not affect the determination of the two-nucleon finite volume spectrum, and thus they do not couple to deeply bound di-nucleons that are missed by the momentum-space operators. Further, we perform a high-statistics calculation of the HAL QCD potential on the same gauge ensembles and find qualitative agreement with our main results. We conclude that two-nucleons do not form bound states at heavy pion masses and that previous identification of deeply bound di-nucleons must have arisen from a misidentification of the spectrum from off-diagonal elements of a correlation function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance, unitarity, and causality enforce powerful constraints on the theory space of physical scattering amplitudes. However, virtually all efforts in this direction have centered on the very simplest case of four-point scattering. In this work, we derive an infinite web of "multipositivity bounds" that nonlinearly constrain all tree-level higher-point scattering amplitudes under similarly minimal assumptions. Our construction rules out several deformations of the string and implies mixed-multiplicity bounds on the Wilson coefficients of planar effective field theories. Curiously, an infinite class of multipositivity bounds is exactly saturated by the amplitudes of the open string.</description>

      <title>Measurement of medium-induced acoplanarity in central Au-Au and pp collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV using direct-photon+jet and $\pi^{0}$+jet correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The STAR Collaboration reports measurements of acoplanarity using semi-inclusive distributions of charged-particle jets recoiling from direct photon and $\pi^{0}$ triggers, in central Au-Au and pp collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV. Significant medium-induced acoplanarity broadening is observed for large but not small recoil jet resolution parameter, corresponding to recoil jet yield enhancement up to a factor of $\approx20$ for trigger-recoil azimuthal separation far from $\pi$. This phenomenology is indicative of the response of the Quark-Gluon Plasma to excitation, but not the scattering of jets off of its quasiparticles. The measurements are not well-described by current theoretical models which incorporate jet quenching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark Stars, i.e. early stars composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium but powered by Dark Matter, could form in zero metallicity clouds located close to the center of high redshift Dark Matter halos. In 2023 three of us identified (in a PNAS work) the first three photometric Dark Star candidates: JADES-GS-z11-0, JADES-GS-z12-0, and JADES-GS-z13-0. We report here our results of a followup analysis based on available NIRSpec JWST data. We find that JADES-GS-z11-0 and JADES-GS-z-13-0 are spectroscopically consistent with a Dark Star interpretation. Moreover, we find two additional spectroscopic Dark Star candidates: JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z-14-1, with the former being the most distant luminous object ever observed. We furthermore identify a feature in its spectrum indicative of the smoking gun signature of Dark Stars: the He II$\lambda$1640 absorption line. In view ALMA's recent identification of a probable OIII nebular emission line in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, the simple interpretation of this object as an isolated Dark Star is unlikely. If both spectral features survive follow-up observations it would imply a Dark Star embedded in a metal rich environment, requiring theoretical refinements of the formation of evolution of Dark Stars, which in previous studies were assumed to form in isolation, without any companions.</description>

      <title>Revealing the nature of ultra-long period objects with space-based gravitational-wave interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A few members of the recently-discovered class of ultra-long period objects have been identified as binaries with white-dwarf primaries. In most cases however, electromagnetic data are inconclusive and isolated magnetars remain a viable candidate. If the pulsation period matches that of the orbit though -- as is the case for ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37 -- several of these elusive radio transients should be gravitational-wave bright in the mHz band. Space-based interferometers could thus be used to provide independent constraints on their nature. We quantify the signal-to-noise ratio for the known systems, assuming they are compact binaries, and show that a few should be detectable with only a few months of data folding. Astrophysical implications for (non-)detections are discussed.</description>

      <title>Magnetar field dynamics shaped by chiral anomalies and helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME), a macroscopic manifestation of the quantum chiral anomaly, induces currents along magnetic field lines, facilitating mutual conversion between chiral asymmetry and magnetic helicity. Although the finite electron mass suppresses chiral asymmetry through spin-flip processes, we demonstrate that the CME remains effective and plays a significant role in the magnetic field evolution of magnetars. The magnetic helicity acts as a persistent internal source of chiral asymmetry, which mediates the redistribution of magnetic energy across spatial scales, without requiring an external energy source. Focusing on the neutron star crust, we show that this mechanism reshapes the magnetic field configuration inherited at birth and, within a hundred years, amplifies both toroidal and poloidal large-scale dipolar components (relevant for spin-down) up to $10^{14}$ G at the expense of small-scale structures. Our results offer a microphysical mechanism, alternative to traditional hydrodynamic dynamo models, establishing a new framework for understanding magnetar field dynamics.</description>

      <title>Confirmation of the existence of an exotic state in the $\pi D$ system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.15391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years many candidates for states beyond the most simple realization of the quark model were found in various experiments around the world. However, so far no consensus exists on their structure, although there is strong evidence that at least some of those are dynamically generated from meson-meson interactions. In this Letter we provide an important missing piece from the theoretical side to prove that the lightest open charm strange and non-strange scalars $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_0^*$ as well as their axial-vector partner states can all be understood as emerging from the interactions between Goldstone bosons stemming from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and the ground state charmed mesons. For that purpose we exploit the flavor multiplet structure of the lightest open-charm positive-parity scalar states in an SU(3) symmetric lattice QCD simulation at large pion masses to establish that there exists a bound state in the flavor-sextet representation, which cannot emerge for quark-antiquark states but appears naturally for four-quark configurations. Moreover, we find repulsion in the $[15]$ representation and thus no single-particle state in this representation exists, falsifying the expectation for tetraquark models. The findings establish the pattern predicted for the interactions of Goldstone bosons with $D$ mesons from chiral symmetry and the paradigm of the lowest-lying positive-parity charmed mesons as dynamically generated states.</description>

Abstract: The recent detection of gravitational waves from a binary merger involving a potential low-mass gap black hole (LMBH) by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration motivates investigations into mechanisms beyond conventional stellar evolution theories to account for their existence. We study a mechanism in which dark matter (DM), through its capture and accumulation inside main sequence stars, induces the formation of black holes within the mass range of $[3, 5]M_\odot$. We examine the distribution of these LMBHs as a function of galaxy halo mass, particularly when paired with neutron stars. This gives a distinct signature that can be tested with future gravitational wave observations. We find that a viable portion of the DM parameter space predicts a merger rate of such binaries consistent with LVK observations.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the proton$\text{-}$box contribution to the hadronic light$\text{-}$by$\text{-}$light part of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, which is the first reported baryonic contribution to this piece. We follow the quark$\text{-}$loop analysis, incorporating the relevant data$\text{-}$driven and lattice proton form factors. Although the heavy mass expansion would yield a contribution of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-10})$, the damping of the form factors in the regions where the kernel peaks, explains our finding $a_{\mu}^{\rm{p-box}}=1.82 (7)\times 10^{-12}$, two orders of magnitude smaller than the forthcoming uncertainty on the $a_{\mu}$ measurement and on its Standard Model prediction.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Neutrino-Nucleus Cross Sections</title>

Abstract: Neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections are critical theoretical inputs for long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. However, robust modeling of these cross sections remains challenging. For a simple but physically motivated toy model of the DUNE experiment, we demonstrate that an accurate neural-network model of the cross section -- leveraging Standard Model symmetries -- can be learned from near-detector data. We then perform a neutrino oscillation analysis with simulated far-detector events, finding that the modeled cross section achieves results consistent with what could be obtained if the true cross section were known exactly. This proof-of-principle study highlights the potential of future neutrino near-detector datasets and data-driven cross-section models.</description>

      <title>Very Special Relativity in Accelerated Frames: Non-relativistic Effects in Gravitational Spectroscopy of Ultracold Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phenomenology of fermionic systems in uniform gravitational fields within the framework of Very Special Relativity (VSR). We focus on the case of gravitational spectroscopy with ultracold neutrons, explored in experiments like \emph{q}\textsc{Bounce}. Calculating the leading ($c^0$) and next-to-leading ($c^{-1}$) order corrections to the non-relativistic Hamiltonian in an accelerated frame, we obtain the perturbed fermionic energy spectrum. At leading order, we do not find any modifications except for a trivial mass shift, thus preserving the equivalence between inertial and gravitational mass and particle-antiparticle sectors. The next-to-leading order corrections, instead, introduce time-dependent anisotropic contributions depending on the preferred spatial direction in VSR, and can then be used to probe novel Lorentz-violating signatures. Taking \emph{q}\textsc{Bounce} sensitivity as a benchmark, we derive a first rough constraint for the neutron VSR parameter. Finally, we suggest alternative spin-flipping setups to better probe VSR effects and foresee potential future research directions.</description>

      <title>Entering the overcritical regime of nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production in collisions of bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-rays and superintense, tightly focused laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-future high-intensity lasers offer prospects for the observation of nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production in an overcritical field regime, where the quantum nonlinearity parameter substantially exceeds unity. This experimentally yet unexplored scenario is envisaged here to be reached via the collision of a tightly focused laser pulse with high-energy bremsstrahlung photons. We calculate the achievable number of pairs in a range of laser intensities around 10$^{23}$ W/cm$^2$ and GeV-energies of the incident bremsstrahlung-generating electron beam. We investigate under which conditions the attenuation of the $\gamma$-beam due to the production process must be taken into account and how much the second generation of created pairs contributes to the total yield. In the considered interaction regime, where the local production rate grows rather moderately with higher field intensities, it is shown that the range of mostly contributing bremsstrahlung frequencies is generally very broad. For sufficiently large values of the quantum nonlinearity parameter, an optimum domain of frequencies emerges which is located far below the spectral endpoint. Furthermore, we show that it is beneficial for achieving the optimum pair yield to increase the interaction volume by a wider laser focus at the expense of decreased field intensity.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic leptogenesis with light-heavy sterile neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel leptogenesis scenario utilising the two-body decay of heavy right handed neutrino (RHN) via the electromagnetic dipole operator. While the requirement of the standard model (SM) gauge invariance requires such dipole operator only at dimension-6 forcing the generation of non-zero CP asymmetry from three-body decay with two-loop corrections, we write down dimension-5 dipole operators involving heavy RHN $N_R$ and its lighter counterpart $\nu_R$. This allows the generation of lepton asymmetry in $\nu_R$ from two-body decay of heavy RHN which later gets transferred to left handed leptons via sizeable Yukawa coupling with a neutrinophilic Higgs doublet. The asymmetry in left handed leptons is then converted to baryon asymmetry via electroweak sphalerons. The lepton number violation by heavy RHN also induces a one-loop Majorana mass of $\nu_R$ rendering the light neutrinos to be Majorana fermions. While smallness of the Majorana mass of $\nu_R$ prevents additional sources or washout of lepton asymmetry, it also constrains the scale of leptogenesis. For $\mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV scale leptogenesis, this leads to additional sterile neutrinos lighter than a few keV with interesting implications for a variety of observables including neutrino oscillation, warm dark matter as well as effective degrees of freedom within reach of future cosmic microwave background experiments. Additionally, heavy RHN can lead to observable monochromatic photon signatures at terrestrial experiments.</description>

      <title>Factorisation schemes for proton PDFs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond leading-order, perturbative QCD requires a choice of factorisation scheme to define the parton distribution functions (PDFs) and hard-process cross-section. The modified minimal-subtraction ($\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$) scheme has long been adopted as the default choice due to its simplicity. Alternative schemes have been proposed with specific purposes, including, recently, PDF positivity and NLO parton-shower matching. In this paper we assemble these schemes in a common notation for the first time. We perform a detailed comparison of their features, both analytically and numerically, and estimate the resulting factorisation-scheme uncertainty for LHC phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of GRB data to test Lorentz-invariance violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lorentz-invariance violation (LV) at energy scales approaching the Planck regime serves as a critical probe for understanding quantum gravity phenomenology. Astrophysical observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) present a promising avenue for testing LV-induced spectral lag phenomena; however, interpretations are complicated by degeneracies between LV effects and intrinsic emission delays. This study systematically investigates three competing time delay models: Model A (LV delay combined with a constant intrinsic delay), Model B (energy-dependent intrinsic delay without LV), and Model C (LV delay combined with energy-dependent intrinsic delay). We utilize mock GRB datasets generated under distinct delay mechanisms and employ Bayesian parameter estimation on simulated observations of 10 GRBs. Our findings demonstrate that Model C consistently recovers input parameters across all datasets. In contrast, Models A and B struggle to reconcile data generated under alternative mechanisms, particularly when confronted with high-energy TeV photons from GRB 190114C and GRB 221009A. Our analysis confirms that the incorporation of energy-dependent intrinsic delays in Model C is essential for establishing robust LV constraints, effectively resolving prior ambiguities in the interpretation of multi-GeV and TeV photon emissions. The results validate Model C as a generalized framework for future LV searches, yielding a subluminal LV scale of \(E_{\rm LV} \simeq 3 \times 10^{17}\) GeV based on realistic datasets. These findings are consistent with earlier constraints derived from Fermi-LAT datasets. This work underscores the necessity for joint modeling of LV and astrophysical emission processes in next-generation LV studies utilizing observatories such as LHAASO and CTA.</description>

Abstract: One of the key scientific objectives for the next decade is to uncover the nature of dark matter (DM). We should continue prioritizing targets such as weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs), Axions, and other low-mass dark matter candidates to improve our chances of achieving it. A varied and ongoing portfolio of experiments spanning different scales and detection methods is essential to maximize our chances of discovering its composition. This report paper provides an updated overview of the Brazilian community's activities in dark matter and dark sector physics over the past years with a view for the future. It underscores the ongoing need for financial support for Brazilian groups actively engaged in experimental research to sustain the Brazilian involvement in the global search for dark matter particles</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.15544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this proceedings we consider several states, namely the $D^*_{s0}(2317)$, $D_{s1}(2460)$, $D^*_{0}(2300)$ and $D_{1}(2430)$, which appear to defy description as simple quark-antiquark pairs. Theoretical input from unitarized chiral perturbation theory suggests they can be understood as emerging from Goldstone-Boson--$D$-meson scattering. We present results from an $SU(3)$ flavor-symmetric lattice QCD simulation at large pion masses suggesting that there exists a $\pi D$ bound state in the flavor-sextet representation that cannot emerge for quark-antiquark states, but that appears naturally from the multiquark states. Moreover, we find repulsion in the [15] representation, which establishes the pattern predicted for the interactions of Goldstone bosons with $D$ mesons. This suggests these states may have the structure of hadronic molecules.</description>

Abstract: Recent observations indicate a $4.9\sigma$ tension between the CMB and quasar dipoles. This tension challenges the cosmological principle. We propose that if we live in a gigaparsec scale void, the CMB and quasar dipolar tension can be reconciled. This is because we are unlikely to live at the center of the void. And a within 10\% offset from the center will impact the quasars and CMB differently in their dipolar anisotropies. As we consider a large and thick void, our setup can also ease the Hubble tension.</description>

Abstract: The next Milky Way supernova will be an epochal event in multi-messenger astronomy, critical to tests of supernovae, neutrinos, and new physics. Realizing this potential depends on having realistic simulations of core collapse. We investigate the neutrino predictions of nearly all modern models (1-, 2-, and 3-d) over the first $\simeq$1 s, making the first detailed comparisons of these models to each other and to the SN 1987A neutrino data. Even with different methods and inputs, the models generally agree with each other. However, even considering the low neutrino counts, the models generally disagree with data. What can cause this? We show that neither neutrino oscillations nor different progenitor masses appear to be a sufficient solution. We outline urgently needed work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the results of a previous analysis of the Markovian master equation for the irreversible evolution of an open system embedded in de Sitter space, we include in the cosmological Friedmann equations a contribution from the presence of a physical bath at temperature $T_{\rm dS} = h / 2 \pi$, where $h$ is the Hubble parameter. We show that this provides a mechanism for the irreversible relaxation of the cosmological constant and a graceful exit to inflation, without need for subsequent reheating. Thermal particle production during inflation gives adiabatic, Gaussian, and approximately scale-invariant cosmological perturbations. We thus obtain the main features of inflation without any inflaton potential. To clarify the thermodynamic interpretation of these results, we consider the analogy of this irreversible relaxation to superfluorescence in quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Extracting more information from entropy</title>

Abstract: We extract the complex frequency of the lowest quasi-normal mode from the holographically computed entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. The system consists of a purely thermal Supersymmetric Yang-Mills N=4 plasma in homogeneous isotropization dynamics. The initial state is far-from-equilibrium, proceeding to thermalization over time. The system evolves to equilibrium entropy forming a stairway pattern. The analysis reveals that the rate of increase of the stairway is twice the decay rate of the lowest quasi-normal mode. This leads us to propose a model explaining how this information is encoded in entropy. The model is extended to consider finite temperature, R-charge density and scalar condensate of the medium, disclosing an additional feature. The system's main dissipation channel may shift to one driven by the scalar condensate, depending on the chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Understanding thermalization in a non-Abelian gauge theory in terms of its soft modes</title>

Abstract: We measure the maximal Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L$ of physical states in a SU(2) gauge theory consisting of soft momentum modes both in and out-of-thermal equilibrium conditions using ab-initio lattice techniques. We have implemented different algorithms to appropriately describe the dynamics of soft-modes for a wide range of temperatures and under non-equilibrium conditions. The non-equilibrium state has been realized starting from an over-occupied initial condition for low momentum soft gluons whereas the thermal state comprises of strongly interacting soft gluons at temperatures where these are well separated from the hard momentum modes. Spectra of positive Lyapunov exponents is observed in both these states, similar to a chaotic dynamical system. From the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate measured in terms of this spectrum, we estimate a typical time-scale of $\sim 0.50(3)$ fm/c to achieve thermalization at $T\sim 600$ MeV starting from the non-thermal state. We also measure, for the first time, the $\lambda_L$ for long wavelength critical modes of SU(2) using the out-of-time-ordered correlator of a classical $Z_2$ scalar field theory, which shares the same universal behavior with SU(2), near the deconfinement phase transition. The $\lambda_L$ is observed to maximize at the transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Analysis of symmetries in the Causal Loop-Tree Duality representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unveiling hidden symmetries within Feynman diagrams is crucial for achieving more efficient computations in high-energy physics. In this paper, we study the symmetries underlying the causal Loop-Tree Duality (LTD) representations through a {graph-theoretic} analysis. Focusing on the integrand-level representations of $N$-point functions at one loop, we examine their degeneration and discover that different causal representations are interconnected through specific transformations arising from the symmetries of cut diagrams. Furthermore, the degeneration is linked to algebraic constraints among the different causal thresholds. Our findings shed new light on the deeper structures of Feynman integrals and pave the way for significantly accelerating their calculation by interrelating different approaches.</description>

      <title>Magnetar structure in non-linear electrodynamics with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetars have inferred polar field strengths in excess of the Schwinger limit, where non-linear electromagnetic effects can be significant. Their internal fields may be even stronger, suggesting that Maxwellian characterizations of hydromagnetic structure may require revision. A generalized Grad-Shafranov equation, describing static and axisymmetric fluid stars with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields, is introduced and subsequently solved in a perturbative scheme to calculate quadrupolar deformations. In the Born-Infeld theory, we show that the toroidal field has a maximum strength set by the scale parameter, $b$, implying an upper limit to the stellar prolateness, $|\epsilon_{\rm max}| \sim 10^{-5} \left(b/10^{16}\text{ G}\right)^2$, that is independent of field specifics. Observations of magnetar phenomena that are interpreted as evidence for ellipticity, such as precession, can thus implicitly constrain post-Maxwellian parameters in a way that complements terrestrial experiments. Toroidal ceilings also have implications for dynamo theory and gravitational waves, which we revisit together with field evolution in crusts abiding by beyond-Maxwell physics.</description>
