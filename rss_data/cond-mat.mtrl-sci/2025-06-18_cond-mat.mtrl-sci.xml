      <title>A Coordination-Based Model for the Prediction of Surface Energies and the Shape of Metal Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface energies of metal-based systems are important for determining the Wulff-constructed shapes of metal nanoparticles and understanding the stability. We have developed a coordination number-based model to predict the total energy of metal-based systems across a wide range of configurations. Our model has been tested against Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations for late transition metals. This method enables on-the-fly surface energy predictions and allows for the Wulff construction of metal particles for a random number of elemental atoms and without the need for DFT calculations. By making a division between atoms in the different layers of the model system we can considerably improve the accuracy of the model, suggesting a dissimilarity between the electronic structure due to an alternating compression and expansion of atomic layers in the near-surface region. We find that our model accurately and effectively provides valuable insights into the distribution and stability of nanoparticle surfaces.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of the metal contact to p-type GaN: new multilayer design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical properties of contact to p-type nitride semiconductor devices, based on gallium nitride were simulated by ab initio and by drift-diffusion calculations. The contact electric properties are shown to be dominated by electron transfer form metal to GaN related to Fermi level difference both by ab initio and model calculation. The results indicate on high potential barrier for holes leading to nonohmic character of the contact. The electrical nature of the Ni-Au contact formed by annealing in oxygen atmosphere is elucidated. The doping influence on the potential profile in p-type GaN was calculated by in drift-diffusion model. The energy barrier height and width for hole transport is determined. Based on these results, new type of the contact, is proposed. The contact is created employing multiple layer implantation of the deep acceptors. The implementation of such design promise to attain superior characteristics (resistance) as compared to other contacts used in bipolar nitride semiconductor devices. The development of such contact will remove one of the main obstacles in the development of highly efficient nitride optoelectronic devices both LEDs and LDs: energy loss and the excessive heat production close to the multiple quantum wells system</description>

      <title>Impact of Mechanical Stress on IGZO TFTs: Enhancing PBTI Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of out-of-plane compressive mechanical stress (MS) on the performance and reliability of n-channel IGZO thin film transistors (TFTs). It is demonstrated that MS induces a positive Vth shift in the device transfer characteristics and enhances electron trapping during Positive Bias Temperature Instability (PBTI) tests. These effects are attributed to the widening of the IGZO bandgap (EG) and increased accessibility of carriers to AlOX gate oxide trap levels. As substantial residual MS is generated in 3D device processing, understanding its impact on IGZO TFTs is crucial for enabling future 3D DRAM technology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomic structure of Si tetramers that form on the Si$(111)\textrm{-}7\times7$ surface during homoepitaxy, is investigated by means of first principles calculations with the currently available atomistic model as starting point. It is demonstrated that the rectangular shape of the Si tetramer is unstable against buckling. Comparison of calculated results with available scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) data provides a new understanding of the problem, indicating that the recorded STM images are influenced by dynamic buckling.</description>

      <title>An efficient forgetting-aware fine-tuning framework for pretrained universal machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized computational materials science by enabling rapid atomistic simulations as efficient alternatives to ab initio methods. Fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs offers a practical approach to improving accuracy for materials and properties where predictive performance is insufficient. However, this approach often induces catastrophic forgetting, undermining the generalizability that is a key advantage of pretrained MLIPs. Herein, we propose reEWC, an advanced fine-tuning strategy that integrates Experience Replay and Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to effectively balance forgetting prevention with fine-tuning efficiency. Using Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl (LPSC), a sulfide-based Li solid-state electrolyte, as a fine-tuning target, we show that reEWC significantly improves the accuracy of a pretrained MLIP, resolving well-known issues of potential energy surface softening and overestimated Li diffusivities. Moreover, reEWC preserves the generalizability of the pretrained MLIP and enables knowledge transfer to chemically distinct systems, including other sulfide, oxide, nitride, and halide electrolytes. Compared to Experience Replay and EWC used individually, reEWC delivers clear synergistic benefits, mitigating their respective limitations while maintaining computational efficiency. These results establish reEWC as a robust and effective solution for continual learning in MLIPs, enabling universal models that can advance materials research through large-scale, high-throughput simulations across diverse chemistries.</description>

      <title>Subthreshold Swing Behavior in Amorphous Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide Transistors from Room to Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While cryogenic-temperature subthreshold swing (SS) in crystalline semiconductors has been widely studied, a careful study on the temperature-dependent SS in amorphous oxide semiconductors remains lacking. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of the SS in thin-film transistors with an amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) channel at temperatures from 300 K down to 4 K is presented. Main observations include: 1) At room temperature (300 K), the devices exhibit a SS of 61 mV/dec, and a low interface trap density (&lt;1011 cm-2), among the best reported values for IGZO devices. 2) A SS saturation around 40 mV/dec is observed between 200 K and 100 K. It is well explained by the electron transport via band tail states with exponential decay (Wt) of 13 meV. 3) At deep-cryogenic temperature, SS increase significantly exceeding 200 mV/dec at 4 K. Such high SS values are actually limited by the measurement current range, confirmed by Id-Vg simulations based on the variable range hopping (VRH) model. This work not only elucidates the SS behavior in amorphous IGZO devices but also provides a deep understanding of the physical mechanisms of electron transport in amorphous semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric switching control of spin current in graphene proximitized by In$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By utilizing the proximity effect, we introduce a platform that exploits ferroelectric switching to modulate spin currents in graphene proximitized by ferroelectric In$_2$Se$_3$ monolayer. Through first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling, we studied the electronic structure of graphene/In$_2$Se$_3$ heterostructure for twist angles of 0$^{\circ}$ and 17.5$^{\circ}$, considering both ferroelectric polarizations. We discover that switching the ferroelectric polarization reverses the sign of the charge-to-spin conversion coefficients, acting as a chirality switch of the in-plane spin texture in graphene. For the twisted heterostructure, we observed emergence of unconventional radial Rashba field for one ferroelectric polarization direction. Additionally, we demonstrated that the Rashba phase can be directly extracted from the ratio of conversion efficiency coefficients, providing a straightforward approach to characterize the in-plane spin texture in graphene. All the unique features of the studied graphene/In$_2$Se$_3$ heterostructure can be experimentally detected, offering a promising approach for developing advanced spintronic devices with enhanced performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low-resistivity nitrogen-doped p-type Cu2O thin films fabricated by reactive HiPIMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have successfully fabricated the nitrogen-doped cuprous oxide thin films on the amorphous standard soda-lime glass by reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering. The energy of film-forming particles was controlled by the value of pulse-averaged target power density, which has a significant impact on the elemental composition, structure and optoelectrical properties of the films. We have shown that the high-energy regime is more suitable for preserving Cu2O structure and leads to continuous substitution of oxygen by nitrogen compared with the low-energy regime. Moreover, in the high-energy regime, it is possible, to some extent, to independently control the electrical resistivity and optical properties. The electrical resistivity decreases down to 5 x10-2 ohm.cm at the optical band gap 2.0-2.3 eV. Special attention is paid to the formation of nitrogen molecules and their ability to form shallow acceptor states. Experimental results supported by our DFT calculations indicate that N2 replacing Cu in the Cu2O lattice is one possible (but not the only possible) acceptor. We have also found that the formation of nitrogen molecules is preferred in a high-energy regime.</description>

      <title>High-Entropy Skutterudites as Thermoelectrics: Synthesizability and Band Convergence via the Cocktail Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High entropy materials offer a promising avenue for thermoelectric materials discovery, design, and optimization. However, the large chemical spaces that need to be explored hamper their development. In this work, a large family of high-entropy skutterudites is explored as promising thermoelectric materials. Their synthesizability is screened and rationalized using the disordered enthalpy-entropy descriptor through high-throughput density functional theory calculations. In the case of high-entropy skutterudites, the thermodynamic density of states and the entropy gain parameter appear to be key factors for their stabilization. Electronic band structure analyses not only show a reduction in the band gap, which enhances carrier concentration and electrical conductivity, but also a band convergence phenomenon for some specific compositions, which is related to the "cocktail effect". Analyzing atom-projected band structures shows how band convergence is due to the simultaneous presence of Fe, Ni, and Co in the compound. The presence of Rh or Ir, while not contributing to this band convergence effect, can be directly linked to an increase in system's entropy, which enhances the thermodynamic stability of these materials.</description>

      <title>Towards High-Efficiency Solar Cells: Insights into AsNCa 3 Antiperovskite as Active Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in photovoltaic technology are a viable route to contribute to cleaner and more sustainable energy solutions, placing perovskite-based materials among the best candidates for solar energy conversion. However, some challenges must be addressed to enhance their performance and stability. Herein, we report an investigation of the AsNCa3 antiperovskite system for its potential in photovoltaic devices. We consider eight distinct crystalline phases, their structural parameters, dynamical stability, and electronic and optical properties. Furthermore, we consider each structural phase's contributions to solar harvesting efficiency by calculating the power conversion efficiency (PCE) using the spectroscopiclimited maximum efficiency (SLME) formalism, which in this case reaches a maximum of 31.2%. All dynamically stable phases exhibit a band gap around 1.3 eV, which lies within the optimal range for single-junction solar cells and yields PCE values comparable to the theoretical maximum PCE for silicon. These results place AsNCa3 antiperovskites as promising candidates for high-efficiency photovoltaic applications. Notably, the PCE is only slightly changed by structural phase modification, suggesting that phase transitions induced by environmental conditions during device operation might not compromise device performance.</description>

      <title>A new angle on stacking faults: Breaking the edge-on limit in high-resolution defect analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of stacking faults - whether intrinsic or extrinsic - plays a pivotal role in defect-mediated processes in crystalline materials. Yet, current electron microscopy techniques for their reliable analysis remain limited to either conventional fringe-contrast imaging of inclined faults or atomic-resolution imaging of edge-on configurations. Here, we overcome this dichotomy by introducing a high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) method that enables full structural discrimination of inclined stacking faults in fcc and $L1_2$ crystals. This approach eliminates a long-standing geometric constraint on high-resolution analysis, providing comprehensive access to stacking faults on all glide planes along the widely used [001] and [110] zone axes. We demonstrate the robustness of the method in a CoNi-based superalloy, achieving clear discrimination of fault types even in overlapping configurations and foil thicknesses exceeding 100 nm. Simulations reveal that fault-induced de-channeling is key to contrast formation and is strongly governed by the fault's depth within the sample. Leveraging this effect, we further establish a route to artificially generate ultrathin TEM lamellae - bounded by the stacking fault itself - thereby enhancing contrast for atomic-scale studies of long-range ordering, compositional fluctuations, and nanoclustering.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we have performed a comprehensive study of dielectric materials NbOX2 (X=Cl, Br, and I) within the framework of density functional theory, incorporating both conventional and hybrid functionals.Our studies focus on the structure, electronic, elastic, and piezoelectric properties. Piezoelectricity is an innovative avenue to extract energy by manipulating the material's structures via mechanical stress. The use of non-lead-based material for piezoelectricity added an advantage of a greener approach. Among the investigated materials, bulk NbOI2 exhibits the highest piezoelectric response of 6.32 C/m$^2$, which is around 31% higher than NbOCl2, NbOBr2 and even lead zirconate titanate.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Breakdown Mechanism and Heat Dissipation in Few-Layered semimetallic PtSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platinum diselenide (PtSe2) is an emerging two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide known for its excellent electrical and optical properties, along with remarkable air stability. For PtSe2-based electronic devices, understanding high-field breakdown and heat dissipation is crucial for designing high-performance and energy-efficient systems operating under extreme conditions. In this work, we investigate the breakdown mechanisms of semimetallic PtSe2 at both low and room temperatures. Heat dissipation is quantified via interfacial thermal conductivity (ITC) of PtSe2/SiO2 and PtSe2/h-BN interfaces using Raman thermometry. Our findings indicate that at room temperature, device breakdown is predominantly governed by self-heating effects. Conversely, at low temperatures, the breakdown is mainly driven by carrier multiplication under high electric fields, as further confirmed by Hall measurements.</description>

      <title>Maximizing solubility in rock salt high-entropy oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explore and quantitatively map the cation-size mismatch solubility limits in high-entropy oxides (HEOs), we report on Ca$^{2+}$ substitution in prototypical MgCoNiCuZnO, because, while isovalent, Ca$^{2+}$ is 38% larger than its partners' average ionic radii. Using the thermodynamics-grounded bond-length distribution descriptor, we identify Ca$^{2+}$-Cu$^{2+}$ interactions as the primary prospective lattice destabilizer. Bulk synthesis confirms only 4% Ca solubility with Cu at 950$^o$C, modestly rising to 5% after Cu removal at 1150$^o$C. We then employ far-from-equilibrium pulsed-laser deposition to investigate metastable solubility: epitaxial films incorporate 10% Ca with Cu and a full 20% Ca without, doubling and quadrupling the respective bulk limits. This Ca uptake additionally enables deterministic lattice-parameter control via Ca concentration. Overall, our results demonstrate both the extended solubility possible in HEO systems, particularly when accessing metastable states through quenching from high-energy plasma, and that the specific constellation of solid-solvent cations can be rationally engineered to minimize bond-length distributions when largely misfit cations are added, thus expanding the accessible compositional space.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Framework for Modeling Ensemble Properties of Atomically Disordered Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder, though naturally present in experimental samples and strongly influencing a wide range of material phenomena, remains underexplored in first-principles studies due to the computational cost of sampling the large supercell and configurational space. The recent development of machine learning techniques, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), has enabled the efficient and accurate predictions of complex material properties, offering promising tools for studying disordered systems. In this work, we introduce a computational framework that integrates GNNs with Monte Carlo simulations for efficient calculations of thermodynamic properties and ensemble-averaged functional properties of disordered materials. Using the surface-termination-disordered MXene monolayer \ch{Ti3C2T}$_{2-x}$ as a representative system, we investigate the effect of surface termination disorder involving \ch{-F}, \ch{-O}, and termination vacancies on the electrical and optical conductivity spectra. We find that surface termination disorder affects the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity, inducing a peak close to the order-disorder phase transition temperature that reflects the competition between scattering and electron filling effects of the surface termination groups across the phase transition. In contrast, optical conductivity remains robust to local disorder across a wide temperature range and is governed primarily by the global chemical composition of surface terminations. These results demonstrate the utility of our machine-learning-assisted framework for statistically modeling disorder effects and ensemble properties in complex materials, opening new avenues for future studies of disorder-driven phenomena in systems such as high-entropy alloys and disordered magnetic compounds.</description>

      <title>Mixed platinum and zirconia powder as electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution and oxidation reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of efficient and cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen-related technologies is crucial for the transition to sustainable energy. In this work, we present Pt@ZrO2 as a high-performance ceramic-based electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), demonstrating superior activity and stability in alkaline conditions. Compared to Pd@ZrO2, previously investigated in our earlier work, Pt@ZrO2 exhibits significantly lower charge transfer resistance and enhanced HER/HOR kinetics, as confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The synergistic interaction between platinum and ZrO2 stabilizes Pt in a partially oxidized state, facilitating the Volmer step and improving charge transfer kinetics. Cyclic voltammetry further confirms the remarkable electrochemical stability of Pt@ZrO2 under stress conditions. Importantly, Pt@ZrO2 offers a cost-effective alternative to pure platinum by reducing noble metal loading while maintaining excellent catalytic performance. These findings establish Pt@ZrO2 as a better alternative to Pd@ZrO2 and a promising candidate for next-generation hydrogen energy applications.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Task Prediction of HEA Properties Using Prior-Guided Deep Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations. This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic, heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics. Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and data-efficient materials design.</description>

      <title>MXene triggers high toughness, high strength and low hysteresis hydrogels for printed artificial tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Substituting load-bearing tissues requires hydrogels with rapid processability, excellent mechanical strength and fatigue resistance. Conventional homogeneously polymerized hydrogels with short-chains/excessive branching exhibit low strength/toughness, being inadequate for artificial tissues. Here we introduce the heterogeneous polymerization-accelerated reaction kinetics on the Ti3C2Tx MXene microreactor and sluggish kinetics beyond-to rapidly produce hydrogels within minutes. This allows the hyperbranched domains embedded within a highly entangled matrix, leading to excellent strength (2.4 MPa)/toughness (75.2 kJ m-2) and low hysteresis (2.9%) in hydrogels superior to the rest ones. The rapid liquid-to-solid transition triggered by MXene suggests the great possibility of 3D printed robust hydrogels toward artificial tissue. Importantly, these printed hydrogels-based artificial ligaments have demonstrated impressive load-bearing capacity, wear resistance, and suturability compared to commercial analogs.</description>

      <title>MOFClassifier: A Machine Learning Approach for Validating Computation-Ready Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational discovery and design of new crystalline materials, particularly metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), heavily relies on high-quality, computation-ready structural data. However, recent studies have revealed significant error rates within existing MOF databases, posing a critical data problem that hinders efficient high-throughput computational screening. While rule-based algorithms like MOSAEC, MOFChecker, and the Chen and Manz method (Chen-Manz) have been developed to address this, they often suffer from inherent limitations and misclassification of structures. To overcome this challenge, we introduce MOFClassifier, a novel machine learning approach built upon a positive-unlabeled crystal graph convolutional neural network (PU-CGCNN) model. MOFClassifier learns intricate patterns from perfect crys-tal structures to predict a crystal-likeness score (CLscore), effectively classifying MOFs as computation-ready. Our model achieves a ROC value of 0.979 (previous best 0.912) and, importantly, can identify subtle structural and chemical errors that are fundamentally undetectable by current rule-based methods. By accurately recovering previously misclassified false-negative structures, MOFClassifier reduces the risk of overlooking promising material candidates in large-scale computational screening efforts. This user-friendly tool is freely available and has been integrated into the preparation workflow for the updated CoRE MOF DB 2025 v1, contributing to accelerated computational discovery of MOF materials.</description>

      <title>Revised identification of strain gradient elastic parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work reported in ``Granular micromechanics-based identification of isotropic strain gradient parameters for elastic geometrically nonlinear deformations" misidentified key terms in the grain-pair objective relative displacement when accounting for the second gradient of placement. In this paper, we correct that oversight by deriving a revised expression for the grain-pair objective relative displacement within the granular micromechanics framework. The amended terms, which resemble Christoffel symbols expressed in terms of strain gradients, modify the contributions of both the normal and tangential components to the strain energy and, consequently, alter the identified strain gradient elastic parameters. Importantly, the identification of the standard (first gradient) elastic tensor remains unchanged. This brief paper presents the corrected derivation, the resulting stiffness tensors for anisotropic strain gradient elasticity, and updated analytical expressions for the material parameters in both 2D and 3D isotropic settings.</description>

      <title>Recent solution to the Casimir puzzle awaits its experimental confirmation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The plausible resolution of the Casimir puzzle implying that the dissipative Drude model is not applicable in the area of transverse electric evanescent waves is discussed. Calculations show that for the propagating waves, as well for the evanescent waves with transverse magnetic polarization, the Drude model can beused in calculations of the Casimir force by the Lifshitz theory with no contradictions with the measurement data. The lateral component of magnetic field of the magnetic dipole oscillating near a metallic surface is computed for the parameters of experiment in preparation which is aimed to directly check the validity of the Drude model in the area of transverse electric evanescent waves. By comparing with the case of graphene, whose dielectric response is spatially nonlocal and possesses the double pole at zero frequency, it is hypothesized that the success of the dissipationless plasma model in this area is also caused by the presence of a double pole.</description>

      <title>An Atomic Cluster Expansion Potential for Twisted Multilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted multilayer graphene, characterized by its moire patterns arising from inter-layer rotational misalignment, serves as a rich platform for exploring quantum phenomena. While first-principles calculations are computationally prohibitive and empirical interatomic potentials often lack accuracy, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) present a promising alternative, offering (near-)DFT accuracy at a significantly reduced computational cost. Despite their success in two-dimensional monolayer materials, MLIPs remain under-explored in twisted multilayer graphene systems. In this work, we develop an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential for simulating twisted multilayer graphene and test it on a range of simulation tasks. We propose an approach to construct training and test datasets that incorporate all possible twist angles and local stacking, including incommensurate ones. To achieve this, we generate configurations with periodic boundary conditions suitable for DFT calculations, and then introduce an internal twist and shift within those supercell structures. We further refine the dataset through active learning filtering, guided by Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our model is validated for accuracy and robustness through a wide range of numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Effect of Rashba spin-orbit coupling on topological phases in monolayer ZnIn2Te4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of Rashba and quantum spin Hall effects in non-centrosymmetric systems presents both challenges and opportunities for spintronic applications. While Rashba spin-orbit coupling can disrupt the quantum spin Hall phase, their coexistence may enable additional spintronic functionalities by coupling spin-momentum locking in the bulk with topologically protected edge states. Using the ZnIn$_2$Te$_4$ monolayer as a case study-a predicted polar two-dimensional topological insulator-we investigate how intrinsic and Rashba spin-orbit coupling compete within a single material. Our results identify key conditions under which sizable Rashba spin splitting can coexist with a stable quantum spin Hall phase, offering guidance for engineering quantum spin Hall insulators with enhanced spintronic capabilities.</description>

      <title>Highly anisotropic magnetic phase diagram of the ferromagnetic rare-earth diboride HoB$_{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth (RE) compounds have been of enormous interest in condensed matter physics as a platform for the exploration of interesting physical phenomena. Here, we report the successful single crystal growth of HoB$_{2}$, which exhibits a paramagnetic (PM)-ferromagnetic (FM) phase transition at 15 K and another phase transition at 11 K, and the discovery of a highly anisotropic magnetic phase diagram of this FM diboride. Magnetization measurements suggest that the ferromagnetically ordered moments of Ho$^{3+}$ ions are oriented at a direction tilted by 50 degrees from the ab-plane at 2K, which rotate largely toward the ab-plane direction upon application of a magnetic field, but hardly toward the c-axis direction. Heat capacity and electrical resistivity measurements clearly demonstrate that the low-temperature phase transition at 11 K occurs even under high magnetic fields along the ab-plane direction, whereas it disappears immediately by magnetic fields along the c-axis direction. Moreover, the field-induced crossover phenomenon between FM and PM phases near 15 K is found to be more promoted when applying a magnetic field along the ab-plane direction. The resulting magnetic phase diagram reveals that in-plane magnetic anisotropy is predominant in the present system, which contradicts the previous report of a spin reorientation phenomenon toward the c-axis direction between 11 K and 15 K. Taken together, the present findings suggest the presence of strong competition between in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic anisotropies in HoB$_{2}$, giving rise to the unique FM spin arrangement.</description>

      <title>Strain-tuning for superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-transition temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) superconductivity in pressurized La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ bulk crystals has attracted keen attention due to its characteristic energy diagram of $e_{g}$ orbitals, containing nearly half-filled $d_{3z^2 - r^2}$ and quarter-filled $d_{x^2 - y^2}$ orbitals. This finding provides valuable insights into the orbital contributions and interlayer interactions in double NiO$_{6}$ octahedra, offering opportunities to control the electronic structure via ligand field variations. Here, we demonstrate strain-tuning of $T_\mathrm{c}$ over a range of 50 K in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ films grown on different oxide substrates under 20 GPa. As the $c/a$ ratio increases, the onset $T_\mathrm{c}$ systematically rises from 10 K in the tensile-strained film on SrTiO$_{3}$ to a maximum of about 60 K in the compressively strained film on LaAlO$_{3}$. These systematic variations suggest that strain engineering is a promising strategy for expanding superconductivity in bilayer nickelates by tuning the orbital energy landscape toward high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation Framework for Accelerating High-Accuracy Neural Network-Based Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures. To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without sacrificing accuracy.</description>

      <title>Devitrification and Melting Dynamics in Vapor Deposited Water Ice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equilibration dynamics of ultrastable glasses subjected to heating protocols has attracted recent experimental and theoretical interest. With simulations of the mW water model, we investigate the devitrification and melting dynamics of both conventional quenched (QG) and vapor deposited (DG) amorphous ices under controlled heating ramps. By developing an algorithm to reconstruct hydrogen-bond networks, we show that bond ring statistics correlates with the structural stability of the glasses and allows tracking crystalline and liquid clusters during devitrification and melting. We find that QG melts in the bulk, whereas melting in DG preferentially begins near the free surface. During devitrification, the DG shows an excess of 5-membered rings near the free surface, which is consistent with its tendency to nucleate the crystal phase in this region. Additionally, the DG shows an Avrami exponent exceeding the standard 1+d behavior, while both glasses display the same sub-3d growth of liquid clusters across heating rates, indicating that the DG enhanced exponent stems from its higher kinetic stability.</description>

      <title>Time-bin encoded quantum key distribution over 120 km with a telecom quantum dot source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology</description>

      <title>Intertwined magnetic phase driven exchange bias and its impact on the anomalous Hall effect in MnBi$_4$Te$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the interplay between atomic scale inhomogeneity and competing magnetic phases and its effect on the anomalous Hall effect in the layered antiferromagnet MnBi$_4$Te$_7$, a natural superlattice hosting coexisting ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. Using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), DC and AC magnetization, and magneto-transport measurements, we reveal that intrinsic Mn Bi antisite defects induce strong interlayer exchange coupling, giving rise to a robust exchange bias observed in both magnetic and Hall responses. The exchange bias undergoes a transition from asymmetric to symmetric behavior between 2 K and 6 K, indicating a temperature driven dynamical reconfiguration of interfacial spin structures. The training effect analysis revealed a stronger contribution of frozen spins at 2 K compared to 6 K, with relaxation amplitude shift from -264 Oe to 306 Oe. This sign reversal indicates a field-induced change in interfacial coupling. The temperature dependence of longitudinal resistivity and magnetization reveals complementary behavior, indicating the coexistence of two distinct spin states near the magnetic transition temperature. The phase fraction based resistivity model captures the distinct scattering mechanisms that govern electronic transport across different magnetic regimes. Our findings offer a direct link between microscopic disorder, interfacial magnetism and macroscopic topological phenomena in magnetic topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Advanced Langevin thermostats: Properties, extensions to rheology, and a lean momentum-conserving approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Langevin equation accounts for unresolved bath degrees of freedom driving the system toward the bath temperature. Because of this, numerical solutions of the Langevin equation have a long history. Here, we recapitulate, combine, and extend existing Langevin-equation based thermostats, scrutinize their properties and demonstrate their superiority over global kinetic-energy controls. Our work includes compact, asymptotic-analysis based derivations of stochastic thermostats, including the highly accurate Gr{\o}nbech-Jensen scheme. Proposed extensions include a precise, colored and a lean, momentum-conserving thermostat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cubic silicon carbide phonon thermal conductivity has been calculated using anharmonic phonon analysis. The atomic interaction model was built using displacement-force data obtained with the High Efficiency Configuration Space Sampling (HECSS) technique and density functional theory calculated forces. In the new version of HECSS we replaced the Markov chain scheme of Metropolis-Hastings Monte-Carlo with weighting of the final sampling according to the target distribution. This increased the efficiency of the method and allowed to use -- with appropriate weight -- all generated and ab-initio evaluated samples. The quality of the proposed method is confirmed by the accuracy with which the experimental results taken from the literature were reproduced.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diamond: Interpretable Machine Learning Discovery of Coherent Quantum Defect Hosts in Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum point defects in wide bandgap semiconductors-such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond are leading candidates for solid-state spin qubits due to their long coherence times and optically addressable spin states. Yet, identifying host materials capable of supporting such deep-level defects remains a significant challenge, owing to the complex interplay between chemical composition, crystal structure, and electronic environment. Here, we present a scalable, interpretable machine learning framework that combines density functional theory (DFT)-informed descriptors with a structure-agnostic ensemble model to predict quantum-compatible defect-host materials. Trained on a curated dataset from the Materials Project and ICSD, our model achieves a high Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC &gt; 0.95) and assigns confidence scores to guide prioritization of candidates. First-principles calculations of coherence-relevant properties, including static dielectric constants and defect formation energetics, validate key predictions. While high dielectric response is a necessary but not sufficient condition for spin coherence, our model successfully recovers known hosts such as diamond and SiC, and reveals previously overlooked candidates such as WS2 , MgO, CaS and TiO2 . This approach establishes a robust path for discovering next-generation quantum materials, bridging data-driven screening with physically interpretable design principles.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics of $cis$-polybutadiene across the glass transition revealed by muonated-radical spin relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local molecular motion of $cis$-polybutadiene, a typical polymeric material exhibiting a glass transition ($T_{\rm g}=168$ K), is investigated by the spin relaxation of muonated radicals, where the relaxation is induced by the fluctuation of hyperfine (HF) fields exerted from an unpaired electron to a nearby muon and surrounding protons. The relaxation rate $1/T_\mu$ measured under various longitudinal magnetic fields is analyzed using the recently developed theory of spin relaxation to consider the coexistence of quasistatic and fluctuating HF fields, where the fluctuation frequency for the latter $\nu$ is evaluated over a temperature $T$ range of 5-320 K. The obtained $\nu(T)$ is found to be well reproduced by the Arrhenius relation, and the activation energy and preexponential factor are in good agreement with those for the "elemental process" revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering and attributed to a fluctuation across three carbon-carbon bonds. This result demonstrates that muonated-radical spin relaxation is a promising approach for direct access to local molecular motions in the sub-nanosecond range and for their detailed modeling at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Nonmagnetic ground state of marcasite FeTe$_{2}$: The competition between crystal field splitting and on-site Coulomb repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic ground states in crystalline systems are significant for both fundamental condensed matter physics and practical materials engineering. Marcasite FeTe$_{2}$, characterized as a small-gap semiconductor, exhibits anomalous magnetic behaviors in low-temperature experiments. In this study, first-principles density functional theory calculations combined with scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy are employed to investigate the magnetic ground state of marcasite FeTe$_{2}$. It is revealed that the competition between crystal field splitting and on-site Coulomb repulsion plays the key role in the formation of localized magnetic moments in FeTe$_{2}$. The ground state of FeTe$_{2}$ bulk is confirmed to be nonmagnetic, while the magnetic responses of FeTe$_{2}$ observed at low temperature are suggested to be related to the magnetic Fe atoms on the crystal surfaces. Our work proposes a straightforward competing mechanism for determining ground-state magnetism of various localized-moment crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>IsoME: Streamlining High-Precision Eliashberg Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Julia package IsoME, an easy-to-use yet accurate and robust computational tool designed to calculate superconducting properties. Multiple levels of approximation are supported, ranging from the basic McMillan-Allen-Dynes formula and its machine learning-enhanced variant to Eliashberg theory including static Coulomb interactions derived from $GW$ calculations, offering a fully ab initio approach to determine superconducting properties, such as the critical superconducting temperature ($T_\text{c}$) and the superconducting gap function ($\Delta$). We validate IsoME by benchmarking it against various materials, demonstrating its versatility and performance across different theoretical levels. The findings indicate that the previously held assumption that Eliashberg theory overestimates $T_\text{c}$ is no longer valid when $\mu^*$ is appropriately adjusted to account for the finite Matsubara frequency cutoff. Furthermore, we conclude that the constant density of states (DOS) approximation remains accurate in most cases. By unifying multiple approximation schemes within a single framework, IsoME combines first-principles precision with computational efficiency, enabling seamless integration into high-throughput workflows through its $T_\text{c}$ search mode. This makes IsoME a powerful and reliable tool for advancing superconductivity research.</description>

      <title>First-principles predictions of the diversity in atomic structures and electronic properties of the reconstructed Si(111)-7x7 surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 7x7 reconstruction of Si(111) surface is widely understood by the dimer-adatom-stacking-fault model (DAS), but the predicted metallicity of DAS contradicts experimental signs of insulation. It is still challenge to predict DAS-like reconstructions by traditional method to solve such a puzzle. Here, we show that low-energy reconstructions of Si(111)-7x7 surface with (DAS-d8-T12, DAS-d8-T9H3-A, DAS-d8-T9H3-B and DAS-d8-T6H6) and without (AB-d10-T12, AB-d10-T9H3, AA-d10-T12 and AA-d10-T9H3) stacking-fault can be quickly discovered by graph theory as implemented in RG2 code for crystal structure prediction. They exhibit comparable stability to the DAS (DAS-d8-T12) model and similar STM patterns, offering a plausible explanation for the observed Si(111)-7x7 reconstruction. All these reconstructions exhibit metallic behavior in the nonmagnetic (NM) state with isolated narrow bands crossing the Fermi level in varying occupancy. And they are further confirmed as ferromagnetic (FM) metals (DAS-d8-T9H3-B), half-metals (DAS-d8-T12, AB-d10-T9H3, AA-d10-T12 and AA-d10-T9H3), half-semimetals (DAS-d8-T9H3-A and DAS-d8-T6H6) and even insulators (AB-d10-T12), depending their occupancies of the NM band structures. These findings not only demonstrate the rich electromagnetic phases of reconstructed Si(111) surfaces and their potential for spintronic applications, but also provide a plausible physical explanation for the metal-insulator transition observed on the Si(111) surface.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility (the rate at which relaxation time grow with decreasing temperature) is central to unraveling the glass transition. Fragility is often linked to dynamic heterogeneity, and thus it is commonly assumed that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using three model systems: Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Weeks--Chandler--Andersen, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q, p) system, where potential softness is changed to vary fragility. We employ a structural order parameter derived from the mean field caging potential and analyze energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic slope of the energy barrier, suitably defined, correlates with fragility, no consistent correlation is found for the microscopic energy barriers. Instead, the latter shows a strong correlation with an independently computed structure dynamics measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble. Surprisingly, the two systems with the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8, 5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, bimodal displacement profiles, and high non-Gaussian parameters, all indicative of dynamic heterogeneity. However, their dynamic susceptibilities remain low, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation and temporal heterogeneity. Both systems lie in the enthalpy-dominated regime and are near the spinodal, suggesting mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. These findings challenge the conventional linkage among fragility, heterogeneity, and structure-dynamics correlation.</description>
