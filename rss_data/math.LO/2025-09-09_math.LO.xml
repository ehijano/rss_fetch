      <title>Subsystems of Open Induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study subsystems of open induction which are strongly connected to methods of automated inductive theorem proving. Specifically, we consider systems obtained from restricting induction to atoms, literals, clauses, and dual clauses. We obtain a complete picture of the relationships between these systems in the language of arithmetic and its sublanguages in terms of inclusion and strict inclusion.</description>

      <title>Hyper swap structures and Kalman functors: the case study of da Costa logic $C_\omega$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we recast Morgado hyperlattices and Sette implicative hyperlattices in lattice-theoretic terms. By utilizing swap structures induced by implicative lattices, we obtained a direct proof of soundness and completeness for da Costa's paraconsistent logic $C_\omega$ with respect to Sette's hyperalgebraic semantics. Inspired by Kalman functors in the context of twist structures, we introduce the notion of hyper swap structures, a novel class of hyperalgebras that naturally generalize swap structure semantics. We prove that these hyperalgebras, besides providing another class of hyperalgebraic models for $C_\omega$, induce a Kalman-style functor between the category of Sette implicative hyperlattices and the category of enriched hyperalgebras for $C_\omega$. Specifically, we exhibit an equivalence of categories between Sette implicative hyperlattices and their enriched hyperalgebraic counterparts using Kalman and forgetful functors. Similar results are extended to two axiomatic extensions of $C_\omega$.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Point Theorems and the Ethics of Radical Transparency: A Logic-First Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a formal framework, grounded in mathematical logic and order theory, to analyze the inherent limitations of radical transparency. We demonstrate that self-referential disclosure policies inevitably encounter fixed-point phenomena and diagonalization barriers, imposing fundamental trade-offs between openness and stability.
  Key results include: (i) an impossibility theorem showing no sufficiently expressive system can define a total, consistent transparency predicate for its own statements; (ii) a categorical fixed-point argument (Lawvere) for the inevitability of self-referential equilibria; (iii) order-theoretic design theorems (Knaster-Tarski) proving extremal fixed points exist and that the least fixed point minimizes a formal ethical risk functional; (iv) a construction for consistent partial transparency using Kripkean truth; (v) an analysis of self-endorsement hazards via L\"ob's Theorem; (vi) a recursion-theoretic exploitation theorem (Kleene) formalizing Goodhart's Law under full disclosure; (vii) an exploration of non-classical logics for circumventing classical paradoxes; and (viii) a modal $\mu$-calculus formulation for safety invariants under iterative disclosure.
  Our analysis provides a mathematical foundation for transparency design, proving that optimal policies are necessarily partial and must balance accountability against strategic gaming and paradox. We conclude with equilibrium analysis and lattice-theoretic optimality conditions, offering a principled calculus for ethical disclosure in complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study actions of (infinitely presented) graphical small cancellation groups on the Gromov boundaries of their coned-off Cayley graphs. We show that a class of graphical small cancellation groups, including (infinitely presented) classical small cancellation groups, admit hyperfinite boundary actions, more precisely, the orbit equivalence relation that they induce on the boundaries of the coned-off Cayley graphs is hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>The Ribes-Zalesski\u{i} product theorem via foldings and extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exposition of the Auinger-Steinberg proof of the Ribes-Zalesski\u{i} product theorem for pro-V topologies, where V is a pseudovariety of groups closed under extensions with abelian kernel. This proof is self-contained and is accessible to those acquainted with coverings of graphs, and as such, it provides an easy entry point to various other deep theorems for which the product theorem is formally equivalent to.</description>

      <title>Proxy principles in combinatorial set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parameterized proxy principles were introduced by Brodsky and Rinot in a 2017 paper, as new foundations for the construction of $\kappa$-Souslin trees in a uniform way that does not depend on the nature of the (regular uncountable) cardinal $\kappa$. Since their introduction, these principles have facilitated construction of Souslin trees with complex combinations of features, and have enabled the discovery of completely new scenarios in which Souslin trees must exist. Furthermore, the proxy principles have found new applications beyond the construction of trees.
  This paper opens with a comprehensive exposition of the proxy principles. We motivate their very definition, emphasizing the utility of each of the parameters and the consequent flexibility that they provide. We then survey the findings surrounding them, presenting a rich spectrum of unrelated models and configurations in which the proxy principles are known to hold, and showcasing a gallery of Souslin trees constructed from the principles.
  The last two sections of the paper offer new results. In particular, for every positive integer $n$, we give a construction of a $\lambda^+$-Souslin tree all of whose $n$-derived trees are Souslin, but whose $(n+1)$-power is special.</description>

      <title>An almost Kurepa Suslin tree with strongly non-saturated square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For uncountable downwards closed subtrees $U$ and $W$ of an $\omega_1$-tree $T$, we say that $U$ and $W$ are strongly almost disjoint if their intersection is a finite union of countable chains. The tree $T$ is strongly non-saturated if there exists a strongly almost disjoint family of $\omega_2$-many uncountable downwards closed subtrees of $T$. In this article we construct a Knaster forcing which adds a Suslin tree together with a family of $\omega_2$-many strongly almost disjoint automorphisms of it (and thus the square of the Suslin tree is strongly non-saturated). To achieve this goal, we introduce a new idea called $\rho$-separation, which is an adaptation to the finite context of the notion of separation which was recently introduced by Stejskalov\'{a} and the first author for the purpose of adding automorphisms of a tree with a forcing with countable conditions.</description>

      <title>On distance logics of Euclidean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider logics derived from Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$. Each Euclidean space carries relations consisting of those pairs that are, respectively, distance more than 1 apart, distance less than 1 apart, and distance 1 apart. Each relation gives a uni-modal logic of $\mathbb{R}^n$ called the farness, nearness, and constant distance logics, respectively. These modalities are expressive enough to capture various aspects of the geometry of $\mathbb{R}^n$ related to bodies of constant width and packing problems. This allows us to show that the farness logics of the spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$ are all distinct, as are the nearness logics, and the constant distance logics. The farness and nearness logics of $\mathbb{R}$ are shown to strictly contain those of $\mathbb{Q}$, while their constant distance logics agree. It is shown that the farness logic of the reals is not finitely axiomatizable and does not have the finite model property.</description>
