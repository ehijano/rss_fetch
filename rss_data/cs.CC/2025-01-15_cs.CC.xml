      <title>Towards the Pseudorandomness of Expander Random Walks for Read-Once ACC0 circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expander graphs are among the most useful combinatorial objects in theoretical computer science. A line of work studies random walks on expander graphs for their pseudorandomness against various classes of test functions, including symmetric functions, read-only branching programs, permutation branching programs, and $\mathrm{AC}^0$ circuits. The promising results of pseudorandomness of expander random walks against $\mathrm{AC}^0$ circuits indicate a robustness of expander random walks beyond symmetric functions, motivating the question of whether expander random walks can fool more robust \emph{asymmetric} complexity classes, such as $\mathrm{ACC}^0$. In this work, we make progress towards this question by considering certain two-layered circuit compositions of $\mathrm{MOD}[k]$ gates, where we show that these family of circuits are fooled by expander random walks with total variation distance error $O(\lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the second largest eigenvalue of the underlying expander graph. For $k\geq 3$, these circuits can be highly asymmetric with complicated Fourier characters. In this context, our work takes a step in the direction of fooling more complex asymmetric circuits. Separately, drawing from the learning-theory literature, we construct an explicit threshold circuit in the circuit family $\mathrm{TC}^0$, and show that it \emph{is} fooled by expander random walks, providing an upper bound on the set of functions fooled by expander random walks.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of epimorphism testing with virtually abelian targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Friedl and L\"oh (2021, Confl. Math.) prove that testing whether or not there is an epimorphism from a finitely presented group to a virtually cyclic group, or to the direct product of an abelian and a finite group, is decidable. Here we prove that these problems are $\mathsf{NP}$-complete. We also show that testing epimorphism is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete when the target is a restricted type of semi-direct product of a finitely generated free abelian group and a finite group, thus extending the class of virtually abelian target groups for which decidability of epimorphism is known. Lastly, we consider epimorphism onto a fixed finite group. We show the problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete when the target is a dihedral groups of order that is not a power of 2, complementing the work on Kuperberg and Samperton (2018, Geom. Topol.) who showed the same result when the target is non-abelian finite simple.</description>
