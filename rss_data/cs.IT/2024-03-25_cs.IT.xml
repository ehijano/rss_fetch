      <title>RIS-assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems With Two-Timescale Design and Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system is an effective solution to achieve high system capacity with low cost and power consumption. However, existing works of RIS-assisted systems mostly assumed perfect hardware, while the impact of hardware impairments (HWIs) is generally ignored. In this paper, we consider the general Rician fading channel and uplink transmission of the RIS-assisted CF-mMIMO system under transceiver impairments and RIS phase noise. To reduce the feedback overhead and power consumption, we propose a two-timescale transmission scheme to optimize the passive beamformers at RISs with statistical channel state information (CSI), while transmit beamformers at access points (APs) are designed based on instantaneous CSI. Also, the maximum ratio combining (MRC) detection is applied to the central processing unit (CPU). On this basis, we derive the closed-form approximate expression of the achievable rate, based on which the impact of HWIs and the power scaling laws are analyzed to draw useful theoretical insights. To maximize the users' sum rate or minimum rate, we first transform our rate expression into a tractable form, and then optimize the phase shifts of RISs based on an accelerated gradient ascent method. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the correctness of our derived expressions and validate the previous analysis, which provide some guidelines for the practical application of the imperfect RISs in the CF-mMIMO with transceiver HWIs.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Information Bottleneck for Deterministic Multi-view Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent several years, the information bottleneck (IB) principle provides an information-theoretic framework for deep multi-view clustering (MVC) by compressing multi-view observations while preserving the relevant information of multiple views. Although existing IB-based deep MVC methods have achieved huge success, they rely on variational approximation and distribution assumption to estimate the lower bound of mutual information, which is a notoriously hard and impractical problem in high-dimensional multi-view spaces. In this work, we propose a new differentiable information bottleneck (DIB) method, which provides a deterministic and analytical MVC solution by fitting the mutual information without the necessity of variational approximation. Specifically, we first propose to directly fit the mutual information of high-dimensional spaces by leveraging normalized kernel Gram matrix, which does not require any auxiliary neural estimator to estimate the lower bound of mutual information. Then, based on the new mutual information measurement, a deterministic multi-view neural network with analytical gradients is explicitly trained to parameterize IB principle, which derives a deterministic compression of input variables from different views. Finally, a triplet consistency discovery mechanism is devised, which is capable of mining the feature consistency, cluster consistency and joint consistency based on the deterministic and compact representations. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of our DIB method on 6 benchmarks compared with 13 state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Block Orthogonal Sparse Superposition Codes for $ \sf{L}^3 $ Communications: Low Error Rate, Low Latency, and Low Power Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block orthogonal sparse superposition (BOSS) code is a class of joint coded modulation methods, which can closely achieve the finite-blocklength capacity with a low-complexity decoder at a few coding rates under Gaussian channels. However, for fading channels, the code performance degrades considerably because coded symbols experience different channel fading effects. In this paper, we put forth novel joint demodulation and decoding methods for BOSS codes under fading channels. For a fast fading channel, we present a minimum mean square error approximate maximum a posteriori (MMSE-A-MAP) algorithm for the joint demodulation and decoding when channel state information is available at the receiver (CSIR). We also propose a joint demodulation and decoding method without using CSIR for a block fading channel scenario. We refer to this as the non-coherent sphere decoding (NSD) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that BOSS codes with MMSE-A-MAP decoding outperform CRC-aided polar codes, while NSD decoding achieves comparable performance to quasi-maximum likelihood decoding with significantly reduced complexity. Both decoding algorithms are suitable for parallelization, satisfying low-latency constraints. Additionally, real-time simulations on a software-defined radio testbed validate the feasibility of using BOSS codes for low-power transmission.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Design of Active STAR-RIS-Aided SWIPT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the downlink transmission of a multi-antenna base station (BS) supported by an active simultaneously transmitting and reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) to serve single-antenna users via simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). In this context, we formulate an energy efficiency maximisation problem that jointly optimises the gain, element selection and phase shift matrices of the active STAR-RIS, the transmit beamforming of the BS and the power splitting ratio of the users. With respect to the highly coupled and non-convex form of this problem, an alternating optimisation solution approach is proposed, using tools from convex optimisation and reinforcement learning. Specifically, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), difference of concave functions (DC), and fractional programming techniques are employed to transform the non-convex optimisation problem into a convex form for optimising the BS beamforming vector and the power splitting ratio of the SWIPT. Then, by integrating meta-learning with the modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and soft actor-critical (SAC) methods, a combinatorial reinforcement learning network is developed to optimise the element selection, gain and phase shift matrices of the active STAR-RIS. Our simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation scheme. Furthermore, our proposed active STAR-RIS-based SWIPT system outperforms its passive counterpart by 57% on average.</description>

      <title>Permutation Recovery Problem against Deletion Errors for DNA Data Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to its immense storage density and durability, DNA has emerged as a promising storage medium. However, due to technological constraints, data can only be written onto many short DNA molecules called data blocks that are stored in an unordered way. To handle the unordered nature of DNA data storage systems, a unique address is typically prepended to each data block to form a DNA strand. However, DNA storage systems are prone to errors and generate multiple noisy copies of each strand called DNA reads. Thus, we study the permutation recovery problem against deletions errors for DNA data storage.
  The permutation recovery problem for DNA data storage requires one to reconstruct the addresses or in other words to uniquely identify the noisy reads. By successfully reconstructing the addresses, one can essentially determine the correct order of the data blocks, effectively solving the clustering problem.
  We first show that we can almost surely identify all the noisy reads under certain mild assumptions. We then propose a permutation recovery procedure and analyze its complexity.</description>

      <title>MIMO with Analogue 1-bit Phase Shifters: A Quantum Annealing Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we study the analogue pre/post-coding vector design for a point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with 1-bit phase shifters. Specifically, we focus on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maximization problem which corresponds to a combinatorial NP-hard due to the binary phase resolution. Two classical computation heuristics are proposed i.e., i) an 1-bit real-valued approximation of the optimal digital designs, and ii) an alternating optimization where a Rayleigh quotient problem is solved at each iteration. An iterative quantum annealing (QA)-based heuristic is also investigated, which outperforms classical counterparts and achieves near-optimal performance while ensuring polynomial time complexity. Experimental results in a real-world D-WAVE QA device validate the efficiency of the proposed QA approach.</description>

      <title>On the Secrecy Enhancement of an Integrated Ground-Aerial Network with a Hybrid FSO/THz Feeder Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High altitude platforms (HAPs)-aided terrestrial-aerial communication technology based on free-space optical (FSO) and Terahertz (THz) feeder links has been attracting notable interest recently due to its great potential in reaching a higher data rate and connectivity. Nonetheless, the presence of harsh vertical propagation environments and potential aerial eavesdroppers are two of the main challenges limiting the reliability and security of such a technology. In this work, a secrecy-enhancing scheme for HAP-aided ground-aerial communication is proposed. The considered network consists of HAP-assisted communication between a ground station and a legitimate user under the threat of an aerial and ground eavesdropper. Thus, the proposed scheme leverages (i) HAP diversity by exploiting the presence of multiple flying HAPs and (ii) the use of a hybrid FSO/THz transmission scheme to offer better resilience against eavesdropping attacks. An analytical secrecy outage probability (SOP) expression is derived for the scheme in consideration. Results manifest the notable gain in security of the proposed scheme with respect to both (i) the single-HAP and (ii) THz feeder-based benchmark ones, where the proposed scheme's SOP is decreased by four orders of magnitude using $4$ HAPs with respect to the first benchmark scheme, while a $5$-dB secrecy gain is manifested with respect to the second benchmark one.</description>

      <title>Site-Specific Beam Alignment in 6G via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam alignment (BA) in modern millimeter wave standards such as 5G NR and WiGig (802.11ay) is based on exhaustive and/or hierarchical beam searches over pre-defined codebooks of wide and narrow beams. This approach is slow and bandwidth/power-intensive, and is a considerable hindrance to the wide deployment of millimeter wave bands. A new approach is needed as we move towards 6G. BA is a promising use case for deep learning (DL) in the 6G air interface, offering the possibility of automated custom tuning of the BA procedure for each cell based on its unique propagation environment and user equipment (UE) location patterns. We overview and advocate for such an approach in this paper, which we term site-specific beam alignment (SSBA). SSBA largely eliminates wasteful searches and allows UEs to be found much more quickly and reliably, without many of the drawbacks of other machine learning-aided approaches. We first overview and demonstrate new results on SSBA, then identify the key open challenges facing SSBA.</description>

      <title>Percentile Optimization in Wireless Networks- Part II: Beamforming for Cell-Edge Throughput Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Part I of this two-part paper focused on the formulation of percentile problems, complexity analysis, and development of power control algorithms via the quadratic fractional transform (QFT) and logarithmic fractional transform (LFT) for sum-least-qth-percentile (SLqP) rate maximization problems. In this second part, we first tackle the significantly more challenging problems of optimizing SLqP rate via beamforming in a multiuser, multiple-input multiple-output (MU- MIMO) network to maximize cell-edge throughput. To this end, we first propose an adaptation of the QFT algorithm presented in Part I that enables optimization of the complex-valued multidimensional beamforming weights for the SLqP rate utility function. We also introduce a new class of problems which we term as sum-greatest-qth-percentile weighted mean squared error (SGqP-WMSE) minimization. We show that this class subsumes the well-known sum-weighted mean squared error (WMMSE) minimization and max-WMSE minimization problems. We demonstrate an equivalence between this class of problems and the SLqP rate maximization problems, and show that this correspondence can be exploited to obtain stationary-point solutions for the aforementioned beamforming problem. Next, we develop extensions for the QFT and LFT algorithms from Part I to optimize ergodic long-term average or ergodic SLqP utility. Finally, we also consider related problems which can be solved using the proposed techniques, including hybrid utility functions targeting optimization at specific subsets of users within cellular networks.</description>

      <title>Percentile Optimization in Wireless Networks- Part I: Power Control for Max-Min-Rate to Sum-Rate Maximization (and Everything in Between)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving throughput for cell-edge users through coordinated resource allocation has been a long-standing driver of research in wireless cellular networks. While a variety of wireless resource management problems focus on sum utility, max-min utility and proportional fair utility, these formulations do not explicitly cater to cell-edge users and can, in fact, be disadvantageous to them. In this two-part paper series, we introduce a new class of optimization problems called percentile programs, which allow us to explicitly formulate problems that target lower-percentile throughput optimization for cell-edge users. Part I focuses on the class of least-percentile throughput maximization through power control. This class subsumes the well-known max-min and max-sum-rate optimization problems as special cases. Apart from these two extremes, we show that least-percentile rate programs are non-convex, non-smooth and strongly NP-hard in general for multiuser interference networks, making optimization extremely challenging. We propose cyclic maximization algorithms that transform the original problems into equivalent block-concave forms, thereby enabling guaranteed convergence to stationary points. Comparisons with state-of-the-art optimization algorithms such as successive convex approximation and sequential quadratic programming reveal that our proposed algorithms achieve superior performance while computing solutions orders of magnitude faster.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Hybrid Beamforming with Dynamic On-off Control for Integrated Sensing, Communications, and Powering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the energy-efficient hybrid beamforming design for a multi-functional integrated sensing, communications, and powering (ISCAP) system. In this system, a base station (BS) with a hybrid analog-digital (HAD) architecture sends unified wireless signals to communicate with multiple information receivers (IRs), sense multiple point targets, and wirelessly charge multiple energy receivers (ERs) at the same time. To facilitate the energy-efficient design, we present a novel HAD architecture for the BS transmitter, which allows dynamic on-off control of its radio frequency (RF) chains and analog phase shifters (PSs) through a switch network. We also consider a practical and comprehensive power consumption model for the BS, by taking into account the power-dependent non-linear power amplifier (PA) efficiency, and the on-off non-transmission power consumption model of RF chains and PSs. We jointly design the hybrid beamforming and dynamic on-off control at the BS, aiming to minimize its total power consumption, while guaranteeing the performance requirements on communication rates, sensing Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB), and harvested power levels. The formulation also takes into consideration the per-antenna transmit power constraint and the constant modulus constraints for the analog beamformer at the BS. The resulting optimization problem for ISCAP is highly non-convex. Please refer to the paper for a complete abstract.</description>

      <title>Single-Carrier Delay-Doppler Domain Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For doubly-selective channels, delay-Doppler (DD) modulation, mostly known as orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, enables simultaneous compensation of delay and Doppler shifts. However, OTFS modulated signal has high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) because of its precoding operation performed over the DD domain. In order to deal with this problem, we propose a single-carrier transmission with delay-Doppler domain equalization (SC-DDE). In this system, the discretized time-domain SC signal is converted to the DD domain by discrete Zak transform (DZT) at the receiver side, followed by delay-Doppler domain equalization (DDE). Since equalization is performed in the DD domain, the SC-DDE receiver should acquire the channel delay-Doppler response. To this end, we introduce an embedded pilot-aided channel estimation scheme designed for SC-DDE, which does not affect the peak power property of transmitted signals. Through computer simulation, distribution of PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed system are compared with those of the conventional OTFS and SC with frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE). As a result, our proposed SC-DDE significantly outperforms SC-FDE in terms of BER at the expense of additional computational complexity at the receiver. Furthermore, SC-DDE shows much lower PAPR than OTFS even though they achieve comparable coded BER performance.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Advanced Transceiver Technologies for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accommodate new applications such as extended reality, fully autonomous vehicular networks and the metaverse, next generation wireless networks are going to be subject to much more stringent performance requirements than the fifth-generation (5G) in terms of data rates, reliability, latency, and connectivity. It is thus necessary to develop next generation advanced transceiver (NGAT) technologies for efficient signal transmission and reception. In this tutorial, we explore the evolution of NGAT from three different perspectives. Specifically, we first provide an overview of new-field NGAT technology, which shifts from conventional far-field channel models to new near-field channel models. Then, three new-form NGAT technologies and their design challenges are presented, including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, flexible antennas, and holographic multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. Subsequently, we discuss recent advances in semantic-aware NGAT technologies, which can utilize new metrics for advanced transceiver designs. Finally, we point out other promising transceiver technologies for future research.</description>

Abstract: Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has attracted significant attention in wireless communications, due to its reflecting elements (REs) capable of reflecting incident signals with not only phase shifts but also amplitude amplifications. In this paper, we are interested in active RIS-aided interference channels in which $K$ user pairs share the same time and frequency resources with the aid of active RIS. Thanks to the promising amplitude amplification capability, activating a moderate number of REs, rather than all of them, is sufficient for the active RIS to mitigate cross-channel interferences. Motivated by this, we propose a power-aware sparse reflect beamforming design for the active RIS-aided interference channels, which allows the active RIS to flexibly adjust the number of activated REs for the sake of reducing hardware and power costs. Specifically, we establish the power consumption model in which only those activated REs consume the biasing and operation power that supports the amplitude amplification, yielding an $\ell_0$-norm power consumption function. Based on the proposed model, we investigate a sum-rate maximization problem and an active RIS power minimization problem by carefully designing the sparse reflect beamforming vector. To solve these problems, we first replace the nonconvex $\ell_0$-norm function with an iterative reweighted $\ell_1$-norm function. Then, fractional programming is used to solve the sum-rate maximization, while semidefinite programming together with the difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA) is used to solve the active RIS power minimization. Numerical results show that the proposed sparse designs can notably increase the sum rate of user pairs and decrease the power consumption of active RIS in interference channels.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding Next Generation Multiple Access Using Physical Layer Security Techniques: A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the ever-increasing requirements of ultra-high spectral efficiency, ultra-low latency, and massive connectivity, the forefront of wireless research calls for the design of advanced next generation multiple access schemes to facilitate provisioning of these stringent demands. This inspires the embrace of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in future wireless communication networks. Nevertheless, the support of massive access via NOMA leads to additional security threats, due to the open nature of the air interface, the broadcast characteristic of radio propagation as well as intertwined relationship among paired NOMA users. To address this specific challenge, the superimposed transmission of NOMA can be explored as new opportunities for security aware design, for example, multiuser interference inherent in NOMA can be constructively engineered to benefit communication secrecy and privacy. The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a comprehensive overview on the state-of-the-art physical layer security techniques that guarantee wireless security and privacy for NOMA networks, along with the opportunities, technical challenges, and future research trends.</description>

      <title>BackCom Assisted Hybrid NOMA Uplink Transmission for Ambient IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (H-NOMA) has recently received significant attention as a general framework of multiple access, where both conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and pure NOMA are its special cases. This paper focuses on the application of H-NOMA to ambient Internet of Things (IoT) with energy-constrained devices, where a new backscatter communication (BackCom) assisted H-NOMA uplink scheme is developed. Resource allocation for H-NOMA uplink transmission is also considered, where an overall power minimization problem is formulated. Insightful understandings for the key features of BackCom assisted H-NOMA and its difference from conventional H-NOMA are illustrated by developing analytical results for the two-user special case. For the general multi-user scenario, two algorithms, one based on the branch-bound (BB) principle and the other based on successive convex approximation (SCA), are developed to realize different tradeoffs between the system performance and complexity. The numerical results are also provided to verify the accuracy of the developed analytical results and demonstrate the performance gain of H-NOMA over OMA.</description>

      <title>A Measure of Synergy based on Union Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The partial information decomposition (PID) framework is concerned with decomposing the information that a set of (two or more) random variables (the sources) has about another variable (the target) into three types of information: unique, redundant, and synergistic. Classical information theory alone does not provide a unique way to decompose information in this manner and additional assumptions have to be made. One often overlooked way to achieve this decomposition is using a so-called measure of union information - which quantifies the information that is present in at least one of the sources - from which a synergy measure stems. In this paper, we introduce a new measure of union information based on adopting a communication channel perspective, compare it with existing measures, and study some of its properties. We also include a comprehensive critical review of characterizations of union information and synergy measures that have been proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Design and Performance of Resonant Beam Communications -- Part I: Quasi-Static Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This two-part paper studies a point-to-point resonant beam communication (RBCom) system, where two separately deployed retroreflectors are adopted to generate the resonant beam between the transmitter and the receiver, and analyzes the transmission rate of the considered system under both the quasi-static and mobile scenarios. Part I of this paper focuses on the quasi-static scenario where the locations of the transmitter and the receiver are relatively fixed. Specifically, we propose a new information-bearing scheme which adopts a synchronization-based amplitude modulation method to mitigate the echo interference caused by the reflected resonant beam. With this scheme, we show that the quasi-static RBCom channel is equivalent to a Markov channel and can be further simplified as an amplitude-constrained additive white Gaussian noise channel. Moreover, we develop an algorithm that jointly employs the bisection and exhaustive search to maximize its capacity upper and lower bounds. Finally, numerical results validate our analysis. Part II of this paper discusses the performance of the RBCom system under the mobile scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This two-part paper focuses on the system design and performance analysis for a point-to-point resonant beam communication (RBCom) system under both the quasi-static and mobile scenarios. Part I of this paper proposes a synchronization-based information transmission scheme and derives the capacity upper and lower bounds for the quasi-static channel case. In Part II, we address the mobile scenario, where the receiver is in relative motion to the transmitter, and derive a mobile RBCom channel model that jointly considers the Doppler effect, channel variation, and echo interference. With the obtained channel model, we prove that the channel gain of the mobile RBCom decreases as the number of transmitted frames increases, and thus show that the considered mobile RBCom terminates after the transmitter sends a certain number of frames without frequency compensation. By deriving an upper bound on the number of successfully transmitted frames, we formulate the throughput maximization problem for the considered mobile RBCom system, and solve it via a sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method. Finally, simulation results validate the analysis of our proposed method in some typical scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant beam communications (RBCom), which adopt oscillating photons between two separate retroreflectors for information transmission, exhibit potential advantages over other types of wireless optical communications (WOC). However, echo interference generated by the modulated beam reflected from the receiver affects the transmission of the desired information. To tackle this challenge, a synchronization-based point-to-point RBCom system is proposed to eliminate the echo interference, and the design for the transmitter and receiver is discussed. Subsequently, the performance of the proposed RBCom is evaluated and compared with that of visible light communications (VLC) and free space optical communications (FOC). Finally, future research directions are outlined and several implementation challenges of RBCom systems are highlighted.</description>

      <title>A Progressive Codebook Optimization Scheme for Sparse Code Multiple Access in Downlink Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a promising technique for enabling massive connectivity and high spectrum efficiency in future machine-type communication networks. However, its performance crucially depends on well-designed multi-dimensional codebooks. In this paper, we propose a novel progressive codebook optimization scheme that can achieve near-optimal performance over downlink fading channels. By examining the pair-wise error probability (PEP), we first derive the symbol error rate (SER) performance of the sparse codebook in downlink channels, which is considered as the design criterion for codebook optimization. Then, the benchmark constellation group at a single resource element is optimized with a sequential quadratic programming approach. Next, we propose a constellation group reconstruction process to assign the sub-constellations in each resource element (RE) progressively. For the current RE, the assignment of the sub-constellations is designed by minimizing the error performance of the product distance of the superimposed codewords in previous REs. The design process involves both permutation and labeling of the sub-constellations in the benchmark constellation group. Simulation results show that the proposed codebooks exhibit significant performance gains over state-of-the-art codebooks in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region over various downlink fading channels.</description>

Abstract: In this study, in order to get better codes, we focus on double skew cyclic codes over the ring $\mathrm{R}= \mathbb{F}_q+v\mathbb{F}_q, ~v^2=v$ where $q$ is a prime power. We investigate the generator polynomials, minimal spanning sets, generator matrices, and the dual codes over the ring $\mathrm{R}$. As an implementation, the obtained results are illustrated with some good examples. Moreover, we introduce a construction for new generator matrices and thus achieve codes with better parameters than existing codes in the literature. Finally, we tabulate double skew cyclic codes of block length over the ring $\mathrm{R}$.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna Position Optimization: A Graph-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antennas (FAs) and movable antennas (MAs) have emerged as promising technologies in wireless communications, which offer the flexibility to improve channel conditions by adjusting transmit/receive antenna positions within a spatial region. In this letter, we focus on an MA-enhanced multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system, aiming to optimize the positions of multiple transmit MAs to maximize the received signal power. Unlike the prior works on continuously searching for the optimal MA positions, we propose to sample the transmit region into discrete points, such that the continuous antenna position optimization problem is transformed to a discrete sampling point selection problem based on the point-wise channel information. However, such a point selection problem is combinatory and challenging to be optimally solved. To tackle this challenge, we ingeniously recast it as an equivalent fixed-hop shortest path problem in graph theory and propose a customized algorithm to solve it optimally in polynomial time. To further reduce the complexity, a linear-time sequential update algorithm is also proposed to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can yield considerable performance gains over the conventional fixed-position antennas with/without antenna selection.</description>

Abstract: Near-field propagation, particularly that enabled by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), has emerged as a promising research topic in recent years. However, a comprehensive literature review on RIS-based near-field technologies is still lacking. This article aims to fill this gap by providing a brief overview of near-field concepts and a systematic survey of the state-of-the-art RIS-based near-field technologies. The focus is on three key aspects: the construction of ubiquitous near-field wireless propagation environments using RIS, the enabling of new near-field paradigms for 6G networks through RIS, and the challenges faced by RIS-based near-field technologies. This technical review intends to facilitate the development and innovation of RIS-based near-field technologies.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric inference of higher order interaction patterns in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for obtaining parsimonious decompositions of networks into higher order interactions which can take the form of arbitrary motifs.The method is based on a class of analytically solvable generative models, where vertices are connected via explicit copies of motifs, which in combination with non-parametric priors allow us to infer higher order interactions from dyadic graph data without any prior knowledge on the types or frequencies of such interactions. Crucially, we also consider 'degree--corrected' models that correctly reflect the degree distribution of the network and consequently prove to be a better fit for many real world--networks compared to non-degree corrected models. We test the presented approach on simulated data for which we recover the set of underlying higher order interactions to a high degree of accuracy. For empirical networks the method identifies concise sets of atomic subgraphs from within thousands of candidates that cover a large fraction of edges and include higher order interactions of known structural and functional significance. The method not only produces an explicit higher order representation of the network but also a fit of the network to analytically tractable models opening new avenues for the systematic study of higher order network structures.</description>

      <title>Laplacian-guided Entropy Model in Neural Codec with Blur-dissipated Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While replacing Gaussian decoders with a conditional diffusion model enhances the perceptual quality of reconstructions in neural image compression, their lack of inductive bias for image data restricts their ability to achieve state-of-the-art perceptual levels. To address this limitation, we adopt a non-isotropic diffusion model at the decoder side. This model imposes an inductive bias aimed at distinguishing between frequency contents, thereby facilitating the generation of high-quality images. Moreover, our framework is equipped with a novel entropy model that accurately models the probability distribution of latent representation by exploiting spatio-channel correlations in latent space, while accelerating the entropy decoding step. This channel-wise entropy model leverages both local and global spatial contexts within each channel chunk. The global spatial context is built upon the Transformer, which is specifically designed for image compression tasks. The designed Transformer employs a Laplacian-shaped positional encoding, the learnable parameters of which are adaptively adjusted for each channel cluster. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework yields better perceptual quality compared to cutting-edge generative-based codecs, and the proposed entropy model contributes to notable bitrate savings.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Treatment of Animal Movement Tracks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional track of an animal on a landscape has progressed over the past three decades from hourly to second-by-second recordings of locations. Track segmentation methods for analyzing the behavioral information in such relocation data has lagged somewhat behind, with scales of analysis currently at the sub-hourly to minute level. A new approach is needed to bring segmentation analysis down to a second-by-second level. Here, such an approach is presented that rests heavily on concepts from Shannon's Information Theory. In this paper, we first briefly review and update concepts relating to movement path segmentation. We then discuss how cluster analysis can be used to organize the smallest viable statistical movement elements (StaMEs), which are $\mu$ steps long, and to code the next level of movement elements called ``words'' that are $m \mu$ steps long. Centroids of these word clusters are identified as canonical activity modes (CAMs). Unlike current segmentation schemes, the approach presented here allows us to provide entropy measures for movement paths, compute the coding efficiencies of derived StaMEs and CAMs, and assess error rates in the allocation of strings of $m$ StaMEs to CAM types. In addition our approach allows us to employ the Jensen-Shannon divergence measure to assess and compare the best choices for the various parameters (number of steps in a StaME, number of StaME types, number of StaMEs in a word, number of CAM types), as well as the best clustering methods for generating segments that can then be used to interpret and predict sequences of higher order segments. The theory presented here provides another tool in our toolbox for dealing with the effects of global change on the movement and redistribution of animals across altered landscapes</description>

Abstract: Categories of lenses/optics and Dialectica categories are both comprised of bidirectional morphisms of basically the same form. In this work we show how they can be considered a special case of an overarching fibrational construction, generalizing Hofstra's construction of Dialectica fibrations and Spivak's construction of generalized lenses. This construction turns a tower of Grothendieck fibrations into another tower of fibrations by iteratively twisting each of the components, using the opposite fibration construction.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Remote Estimation of Multiple Markov Sources Under Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies semantic-aware communication for remote estimation of multiple Markov sources over a lossy and rate-constrained channel. Unlike most existing studies that treat all source states equally, we exploit the semantics of information and consider that the remote actuator has different tolerances for the estimation errors of different states. We aim to find an optimal scheduling policy that minimizes the long-term state-dependent costs of estimation errors under a transmission frequency constraint. We theoretically show the structure of the optimal policy by leveraging the average-cost Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) theory and the Lagrangian dynamic programming. By exploiting the optimal structural results, we develop a novel policy search algorithm, termed intersection search plus relative value iteration (Insec-RVI), that can find the optimal policy using only a few iterations. To avoid the ``curse of dimensionality'' of MDPs, we propose an online low-complexity drift-plus-penalty (DPP) scheduling algorithm based on the Lyapunov optimization theorem. We also design an efficient average-cost Q-learning algorithm to estimate the optimal policy without knowing a priori the channel and source statistics. Numerical results show that continuous transmission is inefficient, and remarkably, our semantic-aware policies can attain the optimum by strategically utilizing fewer transmissions by exploiting the timing of the important information.</description>

      <title>Optimality of spherical codes via exact semidefinite programming bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the spectral embeddings of all known triangle-free strongly regular graphs are optimal spherical codes (the new cases are $56$ points in $20$ dimensions, $50$ points in $21$ dimensions, and $77$ points in $21$ dimensions), as are certain mutually unbiased basis arrangements constructed using Kerdock codes in up to $1024$ dimensions (namely, $2^{4k} + 2^{2k+1}$ points in $2^{2k}$ dimensions for $2 \le k \le 5$). As a consequence of the latter, we obtain optimality of the Kerdock binary codes of block length $64$, $256$, and $1024$, as well as uniqueness for block length $64$. We also prove universal optimality for $288$ points on a sphere in $16$ dimensions. To prove these results, we use three-point semidefinite programming bounds, for which only a few sharp cases were known previously. To obtain rigorous results, we develop improved techniques for rounding approximate solutions of semidefinite programs to produce exact optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>On the Maximum Theta Series over Unimodular Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theta series of a lattice has been extensively studied in the literature and is closely related to a critical quantity widely used in the fields of physical layer security and cryptography, known as the flatness factor, or equivalently, the smoothing parameter of a lattice. Both fields raise the fundamental question of determining the (globally) maximum theta series over a particular set of volume-one lattices, namely, the stable lattices.
  In this work, we present a property of unimodular lattices, a subfamily of stable lattices, to verify that the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ achieves the largest possible value of theta series over the set of unimodular lattices. Such a result moves towards proving the conjecture recently stated by Regev and Stephens-Davidowitz: any unimodular lattice, except for those lattices isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, has a strictly smaller theta series than that of $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. Our techniques are mainly based on studying the ratio of the theta series of a unimodular lattice to the theta series of $\mathbb{Z}^n$, called the secrecy ratio. We relate the Regev and Stephens-Davidowitz conjecture with another conjecture for unimodular lattices, known in the literature as the Belfiore-Sol{\'e} conjecture. The latter assumes that the secrecy ratio of any unimodular lattice has a symmetry point, which is exactly where the global minimum of the secrecy ratio is achieved.</description>

      <title>The Sample Complexity of Simple Binary Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sample complexity of simple binary hypothesis testing is the smallest number of i.i.d. samples required to distinguish between two distributions $p$ and $q$ in either: (i) the prior-free setting, with type-I error at most $\alpha$ and type-II error at most $\beta$; or (ii) the Bayesian setting, with Bayes error at most $\delta$ and prior distribution $(\alpha, 1-\alpha)$. This problem has only been studied when $\alpha = \beta$ (prior-free) or $\alpha = 1/2$ (Bayesian), and the sample complexity is known to be characterized by the Hellinger divergence between $p$ and $q$, up to multiplicative constants. In this paper, we derive a formula that characterizes the sample complexity (up to multiplicative constants that are independent of $p$, $q$, and all error parameters) for: (i) all $0 \le \alpha, \beta \le 1/8$ in the prior-free setting; and (ii) all $\delta \le \alpha/4$ in the Bayesian setting. In particular, the formula admits equivalent expressions in terms of certain divergences from the Jensen--Shannon and Hellinger families. The main technical result concerns an $f$-divergence inequality between members of the Jensen--Shannon and Hellinger families, which is proved by a combination of information-theoretic tools and case-by-case analyses. We explore applications of our results to robust and distributed (locally-private and communication-constrained) hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Relative Representations for Goal-Oriented Semantic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In future 6G wireless networks, semantic and effectiveness aspects of communications will play a fundamental role, incorporating meaning and relevance into transmissions. However, obstacles arise when devices employ diverse languages, logic, or internal representations, leading to semantic mismatches that might jeopardize understanding. In latent space communication, this challenge manifests as misalignment within high-dimensional representations where deep neural networks encode data. This paper presents a novel framework for goal-oriented semantic communication, leveraging relative representations to mitigate semantic mismatches via latent space alignment. We propose a dynamic optimization strategy that adapts relative representations, communication parameters, and computation resources for energy-efficient, low-latency, goal-oriented semantic communications. Numerical results demonstrate our methodology's effectiveness in mitigating mismatches among devices, while optimizing energy consumption, delay, and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Massive Uncoordinated Multiple Access for Beyond 5G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.00098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing wireless communication systems have been mainly designed to provide substantial gain in terms of data rates. However, 5G and Beyond will depart from this scheme, with the objective not only to provide services with higher data rates. One of the main goals is to support massive machine-type communications (mMTC) in the IoT applications. Supporting massive uplink (UP) communications for devices with sporadic traffic pattern and short-packet size, as it is in many mMTC use cases, is a challenging task, particularly when the control signaling is not negligible in size compared to the payload. Also, channel estimation is challenging for sporadic and short-packet transmission due to the limited number of employed pilots. In this paper, a new UP multiple access (MA) scheme is proposed for mMTC, which can support a large number of uncoordinated IoT devices with short-packet and sporadic traffic. The proposed UP MA scheme removes the overheads associated with the device identifier as well as pilots related to channel estimation. An alternative mechanism for device identification is proposed, where a unique spreading code is dedicated to each IoT device. This unique code is simultaneously used for the spreading purpose and device identification. Two IoT device identification algorithms which employ sparse signal reconstruction methods are proposed to determine the active IoT devices prior to data detection. Specifically, the BIC model order selection method is employed to develop an IoT device identification algorithm for unknown and time-varying probability of device activity. Our proposed MA scheme benefits from a non-coherent multiuser detection algorithm based on machine learning to enable data detection without a priori knowledge on channel state information. The effectiveness of the proposed MA scheme for known and unknown probability of activity is supported by simulation results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.10566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose efficient and low-complexity multiuser detection (MUD) algorithms for Gaussian multiple access channel (G-MAC) for short-packet transmission in massive machine type communications. To do so, we first formulate the G-MAC MUD problem as a sparse signal recovery problem and obtain the exact and approximate joint prior distribution of the sparse vector to be recovered. Then, we employ the Bayesian approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms with the optimal separable and non-separable minimum mean squared error (MMSE) denoisers for soft decoding of the sparse vector. The effectiveness of the proposed MUD algorithms for a large number of devices is supported by simulation results. For packets of 8 information bits, while the state-of-the-art AMP with soft-threshold denoising achieves 8/100 of the upper bound at Eb/N0 = 4 dB, the proposed algorithms reach 4/7 and 1/2 of the upper bound.</description>

      <title>Coded Caching with Shared Caches and Private Caches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the coded caching problem in a setting where the users are simultaneously endowed with a private cache and a shared cache. The setting consists of a server connected to a set of users, assisted by a smaller number of helper nodes that are equipped with their own storage. In addition to the helper cache, each user possesses a dedicated cache which is also used to prefetch file contents. Each helper cache can serve an arbitrary number of users, but each user gets served by only one helper cache. We consider two scenarios: (a) the server has no prior information about the user-to-helper cache association, and (b) the server knows the user-to-helper cache association at the placement phase itself. We design centralized coded caching schemes under uncoded placement for the above two settings. For case (b), two schemes are proposed that are optimal in certain memory regimes. Further, a cut-set based lower bound is derived and used to show that one of the proposed schemes for case (b) is optimal in certain memory regime.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Performance Analysis for Movable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel antenna architecture called movable antenna (MA) to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) that undergo random wireless channel variation, the MAs with the capability of flexible movement can be deployed at positions with more favorable channel conditions to achieve higher spatial diversity gains. To characterize the general multi-path channel in a given region or field where the MAs are deployed, a field-response model is developed by leveraging the amplitude, phase, and angle of arrival/angle of departure (AoA/AoD) information on each of the multiple channel paths under the far-field condition. Based on this model, we then analyze the maximum channel gain achieved by a single receive MA as compared to its FPA counterpart in both deterministic and stochastic channels. First, in the deterministic channel case, we show the periodic behavior of the multi-path channel gain in a given spatial field, which can be exploited for analyzing the maximum channel gain of the MA. Next, in the case of stochastic channels, the expected value of an upper bound on the maximum channel gain of the MA in an infinitely large receive region is derived for different numbers of channel paths. The approximate cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the maximum channel gain is also obtained in closed form, which is useful to evaluate the outage probability of the MA system. Moreover, our results reveal that higher performance gains by the MA over the FPA can be acquired when the number of channel paths increases due to more pronounced small-scale fading effects in the spatial domain. Numerical examples are presented which validate our analytical results and demonstrate that the MA system can reap considerable performance gains over the conventional FPA systems with/without antenna selection (AS).</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna Enhanced Multiuser Communication via Antenna Position Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is a promising technology to improve wireless communication performance by varying the antenna position in a given finite area at the transceivers to create more favorable channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the MA-enhanced multiple-access channel (MAC) for the uplink transmission from multiple users each equipped with a single MA to a base station (BS) with a fixed-position antenna (FPA) array. A field-response based channel model is used to characterize the multi-path channel between the antenna array of the BS and each user's MA with a flexible position. To evaluate the MAC performance gain provided by MAs, we formulate an optimization problem for minimizing the total transmit power of users, subject to a minimum-achievable-rate requirement for each user, where the positions of MAs and the transmit powers of users, as well as the receive combining matrix of the BS are jointly optimized. To solve this non-convex optimization problem involving intricately coupled variables, we develop two algorithms based on zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) combining methods, respectively. Specifically, for each algorithm, the combining matrix of the BS and the total transmit power of users are expressed as a function of the MAs' position vectors, which are then optimized by using the proposed multi-directional descent (MDD) framework. It is shown that the proposed ZF-based and MMSE-based MDD algorithms can converge to high-quality suboptimal solutions with low computational complexities. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solutions for MA-enhanced multiple access systems can significantly decrease the total transmit power of users as compared to conventional FPA systems employing antenna selection under both perfect and imperfect field-response information.</description>

Abstract: This paper analyzes the performance of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-inspired multi-cell wideband single-hop backhaul millimeter-wave-in-band-full-duplex (IBFD)-integrated access and backhaul (IAB) networks by using stochastic geometry. We model the wired-connected Next Generation NodeBs (gNBs) as the Mat\'ern hard-core point process (MHCPP) to meet the real-world deployment requirement and reduce the cost caused by wired connection in the network. We first derive association probabilities that reflect how likely the typical user-equipment is served by a gNB or an IAB-node based on the maximum long-term averaged biased-received-desired-signal power criteria. Further, by leveraging the composite Gamma-Lognormal distribution, we derive the closed-form signal to interference plus noise ratio coverage, capacity with outage, and ergodic capacity of the network. In order to avoid underestimating the noise, we consider the sidelobe gain on inter-cell interference links and the analog to digital converter quantization noise. Compared with the half-duplex transmission, numerical results show an enhanced capacity with outage and ergodic capacity provided by IBFD under successful self-interference cancellation. We also study how the power bias and density ratio of the IAB-node to gNB, and the hard-core distance can affect system performances.</description>

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology is a recent development that fully exploits the wireless channel spatial variation in a confined region by enabling local movement of the antenna. Specifically, the positions of antennas at the transmitter and/or receiver can be dynamically changed to obtain better channel conditions for improving the communication performance. In this article, we first provide an overview of the promising applications for MA-aided wireless communication. Then, we present the hardware architecture and channel characterization for MA systems, based on which the variation of the channel gain with respect to the MA's position is illustrated. Furthermore, we analyze the performance advantages of MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas, in terms of signal power improvement, interference mitigation, flexible beamforming, and spatial multiplexing. Finally, we discuss the main design challenges and their potential solutions for MA-aided communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the search for highly efficient decoders for short LDPC codes approaching maximum likelihood performance, a relayed decoding strategy, specifically activating the ordered statistics decoding process upon failure of a neural min-sum decoder, is enhanced by instilling three innovations. Firstly, soft information gathered at each step of the neural min-sum decoder is leveraged to forge a new reliability measure using a convolutional neural network. This measure aids in constructing the most reliable basis of ordered statistics decoding, bolstering the decoding process by excluding error-prone bits or concentrating them in a smaller area. Secondly, an adaptive ordered statistics decoding process is introduced, guided by a derived decoding path comprising prioritized blocks, each containing distinct test error patterns. The priority of these blocks is determined from the statistical data during the query phase. Furthermore, effective complexity management methods are devised by adjusting the decoding path's length or refining constraints on the involved blocks. Thirdly, a simple auxiliary criterion is introduced to reduce computational complexity by minimizing the number of candidate codewords before selecting the optimal estimate. Extensive experimental results and complexity analysis strongly support the proposed framework, demonstrating its advantages in terms of high throughput, low complexity, independence from noise variance, in addition to superior decoding performance.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna Array Enhanced Beamforming: Achieving Full Array Gain with Null Steering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional beamforming with fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays has a fundamental trade-off between maximizing the signal power (array gain) over a desired direction and simultaneously minimizing the interference power over undesired directions. To overcome this limitation, this letter investigates the movable antenna (MA) array enhanced beamforming by exploiting the new degree of freedom (DoF) via antenna position optimization, in addition to the design of antenna weights. We show that by jointly optimizing the antenna positions vector (APV) and antenna weights vector (AWV) of a linear MA array, the full array gain can be achieved over the desired direction while null steering can be realized over all undesired directions, under certain numbers of MAs and null-steering directions. The optimal solutions for AWV and APV are derived in closed form, which reveal that the optimal AWV for MA arrays requires only the signal phase adjustment with a fixed amplitude. Numerical results validate our analytical solutions for MA array beamforming and show their superior performance to the conventional beamforming techniques with FPA arrays.</description>

      <title>Modulation and Estimation with a Helper</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of transmitting a parameter value over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is considered, where, in addition to the transmitter and the receiver, there is a helper that observes the noise non-causally and provides a description of limited rate $R_h$ to the transmitter and/or the receiver. We derive upper and lower bounds on the optimal achievable $\alpha$-th moment of the estimation error and show that they coincide for small values of $\alpha$ and for high values of $R_h$. The upper bound relies on a recently proposed channel-coding scheme that effectively conveys $R_h$ bits essentially error-free and the rest of the rate - over the same AWGN channel without help, with the error-free bits being allocated to the most significant bits of the quantized parameter. We then concentrate on the setting with a total transmit energy constraint, for which we derive achievability results for both channel coding and parameter modulation for several scenarios: when the helper assists only the transmitter or only the receiver and knows the noise, and when the helper assists the transmitter and/or the receiver and knows both the noise and the message. In particular, for the message-informed helper that assists both the receiver and the transmitter, it is shown that the error probability in the channel-coding task decays doubly exponentially. Finally, we translate these results to those for continuous-time power-limited AWGN channels with unconstrained bandwidth. As a byproduct, we show that the capacity with a message-informed helper that is available only at the transmitter can exceed the sum of the capacity without help and the help rate $R_h$, when the helper knows only the noise but not the message.</description>

      <title>Computation-Limited Signals: A Channel Capacity Regime Constrained by Computational Complexity</title>

Abstract: In this letter, we introduce the computational-limited (comp-limited) signals, a communication capacity regime in which the signal time computational complexity overhead is the key constraint -- rather than power or bandwidth -- to the overall communication capacity. We present the Spectro-Computational (SC) analysis, a novel mathematical framework that enhances classic concepts of information theory -- such as throughput, spectral efficiency and capacity -- to account for the signal processing computational complexity overhead. We consider a specific Shannon regime under which capacity is expected to get arbitrarily large as channel resources grow. Under that regime, we identify the conditions under which the time complexity overhead causes capacity to decrease rather than increasing, thereby creating the case for the comp-limited regime. We also provide examples of the SC analysis and show the OFDM waveform is comp-limited unless the lower-bound computational complexity of the $N$-point DFT problem verifies as $\Omega(N)$, which remains an open challenge.</description>

Abstract: Radio maps provide radio frequency metrics, such as the received signal strength, at every location of a geographic area. These maps, which are estimated using a set of measurements collected at multiple positions, find a wide range of applications in wireless communications, including the prediction of coverage holes, network planning, resource allocation, and path planning for mobile robots. Although a vast number of estimators have been proposed, the theoretical understanding of the radio map estimation (RME) problem has not been addressed. The present work aims at filling this gap along two directions. First, the complexity of the set of radio map functions is quantified by means of lower and upper bounds on their spatial variability, which offers valuable insight into the required spatial distribution of measurements and the estimators that can be used. Second, the reconstruction error for power maps in free space is upper bounded for three conventional spatial interpolators. The proximity coefficient, which is a decreasing function of the distance from the transmitters to the mapped region, is proposed to quantify the complexity of the RME problem. Numerical experiments assess the tightness of the obtained bounds and the validity of the main takeaways in complex environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent surfaces (ISs) have emerged as a key technology to empower a wide range of appealing applications for wireless networks, due to their low cost, high energy efficiency, flexibility of deployment and capability of constructing favorable wireless channels/radio environments. Moreover, the recent advent of several new IS architectures further expanded their electromagnetic functionalities from passive reflection to active amplification, simultaneous reflection and refraction, as well as holographic beamforming. However, the research on ISs is still in rapid progress and there have been recent technological advances in ISs and their emerging applications that are worthy of a timely review. Thus, we provide in this paper a comprehensive survey on the recent development and advances of ISs aided wireless networks. Specifically, we start with an overview on the anticipated use cases of ISs in future wireless networks such as 6G, followed by a summary of the recent standardization activities related to ISs. Then, the main design issues of the commonly adopted reflection-based IS and their state-of-the-art solutions are presented in detail, including reflection optimization, deployment, signal modulation, wireless sensing, and integrated sensing and communications. Finally, recent progress and new challenges in advanced IS architectures are discussed to inspire futrue research.</description>

      <title>Finite-Precision Arithmetic Transceiver for Massive MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient implementation of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transceivers is essential for the next-generation wireless networks. To reduce the high computational complexity of the massive MIMO transceiver, in this paper, we propose a new massive MIMO architecture using finite-precision arithmetic. First, we conduct the rounding error analysis and derive the lower bound of the achievable rate for single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) using maximal ratio combining (MRC) and multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems using maximal ratio transmission (MRT) with finite-precision arithmetic. Then, considering the multi-user scenario, the rounding error analysis of zero-forcing (ZF) detection and precoding is derived by using the normal equations (NE) method. The corresponding lower bounds of the achievable sum rate are also derived and asymptotic analyses are presented. Built upon insights from these analyses and lower bounds, we propose a mixed-precision architecture for massive MIMO systems to offset performance gaps due to finite-precision arithmetic. The corresponding analysis of rounding errors and computational costs is obtained. Simulation results validate the derived bounds and underscore the superiority of the proposed mixed-precision architecture to the conventional structure.</description>

      <title>The geodesic dispersion phenomenon in random fields dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random fields are ubiquitous mathematical structures in physics, with applications ranging from thermodynamics and statistical physics to quantum field theory and cosmology. Recent works on information geometry of Gaussian random fields proposed mathematical expressions for the components of the metric tensor of the underlying parametric space, allowing the computation of the curvature in each point of the manifold. In this study, our hypothesis is that time irreversibility in Gaussian random fields dynamics is a direct consequence of geometric properties (curvature) of their parametric space. In order to validate this hypothesis, we compute the components of the metric tensor and derive the twenty seven Christoffel symbols of the metric to define the Euler-Lagrange equations, a system of partial differential equations that are used to build geodesic curves in Riemannian manifolds. After that, by the application of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, we numerically build geodesic curves starting from an arbitrary initial point in the manifold. The obtained results show that, when the system undergoes phase transitions, the geodesic curve obtained by time reversing the computational simulation diverges from the original curve, showing a strange effect that we called the geodesic dispersion phenomenon, which suggests that time irreversibility in random fields is related to the intrinsic geometry of their parametric space.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the problems of interference prediction and sensing for efficient spectrum access and link adaptation. The considered approach for interference prediction relies on a parametric model. However, we assume that the number of observations available to learn theses parameters is limited. This implies that they should be treated as random variables rather than fixed values. We show how this can impact the spectrum access and link adaptation strategies. We also introduce the notion of "interferer-coherence time" to establish the number of independent interferer state realizations experienced by a codeword. We explain how it can be computed taking into account the model uncertainty and how this impacts the link adaptation.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Transmitting and Reflecting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Empowered Cooperative Rate Splitting with User Relaying</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we unveil the advantages of synergizing cooperative rate splitting (CRS) with user relaying and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR RIS). Specifically, we propose a novel STAR RIS-assisted CRS transmission framework, featuring six unique transmission modes that leverage various combination of the relaying protocols (including full duplex-FD and half duplex-HD) and the STAR RIS configuration protocols (including energy splitting-ES, mode switching-MS, and time splitting-TS). With the objective of maximizing the minimum user rate, we then propose a unified successive convex approximation (SCA)-based alternative optimization (AO) algorithm to jointly optimize the transmit active beamforming, common rate allocation, STAR RIS passive beamforming, as well as time allocation (for HD or TS protocols) subject to the transmit power constraint at the base station (BS) and the law of energy conservation at the STAR RIS. To alleviate the computational burden, we further propose a low-complexity algorithm that incorporates a closed-form passive beamforming design. Numerical results show that our proposed framework significantly enhances user fairness compared with conventional CRS schemes without STAR RIS or other STAR RIS empowered multiple access schemes. Moreover, the proposed low-complexity algorithm dramatically reduces the computational complexity while achieving very close performance to the AO method.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Semantic-Bit Coexisting Communication System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is emerging as a key technology for future sixth-generation (6G) systems. Unlike traditional bit-level communication (BitCom), SemCom directly optimizes performance at the semantic level, leading to superior communication efficiency. Nevertheless, the task-oriented nature of SemCom renders it challenging to completely replace BitCom. Consequently, it is desired to consider a semantic-bit coexisting communication system, where a base station (BS) serves SemCom users (sem-users) and BitCom users (bit-users) simultaneously. Such a system faces severe and heterogeneous inter-user interference. In this context, this paper provides a new semantic-bit coexisting communication framework and proposes a spatial beamforming scheme to accommodate both types of users. Specifically, we consider maximizing the semantic rate for semantic users while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for bit-users. Due to the intractability of obtaining the exact closed-form expression of the semantic rate, a data driven method is first applied to attain an approximated expression via data fitting. With the resulting complex transcendental function, majorization minimization (MM) is adopted to convert the original formulated problem into a multiple-ratio problem, which allows fractional programming (FP) to be used to further transform the problem into an inhomogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQP) problem. Solving the problem leads to a semi-closed form solution with undetermined Lagrangian factors that can be updated by a fixed point algorithm. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beamforming scheme significantly outperforms conventional beamforming algorithms such as zero-forcing (ZF), maximum ratio transmission (MRT), and weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE).</description>

      <title>Novel one-shot inner bounds for unassisted fully quantum channels via rate splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.01766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the first non-trivial one-shot inner bounds for sending quantum information over an entanglement unassisted two-sender quantum multiple access channel (QMAC) and an unassisted two-sender two-receiver quantum interference channel (QIC). Previous works only studied the unassisted QMAC in the limit of many independent and identical uses of the channel also known as the asymptotic iid limit, and did not study the unassisted QIC at all. We employ two techniques, rate splitting and successive cancellation}, in order to obtain our inner bound. Rate splitting was earlier used to obtain inner bounds, avoiding time sharing, for classical channels in the asymptotic iid setting. Our main technical contribution is to extend rate splitting from the classical asymptotic iid setting to the quantum one-shot setting. In the asymptotic iid limit our one-shot inner bound for QMAC approaches the rate region of Yard, Devetak and Hayden. For the QIC we get novel non-trivial rate regions in the asymptotic iid setting. All our results also extend to the case where limited entanglement assistance is provided, in both one-shot and asymptotic iid settings. The limited entanglement results for one-setting for both QMAC and QIC are new. For the QIC the limited entanglement results are new even in the asymptotic iid setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove asymptotic results for a modification of the cross-entropy estimator originally introduced by Ziv and Merhav in the Markovian setting in 1993. Our results concern a more general class of decoupled measures on shift spaces over a finite alphabet and in particular imply strong asymptotic consistency of the modified estimator for all pairs of functions of stationary, irreducible, finite-state Markov chains satisfying a mild decay condition. Our approach is based on the study of a rescaled cumulant-generating function called the cross-entropic pressure, importing to information theory some techniques from the study of large deviations within the thermodynamic formalism.</description>
