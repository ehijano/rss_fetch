      <title>Asymptotically exact dimension reduction of functionally graded anisotropic rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study utilizes the variational-asymptotic method to establish a one-dimensional theory for functionally graded rods characterized by general anisotropy from the three-dimensional elasticity theory. A distinctive feature of this dimension reduction procedure is the numerical solution of dual cross-sectional problems, which provide rigorous upper and lower bounds for the average transverse energy density. By employing the Prager-Synge identity, we derive an error estimate in the energetic norm to establish the asymptotic exactness of the model. Furthermore, the dynamic validity of the theory is demonstrated by comparing the one-dimensional dispersion relations with exact analytical three-dimensional solutions for wave propagation in composite rods. The results show that the developed one-dimensional model captures the long-wave asymptotic behavior of the three-dimensional elastic body with high fidelity.</description>

      <title>Visualization of cylindrical resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of cylindrical resonators is part of standard physics curricula but, unlike for their rectangular counterpart, their mode structure is hardly ever visualized. The aim of this work is to show a way of doing it, providing a set of interactive web applications and citing potential use cases in the form of both academic courses and published research. These cover several branches of physics and engineering, showing that these materials can be useful for a broad audience.</description>

      <title>On material-uniform elastic bodies with disclinations and their homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we define material-uniform hyperelastic bodies (in the sense of Noll) containing discrete disclinations and dislocations, and study their properties. We show in a rigorous way that the size of a disclination is limited by the symmetries of the constitutive relation; in particular, if the symmetry group of the body is discrete, it cannot admit arbitrarily small, yet non-zero, disclinations. We then discuss the application of these observations to the derivations of models of bodies with continuously-distributed defects.</description>

      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Textbook Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06651v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of an RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing textbook model \cite{ZhigarevBook, Gevorgian2015}, interpret them and provide understanding of them. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>
