      <title>Turbulence, Waves, and Taylor's Hypothesis for Heliosheath Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field fluctuations measured in the heliosheath by the Voyager spacecraft are often characterized as compressible, as indicated by a strong fluctuating component parallel to the mean magnetic field. However, the interpretation of the turbulence data faces the caveat that the standard Taylor hypothesis is invalid because the solar wind flow velocity in the heliosheath becomes subsonic and slower than the fast magnetosonic speed, given the contributions from hot pickup ions in the heliosheath. We attempt to overcome this caveat by introducing a 4D frequency wavenumber spectral modeling of turbulence, which is essentially a decomposition of different wave modes following their respective dispersion relations. Isotropic Alfven and fast mode turbulence are considered to represent the heliosheath fluctuations. We also include two dispersive fast wave modes derived from a three-fluid theory. We find that (1) magnetic fluctuations in the inner heliosheath are less compressible than previously thought. An isotropic turbulence spectral model with about 1/4 in compressible fluctuation power is consistent with the observed magnetic compressibility in the heliosheath; (2) the hot pickup ion component and the relatively cold solar wind ions induce two dispersive fast magnetosonic wave branches in the perpendicular propagation limit. Pickup ion fast wave may account for the spectral bump near the proton gyrofrequency in the observable spectrum; (3) it is possible that the turbulence wavenumber spectrum is not Kolmogorov-like although the observed frequency spectrum has a -5/3 power law index, depending on the partitioning of power among the various wave modes, and this partitioning may change with wavenumber.</description>

      <title>Spurious Solar-Wind Effects on Acceleration Noise in LISA Pathfinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spurious solar-wind effects are a potential noise source in the measurements of the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Comparative models are used to predict the possible impact of this noise factor and estimate spurious solar-wind effects on acceleration noise in LISA Pathfinder (LPF). Data from NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), situated at the L1 Lagrange point, served as a reliable source of solar-wind data. The data sets were compared over the 114-day time period from March 1, 2016 to June 23, 2016. To evaluate these effects, the data from both satellites were formatted, gap-filled, and adapted for comparison, and a coherence plot comparing the results of the Fast Fourier Transformations. The coherence plot suggested that solar-wind had a minuscule effect on the LPF, and higher frequency coherence (LISA's main observing band) can be attributed to random chance correlation. This result indicates that measurable correlation due to solar-wind noise over 3-month timescales can be ruled out as a noise source. This is encouraging, although another source of noise from the sun, solar irradiance pressure, is estimated to have a more significant effect and has yet to be analyzed.</description>
