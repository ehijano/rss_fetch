      <title>Fast and accurate parameter estimation of high-redshift sources with the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein Telescope (ET), along with other third-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, will be a key instrument for detecting GWs in the coming decades. However, analyzing the data and estimating source parameters will be challenging, especially given the large number of expected detections - of order $10^5$ per year - which makes current methods based on stochastic sampling impractical. In this work, we use Dingo-IS to perform Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) of high-redshift events detectable with ET in its triangular configuration. NPE is a likelihood-free inference technique that leverages normalizing flows to approximate posterior distributions. After training, inference is fast, requiring only a few minutes per source, and accurate, as corrected through importance sampling and validated against standard Bayesian inference methods. To confirm previous findings on the ability to estimate parameters for high-redshift sources with ET, we compare NPE results with predictions from the Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We find that FIM underestimates sky localization errors substantially for most sources, as it does not capture the multimodalities in sky localization introduced by the geometry of the triangular detector. FIM also overestimates the uncertainty in luminosity distance by a factor of $\sim 3$ on average when the injected luminosity distance is $d^{\mathrm{inj}}_{\mathrm{L}} &gt; 10^5~$Mpc, further confirming that ET will be particularly well suited for studying the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Search for the Optical Counterpart of Einstein Probe Discovered Fast X-ray Transients from Lulin Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The launch of the Einstein Probe (EP) mission has revolutionized the detection and follow-up observations of fast X-ray transients (FXTs) by providing prompt and timely access to their precise localizations. In the first year of its operation, the EP mission reports the discovery of 72 high signal-to-noise FXTs. Subjected to the visibility in the sky and weather conditions, we search for the optical counterparts of 42 EP-discovered FXTs from the Lulin observatory. We successfully detect the optical counterparts of 12 FXTs, and five of those are first discovered by us from the Lulin observatory. We find that the optical counterparts are generally faint (r&gt;20 mag) and decline rapidly (&gt;0.5 mag per day). We also find that 11 out of 42 FXTs had shown direct evidence of their association with Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) through significant temporal and spatial overlapping. Furthermore, the luminosities and redshifts of FXTs with confirm optical counterparts in our observations are fully consistent with the faintest end of the GRB population. However, the non-detection of any associated optical counterpart with a significant fraction of FXTs suggests that EP FXTs are likely a subset of so-called `Dark' FXTs, similar to `Dark' GRBs. Additionally, the luminosities of two FXTs were also consistent with jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs). However, their luminosities differ significantly from those of typical supernova shock breakout or kilonova emissions. Thus, we conclude that a significant fraction of EP-discovered FXTs are associated with events having relativistic jets; either a GRB or a jetted TDE.</description>

      <title>The inner structure and thermodynamics of a thin accretion disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with electron and proton thermodynamics, we probe the inner radial and vertical structure of weakly magnetized geometrically thin accretion discs around rapidly spinning black holes. We find that the thin, cold disc transitions to a thick, hot accretion flow at a radius dependent on the mass accretion rate. At high accretion rates, the disc truncates close to the innermost stable circular orbit $r\approx2r_g$, demonstrating that even in the canonical thin disc model, the plunging region should be treated with two-temperature physics. At intermediate accretion rates, the transition radius moves outward by a factor of two to $r\approx 5r_g$, forming a radiatively inefficient inner flow. The simulations also reveal extended cooling along the surface of the disc out to $\sim10r_g$, with 40% of the total cooling at intermediate accretion rates occurring above the disc body. These results have implications for X-ray binary state transitions and the physical origin of the X-ray corona.</description>

      <title>The H.E.S.S. extragalactic sky survey with the first decade of observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of the first extragalactic gamma-ray survey by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) are presented. The survey comprises 2720 hours of very high-energy gamma-ray observations of the extragalactic sky, recorded with H.E.S.S. from 2004 up to the end of 2012. These data have been re-analysed using a common consistent set of up-to-date data calibration and analysis tools. From this analysis, a list of 23 detected objects, predominantly blazars, was obtained. This catalogue was assessed in terms of the source class populations that it contains. The level of source parameter bias for the blazar sources, probed by this observational dataset, was evaluated using Monte-Carlo simulations. Spectral results obtained with the H.E.S.S. data were compared with the \textit{Fermi}-LAT catalogues to present the full gamma-ray picture of the detected objects. Lastly, this unique dataset was used to assess the contribution of BL Lacertae objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars to the extragalactic gamma-ray background light at several hundreds of giga-electronvolts. These results are accompanied by the release of the high-level data to the astrophysical community.</description>

      <title>A new candidate of a cluster of galaxies behind the Galactic plane, AX J145732-5901</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AX J145732-5901 is an unidentified X-ray source discovered in the ASCA Galactic plane survey. Its extended nature and heavily absorbed X-ray spectrum suggest that AX J145732-5901 is a cluster of galaxies behind the Galactic plane. However, due to limited photon statistics, the spectral shape was not well examined. Using the results of the Galactic ridge X-ray emission and Cosmic X-ray background studies based on the Suzaku observations, we reanalyzed the ASCA data of AX J145732-5901. We confirmed that the source is more extended than the point spread function and the angular size is 14'x10'. The spectrum was heavily absorbed by interstellar matter equivalent to an N_{H} of ~10^{23} cm^{-2} and the emission line feature was confirmed. The spectrum was represented by a thin thermal plasma model with a temperature of 2.6 keV and a redshift of 0.12. Assuming the redshift value, the X-ray luminosity is calculated to be 2.6x10^{44} erg s^{-1} in the 1-10 keV energy band. The observational results indicate that AX J145732-5901 is a cluster of galaxies behind the Galactic plane.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the inner accretion flow and the white-dwarf spin pulse during the 2023 outburst in GK Persei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our X-ray and optical observations performed by NICER, NuSTAR, and Tomo-e Gozen during the 2023 outburst in the intermediate polar GK Persei. The X-ray spectrum consisted of three components: blackbody emission of several tens of eVs from the irradiated white-dwarf surface, a source possibly including several emission lines around 1 keV, and multi-temperature bremsstrahlung emission from the accretion column. The 351.3-s white-dwarf spin pulse was detected in X-rays, and the observable X-ray flux from the column drastically decreased at the off-pulse phase, which suggests that the absorption of the column by the accreting gas called the curtain was the major cause of the pulse. As the system became brighter in optical, the column became fainter, the pulse amplitude became higher, and the energy dependence of pulses became weaker at $&lt;$8~keV. These phenomena could be explained by the column's more pronounced absorption by the denser curtain as mass accretion rates increased. The blackbody and line fluxes rapidly decreased at the optical decline, which suggests the expansion of the innermost disk edge with decreasing accretion rates. The electron scattering or the column geometry may be associated with almost no energy dependence of high-energy pulses. The irradiated vertically-thick structure at the disk may generate optical QPOs with a period of $\sim$5700 s.</description>

      <title>The maximum mass and rotational kinetic energy of rapidly rotating neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid uniformly-rotating neutron stars are expected to be formed for instance in the collapse of some massive stars, the accretion of some compact object binaries, and some double neutron star mergers. The huge amount of the rotational energy has been widely believed to be the source of some cosmic gamma-ray bursts and superluminous supernovae. Benefited from the tight constraints on the equation of state of the neutron star matter set by the latest multi-messenger data, the chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), here we present the maximum gravitational mass as well as the kinetic rotational energy for a neutron star at a given spin period. Our nonparametric EOS analysis reveals that the critical Keplerian configurations ($\Omega_{\rm kep}^{\rm crit}=1.00\pm0.07\times 10^{4}~ {\rm rad/s}$) can sustain maximum gravitational masses of $M_{\rm kep}^{\rm crit}=2.76^{+0.11}_{-0.09} M_\odot$ with corresponding rotational energy reaching $E_{\rm rot,kep}^{\rm crit}=2.38^{+0.25}_{-0.24}\times 10^{53}$. However, the maximum rotational energy that can be feasibly extracted from a neutron star is limited to $1.40^{+0.15}_{-0.13}\times 10^{53}$ erg, which holds for a baryon mass of $2.68^{+0.10}_{-0.09}M_\odot$. All these parameters, obtained via the nonparametric reconstruction of the equation of state, are at the $68.3\%$ confidence level and the adoption of a quarkonic model yields rather similar results. These findings are found to have already set some intriguing constraints on the millisecond magnetar interpretation of some exciting data.</description>

      <title>Collisions with tidal disruption event disks: implications for quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A popular class of models for interpreting quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions from galactic nuclei (QPEs) invoke collisions between an object on an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. There are strong links between QPE systems and those disks which formed following a tidal disruption event (TDE), and at least two events (AT2019qiz and AT2022upj) are known to have occurred following an otherwise typical TDE. We show that the fact that these disks were formed following a TDE strongly constrains their properties, more so than previous models have assumed. Models based on steady-state AGN-like disks have mass contents which grow strongly with size $M_{\rm disk}\propto R_{\rm out}^{7/2}$ and do not conserve the mass or angular momentum of the disrupted star. A very different scaling must be satisfied by a TDE disk in order to conserve the disrupted stars angular momentum, $M_{\rm disk} \propto R_{\rm out}^{-1/2}$. These constraints substantially change the predicted scaling relationships between QPE observables (luminosity, duration, energy, temperature) and the QPE period. They also allow QPE observables to be written in terms of the properties of the two stars assumed to be involved (the one tidally disrupted and the one on an EMRI), making plausibility tests of these models possible. We show that these modifications to the disk structure imply that (i) QPEs cannot be powered by collisions between an orbiting black hole and a TDE disk, (ii) QPEs also cannot be powered by collisions between the surface of a stellar EMRI and a TDE disk. A framework in which the collisions are between a TDE disk and a star which has puffed up to fill its Hills sphere with a trailing debris stream (as seen in recent simulations) cannot be ruled out from the data, and should be the focus of further study.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Priors Improve Gravitational-Wave Constraints on Neutron-Star Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave astronomy shows great promise in determining nuclear physics in a regime not accessible to terrestrial experiments. We introduce physics-informed priors constrained by nuclear theory and perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics calculations, as well as astrophysical measurements of neutron-star masses and radii. When these priors are used in gravitational-wave astrophysical inference, we show a significant improvement on nuclear equation of state constraints. Applying these to the first observed gravitational-wave binary neutron-star merger GW170817, the constraints on the radius of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star improve from $R_{1.4} ={12.54^{+1.05}_{-1.54}} \, {\rm km}$ to $R_{1.4} = 12.11^{+0.91}_{-1.11} \,{\rm km}$ and those on the tidal deformability from $\tilde{\Lambda}_{1.186} &lt; 720$ to $\tilde{\Lambda}_{1.186} = 384^{+306}_{-158}$ ($90\%$ confidence intervals) at the events measured chirp mass $\mathcal{M}=1.186\,M_\odot$. We also show these priors can be used to perform model selection between binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers; in the case of GW190425, the results provide only marginal evidence with a Bayes factor $\mathcal{BF}=1.33$ in favour of the binary neutron star merger hypothesis. Given their ability to improve the astrophysical inference of binary mergers involving neutron stars, we advocate for these physics-informed priors to be used as standard in the literature and provide open-source code for reproducibility and adaptation of the method.</description>

      <title>Rapid Spectral Evolution of SGR 1935+2154 During its 2022 Outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the 2022 outburst of SGR 1935+2154, a Fast-Radio-Burst-like event (FRB 20221014A) and X-ray activities occurred between two spin-up glitches, suggesting these glitches may connect to multiwavelength phenomenology. However, the mechanisms altering the magnetar's magnetosphere to enable radio emission remain unclear. This study presents high-cadence NICER and NuSTAR observations revealing spectral changes in burst and persistent emission. Hardness ratio and spectral analysis reveal significant changes during an "intermediate flare" 2.5 hours before FRB 20221014A. This 80-second flare, releasing $&gt;(6.3\pm0.2)\times10^{40}$ erg, coincides with a rapid spectral softening in both burst and persistent emission and a notable decrease in burst occurrence rate. The intermediate flare is bright enough to be detected if placed at a few Mpc, and would appear as a fast X-ray transient. This implies that the connection between magnetar X-ray activity and FRBs can be observed in the local Universe. Post-flare burst spectra peak near 5 keV, resembling the characteristics of the FRB-associated X-ray burst of 2020. Such change persisted for a few hours, implying magnetospheric evolution on similar timescales. However, no radio emission was detected from post-flare bursts, suggesting that FRB emission requires conditions beyond peculiar short bursts. The burst waiting times exhibit a broken power-law distribution, likely resulting from contamination by enhanced persistent emission. Although the bursts appear randomly distributed in the spin phase, the hardness ratio profile as a function of spin phase follows that of the persistent emission, indicating that X-ray bursts originate at low altitudes.</description>

      <title>Compact stellar systems hosting an intermediate mass black hole: magnetohydrodynamic study of inflow-outflow dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are a missing link in black hole demographics, with only tentative observational evidence to date. Dense stellar clusters such as IRS 13E near the Galactic Center are promising IMBH hosts, where accretion is likely driven by winds from nearby Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Yet, the dynamics of such wind-fed systems remain largely unexplored. We investigate how high-velocity stellar winds, magnetic fields, and metallicity-dependent radiative cooling influence gas dynamics and black hole accretion in compact WR clusters. Using three-dimensional (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations, we model each WR star as a source of mass, momentum, energy, and magnetic flux, and include a cooling function that depends on chemical abundance. We compare isotropic versus disk-like stellar distributions to explore the impact of cluster geometry. Across all models, we find that the accretion rate onto the IMBH is suppressed by up to five orders of magnitude relative to the total stellar mass-loss rate. Turbulent, shock-heated outflows driven by wind-wind collisions dominate the flow, expelling most injected gas. While enhanced cooling in high-metallicity runs promotes the formation of dense clumps, these structures are typically unable to reach the black hole. The system's integrated X-ray luminosity is dominated by colliding WR winds, masking the IMBH's radiative signature. Accretion occurs in short-lived, quasi-periodic episodes triggered by close stellar passages, but even these flares remain difficult to detect against the luminous wind background. Our results naturally explain the low detectability of IMBHs in compact WR clusters and provide theoretical predictions to guide future X-ray and infrared observational strategies.</description>

      <title>Broadband study of the SMC pulsar RX J0032.9-7348 during its X-ray brightening in 2024</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the broadband timing and spectral analysis of the poorly understood SMC pulsar RX J0032.9-7348 (= SXP 7.02) using NuSTAR and NICER observations during its X-ray brightening in 2024. Our timing analysis revealed a pulsation period of approximately 7.02 s in the X-ray light curve. The pulse profile obtained in the broad energy range is double-peaked and asymmetric in nature and shows moderate variation with the energy. An absorbed power-law model describes the 0.5-8 keV NICER spectra well. The 3-50 keV NuSTAR spectrum is best described with an absorbed power-law modified with a high-energy cutoff model. We find no evidence of iron or cyclotron line features in the energy spectrum. During our observation period, the 0.5-50 keV luminosity varies in the range of $\sim 8\times10^{36} - 4\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We also discuss the dependence of spectral parameters on the rotational phase of the pulsar through phase-resolved spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>The case of AT2022wtn: a Tidal Disruption Event in an interacting galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results from our multi-wavelength monitoring campaign of the transient AT2022wtn, discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility in the nucleus of SDSSJ232323.79+104107.7, the less massive galaxy in an active merging pair with a mass ratio of ~10:1. AT2022wtn shows spectroscopic and photometric properties consistent with a X-ray faint N-strong TDE-H+He with a number of peculiarities. Specifically, a 30-days long plateau at maximum luminosity, a corresponding dip in temperature and the development of a double-horned N III+ He II line profile. Strong and time-evolving velocity offsets in the TDE broad emission lines and the detection of a transient radio emission, indicate the presence of outflows. Overall, the observed properties are consistent with the full disruption of a low-mass star by a ~10$^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$ SMBH followed by an efficient disk formation and the launch of a quasi-spherical reprocessing envelope of fast expanding outflowing material. The observed differences between the He II and the Hydrogen and N III lines can be explained either with a spatial separation of the lines emitting region or with a late-time reveal of shocks from the returning debris streams, as the photosphere recedes. Finally, we present an extensive analysis of the hosting environment and discuss the implications for the discovery of two TDEs in interacting galaxy pairs, finding indication for an over-representation of TDEs in these systems. The AT2022wtn host galaxy properties suggest that it is in the early stages of the merger, therefore we may be witnessing the initial enhanced rate of TDEs in interacting galaxies before the post-starburst phase.</description>

      <title>On the difficulty of capturing the distribution function of neutrinos in neutron star merger simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collision of two neutron stars is a rich source of information about nuclear physics. In particular, the kilonova signal following a merger can help us elucidate the role of neutron stars in nucleosynthesis, and informs us about the properties of matter above nuclear saturation. Approximate modeling of neutrinos remains an important limitation to our ability to make predictions for these observables. Part of the problem is the fermionic nature of neutrinos. By the exclusion principle, the expected value $f_\nu$ for the number of neutrinos in a quantum state is at most 1. Any process producing neutrinos is suppressed by a blocking factor $(1-f_\nu)$. Recent simulations focused on neutrino physics mostly use a gray two-moment scheme to evolve neutrinos. This evolves integrals of $f_\nu$ over momentum space, preventing direct calculations of blocking factors. Monte Carlo methods may be an attractive alternative, providing access to the full distribution of neutrinos. Their current implementation is however inadequate to estimate $f_\nu$: in our most recent simulations, a single Monte Carlo packet causes, in the worst cases, estimates of $f_\nu$ to jump from $f_\nu=0$ to $f_\nu\sim 10^5$. While this is concerning, this brazen violation of the fermionic nature of neutrinos has been largely inconsequential as the interactions used in simulations avoid direct calculations of $f_\nu$. We are however reaching a level of modeling at which this problem can no longer be ignored. Here, we discuss the relatively simple origin of this issue. We then show that very rough estimates of $f_\nu$ can in theory be obtained in merger simulations, but that they will require a combination of unintuitive weighting schemes for Monte Carlo packets and smoothing of the neutrino distribution at coarser resolution than what the merger simulation uses.</description>

      <title>Accretion inside astrophysical objects : Effects of rotation and viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-solar mass black holes could show up in gravitational observations in future and near-solar mass black holes might have been involved in the events GW190425 and GW190814. Since they cannot form from the stellar evolution, their creation requires exotic mechanisms. One such mechanism involves the capture of dark matter particles by stellar objects and their thermalization. When the criterion for the collapse of these dark matter particles is satisfied, a tiny endoparasitic black hole (EBH) forms and then it accretes matter from the host. The EBH may transmute the host into a black hole of nearly the same mass as the host or lesser, depending on the type of accretion. We examine this complex and poorly explored accretion mechanism, considering the effects of rotation and viscosity but ignoring some other effects, such as those of pressure and magnetic field, as the first step. Using a general framework to assess the effects of rotation and viscosity on accretion, we show that the accretion could be stalled in some white dwarfs, but not in neutron stars. The stalled accretion should cause an opening in the host's polar regions, the extent of which depends on the mass and spin of the host.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-antineutrino synchrotron emission from magnetized dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Kadanoff--Baym formalism, we perform a detailed study of neutrino-antineutrino synchrotron emission from strongly magnetized, dense quark matter under conditions relevant to compact stars. Starting from an exact expression for the emission rate that fully accounts for Landau-level quantization of quarks, we derive an approximate formula applicable in the regime where quark chemical potentials are much larger than all other relevant energy scales. We demonstrate that the emission rate is largely controlled by a single dimensionless ratio between two low-energy scales: the Landau-level spacing at the Fermi surface, $|e_f B|/\mu_{f}$, and the temperature of the quark matter, $T$. When the ratio $|e_f B|/(\mu_{f} T)$ is small, many closely spaced Landau levels contribute to the emission. In the opposite limit, when the ratio is large, the rate is dominated by transitions between adjacent levels and is exponentially suppressed. Our results show that, even in the presence of the strongest magnetic fields expected in compact stars, the synchrotron emission remains suppressed by more than three orders of magnitude compared to the direct Urca process. This implies that such emission is unlikely to play any substantial role in the cooling of magnetized quark stars, at least those made of unpaired quark matter phases.</description>

      <title>Probing the Axion-Nucleon Coupling with Supergiant Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite axion-nucleon coupling enables the production of axions in stellar environments via the thermal excitation and subsequent de-excitation of the $^{57}$Fe isotope. Given its low-lying excited state at 14.4 keV, $^{57}$Fe can be efficiently excited in the hot cores of supergiant stars, possibly leading to axions emission. The conversion of these axions into photons in the Galactic magnetic field results in a characteristic 14.4 keV line, potentially detectable by hard X-ray telescopes such as NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). In this work, we present the first constraints on axion-nucleon couplings derived from \textsc{NuSTAR} observations of Betelgeuse and discuss the potential insights that could be gained from detecting this line in other nearby supergiants. Our results establish significantly more stringent bounds than those obtained from solar observations, setting a limit of $|g_{a\gamma} g_{aN}^{\mathrm{eff}}| &lt; (1.2 - 2.7) \times 10^{-20}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Mixture of $t$-Factor Analyzers for Clustering High-dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel hybrid approach for estimating the mixture model of $t$-factor analyzers (MtFA) that employs multivariate $t$-distribution and factor model to cluster and characterize grouped data. The traditional estimation method for MtFA faces computational challenges, particularly in high-dimensional settings, where the eigendecomposition of large covariance matrices and the iterative nature of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms lead to scalability issues. We propose a computational scheme that integrates a profile likelihood method into the EM framework to efficiently obtain the model parameter estimates. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through simulations showcasing its superior computational efficiency compared to the existing method, while preserving clustering accuracy and resilience against outliers. Our method is applied to cluster the Gamma-ray bursts, reinforcing several claims in the literature that Gamma-ray bursts have heterogeneous subpopulations and providing characterizations of the estimated groups.</description>

      <title>Cosmological-model independent limits on photon mass from FRB and SNe data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic emissions from astrophysical sources at cosmological distances can be used to estimate the photon mass, $m_{\gamma}$. In this paper, we combine measurements of the dispersion measure ($\mathrm{DM}$) of fast radio bursts (FRB) with the luminosity distance from type Ia supernovae (SNe) to investigate update constraints on the photon rest mass. We derive the expression of $\mathrm{DM}$ dependence concerning a non-vanishing photon mass from a cosmological-model independent approach and constrain the parameter $m_{\gamma}$ from measurements of 68 well-localized FRBs and 1048 SNe data from the Pantheon compilation. We consider two scenarios for the baryon fraction in the intergalactic medium ($f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$): one where the value is fixed according to recent reports and another where it is treated as a free parameter, $f_{\mathrm{IGM}} = f_{\mathrm{IGM,0}}$. In the latter case, we find $m_{\gamma} = (29.4_{-15.5}^{+5.80}) \times 10^{-51}$ kg, at $1\sigma$ level. Our results also demonstrate an anticorrelation between $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ and $m_{\gamma}$, which highlights the importance of analyzing a larger sample of FRBs for a more comprehensive understanding of their properties.</description>

      <title>Predicting Potential Host Galaxies of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Based on Stellar Kinematics in Archival IFU Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) at the centers of galaxies emit continuous gravitational waves (GWs) at nanohertz frequencies, and ongoing pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments aim to detect the first individual system. Identifying the exact host galaxy of a SMBHB detected in GWs is paramount for a variety of multi-messenger science cases, but it will be challenging due to the large number of candidate galaxies in the sky localization region. Here, we apply recent insights on the distinct characteristics of SMBHB host galaxies to archival galaxy datasets, to predict which nearby massive galaxies are most likely to host SMBHBs detectable by PTAs. Specifically, we use archival galaxy IFU surveys to search for nearby galaxies with distinct stellar kinematic signatures of SMBHB host galaxies, as informed by cosmological simulations. These distinct stellar kinematic signatures, including slow rotation and strong kinematic/photometric misalignments, are a hallmark of recent major galaxy mergers that led to the formation of SMBHBs in these galaxies. We produce a list of nearby massive galaxies that may currently host SMBHBs, ranked by a combination of their host galaxy stellar kinematic properties and their hypothetical GW strain. We discuss how our ranked list can be used (1) for targeted searches for individual sources of continuous GWs by PTAs, (2) to corroborate candidate SMBHBs identified through other approaches, and (3) to select candidate recoiling AGN and closely-separated (&lt;100 pc) dual AGN for telescope follow-up confirmation.</description>

      <title>X-ray Spectroscopy via Temporal Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel way to fit solar flare X-ray spectra that offers more sensitivity to physical flare parameters than traditional approaches to spectroscopy. We decouple physically distinct emission types in solar flare X-ray spectra using timing behaviors, a technique we call time-decomposed spectroscopy. By fitting the shapes of particular time series to others across a time interval, we extract X-ray emission of distinct physical origins before any forward modeling. We perform spectroscopy on the original and time-decomposed spectra and find good agreement, with physical reasons for the few disagreements. In general, the time decomposition technique provides more precise results than those of traditional spectroscopy. The thermal and nonthermal energies are better constrained by more than an order of magnitude using the time decomposition approach, relative to traditional spectroscopy. We explain mathematically how and why the technique works using the multifractal formalism, and show that fractality is one way to choose appropriate light curves for this analysis. We speculate about applications to different wavelengths for solar data analysis, as well as applications to other physics subfields and domains.</description>

      <title>Plausible Indication of Gamma-Ray Absorption by Dark Matter in NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NGC 1068 is the brightest extragalactic source in high-energy neutrinos as seen by IceCube, yet the accompanying gamma-ray flux is orders of magnitude weaker. It has been argued that this indicates that the bulk of neutrinos and gamma rays are emitted in the innermost vicinity of the central supermassive black hole, which is transparent to neutrinos, but opaque to gamma rays. Even in such extreme scenarios for the acceleration of cosmic rays, astrophysical models typically overestimate the low-energy gamma-ray flux and/or require some fine-tuning in the physical parameters. Here we suggest instead that the dark matter surrounding the supermassive black hole may absorb the gamma rays, inducing the observed deficit. We show that for a dark matter-photon scattering cross section in the range $\sigma_{\rm DM-\gamma}/m_{\rm DM} \simeq 10^{-28}-10^{-30}$ cm$^2$/GeV, Fermi-LAT measurements can be well reconciled with IceCube data. We also present some simple particle physics examples that achieve the correct spectral energy dependence while respecting complementary constraints.</description>

      <title>New {\em ab initio} constrained extended Skyrme equations of state for simulations of neutron stars, supernovae and binary mergers: I. Subsaturation density domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In numerical simulations of core-collapse supernova and binary neutron stars mergers information about the energetics and composition of matter is implemented via external tables covering the huge ranges of thermodynamic conditions explored during the astrophysical evolution. More than 120 general purpose equation of state tables have been contributed so far. Not all of them comply with current constraints from theoretical and experimental nuclear physics and astrophysical observations of neutron stars. Systematic investigations of the role that dense matter properties play in the evolution of these astrophysical phenomena require that more equation of state tables are provided. We build a set of general purpose equation of state tables. At zero temperature, they comply with all currently accepted constraints, including ab initio chiral effective field theory calculations of pure neutron and symmetric nuclear matter. This set is designed to explore a wide variety of the behaviors of the effective masses as functions of density, which is reflected into a wide range of thermal behaviors. We employ Brussels extended Skyrme interactions generated by means of Bayesian inference techniques. An extended nuclear statistical equilibrium model is developed for modeling sub-saturated inhomogeneous nuclear matter. We study the properties of sub-saturated inhomogeneous nuclear matter over wide ranges of density, temperature and proton fraction. We analyze the mechanisms of transition to homogeneous matter and estimate the transition density. Our key results include the presence of a think $^{14}$He layer in the inner crusts of (neo-)neutron stars, significant abundance of other exotic isotopes of H and He in warm and neutron rich matter and a detailed study of the thermodynamic stability of cold stellar matter. The equation of state tables will be publicly available in the Compose online database.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high resolution WIYN/NEID echelle spectroscopy (R $\approx70$,000) of the supernova (SN) 2023ixf in M101, obtained 1.51 to 18.51 days after explosion over nine epochs. Daily monitoring for the first four days after explosion shows narrow emission features ($\leq200$ km s$^{-1}$), exhibiting predominantly blueshifted velocities, that rapidly weaken, broaden, and vanish in a manner consistent with radiative acceleration and the SN shock eventually overrunning or enveloping the full extent of dense circumstellar medium (CSM). The most rapid evolution is in the He I emission, which is visible on day 1.51 but disappears by day 2.62. We measure the maximum pre-SN speed of He I to be 25 $^{+0}_{-5} \pm2$ km s$^{-1}$, where the error is attributable to the uncertainty in how much the He I had already been radiatively accelerated, and to measurement of the emission line profile. The radiative acceleration of material is likely driven by the shock-CSM interaction, and the CSM is accelerated to $\geq200$ km s$^{-1}$ before being completely swept up by the SN shock to $\sim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$. We compare the observed spectra with spherically-symmetric r16wb HERACLES/CMFGEN model spectra and find the line evolution to generally be consistent with radiative acceleration and optical depth effects. The progenitor of SN2023ixf underwent an enhanced mass loss phase $\gtrsim 4$ year prior to core-collapse, creating a dense, asymmetric CSM region extending out to approximately $r_{CSM} = 3.7 \times 10^{14}$ ($v_\textrm{shock}$/9500 km s$^{-1}$) cm.</description>

      <title>Expanding the parameter space of 2002es-like type Ia supernovae: on the underluminous ASASSN-20jq / SN 2020qxp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the peculiar Type Ia supernova ASASSN-20jq/SN 2020qxp. It is a low-luminosity object with a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B=-17.1\pm0.5$ mag. Despite its low luminosity, its post-peak light-curve decline rate ($\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.35\pm0.09$ mag) and color-stretch parameter (sBV&gt;0.82) are similar to normal SNe Ia, making it an outlier in the luminosity-width and luminosity-color-stretch relations. Early light curves suggest a "bump" during the first 1.4 days of explosion. ASASSN-20jq synthesized a low radioactive $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.09\pm0.01M_\odot$. Near-maximum light spectra reveal strong Si II absorption lines, indicating a cooler photosphere than normal SNe Ia, but lack Ti II absorption lines. Unusually strong O I $\lambda$7773 and Ca II near-infrared triplet absorption features are present. Nebular spectra show a strong, narrow forbidden [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda$7291,7324 doublet emission, rarely seen in SNe Ia except in some Type Iax events. Marginal detection of [O I] $\lambda\lambda$6300,6364 doublet emission, which is extremely rare, is observed. Both [Ca II] and [O I] lines are redshifted by $\sim2000$ km/s. A strong [Fe II] $\lambda$7155 emission line with a tilted-top profile, identical to the [Fe II] $\lambda$16433 profile, is also observed. These asymmetric [Fe II] profiles and redshifted [Ca II] and [O I] emissions suggest a high central density white dwarf progenitor undergoing an off-center delayed-detonation explosion mechanism, producing roughly equal amounts of $^{56}$Ni in deflagration and detonation phases. This distinguishes ASASSN-20jq from normal and subluminous SNe Ia. ASASSN-20jq's light curve and spectra do not align with any single SNe Ia subclass but show similarities to 2002es-like objects. Thus, we add it as an extreme candidate within the heterogeneous parameter space of 2002es-like SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence for r-process nucleosynthesis in delayed MeV emission from the SGR 1806-20 magnetar giant flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of heavy elements synthesized through the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process) has been an enduring mystery for over half a century. Cehula et al. (2024) recently showed that magnetar giant flares, among the brightest transients ever observed, can shock-heat and eject neutron star crustal material at high velocity, achieving the requisite conditions for an $r$-process. Patel et al. (in prep.) confirmed an $r$-process in these ejecta using detailed nucleosynthesis calculations. Radioactive decay of the freshly synthesized nuclei releases a forest of gamma-ray lines, Doppler broadened by the high ejecta velocities $v \gtrsim 0.1c$ into a quasi-continuous spectrum peaking around 1 MeV. Here, we show that the predicted emission properties (light-curve, fluence, and spectrum) match a previously unexplained hard gamma-ray signal seen in the aftermath of the famous December 2004 giant flare from the magnetar SGR 1806-20. This MeV emission component, rising to peak around 10 minutes after the initial spike before decaying away over the next few hours, is direct observational evidence for the synthesis of $\sim 10^{-6}M_{\odot}$ of $r$-process elements. The discovery of magnetar giant flares as confirmed $r$-process sites, contributing at least $\sim 1$-$10\%$ of the total Galactic abundances, has implications for the Galactic chemical evolution, especially at the earliest epochs probed by low-metallicity stars. It also implicates magnetars as potentially dominant sources of heavy cosmic rays. Characterization of the $r$-process emission from giant flares by resolving decay line features offers a compelling science case for NASA's forthcoming COSI nuclear spectrometer, as well as next-generation MeV telescope missions.</description>

      <title>Consequences of a Heavy-Metal Scenario of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assume an extreme scenario, in which the arriving cosmic rays are composed of only iron nuclei at energies above $10^{19.6}\,\text{eV}\simeq40\,\text{EeV}$, while allowing a freedom in the scale of the depth of shower maximum ($X_{\rm{max}}$) and preserving the elongation rate and fluctuations of $X_{\rm{max}}$ predicted by models of hadronic interactions. We derive the shift of the $X_{\rm{max}}$ scale for QGSJet II-04 and Sibyll 2.3d models using the public data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. We then propose a new mass-composition model for the energy evolution of four primary species at the ultra-high energies by fitting the publicly-available $X_{\rm{max}}$ distributions. We discuss the consequences of this Heavy-metal scenario on the energy spectrum of individual primary species, hadronic interaction studies, and the effect of the Galactic magnetic field on the arrival directions.</description>

      <title>Stellar $\beta^{-}$-decay rate of $^{63}$Ni and its impact on the ${s}$-process nucleosynthesis in massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\beta^{-}$-decay rate of $^{63}$Ni, an important branching point, affects the subsequent nucleosynthesis in the weak component of the slow-neutron capture process (weak $s$-process). To evaluate the impact of the uncertainties of stellar lifetime of $^{63}$Ni on abundances, we calculate the contribution to $\beta^{-}$-decay rates from its excited states using the large-scale shell model with various interactions and also explore the atomic effects in the highly ionized plasma. In the core He burning stage and the shell C burning stage of massive stars, our new rates can be larger than those from Takahashi and Yokoi(1987) by up to a factor of 4 and 6, respectively. We evaluate the impact of the stellar decay rates of $^{63}$Ni on the nucleosynthesis of $A=60\sim90$ in a star with an initial mass of 25 $M_{\bigodot}$ and solar metalicity. We find that the new rates can lead to the abundance changes of $^{64}$Ni, $^{63}$Cu, $^{65}$Cu, $^{64}$Zn, $^{66}$Zn, $^{67}$Zn, and $^{68}$Zn by up to $18\%$, $14\%$, $7\%$, $98\%$, $16\%$, $15\%$, and $13\%$, respectively, after the shell C burning stage at the Lagrangian mass coordinate $M_{r}=2M_{\bigodot}$. The enhancement of the decay rate of $^{63}$Ni increases the weak $s$-process efficiency of nuclei after $^{65}$Cu.</description>

      <title>SN 2023vbg: A Type IIn Supernova Resembling SN 2009ip, with a Long-Duration Precursor and Early-Time Bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNe) resembling SN 2009ip (09ip-like SNe) originate from the interaction between circumstellar material (CSM) and the ejecta. This subclass not only shares similar observational properties around the maximum, but is commonly characterized by a long duration precursor before its maximum. Investigating the observed properties of the precursor provides constraints on the mass-loss history of the progenitor.We present observational data of SN 2023vbg, a 09ip-like type IIn SN that displayed unique observational properties compared to other 09ip-like SNe. SN 2023vbg showed a long-duration precursor at $M_g\sim-14$ mag lasting for $\sim100$ days, followed by a bright bump at $M_g\sim-17$ mag at 12-25 days before the maximum. The luminosity of the precursor is similar to those of other 09ip-like SNe, but the bright bump has not been observed in other cases.After reaching the peak luminosity, the light curve exhibited a peculiar smooth decline.While the H$\alpha$ profile displays two velocity components ($\sim 500$ and $3000\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$), a broad component observed in other 09ip-like SNe was not detected. We suggest that these properties are explained by the difference in the CSM structure as compared to other 09ip-like SNe; SN 2023vbg had an inner denser CSM component, as well as generally smooth CSM density distribution in a more extended scale, than in the others. Such diversity of CSM likely reflects the diversity of pre-SN outbursts, which in turn may mirror the range of evolutionary pathways in the final stages of the progenitors.</description>

      <title>A Time-Dependent Solution for GSN 069 Disk Evolution: The Nature of 'Long-Lived' TDEs and Implications for QPE Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the implementation of a fully time-dependent relativistic disk model - based on the light curve fitting package FitTeD - into the X-ray spectral fitting environment, pyXspec. This implementation enables simultaneous fitting of multi-epoch and multi-wavelength spectral data, where the only free parameters are those describing the black hole and the initial conditions, while the subsequent evolution is fully governed by the dynamical equations of an evolving accretion flow. We apply the model to fit seven epochs of X-ray spectra and two epochs of UV spectra of the 'long-lived' tidal disruption event (TDE) and quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) source GSN 069, spanning from its discovery in 2010 through late-2019. Our results show that such 'long-lived', X-ray-bright TDEs - of which GSN 069 is a prime, but not unique, example-can be naturally explained within the same framework as events with shorter-lived X-ray emission, such as ASASSN-14li and AT2019dsg. Their key distinction lies in the 'viscous' timescale parameter - tied to the disk's stress and angular momentum transport efficiency - which should be treated as a free parameter when modeling the disk evolution of transient events. We examine the implications for QPE models by tracking the time evolution of disk properties such as mass surface density and accretion rate. We show that existing QPE models cannot reproduce the observed connection between the presence (e.g., 2018) or absence (e.g., 2014) of eruptions and disk properties. In the context of orbiter-disk collision models, the change in mass surface density appears insufficient to explain the needed variation in the eruption's temperature. The absence of eruptions in GSN 069 in 2014 remains a major challenge for QPE models.</description>

      <title>ESIGMAHM: An Eccentric, Spinning inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model with Higher Modes for the detection and characterization of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a time-domain inspiral-merger-ringdowm (IMR) waveform model ESIGMAHM constructed within a framework we named ESIGMA for coalescing binaries of spinning black holes on moderately eccentric orbits (Huerta et al. (2018) [Phys. Rev. D 97, 024031]). We now include the effect of black hole spins on the dynamics of eccentric binaries, as well as model sub-dominant waveform harmonics emitted by them. The inspiral evolution is described by a consistent combination of latest results from post-Newtonian theory, self-force, and black hole perturbation theory. We assume that these moderately eccentric binaries radiate away most of their orbital eccentricity before merger, and seamlessly connect the eccentric inspiral with a numerical relativity based surrogate waveform model for mergers of spinning binaries on quasi-circular orbits. We validate ESIGMAHM against eccentric Numerical Relativity simulations, and also against contemporary effective-one-body and phenomenological models in the quasi-circular limit. We find that ESIGMAHM achieves match values greater than $99\%$ for quasi-circular spin-aligned binaries with mass ratios up to $8$, and above $97\%$ for non-spinning and spinning eccentric systems with small or positively aligned spins. Using IMRESIGMA, we quantify the impact of orbital eccentricity on GW signals, showing that next-generation detectors can detect eccentric sources up to $10\%$ louder than quasi-circular ones. We also show that current templated LIGO-Virgo searches will lose more than $10\%$ of optimal SNR for about $20\%$ of all eccentric sources by using only quasi-circular waveform templates. The same will result in a $25\%$ loss in detection rate for eccentric sources with mass ratios $m_1/m_2\geq 4$. Our results highlight the need for including eccentricity and higher-order modes in GW source models and searches for asymmetric eccentric BBH signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological vacuum amplification of gravitational waves in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. We develop a comprehensive framework to compute graviton production induced by the parity violating Pontryagin coupling and study its imprint on the stochastic gravitational wave background energy power spectrum. We explore gravitational vacuum amplification in four concrete scenarios for the evolution of the Chern-Simons pseudoscalar. We show that a parity-violating contribution dominates over an initially flat spectrum when the velocity of the pseudoscalar quickly interpolates between two asymptotically constant values or when it is nonvanishing and constant through a finite period of time. This is also the case when we parametrize the pseudoscalar evolution by a perfect fluid with radiation- and dust-like equations of state for large enough values of its energy density. The resulting spectra are compared with the sensitivity curves of current and future gravitational wave observational searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I make a brief review about the QCD phases and the equation of state inferred from the neutron star data. Along the temperature axis at low baryon density, the QCD phase transition is a smooth crossover, and it is a natural extension of our imagination to postulate a similar crossover along the density axis at low temperature. Even without phase transitions, the inferred thermodynamic properties of neutron star matter turn out to be highly nontrivial already at twice of the nuclear saturation density. I also give some discussions about the substantiation of quark matter by means of the gravitational wave signals including the multi-messenger prospect.</description>

      <title>Towards constraining QCD phase transitions in neutron star interiors: Bayesian Inference with TOV linear response analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential hadron-to-quark phase transition in neutron stars has not been fully understood as the property of cold, dense, and strongly interacting matter cannot be theoretically described by the first-principle perturbative calculations, nor have they been systematically measured through terrestrial low-to-intermediate energy heavy-ion experiments. Given the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations, the equation of state (EoS) of the neutron star (NS) matter can be constrained by the observations of NS mass, radius, and tidal deformability. However, large observational uncertainties and the limited number of observations currently make it challenging to strictly reconstruct the EoS, especially to identify interesting features such as a strong first-order phase transition. In this work, we study the dependency of reconstruction quality of the phase transition on the number of NS observations of mass and radius as well as their uncertainty, based on a fiducial EoS. We conquer this challenging problem by constructing a neural network, which allows one to parametrize the EoS with minimum model-dependency, and by devising an algorithm of parameter optimization based on the analytical linear response analysis of the TOV equations. This work may pave the way for the understanding of the phase transition features in NSs using future $x$-ray and gravitational wave measurements.</description>

Abstract: We present a full sampling of the hierarchical population posterior distribution of merging black holes using current gravitational-wave data. We directly tackle the most relevant intrinsic parameter space made of the binary parameters (masses, spin magnitudes, spin directions, redshift) of all the events entering the GWTC-3 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalog, as well as the hyperparameters of the underlying population of sources. This results in a parameter space of about 500 dimensions, in contrast with current investigations where the targeted dimensionality is drastically reduced by marginalizing over all single-event parameters. In particular, we have direct access to (i) population parameters, (ii) population-informed single-event parameters, and (iii) correlations between these two sets of parameters. We quantify the fractional contribution of each event to the constraints on the population hyperparameters. Our implementation relies on modern probabilistic programming languages and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with a continuous interpolation of single-event posterior probabilities. Sampling the full hierarchical problem is feasible, as demonstrated here, and advantageous as it removes some (but not all) of the Monte Carlo integrations that enter the likelihood together with the related variances.</description>

      <title>Systematic Bayesian Optimization for Atomic Structure Calculations of Heavy Elements</title>

Abstract: This study presents a novel optimisation technique for atomic structure calculations using the Flexible Atomic Code, focussing on complex multielectron systems relevant to $r$-process nucleosynthesis and kilonova modelling. We introduce a method to optimise the fictitious mean configuration used in the Flexible Atomic Code, significantly improving the accuracy of calculated energy levels and transition properties for lanthanide and actinide ions. Our approach employs a Sequential Model-Based Optimisation algorithm to refine the fictitious mean configuration, iteratively minimising the discrepancy between calculated and experimentally determined energy levels. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method through detailed analyses of Au II, Pt II, Pr II, Pr III, Er II, and Er~III, representing a broad range of atomic configurations. The results show substantial improvements in the accuracy of the calculated energy levels, with average relative differences to the NIST data reduced from 20-60\% to 10\% or less for the ions studied. Transition wavelength calculations exhibit exceptional agreement with experimental data, with about 90\% of the calculated values falling within 10\% of measurements for Pr and Er ions. While improvements in transition probability calculations are observed, the calculated transition probabilities (log($gf$) values) still show significant discrepancies compared to the experimental data, with root mean square deviations of approximately 1.1-1.4 dex for Pr and Er ions. We extend our optimisation technique to systematic calculations of singly and doubly ionised lanthanides, achieving accuracies comparable to or surpassing those of \textit{ab-initio} atomic structure codes. The method's broad applicability across the lanthanide series demonstrates its potential for enhancing opacity calculations and spectral modelling in astrophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theories in Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We briefly review the recent developments in magnetohydrodynamics, which in particular deal with the evolution of magnetic fields in turbulent plasmas. We especially emphasize (i) the necessity of renormalizing equations of motion in turbulence where velocity and magnetic fields become H\"older singular; (ii) the breakdown of Laplacian determinism (spontaneous stochasticity) for turbulent magnetic fields; and (iii) the possibility of eliminating the notion of magnetic field lines, using instead magnetic path lines as trajectories of Alfvenic wave-packets. These methodologies are then exemplified with their application to the problem of magnetic reconnection -- rapid change in magnetic field pattern that accelerates plasma -- a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysics and laboratory plasmas. The necessity of smoothing out rough velocity and magnetic fields on a finite scale L implies that magnetohydrodynamic equations should be regarded as effective field theories with running parameters depending upon the scale L.</description>
