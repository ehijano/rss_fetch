      <title>Three Scores and 15 Years (1948-2023) of Rao's Score Test: A Brief History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rao (1948) introduced the score test statistic as an alternative to the likelihood ratio and Wald test statistics. In spite of the optimality properties of the score statistic shown in Rao and Poti (1946), the Rao score (RS) test remained unnoticed for almost 20 years. Today, the RS test is part of the ``Holy Trinity'' of hypothesis testing and has found its place in the Statistics and Econometrics textbooks and related software. Reviewing the history of the RS test we note that remarkable test statistics proposed in the literature earlier or around the time of Rao (1948) mostly from intuition, such as Pearson (1900) goodness-fit-test, Moran (1948) I test for spatial dependence and Durbin and Watson (1950) test for serial correlation, can be given RS test statistic interpretation. At the same time, recent developments in the robust hypothesis testing under certain forms of misspecification, make the RS test an active area of research in Statistics and Econometrics. From our brief account of the history the RS test we conclude that its impact in science goes far beyond its calendar starting point with promising future research activities for many years to come.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Consistent Analysis of Realized Covariations in Term Structure Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we show how to analyze the covariation of bond prices nonparametrically and robustly, staying consistent with a general no-arbitrage setting. This is, in particular, motivated by the problem of identifying the number of statistically relevant factors in the bond market under minimal conditions. We apply this method in an empirical study which suggests that a high number of factors is needed to describe the term structure evolution and that the term structure of volatility varies over time.</description>

      <title>Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average Models: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average (VARMA) models form a powerful and general model class for analyzing dynamics among multiple time series. While VARMA models encompass the Vector AutoRegressive (VAR) models, their popularity in empirical applications is dominated by the latter. Can this phenomenon be explained fully by the simplicity of VAR models? Perhaps many users of VAR models have not fully appreciated what VARMA models can provide. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners seeking insights into the advantages and capabilities of VARMA models. We start by reviewing the identification challenges inherent to VARMA models thereby encompassing classical and modern identification schemes and we continue along the same lines regarding estimation, specification and diagnosis of VARMA models. We then highlight the practical utility of VARMA models in terms of Granger Causality analysis, forecasting and structural analysis as well as recent advances and extensions of VARMA models to further facilitate their adoption in practice. Finally, we discuss some interesting future research directions where VARMA models can fulfill their potentials in applications as compared to their subclass of VAR models.</description>
