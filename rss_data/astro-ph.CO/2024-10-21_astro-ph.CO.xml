      <title>Inference of morphology and dynamical state of nearby $Planck$-SZ galaxy clusters with Zernike polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the maps of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal of local galaxy clusters ($z&lt;0.1$) observed by the $Planck$ satellite in order to classify their dynamical state through morphological features. To study the morphology of the cluster maps, we apply a method recently employed on mock SZ images generated from hydrodynamical simulated galaxy clusters in THE THREE HUNDRED (THE300) project. Here, we report the first application on real data. The method consists in modelling the images with a set of orthogonal functions defined on circular apertures, the Zernike polynomials. From the fit we compute a single parameter, $\mathcal{C}$, that quantifies the morphological features present in each image. The link between the morphology of 2D images and the dynamical state of the galaxy clusters is well known, even if not obvious. We use mock $Planck$-like Compton parameter maps generated for THE300 clusters to validate our morphological analysis. These clusters, in fact, are properly classified for their dynamical state with the relaxation parameter, $\chi$, by exploiting 3D information from simulations. We find a mild linear correlation of $\sim 38\%$ between $\mathcal{C}$ and $\chi$ for THE300 clusters, mainly affected by the noise present in the maps. In order to obtain a proper dynamical-state classification for the $Planck$ clusters, we exploit the conversion from the $\mathcal{C}$ parameter derived in each $Planck$ map in $\chi$. A fraction of the order of $63\%$ of relaxed clusters is estimated in the selected $Planck$ sample. Our classification is then compared with those of previous works that have attempted to evaluate, with different indicators and/or other wavelengths, the dynamical state of the same $Planck$ objects. The agreement with the other works is larger than $58\%$.</description>

      <title>Tensor Integrals in the Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for evaluating tensor integrals in the large-scale structure. Decomposing a $\Lambda$CDM-like universe into a finite sum of scaling universes using the FFTLog, we can recast loop integrals for biased tracers in the large-scale structure as certain tensor integrals in quantum field theory. While rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken by the fixed reference frame in which biased tracers are observed, the tensor structures can still be organized to respect the underlying symmetry. Projecting the loop integrands for scaling universes onto spherical harmonics, the problem effectively reduces to the evaluation of one-dimensional radial integrals, which can be solved analytically. Using this method, we derive analytic expressions for the one-loop power spectrum, bispectrum, and trispectrum for arbitrary multipole moments in the basis of scaling universes.</description>

      <title>Gaussianity test of Planck CMB polarization data using the statistics of unpolarized points (Part I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed test for Gaussianity of Planck polarization data using statistics of unpolarized points on the sky, i.e. such points where the linear polarization vanishes. The algorithm we propose for finding such points is stable and guarantees their 100% detection. Our approach allows us to analyze the data for Gaussianity of the signal at different angular scales and detect areas on the polarization maps with a significant contribution from unremoved non-Gaussian foregrounds. We found very strong deviations from Gaussianity for E and B modes in the observational data both over the entire sky and in some specific regions of the celestial sphere.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: a census of bridges between galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to CMB measurements, baryonic matter constitutes about $5\%$ of the mass-energy density of the universe. A significant population of these baryons, for a long time referred to as `missing', resides in a low density, warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) outside galaxy clusters, tracing the ``cosmic web'', a network of large scale dark matter filaments. Various studies have detected this inter-cluster gas, both by stacking and by observing individual filaments in compact, massive systems. In this paper, we study short filaments (&lt; 10 Mpc) connecting massive clusters ($M_{500} \approx 3\times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) detected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) using the scattering of CMB light off the ionised gas, a phenomenon known as the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect. The first part of this work is a search for suitable candidates for high resolution follow-up tSZ observations. We identify four cluster pairs with an intercluster signal above the noise floor (S/N $&gt;$ 2), including two with a tentative $&gt;2\sigma$ statistical significance for an intercluster bridge from the ACT data alone. In the second part of this work, starting from the same cluster sample, we directly stack on ${\sim}100$ cluster pairs and observe an excess SZ signal between the stacked clusters of $y=(7.2^{+2.3}_{-2.5})\times 10^{-7}$ with a significance of $3.3\sigma$. It is the first tSZ measurement of hot gas between clusters in this range of masses at moderate redshift ($\langle z\rangle\approx 0.5$). We compare this to the signal from simulated cluster pairs with similar redshifts and separations in the THE300 and MAGNETICUM Pathfinder cosmological simulations and find broad consistency. Additionally, we show that our measurement is consistent with scaling relations between filament parameters and mass of the embedded halos identified in simulations.</description>

      <title>Galaxy-galaxy strong lensing cross-section with fuzzy dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) cross-section in observed galaxy clusters has been reported to be more than an order of magnitude higher than the theoretical prediction by the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. In this study, we focus on the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) model and study the GGSL cross-section numerically and analytically. We find that FDM subhalos can produce larger cross-sections than the CDM subhalos due to the presence of the soliton core. The maximum cross-section is obtained when the core radius is about the same as the size of the critical curve. The peak ratio of the cross-sections between the FDM subhalos and the CDM subhalos is about two when including the baryon distribution, indicating that the FDM with any masses might not produce the expected observed cross-section.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Galaxy Clustering Predictions from Small-Volume Hydrodynamical Simulations via Control Variates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation are an invaluable tool for understanding galaxy formation and its impact on cosmological parameter inference from large-scale structure. However, their high computational cost is a significant obstacle for running simulations that probe cosmological volumes comparable to those analyzed by contemporary large-scale structure experiments. In this work, we explore the possibility of obtaining high-precision galaxy clustering predictions from small-volume hydrodynamical simulations such as MilleniumTNG and FLAMINGO via control variates. In this approach, the hydrodynamical full-physics simulation is paired with a matched low-resolution gravity-only simulation. By learning the galaxy-halo connection from the hydrodynamical simulation and applying it to the gravity-only counterpart, one obtains a galaxy population that closely mimics the one in the more expensive simulation. One can then construct an estimator of galaxy clustering that combines the clustering amplitudes in the small-volume hydrodynamical and gravity-only simulations with clustering amplitudes in a large-volume gravity-only simulation. Depending on the galaxy sample, clustering statistic, and scale, this galaxy clustering estimator can have an effective volume of up to around $100$ times the volume of the original hydrodynamical simulation in the non-linear regime. With this approach, we can construct galaxy clustering predictions from existing simulations that are precise enough for mock analyses of next-generation large-scale structure surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>syren-new: Precise formulae for the linear and nonlinear matter power spectra with massive neutrinos and dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current and future large scale structure surveys aim to constrain the neutrino mass and the equation of state of dark energy. We aim to construct accurate and interpretable symbolic approximations to the linear and nonlinear matter power spectra as a function of cosmological parameters in extended $\Lambda$CDM models which contain massive neutrinos and non-constant equations of state for dark energy. This constitutes an extension of the syren-halofit emulators to incorporate these two effects, which we call syren-new (SYmbolic-Regression-ENhanced power spectrum emulator with NEutrinos and $W_0-w_a$). We also obtain a simple approximation to the derived parameter $\sigma_8$ as a function of the cosmological parameters for these models. Our results for the linear power spectrum are designed to emulate CLASS, whereas for the nonlinear case we aim to match the results of EuclidEmulator2. We compare our results to existing emulators and $N$-body simulations. Our analytic emulators for $\sigma_8$, the linear and nonlinear power spectra achieve root mean squared errors of 0.1%, 0.3% and 1.3%, respectively, across a wide range of cosmological parameters, redshifts and wavenumbers. We verify that emulator-related discrepancies are subdominant compared to observational errors and other modelling uncertainties when computing shear power spectra for LSST-like surveys. Our expressions have similar accuracy to existing (numerical) emulators, but are at least an order of magnitude faster, both on a CPU and GPU. Our work greatly improves the accuracy, speed and range of applicability of current symbolic approximations to the linear and nonlinear matter power spectra. We provide publicly available code for all symbolic approximations found.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background anisotropies from inflation with non-Bunch-Davies states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been known that stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) have anisotropies generated by squeezed-type tensor non-Gaussianities originating from scalar-tensor-tensor (STT) and tensor-tensor-tensor cubic interactions. While the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities in the standard slow-roll inflation with the Bunch-Davies vacuum state are suppressed due to the so-called consistency relation, those in extended models with the violation of the consistency relation can be enhanced. Among such extended models, we consider the inflation model with the non-Bunch-Davies state that has been known to enhance the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities. We explicitly formulate the primordial STT bispectrum induced during inflation in the context of Horndeski theory with the non-Bunch-Davies state and show that the induced SGWB anisotropies can be enhanced. We then discuss the detectability of those anisotropies in future gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>How large could CP violation in neutral $B$ meson mixing be? Implications for baryogenesis and upcoming searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CP violation in neutral $B$ meson oscillations is an experimental observable that could be directly related to the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through the $B$-Mesogenesis mechanism. As this phenomenon is highly suppressed in the Standard Model, it could also be a sensitive probe for many new physics scenarios that modify neutral meson mixing. Motivated by these facts, and the timely $B$ physics program at the LHC and Belle II, we analyze how large CP violation in the mixing of neutral $B_d$ and $B_s$ meson systems could be. We answer this question, in light of current experimental data, within three different scenarios, namely: (i) generic heavy new physics only affecting the mass mixing $M_{12}^q$, (ii) vector-like quark extensions that introduce deviations of 3$\times$3 CKM unitarity, and (iii) light new physics modifying the decay mixing $\Gamma_{12}^q$. We find that enhancements of the semileptonic asymmetries, that measure the amount of CP violation in mixing, at the level of $10^{-3}$ for the $B_d$ system and $10^{-4}$ for the $B_s$ system can be achieved within scenarios (i) and (ii), while they are much more suppressed in realistic UV completions triggering scenario (iii). With respect to cosmology, the difficulty of finding large CP asymmetries in our analysis puts the $B$-Mesogenesis mechanism in tension. Finally, we conclude that upcoming experimental searches for CP violation in $B$ meson mixing at LHCb and Belle II are unlikely to detect a new physics signal for the most generic models.</description>

      <title>Probing the massive scalar mode in the levitated sensor detector of gravitational wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to the mass scale associated with the scalar longitudinal mode signal of gravitational wave predicted by modified theories of gravity, it should propagate at a subluminal speed and with a different frequency compared to the massless tensor mode signals which moves at the speed of light and are present in both standard general relativity and modified theories. This is ensured by the massless and massive dispersion relations obeyed respectively by the tensor and scalar modes of gravitational wave coming from a given source and thus having the same propagation vector. We show that because of its wider operational frequency band the recently designed levitated sensor detector \cite{Aggarwal} of gravitational wave has a better chance of detecting both the scalar and tensor modes at these different frequencies and thus can provide observational evidence in favour of modified theories of gravity over general relativity. This detector works on the principle of optical trapping \cite{Ashkin_1970} of a dielectric nanosphere sensor\cite{Geraci}. By adjusting the intensity of the optical beam the frequency of the harmonic potential trap can be varied widely so that the nanosphere sensor can undergo distinct resonant transitions induced by the tensor and scalar modes. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the sensor mass obeys a geodesic deviation equation in the proper detector frame and construct a quantum mechanical description of this system in modified gravity framework to compute the probabilities of resonant transitions in response to incoming gravitational wave signals of both periodic and aperiodic kind.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The four-point correlation function is the lowest order correlation function for scalar fields that can be used to probe statistical parity invariance in an isotropic universe. There are intriguing claims of detection of parity violation in the 4-point function of BOSS galaxy clustering data. We apply the same estimator to the public SDSS Data Release 16 Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data probes a different redshift range and is sensitive to a different density regime using a completely different technique. A detection would therefore be a strong indication of new physics. We identify accurate covariance matrix as a crucial impediment to performing this measurement accurately, consistent with existing literature on galaxy 4-point function. We discuss several approaches to estimating the covariance matrix, several of which produce spurious detection. Using a robust, but very suboptimal, covariance matrix derived from subsample bootstrapping, we find no evidence for parity violation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulations of the dark matter distribution throughout the Universe are essential in order to analyse data from cosmological surveys. $N$-body simulations are computationally expensive, and many cheaper alternatives (such as lognormal random fields) fail to reproduce accurate statistics of the smaller, non-linear scales. In this work, we present Psi-GAN (Power-spectrum-informed generative adversarial network), a machine learning model which takes a two-dimensional lognormal dark matter density field and transforms it into a more realistic field. We construct Psi-GAN so that it is continuously conditional, and can therefore generate realistic realisations of the dark matter density field across a range of cosmologies and redshifts in $z \in [0, 3]$. We train Psi-GAN as a generative adversarial network on $2\,000$ simulation boxes from the Quijote simulation suite. We use a novel critic architecture that utilises the power spectrum as the basis for discrimination between real and generated samples. Psi-GAN shows agreement with $N$-body simulations over a range of redshifts and cosmologies, consistently outperforming the lognormal approximation on all tests of non-linear structure, such as being able to reproduce both the power spectrum up to wavenumbers of $1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the bispectra of target $N$-body simulations to within ${\sim}5$ per cent. Our improved ability to model non-linear structure should allow more robust constraints on cosmological parameters when used in techniques such as simulation-based inference.</description>

      <title>Patchy Screening of the CMB from Dark Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study anisotropic (patchy) screening induced by the resonant conversion of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons into dark-sector massive vector bosons (dark photons) as they cross non-linear large scale structure (LSS). Resonant conversion takes place through the kinetic mixing of the photon with the dark photon, one of the simplest low energy extensions to the Standard Model. In the early Universe, resonant conversion can occur when the photon plasma mass, obtained as the photon propagates through the ionized interstellar and intergalactic media, matches the dark photon mass. After the epoch of reionization, resonant conversion occurs mainly in the ionized gas that occupies virialized dark matter halos, for a range of dark photon masses between $10^{-13} {\rm \; eV} \lesssim m_{{\rm A^{\prime}}} \lesssim 10^{-11} {\rm \; eV}$. This leads to new CMB anisotropies that are correlated with LSS, which we refer to as patchy dark screening, in analogy with anisotropies from Thomson screening. Its unique frequency dependence allows it to be distinguished from the blackbody CMB. In this paper, we use a halo model approach to predict the imprint of dark screening on the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies, as well as their correlation with LSS. We then examine the two- and three-point correlation functions of the dark-screened CMB, as well as correlation functions between CMB and LSS observables, to project the sensitivity of future measurements to the kinetic mixing parameter and dark photon mass. We demonstrate that an analysis with existing CMB data can improve upon current constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter by two orders of magnitude with the two-point correlation functions, while data from upcoming CMB experiments and LSS surveys can further improve the reach by another order of magnitude with two- and three-point correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Modular Invariant Slow Roll Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new classes of inflation models based on the modular symmetry, where the modulus field $\tau$ serves as the inflaton. We establish a connection between modular inflation and modular stabilization, wherein the modulus field rolls towards a fixed point along the boundary of the fundamental domain. We find the modular symmetry strongly constrain the possible shape of the potential and identify some parameter space where the inflation predictions agree with cosmic microwave background observations. The tensor-to-scalar ratio is predicted to be smaller than $10^{-6}$ in our models, while the running of spectral index is of the order of $10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>A Trifecta of Modelling Tools: A Bayesian Binary Black Hole Model Selection combining Population Synthesis and Galaxy Formation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) have revealed surprising properties of binary black hole (BBH) populations, but there is still mystery surrounding how these compact objects evolve. We apply Bayesian inference and an efficient method to calculate the BBH merger rates in the Shark host galaxies, to determine the combination of COMPAS parameters that outputs a population most like the GW sources from the LVK transient catalogue. For our COMPAS models, we calculate the likelihood with and without the dependence on the predicted number of BBH merger events. We find strong correlations between hyper-parameters governing the specific angular momentum (AM) of mass lost during mass transfer, the mass-loss rates of Wolf-Rayet stars via winds and the chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) formation channel. We conclude that analysing the marginalised and unmarginalised likelihood is a good indicator of whether the population parameters distribution and number of observed events reflect the LVK data. In doing so, we see that the majority of the models preferred in terms of the population-level parameters of the BBHs greatly overpredict the number of events we should have observed to date. Looking at the smaller number of models which perform well with both likelihoods, we find that those with no CHE, AM loss occurring closer to the donor during the first mass-transfer event, and/or higher rates of mass-loss from Wolf-Rayet winds are generally preferred by current data. We find these conclusions to be robust to our choice of selection criteria.</description>

      <title>Superconducting strings in the two-Higgs doublet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present superconducting vortex solutions in the two-Higgs doublet model which has a gauged $U(1)$ Higgs-family symmetry. We write down an ansatz for the solution and study its basic properties, for the case of both global and gauged symmetries. We demonstrate its prima-facie stability using 3D numerical simulations of a global version of the theory, observing the flow of current along the string. We discuss how generic such a phenomena might be and the possible consequences if such a model is found in nature.</description>

      <title>Measuring Star Formation Histories from Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars: A Demonstration in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how near infrared (NIR) imaging of resolved luminous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can be used to measure well-constrained star formation histories (SFHs) across cosmic time. Using UKIRT J and K-band imaging of M31, we first show excellent agreement over the past $\sim8$ Gyr between the PHAT SFH of M31's outer disk derived from a deep optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD; $\sim3.3\times10^{7}$ stars with $M_{F814W} \lesssim +2$), and our spatially-matched SFH based only on modeling AGB stars on a NIR CMD ($\sim2.3\times10^{4}$ stars with $M_{J} \lesssim -5$). We find that only hundreds of AGB stars are needed for reliable SFH recovery, owing to their excellent age sensitivity in the NIR. We then measure the spatially resolved SFH of M31's inner stellar halo ($D_{M31, projected} \sim20-30$ kpc) using $\sim10^4$ AGB stars. We find: (i) a dominant burst of star formation across M31's inner stellar halo from $4-5$ Gyr ago and lower level, spatially distributed star formation $\sim1-2$ Gyr ago; (ii) a younger 'quenching time' in the vicinity of NGC 205 ($\sim1$ Gyr ago) than near M32 ($\sim1.6$ Gyr ago); (iii) $M_{\star}\sim4\pm0.5\times10^9 M_{\odot}$ formed over the past $\sim8$ Gyr. We discuss some caveats and the enormous potential of resolved AGB stars in the NIR for measuring SFHs back to ancient epochs ($\sim13$ Gyr ago) in galaxies to large distances ($D\gtrsim20$ Mpc) with JWST, Roman, and Euclid.</description>
