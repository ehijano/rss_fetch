      <title>Observational features of massive boson stars with thin disk accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, based on the action of a complex scalar field minimally coupled to a gravitational field, we numerically obtain a series of massive boson star solutions in a spherically symmetric background with a quartic-order self-interaction potential. Then, considering a thin accretion flow with a certain four-velocity, we further investigate the observable appearance of the boson star using the ray-tracing method and stereographic projection technique. As a horizonless compact object, the boson star's thin disk images clearly exhibit multiple light rings and a dark central region, with up to five bright rings. As the observer's position changes, the light rings of some boson stars deform into a symmetrical "horseshoe" or "crescent" shape. When the emitted profile varies, the images may display distinct observational signatures of a "Central Emission Region". Meanwhile, it shows that the corresponding polarized images not only reveal the spacetime features of boson stars but also reflect the properties of the accretion disk and its magnetic field structure. By comparing with black hole, we find that both the polarized signatures and thin disk images can effectively provide a possible basis for distinguishing boson stars from black holes. However, within the current resolution limits of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), boson stars may still closely mimic the appearance of black holes, making them challenging to distinguish at this stage.</description>

      <title>Inspiral to Ring-down, an Almost Exact One-Body Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XOB provides an almost eXact One-Body approach for the conservative part of binary merger dynamics of general relativity, which applies to the full three stages of the merger process, and allows the feature of gravitational waves be related to the inner-structure of merging bodies directly. We clarify the sense of exactness of this approach in this work and calculate the gravitational waveform of black hole binary merger process subsequently. Our calculation shows that, the waveform exhibits damping tail only when the BHs possess regular internals and experience rotational symmetry enhancement as the merger progresses on. Basing on this point, we calculate lower and upper boundings for the real part of the lowest tone quasi-normal frequency of the merger product and get results consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Inside Black Holes, Singularity or Complementarity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through two exact solution families to the Einstein equation and the one-to-one correspondence between their free parameters, we show that the ensemble of collapsars with only close-to-implementing horizon in the Schwarzschild time definition and the over-cross-oscillatory solid-balls in the Lemaitre time definition constitute two complementary description for the microscopic state of black holes formed through gravitational collapse. We quantise the solutions in the Schwarzschild time definition and show that the area law formula of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy follows naturally from the wave-functional's degeneracy of the collapsing materials. In two companion works, supports from the gravitational wave of binary merger observation and predictions for the fast radio burst of single body perturbations of this complementarity will be reported independently.</description>

      <title>Love Numbers of Covariant Loop Quantum Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the linear static response of three covariant loop quantum black holes, namely, the two models proposed by Zhang, Lewandowski, Ma, and Yang (ZLMY) and the Alonso-Bardaji, Brizuela, and Vera (ABV) model, to an external tidal field. Using effective spacetime description, we uniquely extract the tidal Love numbers (TLNs) using perturbative solutions derived from the Green's function technique. Our findings reveal that, in contrast to the classical Schwarzschild black hole, the TLNs for loop quantum black holes are generally nonzero. The sign and magnitude of the TLNs depend on the spin of the external tidal field, the multipole number, and the details of the loop quantized model. The magnitude of the TLNs is found to be Planck scale suppressed for all three models, implying a stronger tidal deformability for black holes with Planckian mass. Additionally, for the same black hole mass, the magnitude of the TLNs for the ABV model is larger than the ZLMY models. We also find that the TLNs exhibit logarithmic running behavior at the leading order, even for low multipole numbers, in response to scalar and vector field perturbations. These distinct features of the TLNs can serve as a potential tool to differentiate between various quantization ambiguities arising in loop quantum black holes. We briefly discuss the potential phenomenological and theoretical implications of nonzero TLNs for black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Signatures from metastable oppositely-charged black hole binaries in scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct numerical simulations of inspiraling, oppositely-charged black holes in the class of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories that exhibit spontaneous black hole scalarization. For quasi-circular, equal-mass binaries near the existence threshold for scalarized solutions, we find a new phenomenon whereby one of the component black holes can suddenly flip the sign of its scalar charge during the inspiral. We confirm this phenomenon with two independent codes and identify two key signatures thereof: a change in the dominant scalar radiation channel (from dipolar to quadrupolar), and, strikingly, the introduction of eccentricity in the orbit. This scenario offers a concrete example of potential nonlinear departures from general relativity in the inspiral of binary black holes in alternative theories of gravity and is of relevance for the development of new tests of gravity.</description>

      <title>Stable initial conditions and analytical investigations of cosmological perturbations in a modified loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study analytically cosmological perturbations in a modified theory of loop quantum cosmologies, the so-called mLQC-I quantization, by using the uniform asymptotic approximation (UAA). The advantage of UAA is that the errors can be minimized by properly choosing a free function introduced in the method, and the upper bounds of errors are known in each order of the approximations. Once such a free function is fixed, the approximation depends on the nature and number of turning points. In the dressed metric approach of cosmological perturbations, we find that this in turn depends on the values of the comoving wavenumber k of the mode function and in general can be divided into three different cases: i)$k \gtrsim k_2$, ii) $k_e \lesssim k \lesssim k_2$ and iii) $k \lesssim k_e$, where $k_2 \simeq 1.61 \; m_P$ and $k_e \simeq 0.97 \; m_P$ with $m_P$ being the Planck mass. In each case, the mode function is expressed explicitly in terms of well-known mathematical functions with two integration constants, which will be determined uniquely by the initial condition. Imposing it in the remote contracting phase, we identify an initial state that is stable, minimizes particle creations and diagonalizes the Hamiltonian, despite that some of the modes may be still outside of the Hubble horizon and not in their adiabatic states at the initial time.</description>

      <title>PINCH: Pipeline-Informed Noise Characterization of Gravitational Wave Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to identify and categorize gravitational wave candidate triggers identified by matched filtering gravitational wave searches (pipelines) caused by transient noise (glitches) in gravitational wave detectors using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Our approach involves training SVM models on pipeline triggers which occur outside periods of excess noise to distinguish between triggers caused by random noise and those induced by glitches. This method is applied independently to the triggers produced by the GstLAL search pipeline on data from the LIGO Hanford and Livingston observatories during the second half of the O3 observing run. The trained SVM models assign scores to ambiguous triggers, quantifying their similarity to triggers caused by random fluctuations, with triggers with scores above a defined threshold being classified as glitch-induced. Analysis of these triggers reveals the distinct impact of different glitch classes on the search pipeline, including their distribution in relevant parameter spaces. We use metrics such as the Bhattacharyya coefficient and an over-representation ratio to quantify the consistency and prevalence of glitch impacts over time and across parameter spaces. Our findings demonstrate that certain glitch types disproportionately affect specific regions of the parameter space, and that certain glitch types manifest themselves in the eyes of the pipeline in consistent ways while other types vary significantly. This method provides a framework for understanding and mitigating the influence of non-Gaussian transients on gravitational wave search pipelines, with implications for improving detection sensitivity and better understanding noise populations.</description>

Abstract: We present an asymptotically flat spherically symmetric non-singular metric that describes gravitational collapse and matter bounce with transient black hole and white hole regions. The metric provides a dynamical counterpart to proposed static non-singular black holes, and a phenomenological model for possible black hole to white hole transitions in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes from EFT of Black Hole Perturbations in Vector-Tensor Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of odd-parity perturbations on a static and spherically symmetric black hole background with a timelike vector field based on the effective field theory (EFT) approach. We derive the quadratic Lagrangian written in terms of two master variables, corresponding to the tensor and vector gravitons, which are coupled in general, while they can be decoupled on a stealth Schwarzschild(-de Sitter) background. For the stealth Schwarzschild background, we find that the quasinormal mode frequencies for both degrees of freedom are obtained from those in general relativity by simple scaling. Nonetheless, due to the fact that the metric perturbation is a non-trivial linear combination of the two degrees of freedom with different QNM spectra, the ringdown gravitational waves may exhibit characteristic modulation that can in principle be a signature of vector-tensor gravity.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of the Possible Consistent Model of Parity Violations in the Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity: Generalized Background Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a symmetric teleparallel gravity model that extends the general relativity equivalent model by several parity violating interactions between the gravitational field and a scalar field. We derive three different families of background solutions in flat FRW universe, with three classes of different connections. Through investigations on the linear cosmological perturbations, we show that one of the vector modes of this model will evolve into a ghost field at high energy, and the ghost instability can be cancelled only under specific combinations of the coefficients. On two of three families of backgrounds, such combination remains the same as the one we have investigated in our previous work; while on the other family of background, one additional condition should be taken into consider.</description>

      <title>Canonical Structure and Hidden Symmetries in Scalar Field Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate hidden symmetries in minimally coupled scalar field cosmology within the FLRW universe, and a perfect fluid with and without interaction to the scalar field. We show that for an exponential potential there exists a set of canonical transformations through which the cosmological field equations can be recast in the form of a free particle in flat space. Based on this equivalence, we construct a mapping that generates cosmological solutions with interaction terms, corresponding to a chameleon mechanism. Finally, we discuss how this class of canonical transformations can relate the solution spaces of different cosmological models, such as of the scalar field and of the $\Lambda$-Cosmology.</description>

      <title>A note on the calculation of the Komar integral in the Lorentzian Taub-NUT spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that one can derive consistent thermodynamical expressions in the Lorentzian Taub--NUT spacetime keeping the Misner-string singularities and taking into account their contributions in the Komar integrals. We show how the same results are obtained when the Mister-string singularities are removed by using Misner's procedure because, even though the complete spacetime has no such singularities anymore, they are unavoidable in all spacelike hypersurfaces which are used in the Komar integrals. Different choices of hypersurfaces may contain different strings and lead to different physics, though.</description>

      <title>A Falsifiable Alternative to General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotically Weyl-invariant gravity (AWIG) is further developed within the Palatini formalism as a power-counting renormalizable alternative to general relativity (GR). An expression for the dimensionless exponent n(R) is derived based on dynamical dimensional reduction. We show that this version of AWIG naturally resolves several theoretical issues normally associated with the Palatini formalism. A falsifiable prediction regarding the frequency of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers is made. A preliminary analysis of gravitational wave GW150914 yields a maximum tension of 0.9{\sigma} with GR and marginally favours AWIG. A similar analysis of gravitational wave GW151226 yields a maximum tension of 2.7{\sigma} with GR and favours AWIG more significantly.</description>

      <title>Constraining scalar-tensor theories from higher harmonics with GW230529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Advanced LIGO and Virgo collaborations recently detected a gravitational wave event, GW230529\_181500, during the fourth observing run, which is most plausibly attributed to the merger of a neutron star and a black hole. This observation provides an opportunity to test a class of gravitational theories that deviate from general relativity. In such theories, additional terms contribute to the gravitational wave signal only in cases of asymmetric binaries. This study focuses on two scalar-tensor models within this class of theories: the Screened Modified Gravity and Brans-Dicke theory. These models have potential applications in areas such as dark matter, dark energy, cosmic inflation, and primordial nucleosynthesis. With the GW230529\_181500 and Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo analyses, we derive a 90\% credible lower bound as $ \frac{\varphi_{\rm_{VEV}}}{M_{\rm Pl}}&lt;1.7\times10^{-2}$ and $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;25.12$ by using dominant-mode correction. Asymmetric binary systems usually have a significant mass ratio, in such cases, higher harmonic modes cannot be neglected. Our work considers higher harmonic corrections from scalar-tensor theories and provides a tighter constraint of $ \frac{\varphi_{\rm_{VEV}}}{M_{\rm Pl}}&lt;1.5\times10^{-2}$ and $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;32.68$, with a 13.3\% and 30.1\% improvement respectively. Combining GW230529\_181500, GW200115 and GW190814 and including higher modes, the constraint is improved to $\frac{\varphi_{\rm_{VEV}}}{M_{\rm Pl}}&lt;7.84\times10^{-3}$ and $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;123.75$. This is currently the strongest constraint from GWs, contingent upon GW190814 being an NSBH event.</description>

      <title>A fast deep-learning approach to probing primordial black hole populations in gravitational wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), envisioned as a compelling dark matter candidate and a window onto early-Universe physics, may contribute to the part of the gravitational-wave (GW) signals detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network. Traditional hierarchical Bayesian analysis, which relies on precise GW-event posterior estimates, for extracting the information of potential PBH population from GW events become computationally prohibitive for catalogs of hundreds of events. Here, we present a fast deep-learning framework, leveraging Transformer and normalizing flows, that maps GW-event posterior samples to joint posterior distributions over the hyperparameters of the PBH population. Our approach yields accurate credible intervals while reducing end-to-end inference time to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ s on a single GPU. These results underscore the potential of deep learning for fast, high-accurately PBH population studies in the era of next-generation GW detectors.</description>

Abstract: The Dehnen - type dark matter density distribution model is mainly used for dwarf galaxies. In recent years, researchers have speculated that black holes may exist in this dark matter model and have given the black hole metric solutions. On this basis, this paper conducts a systematic study on the quasinormal modes of a Schwarzschild black hole in a Dehnen - (1,4, 5/2) dark matter halo, revealing the influences of dark matter distribution and perturbation field types on the black hole's quasinormal modes.The research uses the shadow radius data of the M87$^{\ast}$ black hole. Through the geodesic equation, two sets of dark matter halo parameter values of $\rho_{\rm s}$ and $r_{\rm s}$ are determined, and the specific numerical values of the black hole's event horizon radius, photon sphere radius, and shadow radius under the corresponding conditions are obtained. The wave equations and effective potentials of the black hole under the perturbations of the scalar field, electromagnetic field, and axial gravitational were analyzed. It was found that the larger the values of $\rho_{\rm s}$ or $r_{\rm s}$, the smaller the peak value of the effective potential, and the wave function oscillation slows down with a lower frequency. The black hole remains stable under perturbations. These studies provide relevant data for the quasinormal modes of the Schwarzschild black hole in the Dehnen-(1,4, 5/2) type dark matter halo. They also offer crucial evidence for understanding the interaction mechanism between the black hole and the dark matter halo.</description>

      <title>Some exact results on the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known Bielinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) scenario for the universe near the cosmological singularity is supplemented with a few exact results following from the BKL asymptotic of the Einstein equations: (1) The cosmological singularity is proved to be an inevitable beginning or end of the universe as described by these equations. (2) Attaining the singularity from shrinking initial conditions requires infinite time parameter $\tau$; no singularity of any kind may occur in a finite $\tau$. (3) The previously found exact solution [P.G. and W. Piechocki, Eur. Phys. J. C 82:216 (2022)] is the only asymptotic with well-defined proportions between the directional scale factors which have been appropriately compensated against indefinite growth of anisotropy. In all other cases, the universe undergoes oscillations of Kasner type, which reduce the length scales to nearly zero in some directions, while largely extending it in the others. Together with instability of the exact solution [op. cit.], it makes the approach to the singularity inevitably chaotic. (4) Reduced equations are proposed and explicitly solved to describe these oscillations near their turning points. In logarithmic variables, the oscillations are found to have sawtooth shapes. A by-product is a quadric of kinetic energy, a simple geometric tool for all this analysis.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining the equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating, self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the classical challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating foundational theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that enhances the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method applies Lie group theory to vector flows and solves functional equations using the Neumann series. We extend Clairaut's classical linear perturbation theory into the nonlinear regime via Lie exponential mapping, yielding a system of nonlinear functional equations for gravitational potential and fluid density. These are analytically tractable using shift operators and Neumann series summation, enabling explicit characterization of density and gravitational perturbations. This leads to an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing equilibrium deformation without assuming slow rotation. We validate the framework through exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques for analyzing radial harmonics and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order nonlinear corrections efficiently. The framework includes boundary conditions for Legendre harmonics, supporting the derivation of nonlinear Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments. This work offers a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational and tidal deformations in astrophysical and planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Absolute entropy and the observer's no-boundary state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the no-boundary proposal for closed universes with an observer. We argue that the observer's no-boundary state is the identity operator on the physical Hilbert space, i.e. the maximum entropy state. Geometrically, the no-boundary state is a bra-ket wormhole. Our result is consistent with all previously discussed cases of traces for invariantly defined regions. We explicitly show that the observer's no-boundary state is an identity operator in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Expectation values in the no-boundary state provide a trace for the observer's algebra, which allows one to define von Neumann entropy for observers in different universes as the relative entropy with respect to the no-boundary state.</description>

      <title>Are magnetic fields in cosmic voids primordial?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of magnetic fields in the voids of the large-scale structure of the Universe has been a multifaceted open puzzle for decades. On one hand, their origin is not clear with most of the magnetogenesis models using physics beyond the standard model in the early Universe, and on the other hand, their existence and potential role in explaining the spectra of TeV blazars have been intensely debated in the past decade. Here, we show that void fields must exist and can be generated using classical electrodynamics in the late Universe. Specifically, we use the dipole component of the galactic fields, decaying as $r^{-3}$, and show that this generates space-filling magnetic fields in voids with sufficient amplitude to explain the blazar spectra and the lack of GeV halos observed by Fermi-LAT. Our results also show that the void fields might be too strong even for Cherenkov Telescope Array to observe the GeV halos. While primordial magnetic fields could still have been generated through some non-standard physics in the early Universe, our results show that the need for primordial magnetic fields is not strengthened by the presence of void magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Determination of the Tidal Deformability of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ Neutron Star from Gravitational-Wave Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal deformability of a 1.4 $M_\odot$ neutron star provides a pivotal window into the physics of dense nuclear matter, bridging gravitational-wave(GW), electromagnetic observations and nuclear physics. In this work, we present a novel, data-driven approach to constrain $\Lambda_{1.4}$ without invoking specific equation-of-state(EOS) models. By interpolating directly over the mass--tidal-deformability posteriors from GW170817, we obtain an EOS-independent constraint of $ \Lambda_{1.4} \;=\; 222.89_{-98.85}^{+420.33}. $ We further combine these GW-based results with the X-ray EOS-independent constraint from \cite{Huang_2025}, deriving a multimessenger limit of $ \Lambda_{1.4} \;=\; 265.18_{-104.38}^{+237.88}, $ which remains largely EOS agnostic. This framework demonstrates that higher-order terms neglected in linear expansion methods do not significantly affect $\Lambda_{1.4}$ estimates under current observational uncertainties. As gravitational-wave detectors improve in sensitivity and more binary neutron-star mergers are discovered, our purely data-driven strategy can serve as a robust standard baseline for extracting neutron-star interior properties without relying on unverified EOS models.</description>

      <title>The Long Road to Alignment: Measuring Black Hole Spin Orientation with Expanding Gravitational-Wave Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the distribution of spin tilts-the angles between the spin vectors and the binary orbital angular momentum-in stellar-mass binary black holes detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA would provide valuable insight into their astrophysical origins. Analyses of the 69 binary black holes detected through LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's third observing run yielded model-dependent conclusions, particularly regarding whether the spin tilt distribution exhibits a peak near alignment, as expected for binaries formed in galactic fields. In this work, we simulate populations of up to 1500 binary black hole systems with parameters consistent with the default GWTC-3 analysis, while introducing a correlation that favors small spin tilts for binaries with mass ratios near unity. We find that: (a) spurious peaks away from perfect alignment are possible even with catalogs of up to 300 sources; (b) establishing a definitive peak at alignment remains difficult even with 1500 detections; (c) integrated measurements -- such as the fraction of events with tilt angles smaller than $10^\circ$ or greater than $90^\circ$ -- are more robust and should be preferred, achieving relative 90\% credible uncertainties of $\sim20\%-80\%$ with 1500 sources; and (d) even with the largest simulated catalogs, evidence for a mass ratio-tilt correlation remains inconclusive. Our results suggest that identifying the formation channels of merging black holes using spin tilts will remain challenging, but that model-independent measurements may yield more informative insights over model parameters themselves.</description>

      <title>Beyond Noether: A Covariant Study of Poisson-Lie Symmetries in Low Dimensional Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore global Poisson-Lie (PL) symmetries using a Lagrangian, or ``covariant phase space" approach, that manifestly preserves spacetime covariance. PL symmetries are the classical analog of quantum-group symmetries. In the Noetherian framework symmetries leave the Lagrangian invariant up to boundary terms and necessarily yield (on closed manifolds) $\mathfrak{g}^{*}$-valued conserved charges which serve as Hamiltonian generators of the symmetry itself. Non-trivial PL symmetries transcend this framework by failing to be symplectomorphisms and by admitting (conserved) non-Abelian group-valued momentum maps. In this paper we discuss various structural and conceptual challenges associated with the implementation of PL symmetries in field theory, focusing in particular on non-locality. We examine these issues through explicit examples of low-dimensional field theories with non-trivial PL symmetries: the deformed spinning top (or, the particle with curved momentum and configuration space) in 0+1D; the non-linear $\sigma$-model by Klim\v{c}\'ik and \v{S}evera (KS) in 1+1D; and gravity with a cosmological constant in 2+1D. Although these examples touch on systems of different dimensionality, they are all ultimately underpinned by 2D $\sigma$-models, specifically the A-model and KS model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how statistical anisotropy (SA) in matter distributions affects the shapes and orientations of cluster-sized halos, using cosmological $N$-body simulations that incorporate SA. While the three-dimensional halo shape parameters show little dependence on SA, we find that halo orientations are significantly influenced, with halos tending to align either perpendicular or parallel to the SA direction. This SA-induced alignment becomes more prominent for more massive halos. Our findings suggest that observational measurements of projected halo shapes, such as those derived from galaxy cluster-galaxy lensing, could provide a novel probe of SA in the universe.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Large-Scale Structures in the Anisotropies of the Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the cross-correlation between the anisotropies of the cosmological gravitational wave background (CGWB) and the galaxy density contrast. We show that the cross-correlation is non-zero due to the {\it late} integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect experienced by tensor modes. We study the detection prospects of the cross-correlation signal against cosmic variance (CV), and in the light of incoming LSS and GW surveys, where we found that the signal under certain conditions could be distinguishable from noise. In addition, by considering a CGWB sourced by scalar-induced gravitational waves, and the inclusion of a scale-dependent galaxy bias, we use the cross-correlation to forecast local primordial non-Gaussianity, where we find $\sigma(f_\text{NL}^\text{loc})\sim10$ for CV only and a LSST-like survey. Moreover, by combining the Fisher information of CGWB$\times$LSS with LSS, we are able to improve the constraints by 4\% compared to an LSS-only analysis. Our results imply that a cross-correlation between GW anisotropies and LSS can indeed come from a stochastic background of cosmological origin and could be used to distinguish it from an astrophysical one.</description>

      <title>A Deep Dive into classical and Topological CFT Thermodynamics in Lifshitz and Hyperscaling Violating Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To effectively utilize the AdS/CFT correspondence, a precise set of rules must be established to guide the translation of computed quantities in the gravitational sector into their CFT counterparts, and vice versa. This framework is commonly referred to as the holographic dictionary. The formulation of such dictionaries opens a two-way gateway, allowing researchers to extend theoretical principles and findings from one domain into the other for further exploration and study. The development of a holographic dictionary for Lifshitz black holes and hyperscaling violation (HSV) models \cite{6} has provided an essential foundation for studying CFT thermodynamics and phase behavior of these black holes. Based on this framework, we will investigate their thermodynamic properties using two distinct approaches. In the first step, we adopt the classical and traditional method, identifying critical points to examine the behavior of the free energy function as a function of temperature near the critical boundary. By analyzing its behavior, we will study phase transitions and then proceed to evaluate the stability of the models. In the next step, to compare both methodologies and highlight their equivalence, particularly demonstrating the accessibility of the topological method compared to the classical approach, we will analyze phase behavior through the lens of topological charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that general relativistic corrections to the accretion of relativistic matter onto primordial black holes (PBHs) can significantly enhance their mass growth during the early Universe. Contrary to previous Newtonian treatments, our analysis reveals that PBH masses can increase by an order of magnitude before evaporation, leading to substantial modifications of their lifetime and cosmological imprints. We quantify the resulting shifts in the minimum PBH mass constrained by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), the revised lower bound for PBHs surviving today, and the dark matter parameter space allowed by PBH evaporation. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced accretion alters the high-frequency gravitational wave spectrum from PBH evaporation, potentially within the reach of future detectors. Our results provide a comprehensive, relativistically consistent framework to delineate the role of PBHs in early-universe cosmology and dark matter phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Detector Based Evaluation of Extractable Entanglement in Flat spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy (EE) is widely used to quantify quantum correlations in field theory, with the well-known result in two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) predicting a logarithmic divergence with the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff. However, this expression lacks operational meaning: it remains unclear how much of the entanglement is physically extractable via local measurements. In this work, we investigate the operationally accessible entanglement by employing a pair of Unruh-DeWitt detectors, each interacting with complementary regions of a quantum field. We derive an upper bound on the entanglement that can be harvested by such detectors and show that it scales as a double logarithm with respect to the UV cutoff-significantly weaker than the single-logarithmic divergence of the standard CFT result. This work provides an operational perspective on field-theoretic entanglement and sets fundamental limits on its extractability.</description>

      <title>Current constraints on the minimally extended varying speed of light model through the cosmic distance duality relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most crucial tests of the standard cosmological model consists on testing possible variations on fundamental physical constants. In frameworks such as the minimally extended varying speed of light model (meVSL), the relationship between the luminosity distance ($D_{\text{L}}$) and the angular diameter distance ($D_{\text{A}}$), namely the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), is expected to deviate from $\eta(z) \equiv D_{\text{L}}(z)/D_{\text{A}}(z) = (1+z)^{2}$, making it a powerful probe of a potential variation of such a fundamental constant. Hence, we test the viability of the meVSL model through the CDDR by comparing $D_{\text{A}}$ measurements, provided by the transverse (2D) and anisotropic (3D) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations from different surveys, like SDSS, DES and DESI, in combination with $D_{\text{L}}$ measurements from Pantheon+ type Ia Supernova (SNe) compilation. The Gaussian Process reconstruction is employed on the SN data to match $D_{\text{A}}$ with $D_{\text{L}}$ at the same redshift. We find no deviation of the standard CDDR relation within 1-2$\sigma$ confidence level when considering SNe with 2D and 3D BAO samples combined together, as well as when considering SNe with 3D BAO only. However, when SNe and 2D BAO only are considered, the standard CDDR is only recovered at $\sim 4\sigma$ confidence level. However, such a result might be due to some recently discussed tensions between SN and BAO datasets, especially at low redshifts, in addition to possible inconsistencies between the BAO datasets individually. Therefore, our results show no significant evidence in favour of the meVSL model, once these potential systematics are taken into account.</description>

      <title>CMB Lensing Trispectrum as a Probe of Parity Violation in LSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing trispectrum is sensitive to parity violation in Large-Scale Structure (LSS). We obtain a compact expression for the reduced lensing trispectrum that is general for any input matter trispectrum. We then present as an example a simple parity-violating toy model for the latter, and explicitly compute the parity-odd lensing trispectrum, including an estimate of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). This work serves as a proof of principle, demonstrating how future studies of more physically motivated models can be conducted. It also provides an intuitive physical explanation of why CMB lensing is sensitive to parity. Our work is the first to point out that secondary CMB anisotropies can be used to probe parity in LSS, and will be important in enabling upcoming experiments such as Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 to contribute maximal power on parity violation.</description>

Abstract: Massive scalar fields are promising candidates to address many unresolved problems in fundamental physics. We report the first model-agnostic Bayesian search of massive scalar fields in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational-wave data. We find no evidence for such fields and place the most stringent upper limits on their coupling for scalar masses $\lesssim 2\times10^{-12}\,{\rm eV}$. We exemplify the strength of these bounds by applying them to massive scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, finding the tightest constraints on the coupling constant to date, $\sqrt{\alpha_{\rm GB}}\lesssim 1\,{\rm km}$ for scalar masses $\lesssim 10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}$ to 90% confidence.</description>

      <title>Beyond Buchdahl's limit: bilayered stars and thin-shell configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the theoretical motivations behind the belief that black holes as described by general relativity exist in nature is that it is hard to find matter configurations that mimic their properties, especially their compactness. One of the classic results that goes in this direction is the socalled Buchdahl limit: a bound for the maximum compactness that spherically symmetric isotropic fluid spheres in hydrostatic equilibrium can possibly achieve with an outward-decreasing energy density. However, physically realistic situations could violate both isotropy and the monotonicity of the density profile. Notably, Bondi already showed that if the density profile is allowed to be arbitrary (but remains non-negative), a less restrictive compactness bound emerges. Furthermore, if negative energy densities are permitted, configurations can approach the black hole compactness limit arbitrarily closely. In this work we introduce a set of simple bilayered and thin-shell toy models designed to illustrate the effect of relaxing separately the assumptions of Buchdahl's theorem. Within these models we highlight the existence of two special examples that we have called AdS stars and Einstein Static stars. We also discuss how these toy models may represent some of the main features of realistic systems, and how they could be extended to find more refined models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the analytic evaluation of the gravitational energy and of the angular momentum flux with tidal effects for inspiraling compact binaries, at next-to-next-to-leading post-Newtoian (2PN) order, within the effective field theory diagrammatic approach. We first compute the stress-energy tensor for a binary system, that requires the evaluation of two-point Feynman integrals, up to two loops. Then, we extract the multipole moments of the system, which we present for generic orbits in center-of-mass coordinates, and which are needed for the evaluation of the total gravitational energy and the angular momentum flux, for generic orbits. Finally, we provide the expression of gauge invariant quantities such as the fluxes, and the mode amplitudes and phase of the emitted gravitational wave, for circular orbits. Our findings are useful to update earlier theoretical studies as well as related phenomenological analyses, and waveform models</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12419v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deepen the analysis of the cosmological acceleration produced by quantum gravity dynamics in the formalism of group field theory condensate cosmology, treated at the coarse-grained level via a phenomenological model, in the language of hydrodynamics on minisuperspace. Specifically, we conduct a detailed analysis of the late-time evolution, which shows a phantom-like phase followed by an asymptotic De Sitter expansion. We argue that the model indicates a recent occurrence of the phantom crossing and we extract a more precise expression for the effective cosmological constant, linking its value to other parameters in the model and to the scale of the quantum bounce in the early universe evolution. Additionally, we show how the phantom phase produced by our quantum gravity dynamics increases the inferred value of the current Hubble parameter based on observed data, indicating a possible quantum gravity mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension. Our results represent a concrete example of how quantum gravity can provide an explanation for large-scale cosmological puzzles, in an emergent spacetime scenario.</description>

Abstract: Conserved currents are discussed for static Conformal Killing Gravity, with explicit expressions in static spherical symmetry with anisotropic matter fluid or coupled to (non)linear electromagnetism. They are found in the reformulation of the third order equations by Harada as Einstein equations with sources supplemented by a divergence free anisotropic conformal Killing tensor. A conserved current proposed by Altas and Tekin is also evaluated, and found nonzero for the vacuum solution by Harada.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A horizonless ultracompact object can have a stable antiphoton sphere, which causes the strong deflection of photons inside the unstable photon sphere, leading to the formation of distinctive inner photon rings. In this work, we present analytical descriptions for the shape, thickness and interference pattern of higher-order inner photon rings. By taking the static spherically symmetric Schwarzschild star with a photon sphere as an example, we find that its inner photon rings can be more non-circular and thicker than the outer ones, and show that the inclusion of the inner photon rings can give rise to new features in the interferometric pattern. Our formulae can also be applied to other ultracompact objects, providing a convenient way to study the observational properties of their higher-order photon rings.</description>

Abstract: Using the formalism of geometrothermodynamics, we investigate the phase-transition structure and microstructure of the Kerr-anti-de Sitter black hole and show the relationship with its shadow structure. By treating the curvature radius as a thermodynamic variable, we ensure scaling consistency and model the system as quasi-homogeneous. In the canonical ensemble, we identify critical points and characterize both first- and second-order phase transitions independently of pressure. In the grand-canonical ensemble, we reveal a distinct phase structure, including the Hawking-Page transition. We derive analytical expressions for the Kerr-anti-de Sitter black hole shadow and its critical parameters, using shadow thermodynamics to construct asymmetric shadow profiles that capture the phase-transition structure. Finally, we show that the singularities of the geometrothermodynamic curvature in the shadow align with divergences in thermodynamic response functions, confirming the correspondence between shadows, phase transitions, and microstructure.</description>

      <title>Measuring spin precession from massive black hole binaries with gravitational waves: insights from time-domain signal morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robustly measuring binary black hole spins via gravitational waves is key to understanding these systems' astrophysical origins, but remains challenging -- especially for high-mass systems, whose signals are short and dominated by the merger. Nonetheless, events like GW190521 show that strong spin precession can indeed be gleaned from high-mass systems. In this work, we track how spin precession imprints on simulated high-mass binary black hole signals cycle-by-cycle using time-domain inference. We investigate a suite of signals, all with the same spins and (near-unity) mass ratio but different signal-to-noise ratios, total masses, and extrinsic angles, which affect the observed waveform morphology. We truncate each signal at various times and infer source parameters using only the data before or after each cutoff. The resultant posterior allows us to identify which time segments of each signal inform its spin precession constraints. We find that at a sufficiently high post-peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, $\rho\sim 20$), spin precession can be constrained by the NRSur7dq4 waveform model when just the post-peak data (i.e., ringdown) is visible. Similarly, at a large enough pre-cutoff SNR ($\rho\sim 10$), spin precession can be constrained using only pre-peak data (i.e., inspiral); this occurs for signals with detector-frame total mass $\lesssim 100 M_{\odot}$ at GW190521's SNR. Finally, we vary the inclination, polarization, and phase angles, finding that their configuration need not be fine-tuned to measure spin precession, even for very high-mass and short signals with 2-3 observable cycles. We do not find that the same morphological features consistently drive precession constraints: in some signals, precession inference hinges on the relationship between a loud merger and quiet pre-merger cycle, as was the case for GW190521, but this is not generically true.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.06232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider at a finite temperature $T$ a superfluid moving with a velocity $v$ relative to the thermal bath or its normal component. From Landau's argument there exists a critical $v_c (T)$ beyond which excitations can be spontaneously generated and the system becomes unstable. Identifying the final state induced by such an instability has been an outstanding open question. Using holographic duality we perform dynamical simulations of evolutions from initial unstable states, and find that the system settles to a homogenous superfluid state with a final velocity below the critical velocity. The dynamical evolution process appears to be highly chaotic, exhibiting transient turbulence. Nevertheless we are able to identify from the simulations a universal physical mechanism for the reduction of superfluid velocity, in terms of spontaneous nucleation of solitons. We also derive a simple analytic formula which relates the final velocity to the number of solitons nucleated during the evolution.</description>

Abstract: We study the details of the explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking of the constrained 3BF action representing the Standard Model coupled to Einstein-Cartan gravity. First we discuss how each particular constraint breaks the original symmetry of the topological 3BF action. Then we investigate the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism for the electroweak theory in the constrained 3BF form, in order to demonstrate that they can indeed be performed in the framework of higher gauge theory. A formulation of the Proca action as a constrained 3BF theory is also studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Shadow of quadrupole-deformed compact objects in a local dark matter shell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates observational properties, namely the shadow and photon ring structure, of emission profiles originating near compact objects. In particular, we consider a distorted and deformed compact object characterised by two quadrupole parameters and surrounded by an optically thin and geometrically thin accretion disk with different emission profiles modelled by Johnson's Standard-Unbound (SU) distribution in the reference frame of the emitter. Under these assumptions, we produce the observed intensity profiles and shadow images for a face-on observer. Our results indicate that, due to the fact that modifications of the quadrupole parameters affect the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the unstable photon orbits on the equatorial plane, the observed shadow images and their properties are significantly influenced by the quadrupole parameters and emission profiles. Furthermore, we analyse the impact of the presence of a dark matter halo in the observational imprints considered and verify that both the increase in the matter contained in the halo or the decrease in the length-scale of the halo lead to an increase in the size of the observed shadow. Our results indicate potential degeneracies between the observational features of distorted and deformed compact objects with those of spherically symmetric blackholes, which could be assessed by a comparison with the current and future generation of optical experiments in gravitational physics.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Fermionic Quantum Fluid from Standard Model Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model of dark matter as a superconducting fluid of Cooper pairs of right handed neutrinos or of vector-like quarks. The superconducting dark matter is induced by attractive channels in the Standard Model Higgs and color sectors of the Standard Model, respectively. We show that, for each case, the solution to the gap equation provides viable dark matter candidates for suitable chemical potential values. The mechanism yields an ultra-light neutrino condensate with a mass of $m_{\rm DM} \sim 10^{-19} \text{eV}$ or a vector-like quark condensate with wide range of possible masses. Both cosmological and particle physics constraints on the model lead to a connection between the number of effective relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, and the chemical potential and CMB temperature at the time of fermion creation. We also find a relation between the superconducting fermion and baryon densities, with implications for the coincidence between the dark matter and baryon densities in standard cosmology. Given the natural $\text{eV}$ scale of neutrinos, this mechanism may have implications for the Hubble tension.</description>

Abstract: The brick wall model is a semi-classical approach to understanding the microscopic origin of black hole entropy. We outline the formalism for the brick wall model in arbitrary number of dimensions and generalize it to include both charged spacetimes and charged probes in order to systematically show how to calculate the entropy for any black hole, in higher orders of the WKB approximation. We calculate the entropy for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and charged BTZ black holes, and by looking at the chargeless limits we recover the entropy of the Schwarzschild and neutral BTZ black holes. We also study noncommutative corrections to the black hole entropy by using a Drinfeld twist to deform spacetime symmetries. Using the noncommutative action for a charged scalar field, we derive the noncommutative Klein-Gordon equation and the radial equation in arbitrary dimension on which we generalize the brick wall method. We study case by case the noncommutative Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and noncommutative charged BTZ black holes, the entropy of which we calculate using the generalized brick wall method. Corrections due to higher order in the WKB approximation arise, and they are given by the logarithms of the black hole area. The corrections in the lowest order of WKB due to noncommutativity are also given by the logarithms of the black hole area.</description>

      <title>On the use of galaxy catalogs in gravitational-wave parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in gravitational-wave multi-messenger astrophysics is the imprecise localization of gravitational-wave compact binary mergers. We investigate the use of a method to include galaxy catalog information in performing parameter estimation of these events. We test its effectiveness with the gravitational-wave events GW170817, GW190425, and GW190814, as well as with simulated binary neutron star mergers. For GW170817, we recover the true host galaxy as the most probable galaxy after a straightforward mass reweighting, with significantly decreased localization area and volume. On the simulated sample, however, we do not find improvement compared to performing a simple galaxy catalog crossmatch with a regular gravitational wave localization. Future investigations into sampling methods may yield improvements that increase the viability of this method.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of small-scale induced gravitational waves from the soliton/oscillon domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate density fluctuations and scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) arising from the production of long-lived solitons and oscillons, which can dominate the early Universe and drive reheating prior to the standard radiation-dominated era. Curvature perturbations are generated not only by the Poisson distribution of these solitons/oscillons but are also amplified during the early matter-dominated phase when the solitons/oscillons dominate. Scalar-induced GWs with characteristic energy spectra emerge from these amplified curvature perturbations, particularly at the sudden transition from matter domination to radiation domination. We analyze this scenario and its GW predictions in detail, focusing on the impact of the initial energy fraction, the lifetime, and the average separation of these solitons/oscillons. This provides a wealth of potential observational targets for various GW detectors. Furthermore, for inflation and preheating models that produce oscillons with large separations, we derive new constraints on these models based on the upper bounds on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, as anticipated from future cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure observations.</description>

      <title>Black Mirrors: CPT-Symmetric Alternatives to Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein's equations imply that a gravitationally collapsed object forms an event horizon. But what lies on the other side of this horizon? In this paper, we question the reality of the conventional solution (the black hole), and point out another, topologically distinct solution: the black mirror. In the black hole solution, the horizon connects the exterior metric to an interior metric which contains a curvature singularity. In the black mirror, the horizon instead connects the exterior metric to its own CPT mirror image, yielding a solution with smooth, bounded curvature. We give the general stationary (charged, rotating) black mirror solution explicitly, and also describe the general black mirror formed by gravitational collapse. The black mirror is the relevant stationary point when the quantum path integral is equipped with suitably CPT-symmetric boundary conditions, that we propose. It appears to avoid many vexing puzzles which plague the conventional black hole.</description>

      <title>Henneaux-Teitelboim Form of the Generalized Unimodular Gravity Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an alternative description of generalized unimodular gravity (GUMG), extending the Henneaux-Teitelboim approach to unimodular gravity (UMG). The central feature of this formulation is the consistent incorporation of time reparameterization, which enhances the gauge structure and reveals a spatial nonlocality hidden in the dynamics of the original formulation. We examine the resulting dynamics, emphasizing the effects of spatial nonlocality, and outline the constraint structure. We show that the gauge symmetry in the gravitational sector is extended by a functionally incomplete symmetry, as occurs in the unimodular gravity. However, in contrast to the latter, the resulting action is not fully diffeomorphism-invariant.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Primordial Curvature Perturbations via Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many early universe scenarios predict an enhancement of scalar perturbations at scales currently unconstrained by cosmological probes. These perturbations source gravitational waves (GWs) at second order in perturbation theory, leading to a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background. The LISA detector, sensitive to mHz GWs, will be able to constrain curvature perturbations in a new window corresponding to scales $k \in [10^{10}, 10^{14}] \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, difficult to probe otherwise. In this work, we forecast the capabilities of LISA to constrain the source of SIGWs using different approaches: i) agnostic, where the spectrum of curvature perturbations is binned in frequency space; ii) template-based, modeling the curvature power spectrum based on motivated classes of models; iii) ab initio, starting from first-principles model of inflation featuring an ultra-slow roll phase. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We also discuss the impact on the SIGW spectrum of non-standard thermal histories affecting the kernels of SIGW emission and non-Gaussianity in the statistics of the curvature perturbations. Finally, we propose simple tests to assess whether the signal is compatible with the SIGW hypothesis. The pipeline used is built into the SIGWAY code.</description>

      <title>Detection of Intermediate-Mass Ratio Inspirals in Globular Clusters: Revealing the Brownian Motion with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) formed by stellar-mass compact objects orbiting intermediate-mass black holes will be detected by future gravitational wave (GW) observatories like TianQin, LISA, and AION. We study a set of 100 IMRI systems in globular clusters obtained from MOCCA simulations to estimate their detectability. Furthermore, we model the Brownian motion of the IMRIs induced by weak interactions with the surrounding field of stars and include its effect on the GW's phase through Doppler and aberrational phase shift. We find that a small fraction of IMRIs ($&lt;10\,\%$) will have signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) high enough to be detected by TianQin, LISA, and AION. However, for all sources detected, the SNR is high enough to discern the Brownian motion of the IMRI. More precisely, we find that the match between the signal containing the effect of the Brownian motion and a waveform model without this effect is mostly low ($&lt;0.8$). These results highlight the importance of including the interaction of IMRIs with the surrounding field of stars to obtain proper detection, but also show the possibility of studying the environment of the source using GWs.</description>

      <title>Primordial gravitational waves from spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of Spontaneous Lorentz Symmetry Breaking (SLSB) on Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) generated during inflation. The SLSB is induced by a time-like Bumblebee vector field which is non-minimally coupled to the Ricci tensor in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background. The power spectrum and GW amplitude are computed to investigate how Lorentz violation leaves observable imprints. We calculate the GW strain amplitude over frequencies $(10^{-10}~\mathrm{Hz}, 10^4~\mathrm{Hz})$, for a range of the dimensionless Lorentz-violating parameter, $ -10^{-3} \leq l \leq 10^{-4} $, which essentially comes from a slight sensitivity to the equation of state for dark energy. For positive $ l $ values, the amplitude of GW shows a mild suppression compared to the standard cosmological scenario $( l = 0) $. This effect could be observable with detectors like SKA, $\mu$-Ares, and BBO. Conversely, negative $ l $ values amplify the GW amplitude, enhancing detectability by both SKA, $\mu$-Ares, and BBO, as well as by THEIA and DECIGO. Notably, the GW strain amplitude increases by an order of magnitude as $ l $ moves from 0 to $ -10^{-3} $, improving prospects for detection in high-sensitivity detectors like THEIA and DECIGO.</description>
