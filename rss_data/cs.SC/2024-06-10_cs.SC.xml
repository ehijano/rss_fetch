      <title>Whitney Stratification of Algebraic Boundaries of Convex Semi-algebraic Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algebraic boundaries of convex semi-algebraic sets are closely related to polynomial optimization problems. Building upon Rainer Sinn's work, we refine the stratification of iterated singular loci to a Whitney (a) stratification, which gives a list of candidates of varieties whose dual is an irreducible component of the algebraic boundary of the dual convex body. We also present an algorithm based on Teissier's criterion to compute Whitney (a) stratifications, which employs conormal spaces and prime decomposition.</description>

      <title>Differential equations satisfied by generating functions of 5-, 6-, and 7-regular labelled graphs: a reduction-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By a classic result of Gessel, the exponential generating functions for $k$-regular graphs are D-finite. Using Gr\"obner bases in Weyl algebras, we compute the linear differential equations satisfied by the generating function for 5-, 6-, and 7- regular graphs. The method is sufficiently robust to consider variants such as graphs with multiple edges, loops, and graphs whose degrees are limited to fixed sets of values.</description>

      <title>Faster Gr\"obner bases for Lie derivatives of ODE systems via monomial orderings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbolic computation for systems of differential equations is often computationally expensive. Many practical differential models have a form of polynomial or rational ODE system with specified outputs. A basic symbolic approach to analyze these models is to compute and then symbolically process the polynomial system obtained by sufficiently many Lie derivatives of the output functions with respect to the vector field given by the ODE system.
  In this paper, we present a method for speeding up Gr\"obner basis computation for such a class of polynomial systems by using specific monomial ordering, including weights for the variables, coming from the structure of the ODE model. We provide empirical results that show improvement across different symbolic computing frameworks and apply the method to speed up structural identifiability analysis of ODE models.</description>

      <title>Connectivity in Symmetric Semi-Algebraic Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-algebraic set is a subset of the real space defined by polynomial equations and inequalities. In this paper, we consider the problem of deciding whether two given points in a semi-algebraic set are connected. We restrict to the case when all equations and inequalities are invariant under the action of the symmetric group and their degrees at most $d&lt;n$, where $n$ is the number of variables. Additionally, we assume that the two points are in the same fundamental domain of the action of the symmetric group, by assuming that the coordinates of two given points are sorted in non-decreasing order. We construct and analyze an algorithm that solves this problem, by taking advantage of the group action, and has a complexity being polynomial in $n$.</description>

      <title>clauseSMT: A NLSAT-Based Clause-Level Framework for Satisfiability Modulo Nonlinear Real Arithmetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model-constructing satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework has been applied to SMT problems on different arithmetic theories. NLSAT, an implementation using cylindrical algebraic decomposition for explanation, is especially competitive among nonlinear real arithmetic constraints. However, current Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL)-style algorithms only consider literal information for decision, and thus ignore clause-level influence on arithmetic variables. As a consequence, NLSAT encounters unnecessary conflicts caused by improper literal decisions.
  In this work, we analyze the literal decision caused conflicts, and introduce clause-level information with a direct effect on arithmetic variables. Two main algorithm improvements are presented: clause-level feasible-set based look-ahead mechanism and arithmetic propagation based branching heuristic. We implement our solver named clauseSMT on our dynamic variable ordering framework. Experiments show that clauseSMT is competitive on nonlinear real arithmetic theory against existing SMT solvers (cvc5, Z3, Yices2), and outperforms all these solvers on satisfiable instances of SMT(QF_NRA) in SMT-LIB. The effectiveness of our proposed methods are also studied.</description>

      <title>Parallel Summation in P-Recursive Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose investigating a summation analog of the paradigm for parallel integration. We make some first steps towards an indefinite summation method applicable to summands that rationally depend on the summation index and a P-recursive sequence and its shifts. There is a distinction between so-called normal and so-called special polynomials. Under the assumption that the corresponding difference field has no unnatural constants, we are able to predict the normal polynomials appearing in the denominator of a potential closed form. We can also handle the numerator. Our method is incomplete so far as we cannot predict the special polynomials appearing in the denominator. However, we do have some structural results about special polynomials for the setting under consideration.</description>
