      <title>Is there something missing from the Antikythera Mechanism? Was it a mechanical Planetarium, positioner? or a Luni solar Time calculator device? Reconstructing the lost parts of b1 gear and its Cover Disc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the observations and the results of our experience from a large number of flight hours in constructing, handling, testing, studying and interacting with our Antikythera Mechanism functional reconstruction models. We constructed our models according to the X Ray tomographies and without any use of modern stabilization parts (screws, nuts etc). Simple typical bronze material (not with special alloys) was used in the construction, while (most of) the gears were cut from simple bronze discs with thickness about 2mm and with triangular shaped teeth (not in modern involute shape). The bronze (not iron or steel) shafts have dimensions conforming to the original parts of the ancient artifact. The assembly of the parts was done following careful study of the Personal Constructional Characteristics and the Design Style of the ancient Craftsman, which are visible or even hidden on the Antikythera Mechanism Fragments. During the extensive use of our models, it was concluded that two important and mandatory indicators are missing from all current reconstructions of the Antikythera Mechanism. The absence of these two indicator dials makes it difficult to properly operate the Mechanism and their existence is necessary, in order for the Antikythera Mechanism to be considered as a complete and self contained operational time measuring device. The two procedures related to the (poorly) preserved remains were located on gear b1 and the lost Cover Disc of the b1 gear. The reconstruction of those missing parts was achieved by paying special attention to the Personal Constructional Characteristics of the ancient Craftsman. The extensive analysis of the Antikythera Mechanism calibrated scales leads to the understanding of the Mechanism as a luni solar time measuring device, as opposed to the notion that it was a mechanical planetarium presenting the hypothesized planetary motions and positions.</description>

      <title>In Which Sense Can We Say That First-Class Constraints Generate Gauge Transformations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I consider a recent controversy about whether first-class constraints generate gauge transformations in the case of electromagnetism. I argue that there is a notion of gauge transformation, the extended notion, which is different from the original gauge transformation of electromagnetism, but at the same time not trivial, which allows the making of that claim. I further argue that one can expect that this claim can be extended to more general theories, and that Dirac's conjecture may be true for some physically reasonable theories and only in this sense of gauge transformation. Finally, I argue that the extended notion of gauge transformation seems unnatural from the point of view of classical theories, but that it nicely fits with the way quantum versions of gauge theories are constructed.</description>

      <title>All roads lead to (New) Rome: Byzantine astronomy and geography in a rapidly changing world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the first few centuries CE, the centre of the known world gradually shifted from Alexandria to Constantinople. Combined with a societal shift from pagan beliefs to Christian doctrines, Antiquity gave way to the Byzantine era. While Western Europe entered an extended period of intellectual decline, Constantinople developed into a rich cultural crossroads between East and West. Yet, Byzantine scholarship in astronomy and geography continued to rely heavily on their ancient Greek heritage, and particularly on Ptolemy's Geography. Unfortunately, Ptolemy's choices for his geographic coordinate system resulted in inherent and significant distortions of and inaccuracies in maps centred on the Byzantine Empire. This comprehensive review of Byzantine geographic achievements -- supported by a review of astronomical developments pertaining to position determination on Earth -- aims to demonstrate why and how, when Constantinople fell to the Turks in 1453 and the Ottoman Empire commenced, Byzantine astronomers had become the central axis in an extensive network of Christians, Muslims and Jews. Their influence remained significant well into the Ottoman era, particularly in the context of geographical applications.</description>
