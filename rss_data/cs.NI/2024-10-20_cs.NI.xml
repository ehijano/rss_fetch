      <title>Enhancing Routing in SD-EONs through Reinforcement Learning: A Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimization framework for routing in software-defined elastic optical networks using reinforcement learning algorithms. We specifically implement and compare the epsilon-greedy bandit, upper confidence bound (UCB) bandit, and Q-learning algorithms to traditional methods such as K-Shortest Paths with First-Fit core and spectrum assignment (KSP-FF) and Shortest Path with First-Fit (SPF-FF) algorithms. Our results show that Q-learning significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving a reduction in blocking probability (BP) of up to 58.8% over KSP-FF, and 81.9% over SPF-FF under lower traffic volumes. For higher traffic volumes, Q-learning maintains superior performance with BP reductions of 41.9% over KSP-FF and 70.1% over SPF-FF. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of reinforcement learning in enhancing network performance and resource utilization in dynamic and complex environments.</description>

      <title>Solutions for Sustainable and Resilient Communication Infrastructure in Disaster Relief and Management Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As natural disasters become more frequent and severe, ensuring a resilient communications infrastructure is of paramount importance for effective disaster response and recovery. This disaster-resilient infrastructure should also respond to sustainability goals by providing an energy-efficient and economically feasible network that is accessible to everyone. This paper provides a comprehensive exploration of the technological solutions and strategies necessary to build and maintain resilient communications networks that can withstand and quickly recover from disaster scenarios. The paper starts with a survey of existing literature and related reviews to establish a solid foundation, followed by an overview of the global landscape of disaster communications and power supply management. We then introduce the key enablers of communications and energy resource technologies to support communications infrastructure, examining emerging trends that improve the resilience of these systems. Pre-disaster planning is emphasized as a critical phase where proactive communication and energy supply strategies can significantly mitigate the impact of disasters. We explore the essential technologies for disaster response, focusing on real-time communications and energy solutions that support rapid deployment and coordination in times of crisis. The paper presents post-disaster communication and energy management planning for effective rescue and evacuation operations. The main findings derived from the comprehensive survey are also summarized for each disaster phase. This is followed by an analysis of existing vendor products and services as well as standardization efforts and ongoing projects that contribute to the development of resilient infrastructures. A detailed case study of the Turkiye earthquakes is presented to illustrate the practical application of these technologies and strategies.</description>

      <title>SDONSim: An Advanced Simulation Tool for Software-Defined Elastic Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for flexible and efficient optical networks has led to the development of Software-Defined Elastic Optical Networks (SD-EONs). These networks leverage the programmability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and the adaptability of Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) to optimize network performance under dynamic traffic conditions. However, existing simulation tools often fall short in terms of transparency, flexibility, and advanced functionality, limiting their utility in cutting-edge research. In this paper, we present SDONSim, a fully open-source simulator designed to address these limitations and provide a comprehensive platform for SDON research. SDONSim integrates traditional routing and spectrum assignment algorithms with advanced machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques, including support for the Stable Baselines 3 library. The simulator also offers robust unit testing, a fully functional graphical user interface (GUI), and extensive documentation to ensure usability and reliability. Performance evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of SDONSim in modeling complex network scenarios, showcasing its potential as a powerful tool for advancing SDON research.</description>

      <title>Design and Evaluation of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Energy Saving in Open RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless systems, already widely deployed, are expected to become even more prevalent in the future, representing challenges in both environmental and economic terms. This paper focuses on improving the energy efficiency of intelligent and programmable Open Radio Access Network (RAN) systems through the near-real-time dynamic activation and deactivation of Base Station (BS) Radio Frequency (RF) frontends using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, i.e., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Network (DQN). These algorithms run on the RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs), part of the Open RAN architecture, and are designed to make optimal network-level decisions based on historical data without compromising stability and performance. We leverage a rich set of Key Performance Measurements (KPMs), serving as state for the DRL, to create a comprehensive representation of the RAN, alongside a set of actions that correspond to some control exercised on the RF frontend. We extend ns-O-RAN, an open-source, realistic simulator for 5G and Open RAN built on ns-3, to conduct an extensive data collection campaign. This enables us to train the agents offline with over 300,000 data points and subsequently evaluate the performance of the trained models. Results show that DRL agents improve energy efficiency by adapting to network conditions while minimally impacting the user experience. Additionally, we explore the trade-off between throughput and energy consumption offered by different DRL agent designs.</description>

      <title>Towards High-Speed Passive Visible Light Communication with Event Cameras and Digital Micro-Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive visible light communication (VLC) modulates light propagation or reflection to transmit data without directly modulating the light source. Thus, passive VLC provides an alternative to conventional VLC, enabling communication where the light source cannot be directly controlled. There have been ongoing efforts to explore new methods and devices for modulating light propagation or reflection. The state-of-the-art has broken the 100 kbps data rate barrier for passive VLC by using a digital micro-mirror device (DMD) as the light modulating platform, or transmitter, and a photo-diode as the receiver. We significantly extend this work by proposing a massive spatial data channel framework for DMDs, where individual channels can be decoded in parallel using an event camera at the receiver. For the event camera, we introduce event processing algorithms to detect numerous channels and decode bits from individual channels with high reliability. Our prototype, built with off-the-shelf event cameras and DMDs, can decode up to $\sim$2,000 parallel channels, achieving a data transmission rate of 1.6 Mbps, markedly surpassing current benchmarks by 16x.</description>

      <title>DRL Optimization Trajectory Generation via Wireless Network Intent-Guided Diffusion Models for Optimizing Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements in wireless communication fields, including low-altitude economies, 6G, and Wi-Fi, the scale of wireless networks continues to expand, accompanied by increasing service quality demands. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based optimization models can improve network performance by solving non-convex optimization problems intelligently. However, they heavily rely on online deployment and often require extensive initial training. Online DRL optimization models typically make accurate decisions based on current channel state distributions. When these distributions change, their generalization capability diminishes, which hinders the responsiveness essential for real-time and high-reliability wireless communication networks. Furthermore, different users have varying quality of service (QoS) requirements across diverse scenarios, and conventional online DRL methods struggle to accommodate this variability. Consequently, exploring flexible and customized AI strategies is critical. We propose a wireless network intent (WNI)-guided trajectory generation model based on a generative diffusion model (GDM). This model can be generated and fine-tuned in real time to achieve the objective and meet the constraints of target intent networks, significantly reducing state information exposure during wireless communication. Moreover, The WNI-guided optimization trajectory generation can be customized to address differentiated QoS requirements, enhancing the overall quality of communication in future intelligent networks. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves greater stability in spectral efficiency variations and outperforms traditional DRL optimization models in dynamic communication systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Data-Driven Digital Twin Testbed for Enhanced First Responder Training and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study focuses on developing a digital twin testbed tailored for public safety technologies, incorporating simulated wireless communication within the digital world. The integration enables rapid analysis of signal strength, facilitating effective communication among personnel during catastrophic incidents in the virtual environment. The virtual world also helps with the training of first responders. The digital environment is constructed using the actual training facility for first responders as a blueprint. Using the photo-reference method, we meticulously constructed all buildings and objects within this environment. These reconstructed models are precisely placed relative to their real-world counterparts. Subsequently, all structures and objects are integrated into the Unreal Engine (UE) to create an interactive environment tailored specifically to the requirements of first responders.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.00868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks will likely offer high data rates, increased reliability, and low delay for mobile, personal, and local area networks. Along with the rapid growth of smart wireless sensing and communication technologies, data traffic has increased significantly and existing 5G networks are not able to fully support future massive data traffic for services, storage, and processing. To meet the challenges ahead, research communities and industry are exploring the sixth generation (6G) Terahertz-based wireless network that is expected to be offered to industrial users in just ten years. Gaining knowledge and understanding of the different challenges and facets of 6G is crucial in meeting the requirements of future communication and addressing evolving quality of service (QoS) demands. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of specifications, requirements, applications, and enabling technologies related to 6G. It covers disruptive and innovative, integration of 6G with advanced architectures and networks such as software-defined networks (SDN), network functions virtualization (NFV), Cloud/Fog computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) oriented technologies. The survey also addresses privacy and security concerns and provides potential futuristic use cases such as virtual reality, smart healthcare, and Industry 5.0. Furthermore, it identifies the current challenges and outlines future research directions to facilitate the deployment of 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Dyna-5G: A Dynamic, Flexible, and Self-Organizing 5G Network for M2M Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present Dyna-5G, a dynamic, self-organizing 5G New Radio (5G-NR) network designed for massive Machine-to-Machine (M2M) networks. Traditional 5G NR networks, characterized by their centralized architecture, face challenges in supporting applications that require dynamic, decentralized communication, such as autonomous vehicles and drone swarms for emergency responses. These scenarios often suffer from the centralized model's single point of failure, undermining the reliability required in critical and fully autonomous applications. Dyna-5G addresses these challenges by allowing each device in the network to function as either part of the Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network, or as User Equipment (UE), thus maintaining network functionality even when conventional infrastructure components are compromised. Dyna-5G has built-in mechanisms carefully designed specifically for M2M networks, such as failure-recovery and ad-hoc entry and exit. We demonstrate the performance and feasibility of Dyna-5G using a custom-built testbed that simulates real-world missions, demonstrating our network's robustness, adaptability, and failure recovery capabilities. The results indicate that our entire 5G network model can fully re-organize in 6 seconds at maximum, without compromising the mission.</description>

      <title>Towards Satellite Non-IID Imagery: A Spectral Clustering-Assisted Federated Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are capable of gathering abundant Earth observation data (EOD) to enable different Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, to accomplish an effective EOD processing mechanism, it is imperative to investigate: 1) the challenge of processing the observed data without transmitting those large-size data to the ground because the connection between the satellites and the ground stations is intermittent, and 2) the challenge of processing the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) satellite data. In this paper, to cope with those challenges, we propose an orbit-based spectral clustering-assisted clustered federated self-knowledge distillation (OSC-FSKD) approach for each orbit of an LEO satellite constellation, which retains the advantage of FL that the observed data does not need to be sent to the ground. Specifically, we introduce normalized Laplacian-based spectral clustering (NLSC) into federated learning (FL) to create clustered FL in each round to address the challenge resulting from non-IID data. Particularly, NLSC is adopted to dynamically group clients into several clusters based on cosine similarities calculated by model updates. In addition, self-knowledge distillation is utilized to construct each local client, where the most recent updated local model is used to guide current local model training. Experiments demonstrate that the observation accuracy obtained by the proposed method is separately 1.01x, 2.15x, 1.10x, and 1.03x higher than that of pFedSD, FedProx, FedAU, and FedALA approaches using the SAT4 dataset. The proposed method also shows superiority when using other datasets.</description>

      <title>Certificates in P and Subquadratic-Time Computation of Radius, Diameter, and all Eccentricities in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.04660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of fine-grained complexity, we investigate the notion of certificate enabling faster polynomial-time algorithms. We specifically target radius (minimum eccentricity), diameter (maximum eccentricity), and all-eccentricity computations for which quadratic-time lower bounds are known under plausible conjectures. In each case, we introduce a notion of certificate as a specific set of nodes from which appropriate bounds on all eccentricities can be derived in subquadratic time when this set has sublinear size. The existence of small certificates is a barrier against SETH-based lower bounds for these problems. We indeed prove that for graph classes with small certificates, there exist randomized subquadratic-time algorithms for computing the radius, the diameter, and all eccentricities respectively.Moreover, these notions of certificates are tightly related to algorithms probing the graph through one-to-all distance queries and allow to explain the efficiency of practical radius and diameter algorithms from the literature. Our formalization enables a novel primal-dual analysis of a classical approach for diameter computation that leads to algorithms for radius, diameter and all eccentricities with theoretical guarantees with respect to certain graph parameters. This is complemented by experimental results on various types of real-world graphs showing that these parameters appear to be low in practice. Finally, we obtain refined results for several graph classes.</description>
