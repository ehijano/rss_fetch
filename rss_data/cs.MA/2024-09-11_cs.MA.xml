      <title>Can Agents Spontaneously Form a Society? Introducing a Novel Architecture for Generative Multi-Agents to Elicit Social Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in specific tasks, but most of these frameworks focus on independent tasks and lack attention to social interactions. We introduce a generative agent architecture called ITCMA-S, which includes a basic framework for individual agents and a framework called LTRHA that supports social interactions among multi-agents. This architecture enables agents to identify and filter out behaviors that are detrimental to social interactions, guiding them to choose more favorable actions. We designed a sandbox environment to simulate the natural evolution of social relationships among multiple identity-less agents for experimental evaluation. The results showed that ITCMA-S performed well on multiple evaluation indicators, demonstrating its ability to actively explore the environment, recognize new agents, and acquire new information through continuous actions and dialogue. Observations show that as agents establish connections with each other, they spontaneously form cliques with internal hierarchies around a selected leader and organize collective activities.</description>

      <title>A Quality Diversity Approach to Automatically Generate Multi-Agent Path Finding Benchmark Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Quality Diversity (QD) algorithm with Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) to generate benchmark maps for Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms. Previously, MAPF algorithms are tested using fixed, human-designed benchmark maps. However, such fixed benchmark maps have several problems. First, these maps may not cover all the potential failure scenarios for the algorithms. Second, when comparing different algorithms, fixed benchmark maps may introduce bias leading to unfair comparisons between algorithms. In this work, we take advantage of the QD algorithm and NCA with different objectives and diversity measures to generate maps with patterns to comprehensively understand the performance of MAPF algorithms and be able to make fair comparisons between two MAPF algorithms to provide further information on the selection between two algorithms. Empirically, we employ this technique to generate diverse benchmark maps to evaluate and compare the behavior of different types of MAPF algorithms such as bounded-suboptimal algorithms, suboptimal algorithms, and reinforcement-learning-based algorithms. Through both single-planner experiments and comparisons between algorithms, we identify patterns where each algorithm excels and detect disparities in runtime or success rates between different algorithms.</description>

      <title>DCMAC: Demand-aware Customized Multi-Agent Communication via Upper Bound Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient communication can enhance the overall performance of collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning. A common approach is to share observations through full communication, leading to significant communication overhead. Existing work attempts to perceive the global state by conducting teammate model based on local information. However, they ignore that the uncertainty generated by prediction may lead to difficult training. To address this problem, we propose a Demand-aware Customized Multi-Agent Communication (DCMAC) protocol, which use an upper bound training to obtain the ideal policy. By utilizing the demand parsing module, agent can interpret the gain of sending local message on teammate, and generate customized messages via compute the correlation between demands and local observation using cross-attention mechanism. Moreover, our method can adapt to the communication resources of agents and accelerate the training progress by appropriating the ideal policy which is trained with joint observation. Experimental results reveal that DCMAC significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms in both unconstrained and communication constrained scenarios.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Unstructured Text Data for Federated Instruction Tuning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated instruction tuning enables multiple clients to collaboratively fine-tune a shared large language model (LLM) that can follow humans' instructions without directly sharing raw data. However, existing literature impractically requires that all the clients readily hold instruction-tuning data (i.e., structured instruction-response pairs), which necessitates massive human annotations since clients' data is usually unstructured text instead. Addressing this, we propose a novel and flexible framework FedIT-U2S, which can automatically transform unstructured corpus into structured data for federated instruction tuning. FedIT-U2S consists two key steps: (1) few-shot instruction-tuning data generation, where each unstructured data piece together with several examples is combined to prompt an LLM in generating an instruction-response pair. To further enhance the flexibility, a retrieval-based example selection technique is proposed, where the examples are automatically selected based on the relatedness between the client's data piece and example pool, bypassing the need of determining examples in advance. (2) A typical federated instruction tuning process based on the generated data. Overall, FedIT-U2S can be applied to diverse scenarios as long as the client holds valuable text corpus, broadening the application scope of federated instruction tuning. We conduct a series of experiments on three domains (medicine, knowledge, and math), showing that our proposed FedIT-U2S can consistently and significantly brings improvement over the base LLM.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multi-Object Tracking Under Limited Field of View Heterogeneous Sensors with Density Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of tracking multiple, unknown, and time-varying numbers of objects using a distributed network of heterogeneous sensors. In an effort to derive a formulation for practical settings, we consider limited and unknown sensor field-of-views (FoVs), sensors with limited local computational resources and communication channel capacity. The resulting distributed multi-object tracking algorithm involves solving an NP-hard multidimensional assignment problem either optimally for small-size problems or sub-optimally for general practical problems. For general problems, we propose an efficient distributed multi-object tracking algorithm that performs track-to-track fusion using a clustering-based analysis of the state space transformed into a density space to mitigate the complexity of the assignment problem. The proposed algorithm can more efficiently group local track estimates for fusion than existing approaches. To ensure we achieve globally consistent identities for tracks across a network of nodes as objects move between FoVs, we develop a graph-based algorithm to achieve label consensus and minimise track segmentation. Numerical experiments with synthetic and real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is significantly more computationally efficient than state-of-the-art solutions, achieving similar tracking accuracy and bandwidth requirements but with improved label consistency.</description>

      <title>Macro Ethics Principles for Responsible AI Systems: Taxonomy and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12616v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Responsible AI must be able to make or support decisions that consider human values and can be justified by human morals. Accommodating values and morals in responsible decision making is supported by adopting a perspective of macro ethics, which views ethics through a holistic lens incorporating social context. Normative ethical principles inferred from philosophy can be used to methodically reason about ethics and make ethical judgements in specific contexts. Operationalising normative ethical principles thus promotes responsible reasoning under the perspective of macro ethics. We survey AI and computer science literature and develop a taxonomy of 21 normative ethical principles which can be operationalised in AI. We describe how each principle has previously been operationalised, highlighting key themes that AI practitioners seeking to implement ethical principles should be aware of. We envision that this taxonomy will facilitate the development of methodologies to incorporate normative ethical principles in reasoning capacities of responsible AI systems.</description>

      <title>The Integration of Prediction and Planning in Deep Learning Automated Driving Systems: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated driving has the potential to revolutionize personal, public, and freight mobility. Beside accurately perceiving the environment, automated vehicles must plan a safe, comfortable, and efficient motion trajectory. To promote safety and progress, many works rely on modules that predict the future motion of surrounding traffic. Modular automated driving systems commonly handle prediction and planning as sequential, separate tasks. While this accounts for the influence of surrounding traffic on the ego vehicle, it fails to anticipate the reactions of traffic participants to the ego vehicle's behavior. Recent methods increasingly integrate prediction and planning in a joint or interdependent step to model bidirectional interactions. To date, a comprehensive overview of different integration principles is lacking. We systematically review state-of-the-art deep learning-based planning systems, and focus on how they integrate prediction. Different facets of the integration ranging from system architecture to high-level behavioral aspects are considered and related to each other. Moreover, we discuss the implications, strengths, and limitations of different integration principles. By pointing out research gaps, describing relevant future challenges, and highlighting trends in the research field, we identify promising directions for future research.</description>
