      <title>New boundary criticality in topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the boundary criticality enriched by boundary fermions, which ubiquitously emerge in topological phases of matter, with a focus on topological insulators and topological superconductors. By employing dimensional regularization and bosonization techniques, we uncover several unprecedented boundary universality classes. These include the boundary Gross-Neveu-Yukawa critical point and the special Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, both resulting from the interplay between edge modes and bulk bosons. We present a comprehensive sketch of the phase diagram that accommodates these boundary criticalities and delineate their critical exponents. Additionally, we explore a 1+1D conformal defect decorated with fermions, where a defect BKT transition is highlighted. We conclude with a discussion on potential experimental realizations of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Lectures on the quantum phase transitions of metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions of metals involve changes in the Fermi surface, and can be divided into three categories. The first two categories involve symmetry breaking, and lead to a distortion or reconstruction of the Fermi surface. The third category involves a change in the volume enclosed by the Fermi surface without any symmetry breaking: one phase is a Fermi liquid (FL) with the conventional Luttinger volume, while the other phase is a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*), which has a non-Luttinger volume Fermi surface accompanied by a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. It is a relatively simple matter to obtain a FL*-FL transition in Kondo lattice models. However, the FL*-FL transition can also be present in single-band Hubbard-like models: this is efficiently described by the `ancilla' method, which shows that the transition is a `flipped' Kondo lattice transition. This single-band FL*-FL transition is argued to apply to the metallic states of the hole-doped cuprates. In the clean limit, the critical properties of the quantum transitions in the three categories are distinct, but all lead to perfect metal transport in the quantum-critical regime. Impurity-induced `Harris disorder', with spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point, is a relevant perturbation to the clean critical points. In the presence of Harris disorder, all three categories exhibit strange metal behavior, which can be described by a universal two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous and impulsive stimulated Raman scattering from two-magnon modes in a cubic antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchange interactions govern the ordering between microscopic spins and the highest-frequency spin excitations - magnons at the edge of the Brillouin zone. As well known from spontaneous Raman scattering (RS) experiments in antiferromagnets, such magnons couple to light in the form of two-magnon modes - pairs of magnon with opposite wavevectors. Experimental works on two-magnon modes driven by exchange perturbation in impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) experiment posed a question about consistency between spin dynamics measured in the ISRS and RS experiments. Here, based on an extended spin correlation pseudovector formalism, we derive the analytical expression for observables in both types of experiments to determine a possibly fundamental differences between the detected two-magnon spectra. We find that in both cases the magnons from the edge of the Brillouin zone give the largest contribution to the measured spectra. However, there is the difference in the spectra which stems from the fact that RS probes population of a continuum of incoherent modes, while in the case of impulsively driven modes, they are coherent and their phase and amplitudes are detected. We show that for the continuum of modes, the sensitivity to the phase results in a relative shift of the main peaks in the two spectra, and the spectrum of the ISRS is significantly broadened and extends to the range above the maximum two-magnon mode frequency. Formally, this is manifested in the fact, that the RS is described by an imaginary part of the Green function only, while the ISRS is described by the absolute value and hence additionally carries information about the real part of the Green function. We further derive two-magnon Raman tensor dispersion and the weighting factors, which define the features of the coupling to light of the modes from the different domains in the Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Signatures of fractionalization in the optical phonons of hyperhoneycomb Kitaev magnet $\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose that the signatures of spin fractionalization in quantum magnets can be identified through a detailed analysis of the temperature dependence of the asymmetric Fano lineshape of optical phonons overlapping with a continuum of spin excitations. We focus on the hyperhoneycomb magnet $\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$, a promising candidate for being in proximity to a three-dimensional Kitaev quantum spin liquid. The Raman response in $\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ notably displays a distinctive asymmetric Fano lineshape in the 24 meV Raman-active optical phonon. This asymmetry arises from the interaction between the discrete phonon mode and the spin excitation continuum, which could be fractionalized if the material is indeed near a quantum spin-liquid phase. Our theoretical model considers the coupling of this optical phonon to Majorana fermions in the Kitaev model on the hyperhoneycomb lattice. Our findings reveal that the temperature-dependent Fano lineshape is consistent with the fractionalization of spins into Majorana fermions and $\mathbb{Z}{_2}$ fluxes.</description>

      <title>Gapless spin excitations in a quantum spin liquid state of S=1/2 perfect kagome antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent an exotic quantum many-body state characterized by the suppression of long-range magnetic order due to strong quantum fluctuations. The kagome spin-1/2 antiferromagnet (AFM) is a prime candidate for realizing QSLs, but its ground state remains an unresolved conundrum. Here we investigate the recently discovered perfect kagome AFM YCu$_3$(OH)$_{6.5}$Br$_{2.5}$ to elucidate two central enigmas surrounding the kagome AFM. Ultra-sensitive torque magnetometry experiments reveal that the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility arising from the kagome layer remains nearly temperature-independent down to exceedingly low temperatures. This observation seemingly implies the emergence of gapless fermionic spin excitations akin to Pauli paramagnetism in metals. However, most strikingly, these results stand in stark contrast to the conspicuous absence of a temperature-linear contribution to the specific heat. These findings appear irreconcilable with the widely-discussed theoretical frameworks assuming fermionic quasiparticles (QPs), instead suggesting a transition of bosonic QPs into a superfluid state with a gapless Goldstone mode. Furthermore, magnetocaloric measurements evince an entropy anomaly, constituting thermodynamic evidence that magnetic fields instigate the opening of a spin gap, driving a quantum phase transition into a 1/9 magnetization plateau state. These results shed light on the nature of the low-energy excitations in zero and strong magnetic fields, providing crucial insights into the long-standing unresolved issues of the ground state of the kagome AFM.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Entanglement Cloud after a Boundary Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement has been extensively used to characterize the structure of strongly correlated many-body systems. Most of these analyses focus on either spatial properties of entanglement or its temporal behavior. Negativity, as an entanglement measure, quantifies entanglement between different non-complementary blocks of a many-body system. Here, we consider a combined spatial-temporal analysis of entanglement negativity in a strongly correlated many-body system to characterize complex formation of correlations through non-equilibrium dynamics of such systems. A bond defect is introduced through a local quench at one of the boundaries of a uniform Heisenberg spin chain. Using negativity and entanglement entropy, computed by the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group, we analyze the extension of entanglement in the model as a function of time. We find that an entanglement cloud is formed, detached from the boundary spin and composed of spins with which it is highly entangled. The cloud travels ballistically in the chain until it reaches the other end where it reflects back and the cycle repeats. The revival dynamics exhibits an intriguing contraction (expansion) of the cloud as it moves away from (towards) the boundary spin.</description>

      <title>Ground-State Properties of the $t$-$J$ Model for the CuO Double-Chain Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of a correlated model for the double-chain structure in cuprates. We consider the $t$-$J$ model, in which the nearest-neighbor spin interaction $J_1$ is smaller than the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ corresponding to the CuO double-chain structure. We vary $J_1$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic values and calculate the correlation functions including the superconducting pair correlation function. Employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we show that the ground state for antiferromagnetic $J_1$ exhibits the hallmarks of the Luther-Emery liquid phase, in which the spin-singlet pair and charge-density-wave correlations exhibit power-law decays against distance, and the spin correlation function decays exponentially. Its signatures are gradually dismissed as $J_1$ approaches the ferromagnetic regime. Our findings suggest that the antiferromagnetic double-chain structure without ferromagnetic bonds is favorable for superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Higher-order topology and bulk-boundary correspondence in a two-dimensional SSH model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the 1D SSH chain into two dimensions using inter-chain hopping $t$ with two specific pairs of edges produced with two different atoms. The extension retains all of the 1D SSH model's symmetries on the global level. We discovered that when individual SSH chains are in a non-trivial topological phase and introduce a staggering amplitude between chains with a scenario $t&lt; v+w/2$, the system exhibits four zero energy modes that are confined to two of the four corners of the system. Interestingly, two out of the four zero modes are found to be associated with trimmers. No zero energy modes arise when the chains are in the trivial topological phase with $t&lt; v+w/2$. Further with a critical look at the phase evolution of the Bloch states of the system we identified a set of closed paths to define a winding number to characterize the topological nature of the system. The Bulk-Corner correspondence is established by calculating the winding number, varying between 2 and 1 in non-trivial topological phase and found to be 0 in the trivial topological phase. Based of this study we characterize the system with four localized corner modes and a bulk winding number 2 appears to be a Second-order topological insulator.</description>

      <title>1-Form Symmetric Projected Entangled-Pair States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1-form symmetry, manifesting as loop-like symmetries, has gained prominence in the study of quantum phases, deepening our understanding of symmetry. However, the role of 1-form symmetries in Projected Entangled-Pair States (PEPS), two-dimensional tensor network states, remains largely underexplored. We present a novel framework for understanding 1-form symmetries within tensor networks, specifically focusing on the derivation of algebraic relations for symmetry matrices on the PEPS virtual legs. Our results reveal that 1-form symmetries impose stringent constraints on tensor network representations, leading to distinct anomalous braiding phases carried by symmetry matrices. We demonstrate how these symmetries influence the ground state and tangent space in PEPS, providing new insights into their physical implications for enhancing ground state optimization efficiency and characterizing the 1-form symmetry structure in excited states.</description>

      <title>Studying the 3d Ising surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15914v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundaries not only are fundamental elements in nearly all realistic physical systems, but also greatly enrich the structure of quantum field theories. In this paper, we demonstrate that conformal field theory (CFT) with a boundary, known as surface CFT in three dimensions, can be studied with the setup of fuzzy sphere. We consider the example of surface criticality of the 3D Ising CFT. We propose two schemes by cutting a boundary in the orbital space or the real space to realise the ordinary and the normal surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere. We obtain the operator spectra through state-operator correspondence. We observe integer spacing of the conformal multiplets, and thus provide direct evidence of conformal symmetry. We identify the ordinary surface primary $o$, the displacement operator $\mathrm{D}$ and their conformal descendants and extract their scaling dimensions. We also study the one-point and two-point correlation functions and extract the bulk-to-surface OPE coefficients, some of which are reported for the first time. In addition, using the overlap of the bulk CFT state and the polarised state, we calculate the boundary central charges of the 3D Ising surface CFTs non-perturbatively. Other conformal data obtained in this way also agrees with prior methods.</description>

      <title>Magic transition in measurement-only circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic, also known as nonstabilizerness, quantifies the distance of a quantum state to the set of stabilizer states, and it serves as a necessary resource for potential quantum advantage over classical computing. In this work, we study magic in a measurement-only quantum circuit with competing types of Clifford and non-Clifford measurements, where magic is injected through the non-Clifford measurements. This circuit can be mapped to a classical model that can be simulated efficiently, and the magic can be characterized using any magic measure that is additive for tensor product of single-qubit states. Leveraging this observation, we study the magic transition in this circuit using large-scale numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate the presence of a magic transition between two different phases with extensive magic scaling, separated by a critical point in which the mutual magic exhibits logarithmic scaling. We further show that these two distinct phases can be distinguished by the topological magic. In a different regime, with vanishing rate of non-Clifford measurements, we find that the magic saturates in both phases. Our work sheds light on the behavior of magic and its linear combinations in quantum circuits, employing genuine magic measures.</description>

      <title>Towards an effective two-orbital description of Nickelate physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered Nickelates have emerged as promising candidates for high-temperature superconductivity, drawing parallels to the well-studied Cuprates. This study provides a robust theoretical framework to understand the electronic structure of these materials, particularly focusing on the role of effective orbitals and the emergence of extra Fermi pocket. Using a multi-orbital model that takes into account the essential symmetries and interactions of the involved orbitals ($5d_{z^2}$, $3d_{z^2}$, $3d_{x^2-y^2}$, $2p_x$, $2p_y$, $2p_z$), we investigated the impact of the Nickel $3d_{z^2}$ orbital on the Fermi surface and the conditions that favor the emergence of a secondary Fermi surface pocket. Our findings reveal that the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, through its exchange interactions with the rare-earth layer, can modify the Fermi surface, thus acting as a crucial element in the electronic structure. We develop an effective two-orbital model applicable to both $RNiO_3$ and $RNiO_2$ families, explaining the sensitivity of the Fermi surface to apical Oxygen presence and high-pressure environments. This model captures the evolution of the Fermi surface and predicts susceptibility features analogous to those observed in Cuprate superconductors. We observe a peak in Lindhard susceptibility in these Nickelate systems at wave vector $\mathbf{q} = (\pi, \pi)$, similar to the Cuprates. This peak can be tuned by pressure and doping.</description>

      <title>Unique magnetic structure of the vdW antiferromagnet VBr$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: VBr$_3$ is a van der Waals antiferromagnet below the N\'eel temperature of 26.5 K with a saturation moment of 1.2 mB/f.u. above the metamagnetic transitions detected in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. To reveal the AFM structure of VBr$_3$ experimentally, we performed a single-crystal neutron diffraction study on a large high-quality crystal. The collected data confirmed a slight monoclinic distortion of the high-temperature rhombohedral structure below 90 K. The magnetic structure was, nevertheless, investigated within the R-3 model. The antiferromagnetic structure propagation vector k = (1, 0, 0.5) was revealed. In an attempt to determine the magnetic structure, 72 non-equivalent magnetic reflections were recorded. The experimental data were confronted with the magnetic space groups dictated by the R-3 lattice symmetry and propagation vector. The best agreement between the experimental data and the magnetic structure model was obtained for the space group P-1.1'_c. The magnetic unit cell of the proposed unique antiferromagnetic structure with periodicity 6c is built from two identical triple layers antiferromagnetically coupled along the c axis. Each triple layer comprises a N\'eel antiferromagnetic monolayer sandwiched between two antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic monolayers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the generation by optical pulses of non-thermal distributions of nuclear spins in quantum dots we investigate the effect of optical pulses applied to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors. Using time-dependent mean-field theory formulated with Anderson pseudospins, we study the electronic configurations and the energy deposited in the system by optical pulses. The pulses are included by Peierls substitution and we study short rectangular pulses as well as idealized $\delta$ pulses. Already a few and even a single pulse generates highly non-trivial distributions of electron expectation values which we simulate numerically and explain analytically based on the linearization of the equations of motion.

      <title>Annealing-induced long-range charge density wave order in magnetic kagome FeGe: fluctuations and disordered structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) in kagome materials with the geometric frustration is able to carry unconventional characteristics. Recently, a CDW has been observed below the antiferromagnetic order in kagome FeGe, in which magnetism and CDW are intertwined to form an emergent quantum ground state. However, the CDW is only short-ranged and the structural modulation originating from it has yet to be determined experimentally. Here we realize a long-range CDW order by post-annealing process, and resolve the structure model through single crystal x-ray diffraction. Occupational disorder of Ge resulting from short-range CDW correlations above $T_\mathrm{CDW}$ is identified from structure refinements. The partial dimerization of Ge along the $c$ axis is unveiled to be the dominant distortion for the CDW. Occupational disorder of Ge is also proved to exist in the CDW phase due to the random selection of partially dimerized Ge sites. Our work provides useful insights for understanding the unconventional nature of the CDW in FeGe.</description>

Abstract: Calculating dynamical spin correlations is essential for matching model magnetic exchange Hamiltonians to momentum-resolved spectroscopic measurements. A major numerical bottleneck is the diagonalization of the dynamical matrix, especially in systems with large magnetic unit cells, such as those with incommensurate magnetic structures or quenched disorder. In this paper, we demonstrate an efficient scheme based on the kernel polynomial method for calculating dynamical correlations of relevance to inelastic neutron scattering experiments. This method reduces the scaling of numerical cost from cubic to linear in the magnetic unit cell size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that nonlinear transport responses in strange metals are strong, larger by a factor of $E_F/T$ than in Fermi liquids. Within the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of a Fermi surface with a spatially random coupling to a critical scalar, the third order conductivity is found to diverge as $1/T$ at low $T$, indicating the existence of a voltage-temperature scaling regime in the conductance. Its frequency and orientation dependence contains information on relaxation times of heat and electron distribution deformations, providing a new set of tools to characterize strange metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long standing problem in the study of the under-hole-doped cuprates has been the description of the Fermi surfaces underlying the high magnetic field quantum oscillations, and their connection to the higher temperature pseudogap metal. Harrison and Sebastian (arXiv:1103.4181) proposed that the pseudogap `Fermi arcs' are reconstructed into an electron pocket by field-induced charge density wave order. But computations on such a model (Zhang and Mei, arXiv:1411.2098) show an unobserved additional oscillation frequency from a Fermi surface arising from the backsides of the hole pockets completing the Fermi arcs. We describe a transition from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) model of the pseudogap metal, to a metal with bi-directional charge density wave order without fractionalization. We show that the confinement of the fermionic spinon excitations of the FL* across this transition can eliminate the unobserved oscillation frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of crystalline symmetry, topologically ordered states can acquire a host of symmetry-protected invariants. These determine the patterns of crystalline symmetry fractionalization of the anyons in addition to fractionally quantized responses to lattice defects. Here we show how ground state expectation values of partial rotations centered at high symmetry points can be used to extract crystalline invariants. Using methods from conformal field theory and G-crossed braided tensor categories, we develop a theory of invariants obtained from partial rotations, which apply to both Abelian and non-Abelian topological orders. We then perform numerical Monte Carlo calculations for projected parton wave functions of fractional Chern insulators, demonstrating remarkable agreement between theory and numerics. For the topological orders we consider, we show that the Hall conductivity, filling fraction, and partial rotation invariants fully characterize the crystalline invariants of the system. Our results also yield invariants of continuum fractional quantum Hall states protected by spatial rotational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Reduction for one-loop tensor Feynman integrals in the relativistic quantum field theories at finite temperature and/or finite density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.11314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \emph{conventional} Passarino-Veltman reduction is a systematic procedure based on the Lorentz covariance, which can efficiently reduce the one-loop tensor Feynman integrals in the relativistic quantum field theories (QFTs) at zero temperature and zero density. However, the Lorentz covariance is explicitly broken when either of the temperature and density is finite, due to a rest reference frame of the many-body system in which the temperature and density are measured, rendering the \emph{conventional} Passarino-Veltman reduction not applicable anymore to reduce the one-loop tensor Feynman integrals therein. In this paper, we report a \emph{generalized} Passarino-Veltman reduction which can efficiently simplify the one-loop tensor Feynman integrals in the relativistic QFTs at finite temperature and/or finite density. The \emph{generalized} Passarino-Veltman reduction can analyze the one-loop tensor Feynman integrals in a wide range of physical systems described by the relativistic QFTs at finite temperature and/or finite density, such as quark-gluon plasma in nuclear physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.02534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectrum consistency of the three fermion family $U(1)\times U(1)$ quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124 (2020) 131601] is analyzed. It has been verified that the originally proposed action violates the unitarity consistency condition in the gauge field sector by exhibiting negative norm states in the spectrum. However, the cure came through the fundamental gauge fields properly settled, consequently, the action rewritten in terms of those fundamental fields shows to be free from any spurious degrees of freedom, and the model now becomes safe for further quantization.</description>

      <title>Correlation between optical phonon softening and superconducting $T_c$ in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$ within $d$-wave Eliashberg theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical description, based on d-wave Eliashberg theory, of the strong correlation between the experimentally observed softening of Raman modes associated with in-plane oxygen motions and the corresponding superconducting critical temperature $T_c$, as a function of oxygen doping $x$, in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$. The theoretical model provides a direct link between physical trends of soft optical $A_g$ (in-plane) oxygen modes, the level of oxygen doping $x$, and the superconducting $T_c$. Different regimes observed in the trend of $T_c$ vs doping can be related to corresponding regimes of optical phonon softening in the Raman spectra. These results provide further evidence related to the physical origin of high-temperature superconductivity in rare-earth cuprate oxides and to the significant role of electron-phonon coupling therein.</description>

      <title>Iterative construction of conserved quantities in dissipative nearly integrable systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrable systems offer rare examples of solvable many-body problems in the quantum world. Due to the fine-tuned structure, their realization in nature and experiment is never completely accurate, therefore effects of integrability are observed only transiently. One way to overcome this limitation is to weakly couple nearly integrable systems to baths and driving: these will stabilize integrable effects up to arbitrary time and encode them in the stationary state approximated by a generalized Gibbs ensemble. However, the description of such driven dissipative nearly integrable models is challenging and no exact analytical methods have been proposed so far. Here, we develop an iterative scheme in which integrability breaking perturbations (baths) determine the conserved quantities that play the leading role in a highly efficient truncated generalized Gibbs ensemble description. Our scheme paves the way for easier calculations in thermodynamically large systems and can be used to construct unknown conserved quantities.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Anyon Condensation and Level-Rank Dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive new dualities of topological quantum field theories in three spacetime dimensions that generalize the familiar level-rank dualities of Chern-Simons gauge theories. The key ingredient in these dualities is non-abelian anyon condensation, which is a gauging operation for topological lines with non-group-like i.e. non-invertible fusion rules. We find that, generically, dualities involve such non-invertible anyon condensation and that this unifies a variety of exceptional phenomena in topological field theories and their associated boundary rational conformal field theories, including conformal embeddings, and Maverick cosets (those where standard algorithms for constructing a coset model fail.) We illustrate our discussion in a variety of isolated examples as well as new infinite series of dualities involving non-abelian anyon condensation including: i) a new description of the parafermion theory as $(SU(N)_{2} \times Spin(N)_{-4})/\mathcal{A}_{N},$ ii) a new presentation of a series of points on the orbifold branch of $c=1$ conformal field theories as $(Spin(2N)_{2} \times Spin(N)_{-2} \times Spin(N)_{-2})/\mathcal{B}_{N}$, and iii) a new dual form of $SU(2)_{N}$ as $(USp(2N)_{1} \times SO(N)_{-4})/\mathcal{C}_{N}$ arising from conformal embeddings, where $\mathcal{A}_{N}, \mathcal{B}_{N},$ and $\mathcal{C}_{N}$ are appropriate collections of gauged non-invertible bosons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03377v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study reveals a novel phenomenon demonstrating the elastic softening of synthetic diamonds when cooled to very low temperatures below 1 K. We present the results of ultrasonic measurements of single-crystalline synthetic diamonds without irradiation, namely type-IIa (colorless) and Ib (yellow) diamonds grown by high-pressure-high-temperature synthesis as well as type-IIa diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition. We observed a divergent decrease of the elastic stiffness constant $C_{44}$ in all samples at low temperatures down to 20 mK. We argue for the existence of electric quadrupolar degrees of freedom with irreducible representation $T_2$ in diamond as the origin of this elastic softening. The possible ground state preserves local $T_d$ symmetry presumably down to absolute zero. Of the ground states of atomic vacancies in diamond proposed thus far, the only relevant one is the positively charged single atomic vacancy V$^+$, which has not been observed in previous optical measurements in diamonds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study viscoelastic response in Weyl semimetals with broken time-reversal symmetry. The principal finding is that topology and anisotropy of the Fermi surface are manifested in the viscoelasticity tensor of the electron fluid. In the dynamic (interband) part of this tensor, the anisotropy leads to a qualitatively different, compared with isotropic models, scaling with frequency and the Fermi energy. The components of the viscosity tensor determined by the Fermi-surface properties agree in the Kubo and kinetic formalisms; the latter, however, misses the anomalous Hall viscosity originating from filled states below the Fermi surface. The anisotropy of the dispersion relation is also manifested in the acceleration and relaxation terms of the hydrodynamic equations providing means to probe the anisotropy in transport experiments.</description>

      <title>Helical trilayer graphene in magnetic field: Chern mosaic and higher Chern number ideal flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Helical trilayer graphene (hTG) exhibits a supermoir\'e pattern with large domains centered around stacking points ABA and BAB, where two well-separated low-energy bands appear with different total Chern numbers at each valley, forming a Chern mosaic pattern. In the chiral limit, the low-energy bands become exactly flat at zero energy for magic-angle twists. Here we investigate these zero-energy flat bands and their topological properties in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. We show that hTG retains the precise flatness of the zero-energy bands, even at finite magnetic fields. We find topological phase transitions at fields corresponding to unit and half magnetic flux leading to an emergence of higher Chern number flat bands. Consequently the Chern mosaic gets modified for finite magnetic fields. We further find the analytical forms of zero-energy wave functions and identify a set of hidden wave functions, which gives crucial insights into both the topological transitions and enhancement of Chern numbers across them. We also find topological transitions away from the chiral limit with finite corrugations and at different magic angles.</description>
