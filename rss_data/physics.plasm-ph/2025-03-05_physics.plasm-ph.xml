      <title>Investigation of Plasma Mixing Processes in the Context of Indirect Drive Inertial Confinement Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion (ICF), the dynamics of plasma mixing in hohlraums critically influence laser-plasma instabilities (LPI) and implosion performance. This study investigates the mixing of hohlraum ablated Au plasmas and filling C$_5$H$_{12}$ plasmas using one-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. We find that ion-ion collisions slow the diffusion of ions, rendering Au ions sub-diffusive, while C and H ions remain super-diffusive. Due to their lower collisionality, H ions diffuse faster into Au regions than C ions, leading to a distinct separation between C and H ions at the interface. Although an electrostatic shock is still generated at the plasma interface in the presence of collisions, its electric field strength and propagation speed are notably reduced. To systematically explore plasma mixing in hohlraum environments, we evaluate the individual effects of incident laser irradiation, plasma flow, and inhomogeneous density profiles on ion mixing. We find that laser irradiation and plasma flow have a minor impact on ion mixing compared to diffusion-driven processes, while the inhomogeneous density profile restricts diffusion from low-density to high-density regions. By incorporating realistic hohlraum plasma conditions derived from radiation hydrodynamic models into the PIC simulations, we demonstrate that the diffusion of C and H ions continues to dominate ion mixing. Simple phenomenological fits are derived to describe the evolution of the mixing width in a hohlraum condition. Further theoretical calculations indicate that the penetration of H and C into Au plasmas suppresses stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) within the mixing layer. This finding underscores the importance of integrating ion mixing effects into LPI codes for more accurate modeling of ICF hohlraum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unveiling temperature and phase boundaries in laser-driven shocked and released copper: insights from ultra-fast X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy up to 300 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cu is an ubiquitous material used in industry for its great thermal and electrical properties. Studying the high-pressure high temperature properties of copper (Cu) is relevant for nuclear fusion research as projectiles and flyers used in hypervelocity impacts are generally made of copper, where it is used also in the design of the nuclear fusion targets. Recently, a solid (fcc)-solid (bcc) phase transition has been detected in shock compressed Cu with X-Ray Diffraction. Here, we present a study on shock compressed copper up to 300 GPa and 7100 K probed by single pulse (100 ps FWHM) X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). Based on the analysis of the XAS spectra, we provide structural identification and bulk temperature measurements along the Hugoniot up to the melting. The collection of XAS spectra under release conditions, i.e. at later times than the breakout time of the shock wave, helped constraining the experimental fcc-bcc and solid-liquid phase boundaries. In particular, we report the first bulk temperature measurement in shock compressed copper on the melting plateau located between 237(40) GPa and 5750(1130) K and 261 (27) GPa and 6240 (1155) K and on liquid copper at 300 GPa and 7100 K.</description>

      <title>Universality of discontinuous bifurcations in collisionless dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the universality in collisionless nonlinear dynamics of a codimension-two bifurcation where two eigenvalues collide at the origin, and two lines of continuous bifurcation and discontinuous jump meet. Through linear analysis and direct numerical simulations, we show that this bifurcation does occur, both for two-dimensional shear flows and for repulsive systems mimicking plasmas.</description>

      <title>Radiation-magnetohydrodynamics with MPI-AMRVAC using flux-limited diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Radiation plays a significant role in solar and astrophysical environments as it may constitute a sizeable fraction of the energy density, momentum flux, and the total pressure. Modelling the dynamic interaction between radiation and magnetized plasmas in such environments is an intricate and computationally costly task. Aims. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the capabilities of the open-source parallel, block-adaptive computational framework MPI-AMRVAC, in solving equations of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), and to present benchmark test cases relevant for radiation-dominated magnetized plasmas. Methods. The existing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and flux-limited diffusion (FLD) radiative-hydrodynamics physics modules are combined to solve the equations of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) on block-adaptive finite volume Cartesian meshes in any dimensionality. Results. We introduce and validate several benchmark test cases such as steady radiative MHD shocks, radiation-damped linear MHD waves, radiation-modified Riemann problems and a multi-dimensional radiative magnetoconvection case. We recall the basic governing Rankine-Hugoniot relations for shocks and the dispersion relation for linear MHD waves in the presence of optically thick radiation fields where the diffusion limit is reached. The RMHD system allows for 8 linear wave types, where the classical 7-wave MHD picture (entropy and three wave pairs for slow, Alfven and fast) is augmented with a radiative diffusion mode. Conclusions. The MPI-AMRVAC code now has the capability to perform multidimensional RMHD simulations with mesh adaptation making it well-suited for larger scientific applications to study magnetized matter-radiation interactions in solar and stellar interiors and atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic parameterization of positive streamer heads in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04282</link>

Abstract: The growth of streamer discharges is determined at their heads, for individual streamers as well as in collective phenomena, such as streamer trees or coronas or streamer bursts ahead of lightning leaders. Some properties of the streamer heads, such as velocity $v$ and radius $R$ now can be measured quite well, but this is very challenging for others such as the maximal electric field, the charge content of the streamer head and the degree of chemical excitation and ionization in the streamer channel. Here we develop, test and evaluate a macroscopic approximation for positive streamer heads in air that relates macroscopic streamer head properties to each other. In particular, we find that velocity $v$, radius $R$ and background field $E_{\rm bg}$ determine the complete profile of streamer heads with photoionization, if they propagate steadily. We also review Naidis' approximate relation between $v$, $R$ and the maximal field $E_{\rm max}$. The approximate head model developed in the present paper consists of three first-order ordinary differential equations along the streamer axis. It is derived from the classical fluid model for streamer discharges by assuming axisymmetry, steady streamer propagation (i.e. with constant velocity and shape), and a spherical shape of the charge layer around the streamer head. The new reduced model agrees well with full solutions of the classical fluid model, even when it is applied to accelerating streamers. Therefore the model can be used for evaluations of experiments, like for the determination of the maximal electric field from radius and velocity of the streamer. It is also a step towards constructing reduced models for the collective dynamics of multi-streamer discharges.</description>

      <title>Energy-momentum-conserving stochastic differential equations and algorithms for nonlinear Landau-Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coulomb collision is a fundamental diffusion process in plasmas that can be described by the Landau-Fokker-Planck (LFP) equation or the stochastic differential equation (SDE). While energy and momentum are conserved exactly in the LFP equation, they are conserved only on average by the conventional corresponding SDEs, suggesting that the underlying stochastic process may not be well-defined by such SDEs. In this study, we derive new SDEs with exact energy-momentum conservation for the Coulomb collision by factorizing the collective effect of field particles into individual particles and enforcing Newton's third law. These SDEs, when interpreted in the Stratonovich sense, have a particularly simple form that represents pure diffusion between particles without drag. Numerical algorithms that preserve discrete conservation laws are developed and benchmarked in various relaxation processes. Techniques to reduce computational complexity are also discussed.</description>
