      <title>Analytical solutions for single and multiple scattering from rib-stiffened plates in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of an acoustic plane wave with a pair of plates connected by periodically spaced stiffeners in water is considered. The rib-stiffened structure is called a "flex-layer" because its low frequency response is dominated by bending stiffness. The quasi-static behavior is equivalent a homogeneous layer of compressible fluid, which we identify as air for the purposes of comparison. In this way an air layer is acoustically the same as a pair of thin elastic plates connected by a periodic spacing of ribs. At discrete higher frequencies the flex-layer exhibits perfect acoustic transmission, the cause of which is identified as fluid-loaded plate waves propagating back and forth between the ribs. Both the low and finite frequency behavior of the flex-layer are fully explained by closed-form solutions for reflection and transmission. The analytical model is extended to two flex-layers in series, introducing new low and high frequency phenomena that are explained in terms of simple lumped parameter models.</description>

      <title>Spin injection and detection in a Si-based ferromagnetic tunnel junction: A theoretical model based on the band diagram and experimental demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have experimentally and theoretically investigated the spin injection/detection polarization in a Si-based ferromagnetic tunnel junction with an amorphous MgO layer, and demonstrated that the experimental features of the spin polarization in a wide bias range can be well explained using our theoretical model based on the band diagram of the junction and the direct tunneling mechanism. It is shown that the spin polarization originates from the band diagrams of the ferromagnetic Fe layer and n+-Si channel in the junction, while the spin selectivity of the MgO tunnel barrier is not necessary. Besides, we clarified the mechanism of the reduction in spin polarization when the bias is high and nonlinear properties are prominent, where the widely-used spin injection/detection model proposed by Valet and Fert is not applicable. The dominant mechanism of such reduction is found to be spin accumulation saturation (SAS) at the n+-Si interface in contact with the MgO layer as the bias is increased in the spin extraction geometry, which is inevitable in semiconductor-based ferromagnetic tunnel junctions. We performed numerical calculations on a two-terminal spin transport device with a n+-Si channel using the junction properties extracted from the experiments, and revealed that the magnetoresistance (MR) ratio is suppressed mainly by SAS in a higher bias range. Furthermore, we proposed methods for improving the MR ratio in two-terminal spin transport devices. Our experiments and theoretical model provide a deep understanding of the spin injection/detection phenomena in semiconductor-based spin transport devices, toward the realization of high performance under reasonably high bias conditions for practical use.</description>

      <title>Bessel-beam direct-write of the etch-mask in a nano-film of alumina for high-efficiency Si solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large surface area applications such as high-efficiency &gt; 26% solar cells require surface patterning with 1-10 micrometers periodic patterns at high fidelity over 1-10 cm^2 areas (before up scaling to 1 m^2) to perform at, or exceed, the Lambertian (ray optics) limit of light trapping. Here we show a pathway to high-resolution sub-1 micrometer etch mask patterning by ablation using direct femtosecond laser writing performed at room conditions (without the need for a vacuum-based lithography approach). A Bessel beam was used to alleviate the required high surface tracking tolerance for ablation of 0.3-0.8 micrometer diameter holes in ~40 nm alumina Al2O3-mask at high writing speed, 7.5 cm/s; a patterning rate 1 cm^2 per 20 min. The plasma etching protocol was optimised for a zero-mesa formation of photonic crystal (PhC) trapping structures and smooth surfaces at the nanoscale level. Scaling up in area and throughput of the demonstrated approach is outlined.</description>

      <title>Optical Bias and Cryogenic Laser Readout of a Multipixel Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic opto-electronic interconnects are gaining increasing interest as a means to control and read out cryogenic electronic components. The challenge is to achieve sufficient signal integrity with low heat load processing. In this context, we demonstrate the opto-electronic bias and readout of a commercial four-pixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector array using a cryogenic photodiode and laser. We show that this approach has a similar system detection efficiency to a conventional bias. Furthermore, multi-pixel detection events are faithfully converted between the optical and electrical domain, which allows reliable extraction of amplitude multiplexed photon statistics. Our device has a passive heat dissipation of 2.6mW, maintains the signal rise time of 3ns, and operates in free-running (self-resetting) mode at a repetition rate of 600kHz. This demonstrates the potential of high-bandwidth, low noise, and low heat load opto-electronic interconnects for scalable cryogenic signal processing and transmission.</description>

      <title>Picotesla-sensitivity microcavity optomechanical magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity optomechanical systems have enabled precision sensing of magnetic fields, by leveraging the optical resonance-enhanced readout and mechanical resonance-enhanced response. Previous studies have successfully achieved scalable and reproducible microcavity optomechanical magnetometry (MCOM) by incorporating Terfenol-D thin films into high-quality ($Q$) factor whispering gallery mode (WGM) microcavities. However, the sensitivity was limited to 585 pT/Hz$^{1/2}$, over 20 times inferior to those using Terfenol-D particles. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a high-sensitivity and scalable MCOM approach by sputtering a FeGaB thin film onto a high-$Q$ SiO$_2$ WGM microdisk. Theoretical studies are conducted to explore the magnetic actuation constant and noise-limited sensitivity by varying the parameters of the FeGaB film and SiO$_2$ microdisk. Multiple magnetometers with different radii are fabricated and characterized. By utilizing a microdisk with a radius of 355 $\mu$m and a thickness of 1 $\mu$m, along with a FeGaB film with a radius of 330 $\mu$m and a thickness of 1.3 $\mu$m, we have achieved a remarkable peak sensitivity of 1.68 pT/Hz$^{1/2}$ at 9.52 MHz. This represents a significant improvement of over two orders of magnitude compared with previous studies employing sputtered Terfenol-D film. Notably, the magnetometer operates without a bias magnetic field, thanks to the remarkable soft magnetic properties of the FeGaB film. Furthermore, as a proof-of-concept, we have demonstrated the real-time measurement of a pulsed magnetic field simulating the corona current in a high-voltage transmission line using our developed magnetometer. These high-sensitivity magnetometers hold great potential for various applications, such as magnetic induction tomography and corona current monitoring.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Processing and Reconstruction of Compromised Biophotonic Image Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of deep learning techniques with biophotonic setups has opened new horizons in bioimaging. A compelling trend in this field involves deliberately compromising certain measurement metrics to engineer better bioimaging tools in terms of cost, speed, and form-factor, followed by compensating for the resulting defects through the utilization of deep learning models trained on a large amount of ideal, superior or alternative data. This strategic approach has found increasing popularity due to its potential to enhance various aspects of biophotonic imaging. One of the primary motivations for employing this strategy is the pursuit of higher temporal resolution or increased imaging speed, critical for capturing fine dynamic biological processes. This approach also offers the prospect of simplifying hardware requirements/complexities, thereby making advanced imaging standards more accessible in terms of cost and/or size. This article provides an in-depth review of the diverse measurement aspects that researchers intentionally impair in their biophotonic setups, including the point spread function, signal-to-noise ratio, sampling density, and pixel resolution. By deliberately compromising these metrics, researchers aim to not only recuperate them through the application of deep learning networks, but also bolster in return other crucial parameters, such as the field-of-view, depth-of-field, and space-bandwidth product. Here, we discuss various biophotonic methods that have successfully employed this strategic approach. These techniques span broad applications and showcase the versatility and effectiveness of deep learning in the context of compromised biophotonic data. Finally, by offering our perspectives on the future possibilities of this rapidly evolving concept, we hope to motivate our readers to explore novel ways of balancing hardware compromises with compensation via AI.</description>

      <title>A miniaturized magnetic field sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a prime candidate for quantum sensing technologies. Ongoing miniaturization calls for ever-smaller sensors maintaining good measurement performance. Here, we present a fully integrated mechanically robust fiber-based endoscopic sensor capable of $5.9\,\mathrm{nT}/ \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ magnetic field sensitivity utilizing $15\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ sized microdiamonds at a microwave power of $50\,\mathrm{mW}$ and optical power of $2.15\,\mathrm{mW}$. A direct laser writing process is used to localize a diamond containing NV centers above the fiber's core by a polymer structure. This structure enables stable optical access and independent guiding of excitation and fluorescent light in different optical fibers. This separation strongly reduces the contribution of autofluorescence from the excitation light in the optical fiber. Moreover, a metallic direct laser written antenna structure is created next to the fibers' facet, allowing microwave manipulation of the NV centers' spins. The fabricated endoscopic sensor provides a robust platform with a tip diameter of $1.25\,\mathrm{mm}$. The device enables remote optical and microwave access to perform the full range of coherent spin measurements with NV centers at a spatial resolution of $15\,\mathrm{\mu m}$. We demonstrate the capability of vector magnetic field measurements in a magnetic field as used in state-of-the-art ultracold quantum gas experiments, opening a potential field in which high resolution and high sensitivity are necessary.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Localization and Recognition of Subwavelength Non-Cooperative Entities Based on SISO Time Reversal and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simultaneous localization and recognition of subwavelength non-cooperative entities within complex multi-scattering environments using a simplified system continues to pose a substantial challenge. This letter addresses this challenge by synergistically integrating time reversal time-frequency phase prints (TRTFPPs) and neural networks. Initially, a time reversal (TR) single-input single-output (SISO) framework is employed to generate TRTFPPs. To enhance the models' adaptability, particularly in the presence of noise, data augmentation techniques are applied. Subsequently, neural networks are employed to comprehend the TRTFPPs. Specifically, a cascaded neural network structure is embraced, encompassing both a recognition neural network and distinct neural networks for localizing different entities. Through the devised approach, two types of subwavelength entities are successfully identified and precisely localized through numerical simulations and experimental verification in laboratory environment. The proposed methodology holds applicability across various electromagnetic systems, including but not limited to detection, imaging, human-computer interaction, and the Internet of Things (IoT).</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Drain Noise in High Electron Mobility Transistors: Thermal and Hot Electron Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02858v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the on-wafer characterization of $S$-parameters and microwave noise temperature ($T_{50}$) of discrete metamorphic InGaAs high electron mobility transistors (mHEMTs) at 40 K and 300 K and over a range of drain-source voltages ($V_{DS}$). From these data, we extract a small-signal model and the drain (output) noise current power spectral density ($S_{id}$) at each bias and temperature. This procedure enables $S_{id}$ to be obtained while accounting for the variation of small-signal model, noise impedance match, and other parameters under the various conditions. We find that the thermal noise associated with the channel conductance can only account for a portion of the measured output noise. Considering the variation of output noise with physical temperature and bias and prior studies of microwave noise in quantum wells, we hypothesize that a hot electron noise source based on real-space transfer of electrons from the channel to the barrier could account for the remaining portion of $S_{id}$. We suggest further studies to gain insights into the physical mechanisms. Finally, we calculate that the minimum HEMT noise temperature could be reduced by up to $\sim 50$% and $\sim 30$% at cryogenic temperature and room temperature, respectively, if the hot electron noise could be suppressed.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Virtual Gain and Large Tuning of Particles' Scattering by Complex-Frequency Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active tuning of the scattering of particles and metasurfaces is a highly sought-after property for a host of electromagnetic and photonic applications, but it normally requires challenging-to-control tunable (reconfigurable) or active (gain) media. Here, we introduce the concepts of anisotropic virtual gain and oblique Kerker effect, where a completely lossy anisotropic medium behaves exactly as its anisotropic gain counterpart upon excitation by a synthetic complex-frequency wave. The strategy allows one to largely tune the magnitude and angle of a particle's scattering simply by changing the shape (envelope) of the incoming radiation, rather than by an involved medium-tuning mechanism. The so-attained anisotropic virtual gain enables directional super-scattering at an oblique direction with fine-management of the scattering angle. Our study, opening a unique light-management method, is based on analytical techniques that allow multipolar decomposition of the scattered field, and is found, throughout, to be in excellent agreement with full-wave simulations.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Laser-induced Transient Bubble Dynamics within Microchannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oscillatory flow in confined spaces is central to understanding physiological flows and rational design of synthetic periodic-actuation based micromachines. Using theory and experiments on oscillating flows generated through a laser-induced cavitation bubble, we associate the dynamic bubble size (fluid velocity) and bubble lifetime to the laser energy supplied - a control parameter in experiments. Employing different channel cross-section shapes, sizes and lengths, we demonstrate the characteristic scales for velocity, time and energy to depend solely on the channel geometry. Contrary to the generally assumed absence of instability in low Reynolds number flows (&lt;1000), we report a momentary flow distortion that originates due to the boundary layer separation near channel walls during flow deceleration. The emergence of distorted laminar states is characterized using two stages. First the conditions for the onset of instabilities is analyzed using the Reynolds number and Womersley number for oscillating flows. Second the growth and the ability of an instability to prevail is analyzed using the convective time scale of the flow. Our findings inform rational design of microsystems leveraging pulsatile flows via cavitation-powered microactuation.</description>
