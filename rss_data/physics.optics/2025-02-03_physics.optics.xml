      <title>Nonlinear Inference Capacity of Fiber-Optical Extreme Learning Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic complexity of nonlinear optical phenomena offers a fundamentally new resource to analog brain-inspired computing, with the potential to address the pressing energy requirements of artificial intelligence. We introduce and investigate the concept of nonlinear inference capacity in optical neuromorphic computing in highly nonlinear fiber-based optical Extreme Learning Machines. We demonstrate that this capacity scales with nonlinearity to the point where it surpasses the performance of a deep neural network model with five hidden layers on a scalable nonlinear classification benchmark. By comparing normal and anomalous dispersion fibers under various operating conditions and against digital classifiers, we observe a direct correlation between the system's nonlinear dynamics and its classification performance. Our findings suggest that image recognition tasks, such as MNIST, are incomplete in showcasing deep computing capabilities in analog hardware. Our approach provides a framework for evaluating and comparing computational capabilities, particularly their ability to emulate deep networks, across different physical and digital platforms, paving the way for a more generalized set of benchmarks for unconventional, physics-inspired computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Single-defect mode lasing in a non-Hermitian 1D trivial SSH lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate robust single-mode lasing in a non-Hermitian 1D trivial Su-Schrieffer-Heeger defective lattice. This structure exhibits a significantly lower threshold power compared to the non-defective lattice, with single-mode lasing sustained across a wide range of pump powers. Notably, our proposed device requires pumping of only the defect ring, leading to minimal required pump power. Moreover, lasing is not confined to the edges but can occur at any point within the lattice.</description>

      <title>Photonic-Spin governed absorption in a mu-near-zero subwavelength gyromagnetic cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing non-reciprocal scattering and absorption from subwavelength elements has several applications across the electromagnetic frequency spectrum. Here we show that gyromagnetic cylindrical rods with subwavelength dimensions exhibit strong absorption with diminished scattering in a narrow frequency band for an incident plane wave. We show that the strong narrowband absorption depends on the photonic-spin of the incident wave. Further, it is shown that this spin-dependent absorption leads to non-reciprocal reflection and absorption characteristics of an array of gyromagnetic cylinders suspended over a reflecting plane. The theoretical claims of strong spin-dependent absorption in subwavelength elements is validated by experimentally demonstrating nonreciprocal absorption and transmission from a single gyromagnetic rod placed in a substrate integrated waveguide.</description>

      <title>Coupling Dichroism in Strong-Coupled Chiral Molecule-Plasmon Nanoparticle System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between intense light-matter not only promotes emerging applications in quantum and nonlinear optics but also facilitates changes in material properties. Plasmons can significantly enhance not only molecular chirality but also the coupling strength. In this study, we investigate the coupling dichroism in a strongly coupled chiral molecule-plasmonic nanoparticle system using RT-TDDFT. By simulating the interaction between L/D- Phenylglycinol molecules and chiral aluminum clusters (Na-doped Al197Na4), we examine the effects of molecular chirality, cluster chirality, and the coupled effect in the system. Our results demonstrate that the achiral/chiral clusters induce significant spectral shifts and enhance molecular CD signals due to strong plasmon-molecule coupling. The electric-field distribution and transition contribution maps (TCMs) reveal the formation of bonding and antibonding polaritonic modes, modulated by molecular proximity to the cluster. Both of the coupling factor and decay rate of the coupled system will be modulated by the chirality of the molecules and the cluster. Furthermore, we find that increasing the number of coupled molecules leads to a substantial increase in the intensity of lower polaritonic modes, highlighting the collective behavior in multi-molecule systems due to the modal crosstalk or resonance between cluster chirality and molecular chirality. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing plasmon-enhanced chirality at the atomic scale, which have implications for the design of highly sensitive chiral sensors and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Assessing Sensitivity of Brain-to-Scalp Blood Flows in Laser Speckle Imaging by Occluding the Superficial Temporal Artery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerebral blood flow is a critical metric for cerebrovascular monitoring, with applications in stroke detection, brain injury evaluation, aging, and neurological disorders. Non-invasively measuring cerebral blood dynamics is challenging due to the scalp and skull, which obstruct direct brain access and contain their own blood dynamics that must be isolated. We developed an aggregated seven-channel speckle contrast optical spectroscopy system to measure blood flow and blood volume non-invasively. Each channel, with distinct source-to-detector distance, targeted different depths to detect scalp and brain blood dynamics separately. By briefly occluding the superficial temporal artery, which supplies blood only to the scalp, we isolated surface blood dynamics from brain signals. Results on 20 subjects show that scalp-sensitive channels experienced significant reductions in blood dynamics during occlusion, while brain-sensitive channels experienced minimal changes. This provides experimental evidence of brain-to-scalp sensitivity in optical measurements, highlighting optimal configuration for preferentially probing brain signals non-invasively.</description>

      <title>Visualization of topological shear polaritons in gypsum thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low symmetry crystals have recently emerged as a platform for exploring novel light-matter interactions in the form of hyperbolic shear polaritons. These excitations exhibit unique optical properties such as frequency-dispersive optical axes and asymmetric light propagation and energy dissipation, which arise from the presence of non-orthogonal resonances. However, only non-vdW materials have been demonstrated to support hyperbolic shear polaritons, limiting their exotic properties and potential applications. Here we introduce for the first time novel shear phenomena in low symmetry crystal thin films by demonstrating the existence of elliptical and canalized shear phonon polaritons in gypsum, an exfoliable monoclinic sulphate mineral. Our results unveil a topological transition from hyperbolic shear to elliptical shear polaritons, passing through a canalization regime with strong field confinement. Importantly, we observe a significant slowdown of group velocity, reaching values as low as 0.0005c, highlighting the potential of gypsum for "slow light" applications and extreme light-matter interaction control. These findings expand the application scope of low-symmetry crystals with the benefits that an exfoliable material provides, such as stronger field confinement, tunability, and versatility for its incorporation in complex photonic devices that might unlock new optical phenomena at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Ultra-fast Real-time Target Recognition Using a Shift, Scale, and Rotation Invariant Hybrid Opto-electronic Joint Transform Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid Opto-electronic correlators (HOC) overcome many limitations of all-optical correlators (AOC) while maintaining high-speed operation. However, neither the OEC nor the AOC in their conventional configurations can detect targets that have been rotated or scaled relative to a reference. This can be addressed by using a polar Mellin transform (PMT) pre-processing step to convert input images into signatures that contain most of the relevant information, albeit represented in a shift, scale, and rotation invariant (SSRI) manner. The PMT requires the use of optics to perform the Fourier transform and electronics for a log-polar remapping step. Recently, we demonstrated a pipelined architecture that can perform the PMT at a speed of 720 frames per second (fps), enabling the construction of an efficient opto-electronic PMT pre-processor. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of a complete HOC that implements this technique to achieve real-time and ultra-fast SSRI target recognition for space situational awareness. For this demonstration, we make use of a modified version of the HOC that makes use of Joint Transform Correlation , thus rendering the system simpler and more compact.</description>

      <title>Programmable Synthetic Magnetism and Chiral Edge States in Nano-Optomechanical Quantum Hall Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial magnetic fields break time-reversal symmetry in engineered materials--also known as metamaterials, enabling robust, topological transport of neutral excitations, much like electronic conduction edge channels in the integer quantum Hall effect. We experimentally demonstrate the emergence of quantum-Hall-like chiral edge states in optomechanical resonator networks. Synthetic magnetic fields for phononic excitations are induced through laser drives, while cavity optomechanical control allows full reconfigurability of the effective metamaterial response of the networks, including programming of magnetic fluxes in multiple resonator plaquettes. By tuning the interplay between network connectivity and magnetic fields, we demonstrate both flux-sensitive and flux-insensitive localized mechanical states. Scaling up the system creates spectral features that are precursors to Hofstadter butterfly spectra. Site-resolved spectroscopy reveals edge-bulk separation, with stationary phononic distributions signaling chiral edge modes. We directly probe those edge modes in transport measurements to demonstrate a unidirectional acoustic channel. This work unlocks new ways of controlling topological phononic phases at the nanoscale with applications in noise management and information processing.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing an optical cavity containing a bulk diamond crystal at millikelvin temperatures in a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We successfully stabilized a Fabry-P\'erot optical cavity incorporating a bulk diamond crystal at millikelvin temperatures in a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator with the pulse-tube cryocooler running. In stark contrast to previous demonstrations where lasers were locked to the cavities, our setup locks the cavity to a laser. Our measurements of cavity length fluctuation suggest that the setup could stabilize a cavity up to a finesse of $1.2\times 10^4$ without the diamond and $5.8 \times10^3$ with the diamond crystal. The finesse with a diamond crystal of approximately 90 is primarily limited by the absorption loss inside the diamond.</description>

      <title>Aggregation of dipolar molecules in SiO$_2$ hybrid organic inorganic films: use of silver nanoparticles as inhibitors of molecular aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The technological implementation of hybrid organic-inorganic materials in second order nonlinear optical photonic devices depends strongly on the ability of the host matrixes to contain high loads of dipolar molecules without aggregation. Some organic molecules are often used to diminish the attracting interactions between dipolar molecules in such kind of materials, but their efficiency as inhibitors of molecular aggregation is limited by their polarizability. In this work, we report the use of silver nanoparticles as inhibitors of molecular aggregation in hybrid organic-inorganic films doped with dipolar molecules. The large polarizability of the silver nanoparticles makes them ideal moieties for the inhibition of the electrostatic interactions between dipolar nonlinear optical molecules. The average size of the silver nanoparticles in this work was 70.5 nm in diameter, they were synthesized using silver nitrate (AgNO$_3$) as precursor and aminoethylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane as reducing agent. These nanoparticles were immersed in SiO$_2$ hybrid organic-inorganic sol-gel films doped with dipolar chromophores to study their effect as inhibitors of dipolar chromophores aggregation. The presence of the silver nanoparticles in the solid films was confirmed by transmission electronic microscopy and UV-Visible spectroscopy. UV-Visible spectroscopy was also used to monitor the dipolar chromophores aggregation in the SiO$_2$ films. We found that, at room temperature, silver nanoparticles are good inhibiting chromophores aggregation in comparison with the performance of organic inhibitors.</description>

      <title>Addressing the correlation of Stokes-shifted photons emitted from two quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In resonance fluorescence excitation experiments, light emitted from solid-state quantum emitters is typically filtered to eliminate the laser photons, ensuring that only red-shifted Stokes photons are detected. Theoretical analyses of the fluorescence intensity correlation often model emitters as two-level systems, focusing on light emitted exclusively from the purely electronic transition (the Zero-Phonon Line), or rely on statistical approaches based on conditional probabilities that do not account for quantum coherences. Here, we propose a general model to characterize the correlation of either Zero-Phonon Line photons or Stokes-shifted photons. This model successfully reproduces the experimental correlation of Stokes-shifted photons emitted from two interacting molecules and predicts that this correlation is affected by quantum coherence. Besides, we analyze the role of quantum coherence in light emission from two uncorrelated emitters, which helps to clarify the discrepancy between theory and experiments regarding the value of the correlation of photons emitted from this system at zero delay time.</description>

      <title>Methods for the study of light propagation in LArTPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) are widely used in particle physics experiments. They use light and charge released in events to reconstruct and analyze them. Light information collected by the Photon Detection System (PDS) is used mainly to determine the initial time stamp, $t_0$, and to support determining the total energy of the event. For these purposes, it is important to simulate and predict the propagation of light inside the detector. There are several approaches to this, and this work discusses some of the options.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the Third Harmonic Generation Efficiency of ITO nanolayers coupled to Tamm Plasmon Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the enhancement of third harmonic generation in indium tin oxide nanolayers coupled to Tamm plasmon polaritons (TPPs). The TPPs are excited at the interface between a thin gold mirror and a silicon dioxide/silicon nitride (SiO2/Si3N4) distributed Bragg reflector with a 30nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) nanolayer embedded inside the topmost dielectric layer under the metal mirror. This ITO nanolayer exhibits epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) behavior at near infrared wavelengths. By tuning the angle of incidence and the TPP resonance conditions, we achieve sub-wavelength confinement of the electromagnetic field, resulting in a 8x enhancement of the nonlinear optical response of the structure compared to the isolated ITO nanolayer at its optimal ENZ condition. We further investigate the dependence of the THG signal on the incident angle and sample orientation, confirming that the enhancement is driven by the excitation of the TPP mode with a characteristic asymmetric behavior. Numerical simulations of local field factors based on the transfer matrix method (TMM) fully support our findings. Our study demonstrates that the TPP-ENZ platform offers a versatile and highly efficient approach to enhancing nonlinear optical processes, with potential applications in frequency conversion, optical signal processing, and the development of more efficient nonlinear photonic devices.</description>

Abstract: For isotropic media, the magnetic field applied across the light propagation direction affects their optical properties only in the second order, and its effect proves to be much weaker than in the longitudinal field. In this work, we show that, under resonant excitation well beyond the linear regime, the situation changes drastically: A small magnetic linear anisotropy considerably increases, and an even stronger new quadrupole dichroism emerges. The latter manifests itself as the 90$^\circ$-periodic azimuthal dependence of the transmission and anisotropic rotation of the probe polarization plane. These effects are described microscopically in a toy model, and their symmetry analysis is presented. Both are observed experimentally on the D2 resonance of cesium vapor and agree with the theoretical predictions. The large magnitude of the quadrupole dichroism makes it promising for magnetometric applications and for studying the effects of anisotropic bleaching.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Dipole-Dipole Interactions Enabled with Guided Plasmons of Matched Nanoparticle-on-Mirror Antenna Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ruling a wide range of phenomena, dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) are typically constrained to the short range due to their rapid decay with the increasing dipole separations, limiting the performance in long-range applications. By judiciously designing the photonic structures that control the two-point Green's functions of the electromagnetic environment, the spontaneous emission of quantum emitters (luminescence) and their interactions (e.g., F\"orster energy transfer) can be conveniently tuned. In this paper, we designed a matched nanoparticle-on-mirror antenna pair with enhanced DDI guided by surface plasmon polaritons confined to the metal substrate, which ensures concentrated and enhanced interaction over long ranges of tens of wavelengths. The long-range ($\sim 10 \lambda$) DDI between donor-acceptor emitters is enhanced by $6\times 10^{3}$ times respective to bare gold film, and $4.4\times 10^{4}$ times respective to vacuum. Our result provides a promising testbed for investigating long-range DDI phenomena on the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Resolved Core Exciton Dynamics in LiF Using Attosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of light presents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the orbital alignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the polarization dependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV pulses excite electrons from the Li 1s core level into the conduction band, allowing for the formation of a p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the XUV light polarization axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then arrives at variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing the coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence lifetimes are found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a phonon-mediated dephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies. The differential absorption features are also shown to be sensitive to the relative polarization of the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR probe induces couplings between the initial XUV-excited p-like bright exciton and s-like dark excitons. When crossed pump and probe polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright and dark states is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption signal associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This interpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system, as well as analysis of the calculated band structure. The results indicate that laser polarization can serve as a powerful experimental tool for exploring the orbital alignment of core excitonic states in solid-state materials.</description>
