      <title>Determination and evaluation of the critical liquid nitrogen for superconducting levitator based on a novel temperature-weight coupling measurement device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid nitrogen (LN2) is the only cooling medium for the high-temperature superconducting (HTS) bulks in the superconducting levitator, which is the heart of the maglev train, to reach working state. The detection and determination of the critical LN2 content are crucial for reliable operation of the HTS maglev train. However, the related intelligent detection model and technology is lack in the combination filed of the cryogenic environment and maglev application, and there is no existing method to detect the LN2 content in superconducting levitator. This paper proposes to employ multisensor fusion framework to fuse and enhance the accuracy of critical LN2 content testing. Four temperature sensors were deployed inside superconducting levitator to measure the temperature change during the LN2 content changing from 100 % to 0. It was first obtained that the critical LN2 content in the superconducting levitator is 4%. To accurately monitor the critical LN2 content in the superconducting levitator, a matrix-weighted information fusion Kalman filter algorithm was used. Compared with the previous single sensor method, the testing accuracy of the multisensor fusion method can be improved by 5.6%. The work can provide a preliminary research foundation for the online monitoring and fault diagnosis of HTS maglev train.</description>

      <title>Scintillation and Timing Performance of a 3at% Yttrium-Doped Barium Fluoride Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the scintillation and timing performance of a new developed 200 * 20 mm * 20 mm large size barium fluoride crystal doped with 3at% yttrium (BaF2:Y) to enhance the application for high time resolution. This doping effectively suppresses the slow scintillation component while maintaining most of the fast component, as confirmed by X-ray excited luminescence measurements. The BaF2:Y crystal demonstrated a transmittance of near 90% in the visible spectrum and a light response uniformity parameter of delta = (-2.74 +- 1.15)% when coupled with the tail end. The actual yttrium content varied from 2.1at% near the seed end to 3.7at% at the tail end. The assembled large BaF2:Y detector with silicon photomultipliers exhibited a time resolution of (82.2 +- 2.6) ps using constant fraction discrimination method in a cosmic ray test and (140.1 +- 3.8) ps using a low fixed threshold method in a beam test at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility with an 1.35 GeV electron beam. These results indicate the significant potential of BaF2:Y crystal for various applications, such as detectors for particle physics and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>The Ultra-Low material budget GEM based TPC for tracking with VMM3a readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaseous Electron Multiplier-based Time Projection Chamber (GEM-TPC) in TWIN configuration for particle tracking has been consolidated after extensive investigations in different facilities to study its tracking performance. The most attractive feature of this detector is its ultra-low material budget, which is 0.28\% X/X$_0$ and can be further reduced by decreasing the thickness of the gas traversed by the incident particles. Thus, it provides excellent position reconstruction and reduced multi-scattering. This detector consists of two GEM-TPCs with drift fields in opposite directions, achieved by rotating one 180 degrees in the middle plane with respect to the other. These two GEM-TPCs share the same gas volume, i.e., inside a single vessel. This configuration is called a TWIN configuration. The results presented in this work were measured using the newly integrated VMM3a/SRS readout electronics, an important milestone in improving overall performance and capabilities. In 2024, this detector was tested at the H4 beamline of the SPS at CERN, using muons and pions and with different gas mixtures like, for instance: Ar/CO$_2$ (70/30 \%), He/CO$_2$ (70/30 \%) and He/CO$_2$ (90/10 \%). The helium-based mixtures were used to commission the detector to track low momenta muons required in the PSI muon-induced X-ray emission (MIXE) experiment. The results obtained from these measurements, a brief discussion of the methodology used for the data analysis, and a comparison of the spatial resolution for different gas mixtures will be presented.</description>

      <title>OpticFusion: Multi-Modal Neural Implicit 3D Reconstruction of Microstructures by Fusing White Light Interferometry and Optical Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White Light Interferometry (WLI) is a precise optical tool for measuring the 3D topography of microstructures. However, conventional WLI cannot capture the natural color of a sample's surface, which is essential for many microscale research applications that require both 3D geometry and color information. Previous methods have attempted to overcome this limitation by modifying WLI hardware and analysis software, but these solutions are often costly. In this work, we address this challenge from a computer vision multi-modal reconstruction perspective for the first time. We introduce OpticFusion, a novel approach that uses an additional digital optical microscope (OM) to achieve 3D reconstruction with natural color textures using multi-view WLI and OM images. Our method employs a two-step data association process to obtain the poses of WLI and OM data. By leveraging the neural implicit representation, we fuse multi-modal data and apply color decomposition technology to extract the sample's natural color. Tested on our multi-modal dataset of various microscale samples, OpticFusion achieves detailed 3D reconstructions with color textures. Our method provides an effective tool for practical applications across numerous microscale research fields. The source code and our real-world dataset are available at https://github.com/zju3dv/OpticFusion.</description>

      <title>Performance evaluation of electron multiplier tubes as a high-intensity muon beam monitor of accelerator neutrino experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upgrade work towards increasing the beam intensity of the neutrino beamline at J- PARC is underway. Monitoring tertiary muon beams is essential for stable operation of the beamline. Accordingly, we plan to replace the present muon monitor sensors with electron multiplier tubes (EMTs). We investigated the radiation tolerance and linearity response of EMTs using a 90 MeV electron beam. An EMTs was irradiated with electrons up to 470 nC. EMTs show higher radiation tolerance than the Si sensors which are presently used as one of the muon monitor detectors for the T2K long-baseline neutrino experiment at J-PARC. The integrated charge yield decrease is found to be less than 8% after a beam irradiation equivalent to 132 days of operation at the future J-PARC beam power of 1.3 MW. The EMTs show linearity better than $\pm$5% up to the future beam intensity. The observed yield decrease is likely due to dynode deterioration based on the detailed investigation. The studies described here confirm that EMTs can be used as a high-intensity muon beam monitor. From the reported results, we are proceeding with the installation in the J-PARC neutrino beamline.</description>

      <title>In-situ high voltage generation with Cockcroft-Walton multiplier for xenon gas time projection chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have newly developed a Cockcroft-Walton (CW) multiplier that can be used in a gas time projection chamber (TPC). TPC requires a high voltage to form an electric field that drifts ionization electrons. Supplying the high voltage from outside the pressure vessel requires a dedicated high-voltage feedthrough. An alternative approach is to generate the high voltage inside the pressure vessel with a relatively low voltage introduced from outside. CW multiplier can convert a low AC voltage input to a high DC voltage output, making it suitable for this purpose.
  We have integrated the CW multiplier into a high-pressure xenon gas TPC, called AXEL (A Xenon ElectroLuminescence detector), which have been developed to search for neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe. It detects ionization electrons by detecting electroluminescence with silicon photomultipliers, making it strong against electrical noises. An operation with the CW multiplier was successfully demonstrated; the TPC was operated for 77 days at 6.8 bar, and an energy resolution as high as (0.67 $\pm$ 0.08) % (FWHM) at 2615 keV was obtained.</description>

      <title>HGPflow: Extending Hypergraph Particle Flow to Collider Event Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high energy physics, the ability to reconstruct particles based on their detector signatures is essential for downstream data analyses. A particle reconstruction algorithm based on learning hypergraphs (HGPflow) has previously been explored in the context of single jets. In this paper, we expand the scope to full proton-proton and electron-positron collision events and study reconstruction quality using metrics at the particle, jet, and event levels. Rather than operating on the entire event in a single pass, we train HGPflow on smaller partitions to avoid potentially learning long-range correlations related to the physics process. We demonstrate that this approach is feasible and that on most metrics, HGPflow outperforms both traditional particle flow algorithms and a machine learning-based benchmark model.</description>
