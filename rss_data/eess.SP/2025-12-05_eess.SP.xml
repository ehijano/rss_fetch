      <title>ReVeal-MT: A Physics-Informed Neural Network for Multi-Transmitter Radio Environment Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately mapping the radio environment (e.g., identifying wireless signal strength at specific frequency bands and geographic locations) is crucial for efficient spectrum sharing, enabling Secondary Users~(SUs) to access underutilized spectrum bands while protecting Primary Users~(PUs). While existing models have made progress, they often degrade in performance when multiple transmitters coexist, due to the compounded effects of shadowing, interference from adjacent transmitters. To address this challenge, we extend our prior work on Physics-Informed Neural Networks~(PINNs) for single-transmitter mapping to derive a new multi-transmitter Partial Differential Equation~(PDE) formulation of the Received Signal Strength Indicator~(RSSI). We then propose \emph{ReVeal-MT} (Re-constructor and Visualizer of Spectrum Landscape for Multiple Transmitters), a novel PINN which integrates the multi-source PDE residual into a neural network loss function, enabling accurate spectrum landscape reconstruction from sparse RF sensor measurements. ReVeal-MT is validated using real-world measurements from the ARA wireless living lab across rural and suburban environments, and benchmarked against 3GPP and ITU-R channel models and a baseline PINN model for a single transmitter use-case. Results show that ReVeal-MT achieves substantial accuracy gains in multi-transmitter scenarios, e.g., achieving an RMSE of only 2.66\,dB with as few as 45 samples over a 370-square-kilometer region, while maintaining low computational complexity. These findings demonstrate that ReVeal-MT significantly advances radio environment mapping under realistic multi-transmitter conditions, with strong potential for enabling fine-grained spectrum management and precise coexistence between PUs and SUs.</description>

      <title>A Spatial Array for Spectrally Agile Wireless Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive MIMO is a cornerstone of next-generation wireless communication, offering significant gains in capacity, reliability, and energy efficiency. However, to meet emerging demands such as high-frequency operation, wide bandwidths, co-existence, integrated sensing, and resilience to dynamic interference, future systems must exhibit both scalability and spectral agility. These requirements place increasing pressure on the underlying processing hardware to be both efficient and reconfigurable. This paper proposes a custom-designed spatial array architecture that serves as a reconfigurable, general-purpose core optimized for a class of wireless kernels that commonly arise in diverse communications and sensing tasks. The proposed spatial array is evaluated against specialized cores for each kernel using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). Both the reconfigurable and specialized designs are synthesized in a 32 nm process to assess latency, throughput, area, and power in realistic processes. The results identify conditions under which general-purpose systolic architectures can approach the efficiency of specialized cores, thereby paving the way toward more scalable and agile systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Beamforming for Pinching Antenna System-Enabled ISAC in Low-Altitude Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the joint learning of pinching antenna (PA) positions and transmit beamforming for PA-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in the low-altitude wireless networks. By freely deploying antenna positions along waveguides, the pinching antenna system effectively mitigates the impact of path loss and thus enhances the capacities of sensing and communicating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that fly over a large range. We first model the problem of maximizing the sensing performance of multiple targets while satisfying the communication performance requirements of multiple users, where both the targets and users are UAVs. For mitigating in-waveguide attenuation and improving sensing performance, the segmented waveguide-enabled pinching antenna (SWAN) system is adopted. Furthermore, an alternative optimization (AO) algorithm for SWAN-based ISAC (SWISAC-AO) is developed, where the optimal structure of the transmit beamforming solution is derived. A graph neural network (GNN), termed SWISAC-GNN, is then proposed to jointly learn PA positions and transmit beamforming, with its alternative update procedure inspired by the SWISAC-AO algorithm. Numerical results show that the GNN achieves sensing performance comparable to or better than the AO algorithm while better satisfying communication requirements. Moreover, the SWISAC-GNN is with much lower implementation complexity, enabling real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>A Mixed Precision FFT with applications in MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mixed precision Fast Fourier transform (FFT) implementation is presented. The procedure uses per-block microscaling (MX), a global power-of-two prescale, and prequantized low bit twiddles. We evaluate forward and round-trip FFT fidelity on two public MRI datasets and compare the effect of various low precision formats, image sizes, and MX block sizes on image quality. Results show that mantissa precision is the primary limiter under MX scaling while ablations suggest weak dependence on image size but a clear block-size trade-off with larger block sizes resulting in better numerical performance.</description>

      <title>RRAM-Based Analog Matrix Computing for Massive MIMO Signal Processing: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) provides an excellent platform for analog matrix computing (AMC), enabling both matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) and the solution of matrix equations through open-loop and closed-loop circuit architectures. While RRAM-based AMC has been widely explored for accelerating neural networks, its application to signal processing in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication is rapidly emerging as a promising direction. In this Review, we summarize recent advances in applying AMC to massive MIMO, including DFT/IDFT computation for OFDM modulation and demodulation using MVM circuits; MIMO detection and precoding using MVM-based iterative algorithms; and rapid one-step solutions enabled by matrix inversion (INV) and generalized inverse (GINV) circuits. We also highlight additional opportunities, such as AMC-based compressed-sensing recovery for channel estimation and eigenvalue circuits for leakage-based precoding. Finally, we outline key challenges, including RRAM device reliability, analog circuit precision, array scalability, and data conversion bottlenecks, and discuss the opportunities for overcoming these barriers. With continued progress in device-circuit-algorithm co-design, RRAM-based AMC holds strong promise for delivering high-efficiency, high-reliability solutions to (ultra)massive MIMO signal processing in the 6G era.</description>

      <title>Towards 6G Native-AI Edge Networks: A Semantic-Aware and Agentic Intelligence Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution toward sixth-generation wireless systems positions intelligence as a native network capability, fundamentally transforming the design of radio access networks (RANs). Within this vision, Semantic-native communication and agentic intelligence are expected to play central roles. SemCom departs from bit-level fidelity and instead emphasizes task-oriented meaning exchange, enabling compact SC and introducing new performance measures such as semantic fidelity and task success rate. Agentic intelligence endows distributed RAN entities with goal-driven autonomy, reasoning, planning, and multi-agent collaboration, increasingly supported by foundation models and knowledge graphs. In this work, we first introduce the conceptual foundations of SemCom and agentic networking, and discuss why existing AI-driven O-RAN solutions remain largely bit-centric and task-siloed. We then present a unified taxonomy that organizes recent research along three axes: i) semantic abstraction level (symbol/feature/intent/knowledge), ii) agent autonomy and coordination granularity (single-, multi-, and hierarchical-agent), and iii) RAN control placement across PHY/MAC, near-real-time RIC, and non-real-time RIC. Based on this taxonomy, we systematically introduce enabling technologies including task-oriented semantic encoders/decoders, multi-agent reinforcement learning, foundation-model-assisted RAN agents, and knowledge-graph-based reasoning for cross-layer awareness. Representative 6G use cases, such as immersive XR, vehicular V2X, and industrial digital twins, are analyzed to illustrate the semantic-agentic convergence in practice. Finally, we identify open challenges in semantic representation standardization, scalable trustworthy agent coordination, O-RAN interoperability, and energy-efficient AI deployment, and outline research directions toward operational semantic-agentic AI-RAN.</description>

      <title>Enabling Fast Polar SC Decoding with IR-HARQ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To extend the applications of polar codes within next-generation wireless communication systems, it is essential to incorporate support for Incremental Redundancy (IR) Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) schemes. For very high- throughput applications, Successive Cancellation (SC) decoding is particularly appealing for polar codes owing to its high area efficiency. In this paper, we propose modifications to SC decoders that employ special nodes to accelerate decoding. Our modifications enable the use of polar IR-HARQ with SC decoding for high throughput applications. Compared to the unmodified SC IR-HARQ scheme, our proposed approach allows us to achieve a 72% reduction in node traversals with a polar code of length 2048. Simulation results confirm that the proposed special node modifications do not cause any degradation in FER performance.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear EM-based Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of high-frequency bands, combined with antenna arrays containing an extremely large number of elements (XL-MIMO), is pushing current technology to its limits in terms of hardware complexity, latency, and power consumption. A promising approach to achieving scalable and sustainable solutions is to shift part of the signal processing directly into the electromagnetic (EM) domain. In this paper, we investigate novel architectures that harness the interaction of reconfigurable passive linear and nonlinear (NL) scattering elements positioned in the reactive near field of signal sources. The objective is to enable multifunctional linear and NL EM signal processing to occur directly "over-the-air." Numerical results highlight the potential to significantly reduce both system complexity and the number of RF chains, while still achieving key performance metrics in applications such as direction-of-arrival and position estimation, without the need for additional analog or digital processing.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna System Design under Random LoS and NLoS Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antennas, realized through position-adjustable radiating elements along dielectric waveguides, have emerged as a promising flexible-antenna technology thanks to their ability to dynamically reshape large-scale channel conditions. However, most existing studies focus on idealized LoS-dominated environments, overlooking the stochastic nature of realistic wireless propagation. This paper investigates a more practical multiuser pinching-antenna system under a composite probabilistic channel model that captures distance-dependent LoS blockage and NLoS scattering. To account for both efficiency and reliability aspects of communication, two complementary design metrics are considered: an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric characterizing long-term throughput and fairness, and an outage-constrained metric ensuring a prescribed reliability level. Based on these metrics, we formulate two optimization problems: the first maximizes the max-min average SNR across users, while the second maximizes a guaranteed SNR threshold under per-user outage constraints. Although both problems are inherently nonconvex, we exploit their underlying monotonic structures and develop low-complexity, bisection-based algorithms that achieve globally optimal solutions using only simple scalar evaluations. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and demonstrate that pinching-antenna systems significantly outperform conventional fixed-antenna designs even under random LoS and NLoS channels.</description>

      <title>CIG-MAE: Cross-Modal Information-Guided Masked Autoencoder for Self-Supervised WiFi Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human Action Recognition using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) has emerged as an attractive alternative to vision-based methods due to its ubiquity, device-agnostic nature, and inherent privacy-preserving capabilities. However, the high cost of manual annotation and the limited scale of publicly available CSI datasets restrict the performance of supervised approaches. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising avenue, but existing contrastive paradigms rely on data augmentations that conflict with the physical semantics of radio signals and require large-batch training, making them poorly suited for CSI. To overcome these challenges, we introduce CIG-MAE -- a Cross-modal Information-Guided Masked Autoencoder -- that reconstructs both the amplitude and phase of CSI using a symmetric dual-stream architecture with a high masking ratio. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Information-Guided Masking strategy that dynamically allocates attention to time-frequency regions with high information density to improve learning efficiency, and incorporate a Barlow Twins regularizer to align cross-modal representations without negative samples. Experiments on three public datasets show that CIG-MAE consistently outperforms SOTA SSL methods and even surpasses a fully supervised baseline, demonstrating superior data efficiency, robustness, and representation generalization.</description>

      <title>Secret Key Generation on Aerial Rician Fading Channels Against a Curious Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secret key generation at the physical layer is expected to be a fundamental enabler for next-generation networks. We consider a network where the user equipment is a drone and propose a novel secret key generation solution when the eavesdropper is another node belonging to the network (curious device). We exploit drone mobility over realistic Rician fading channels. In our protocol, after a prior training phase, drone Alice chooses a trajectory of positions in space and transmits a message to Bob, on the ground, from each position. From the received messages, Bob estimates the channel gain from which a secret key is extracted. The choice of the positions is made to maximize a lower bound on the secret key capacity. Numerical simulations are used to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Assisted Flexible Beamforming for Integrated Sensing and Communication in Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as a key technology in sixth-generation wireless networks, and the additional spatial degrees of freedom obtained by movable antenna (MA) technology can significantly improve the performance of ISAC systems. This paper considers an ISAC-assisted vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) network, where extended kalman filter-based prediction is combined with real-time optimization to jointly optimize transmit antenna positions and beamforming and power allocation vectors in dynamic environments. We propose two algorithms: a preprocessing-schur complement-projected gradient ascent algorithm for scenarios without sensing quality of service (QoS) constraints, which explores the potential range of sensing performance to provide reference and warm-starting for subsequent constrained optimization; and a heuristic reflective projected dynamic particle swarm optimization algorithm for sensing QoS-constrained scenarios, which achieves substantial performance gains under non-convex constraints with a small number of iterations. Simulation results demonstrate that these approaches enhance both the communication sum-rate and the lower of the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound of motion parameter estimation, validating the effectiveness of MA-assisted beamforming in dynamic V2I ISAC networks.</description>

      <title>Cute but Cunning: Effective Closed-Form Alternatives to the Exact Lognormal Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lognormal distribution is a fundamental statistical model widely used in different fields of science, including biology, finance, economics, engineering, etc. In wireless communications, it is the primary statistic for large-scale fading modeling. However, its known analytical intractability presents persistent channel characterization and performance analysis challenges. This paper introduces two effective and mathematically tractable surrogate models for the Lognormal distribution, constructed from the product of Nakagami-$m$ and Inverse Nakagami-$m$ (I-Nakagami-$m$) variates. These models yield asymptotically exact closed-form expressions for key performance metrics -- including the characteristic function, bit error rate, and Shannon's capacity -- and enable analytically tractable expressions for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the composite $\alpha$-$\mu$-Lognormal fading model. To facilitate implementation, a moment-matching framework is developed to map the Lognormal parameters to the surrogate model parameters. In addition, a random mixture approach is proposed to enhance convergence by exploiting the complementary approximation properties of the Nakagami-$m$ and I-Nakagami-$m$ distributions. The methodology is further extended to heterogeneous cascaded fading channels comprising arbitrary combinations of $\alpha$-$\mu$, $\kappa$-$\mu$, and $\eta$-$\mu$ variates, for which moment-based mappings to the equivalent Lognormal distributions are derived. Numerical results confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach, positioning it as a practical and reliable alternative to exact Lognormal statistics.</description>

      <title>Beampattern Synthesis for Discrete Phase RIS in Communication and Sensing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive research on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) has primarily focused on optimizing reflective coefficients for passive beamforming in specific target directions. This optimization typically assumes prior knowledge of the target direction, which is unavailable before the target is detected. To enhance direction estimation, it is critical to develop array pattern synthesis techniques that yield a wider beam by maximizing the received power over the entire target area. Although this challenge has been addressed with active antennas, RIS systems pose a unique challenge due to their inherent phase constraints, which can be continuous or discrete.
  This work addresses this challenge through a novel array pattern synthesis method tailored for discrete phase constraints in RIS. We introduce a penalty method that pushes these constraints to the boundary of the convex hull. Then, the Minorization-Maximization (MM) method is utilized to reformulate the problem into a convex one. Our numerical results show that our algorithm can generate a wide beam pattern comparable to that achievable with per-power constraints, with both the amplitudes and phases being adjustable. We compare our method with a traditional beam sweeping technique, showing a) several orders of magnitude reduction of the MSE of Angle of Arrival (AOA) at low to medium Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)s; and b) $8$~dB SNR reduction to achieve a high probability of detection.</description>

      <title>Channel-Aware Multi-Domain Feature Extraction for Automatic Modulation Recognition in MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is a key technology in non-cooperative communication systems, aiming to identify the modulation scheme from signals without prior information. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have gained wide attention due to their excellent performance, but research mainly focuses on single-input single-output (SISO) systems, with limited exploration for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The confounding effects of multi-antenna channels can interfere with the statistical properties of MIMO signals, making identification particularly challenging. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Channel-Aware Multi-Domain feature extraction (CAMD) framework for AMR in MIMO systems. Our CAMD framework reconstructs the transmitted signal through an efficient channel compensation module and achieves a more robust representation capability against channel interference by extracting and integrating multi-domain features, including intra-antenna temporal correlations and inter-antenna channel correlations. We have verified our method on the widely-used dataset, MIMOSig-Ref, with complex mobile channel environments. Extensive experiments confirm the performance advantages of CAMD over previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Analytical and Cross-Sectional Clinical Validity of a Smartphone-Based U-Turn Test in Multiple Sclerosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observational GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728) enrolled adult people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) &lt;=6.5. PwMS performed the U-Turn Test (UTT), a smartphone-based assessment of dynamic balance, in a gait laboratory (supervised setting) using 6 smartphones at different body locations and daily during a 2-week remote period (unsupervised setting) using 1 smartphone. In the supervised setting, the accuracy of detecting turns with smartphones was compared against turns detected with a motion capture system (mocap) using F1 scores. Agreement between turn speed measured with smartphones and mocap was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC[3,1]) and bias. In the unsupervised setting, test-retest reliability was assessed by ICC(2,1), and correlations with clinical and patient-reported measures by Spearman rank correlation. Ninety-six PwMS were included. In the supervised setting, turns were detected with high accuracy (F1 scores &gt;95% across smartphone wear locations). Smartphone-derived turn speed was comparable across the supervised (1.44 rad/s) and unsupervised settings (1.47 rad/s), and with mocap-derived turn speed (1.47 rad/s). ICC(3,1) revealed high agreement between smartphone- and mocap-derived turn speed (ICC[3,1]: 0.87-0.92 across smartphone wear locations). Bias was minimal (-0.04 to 0.11 rad/s). In the unsupervised setting, test-retest reliability (ICC[2,1]) was &gt;0.90 when aggregating &gt;=2 tests. The UTT correlated with Timed 25-Foot Walk gait speed, EDSS, Ambulation score, 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale, and Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (r=-0.79 to -0.61). The UTT measures turn speed accurately and reproducibly irrespective of smartphone wear location and settings. These findings affirm its potential as a valuable tool in multiple sclerosis trials.</description>

      <title>Distributed Riemannian Optimization in Geodesically Non-convex Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of distributed Riemannian optimization over a network of agents whose cost functions are geodesically smooth but possibly geodesically non-convex. Extending a well-known distributed optimization strategy called diffusion adaptation to Riemannian manifolds, we show that the resulting algorithm, the Riemannian diffusion adaptation, provably exhibits several desirable behaviors when minimizing a sum of geodesically smooth non-convex functions over manifolds of bounded curvature. More specifically, we establish that the algorithm can approximately achieve network agreement in the sense that Fr\'echet variance of the iterates among the agents is small. Moreover, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a first-order stationary point for general geodesically non-convex cost functions. When the global cost function additionally satisfies the Riemannian Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition, we also show that it converges linearly under a constant step size up to a steady-state error. Finally, we apply this algorithm to a decentralized robust principal component analysis (PCA) problem formulated on the Grassmann manifold and illustrate its convergence and performance through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Markov-Renewal Single-Photon LiDAR Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon LiDAR (SP-LiDAR) simulators face a dilemma: fast but inaccurate Poisson models or accurate but prohibitively slow sequential models. This paper breaks that compromise. We present a simulator that achieves both fidelity and speed by focusing on the critical, yet overlooked, component of simulation: the photon count statistics. Our key contribution is a Markov-renewal process (MRP) formulation that, for the first time, analytically predicts the mean and variance of registered photon counts under dead time. To make this MRP model computationally tractable, we introduce a spectral truncation rule that efficiently computes the complex covariance statistics. By proving the shift-invariance of the process, we extend this per-pixel model to full histogram cube generation via a precomputed lookup table. Our method generates 3D cubes indistinguishable from the sequential gold-standard, yet is orders of magnitude faster. This finally enables large-scale, physically-faithful data generation for learning-based SP-LiDAR reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Generalized Pinching-Antenna Systems: A Leaky-Coaxial-Cable Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution toward the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks has flexible reconfigurable antenna architectures capable of adapting their radiation characteristics to the surrounding environment. At the center-stage, while waveguide based pinching antennas have been shown to beneficially ameliorate wireless propagation environments, their applications have remained confined to high-frequency scenarios. As a remedy, we propose a downlink generalized pinching-antenna system that adapts this compelling concept to low-frequency operation through a leaky-coaxial-cable (LCX) implementation. By endowing LCX structures with controllable radiation slots, the system inherits the key capabilities of waveguide based pinching antennas. Explicitly, these include reconfigurable line-of-sight (LoS) links, reduced path loss, and flexible deployment, while supporting a practical implementation of the pinching-antenna concept at low frequencies. A twin-stage propagation model is developed for characterizing both the guided transmission and wireless radiation encountered over LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths. Analytical results reveal strong local gain, complemented by rapid distance-dependent decay. Hence, we conceive a matching joint optimization framework, which maximizes throughput by harnessing game-theoretic association and convex power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate substantial performance gains over conventional fixed-antenna benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Decoders for Sensing Subspace Code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse antenna array sensing of source/target via direction of arrival (DoA) estimation motivates design of the sensing framework in joint communication and sensing (JCAS) systems for sixth generation (6G) communication systems. Recently, it is established by Mahdavifar, Rajam\"{a}ki, and Pal that array geometry of sparse arrays has fundamental connections with the design of subspace codes in coding theory. This was then utilized to design efficient \textit{sensing subspace codes} that estimate the DoA with good resolution. Specifically, the Bose-Chowla sensing subspace code provides near optimal code design for unique DoA estimation with tight theoretical upper bound on the error performance. However, the currently known decoder for these codes, to estimate the DoA, is a traditional \textit{Maximum-a-Posterior (MAP) decoder} with complexity that is cubic with the number of antennas. In this work, we propose novel efficient decoding algorithms for sensing subspace codes, that reduce the complexity down to quadratic while providing new knobs to tune in order to tradeoff complexity with error performance. The decoders are further evaluated for their performance via Monte Carlo simulations for a range of SNRs demonstrating promising performance that smoothly approaches the MAP performance as the complexity grows from quadratic to cubic in the number of antennas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates channel estimation for ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. We propose a joint low-rank and sparse Bayesian estimation (LRSBE) algorithm for spatial non-stationary ultra-massive channels by exploiting the low-rankness and sparsity in the beam domain. Specifically, the channel estimation integrates sparse Bayesian learning and soft-threshold gradient descent within the expectation-maximization framework. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives under different signal-to-noise ratio conditions in terms of estimation accuracy and overall complexity.</description>

      <title>WiFi-based Cross-Domain Gesture Recognition Using Attention Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While fulfilling communication tasks, wireless signals can also be used to sense the environment. Among various types of sensing media, WiFi signals offer advantages such as widespread availability, low hardware cost, and strong robustness to environmental conditions like light, temperature, and humidity. By analyzing Wi-Fi signals in the environment, it is possible to capture dynamic changes of the human body and accomplish sensing applications such as gesture recognition. Although many existing gesture sensing solutions perform well in-domain but lack cross-domain capabilities (i.e., recognition performance in untrained environments). To address this, we extract Doppler spectra from the channel state information (CSI) received by all receivers and concatenate each Doppler spectrum along the same time axis to generate fused images with multi-angle information as input features. Furthermore, inspired by the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), we propose a gesture recognition network that integrates a multi-semantic spatial attention mechanism with a self-attention-based channel mechanism. This network constructs attention maps to quantify the spatiotemporal features of gestures in images, enabling the extraction of key domain-independent features. Additionally, ResNet18 is employed as the backbone network to further capture deep-level features. To validate the network performance, we evaluate the proposed network on the public Widar3 dataset, and the results show that it not only maintains high in-domain accuracy of 99.72%, but also achieves high performance in cross-domain recognition of 97.61%, significantly outperforming existing best solutions.</description>

      <title>Timely Information for Strategic Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a dynamic variant of Bayesian persuasion, in which a strategic sender seeks to influence a receiver's belief over time through controlling the timing of the information disclosure, under resource constraints. We consider a binary information source (i.e., taking values 0 or 1), where the source's state evolve according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this setting, the receiver aims to estimate the source's state as accurately as possible. In contrast, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver to estimate the state to be 1, regardless of whether this estimate reflects the true state. This misalignment between their objectives naturally leads to a Stackelberg game formulation where the sender, acting as the leader, chooses an information-revelation policy, and the receiver, as the follower, decides whether to follow the sender's messages. As a result, the sender's objective is to maximize the long-term average time that the receiver's estimate equals 1, subject to a total sampling constraint and a constraint for the receiver to follow the sender's messages called incentive compatibility (IC) constraint. We first consider the single-source problem and show that the sender's optimal policy is to allocate a minimal sampling rate to the undesired state 0 (just enough to satisfy the IC constraint) and assign the remaining sampling rate to the desired state 1. Next, we extend the analysis to the multi-source case, where each source has a different minimal sampling rate. Our results show that the sender can leverage the timeliness of the revealed information to influence the receiver, thereby achieving a higher utility.</description>

      <title>Exact 3-D Channel Impulse Response for Spherical Receivers with Arbitrary Drift Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate channel modeling for spherical absorbing receivers is fundamental to the design of realistic molecular multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. While advanced modulation schemes have been proposed to mitigate interference, determining the channel impulse response (CIR) under arbitrary flow directions remains a challenge; existing exact solutions are restricted to either 1-D/no-drift scenarios or planar receiver geometries. Addressing this gap, we derive the first exact analytical CIR for a spherical receiver in a 3-D molecular communication system with uniform drift in an arbitrary direction. Unlike prior approximations that ignore the angle between the drift and the transmission axis, our approach utilizes the Girsanov theorem to analytically transform the hitting-time distribution from a stationary medium to a drifted one. The proposed closed-form expression not only eliminates modeling errors inherent in previous approximations for off-axis receivers but also enables efficient parameter-space exploration of critical system metrics (e.g., peak time and amplitude), a task that would be computationally costly with pure simulation-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Communicating Properties of Quantum States over Classical Noisy Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmitting information about quantum states over classical noisy channels is an important problem with applications to science, computing, and sensing. This task, however, poses fundamental challenges due to the exponential scaling of state space with system size. We introduce shadow tomography-based transmission with unequal error protection (STT-UEP), a novel communication protocol that enables efficient transmission of properties of quantum states, allowing decoder-side estimation of arbitrary observables. Unlike conventional approaches requiring the transmission of a number of bits that is exponential in the number of qubits, STT-UEP achieves communication complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of observables, depending on the observable weight. The protocol exploits classical shadow tomography for measurement efficiency, and applies unequal error protection by encoding measurement bases with stronger channel codes than measurement outcomes. We provide theoretical guarantees on estimation accuracy as a function of the bit error probability of the classical channel, and validate the approach against several benchmarks via numerical results.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware Channel Inference via Cross-Modal Flow: From Multimodal Sensing to Wireless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) underpins reliable and efficient wireless communication. However, acquiring CSI via pilot estimation incurs substantial overhead, especially in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in high-Doppler environments. By leveraging the growing availability of environmental sensing data, this treatise investigates pilot-free channel inference that estimates complete CSI directly from multimodal observations, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS coordinates. In contrast to prior studies that rely on predefined channel models, we develop a data-driven framework that formulates the sensing-to-channel mapping as a cross-modal flow matching problem. The framework fuses multimodal features into a latent distribution within the channel domain, and learns a velocity field that continuously transforms the latent distribution toward the channel distribution. To make this formulation tractable and efficient, we reformulate the problem as an equivalent conditional flow matching objective and incorporate a modality alignment loss, while adopting low-latency inference mechanisms to enable real-time CSI estimation. In experiments, we build a procedural data generator based on Sionna and Blender to support realistic modeling of sensing scenes and wireless propagation. System-level evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over pilot- and sensing-based benchmarks in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency for the downstream beamforming task.</description>

      <title>Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network for Ground Reaction Force and Moment Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of three-dimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRFs/GRMs) is crucial for both biomechanics research and clinical rehabilitation evaluation. In this study, we focus on insole-based GRF/GRM estimation and further validate our approach on a public walking dataset. We propose a Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network that integrates anatomy-inspired spatial priors and temporal priors into a region-level attention mechanism, while a complementary path captures context from the full sensor field. The two paths are trained jointly and their outputs are combined to produce the final GRF/GRM predictions. Conclusions: Our model outperforms strong baseline models, including CNN and CNN-LSTM architectures on two datasets, achieving the lowest six-component average NRMSE of 5.78% on the insole dataset and 1.42% for the vertical ground reaction force on the public dataset. This demonstrates robust performance for ground reaction force and moment estimation.</description>

      <title>Semantic Soft Bootstrapping: Long Context Reasoning in LLMs without Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long context reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated enhancement of their cognitive capabilities via chain-of-thought (CoT) inference. Training such models is usually done via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in reasoning based problems, like math and programming. However, RLVR is limited by several bottlenecks, such as, lack of dense reward, and inadequate sample efficiency. As a result, it requires significant compute resources in post-training phase. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose \textbf{Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB)}, a self-distillation technique, in which the same base language model plays the role of both teacher and student, but receives different semantic contexts about the correctness of its outcome at training time. The model is first prompted with a math problem and several rollouts are generated. From them, the correct and most common incorrect response are filtered, and then provided to the model in context to produce a more robust, step-by-step explanation with a verified final answer. This pipeline automatically curates a paired teacher-student training set from raw problem-answer data, without any human intervention. This generation process also produces a sequence of logits, which is what the student model tries to match in the training phase just from the bare question alone. In our experiment, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We then tested its accuracy on MATH500, and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our experiments show a jump of 10.6%, and 10% improvements in accuracy, respectively, over group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which is a commonly used RLVR algorithm.

      <title>Spatially tailored spin wave excitation for spurious-free, low-loss magnetostatic wave filters with ultra-wide frequency tunability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Yttrium iron garnet magnetostatic wave (MSW) radio frequency (RF) cavity filters are promising for sixth-generation (6G) communication systems due to their wide frequency tunability. However, the presence of severe spurious modes arising from the finite cavity dimensions severely degrades the filter performance. We present a half-cone transducer that spatially tailors spin wave excitation to selectively enhance the primary cavity modes comprising the MSW filter passband, while strongly suppressing the undesired spurious modes. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations and experiments verify the effectiveness of the spatially tailored technique. We utilize the half-cone transducer to demonstrate a spurious-free, single-cavity half-cone MSW filter (HC-MSWF) with an insertion loss (IL) of 2.4-3.2 dB over a frequency tuning range of 6.3-16.8 GHz. Extending our study, we further demonstrate a spurious-free, dual-cavity HC-MSWF with an unprecedented tuning range of 21.7 GHz (9.8-31.5 GHz) while maintaining a low IL of 2.9-3.8 dB. This significant advance in performance will enable highly reconfigurable and robust 6G networks.</description>

      <title>An Indoor Radio Mapping Dataset Combining 3D Point Clouds and RSSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing number of smart devices supporting bandwidth-intensive and latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time video analytics, smart sensing, Extended Reality (XR), etc., necessitates reliable wireless connectivity in indoor environments. In such environments, accurate design of Radio Environment Maps (REMs) enables adaptive wireless network planning and optimization of Access Point (AP) placement. However, generating realistic REMs remains difficult due to the variability of indoor environments and the limitations of existing modeling approaches, which often rely on simplified layouts or fully synthetic data. These challenges are further amplified by the adoption of next-generation Wi-Fi standards, which operate at higher frequencies and suffer from limited range and wall penetration. To support the efforts in addressing these challenges, we collected a dataset that combines high-resolution 3D LiDAR scans with Wi-Fi RSSI measurements collected across 20 setups in a multi-room indoor environment. The dataset includes two measurement scenarios, the first without human presence in the environment, and the second with human presence, enabling the development and validation of REM estimation models that incorporate physical geometry and environmental dynamics. The described dataset supports research in data-driven wireless modeling and the development of high-capacity indoor communication networks.</description>

      <title>Robust HRRP Recognition under Interrupted Sampling Repeater Jamming using a Prior Jamming Information-Guided Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radar automatic target recognition (RATR) based on high-resolution range profile (HRRP) has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to capture fine-grained structural features. However, recognizing targets under electronic countermeasures (ECM), especially the mainstream interrupted-sampling repeater jamming (ISRJ), remains a significant challenge, as HRRPs often suffer from serious feature distortion. To address this, we propose a robust HRRP recognition method guided by prior jamming information. Specifically, we introduce a point spread function (PSF) as prior information to model the HRRP distortion induced by ISRJ. Based on this, we design a recognition network that leverages this prior through a prior-guided feature interaction module and a hybrid loss function to enhance the model's discriminative capability. With the aid of prior information, the model can learn invariant features within distorted HRRP under different jamming parameters. Both the simulated and measured-data experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits stronger generalization capabilities when facing unseen jamming parameters.</description>

      <title>Entropic Analysis of Time Series through Kernel Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for time series analysis using entropic measures based on the kernel density estimate (KDE) of the time series' Takens' embeddings. Using this framework we introduce two distinct analytical tools: (1) a multi-scale KDE entropy metric, denoted as $\Delta\text{KE}$, which quantifies the evolution of time series complexity across different scales by measuring certain entropy changes, and (2) a sliding baseline method that employs the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to detect changes in time series dynamics through changes in KDEs. The $\Delta{\rm KE}$ metric offers insights into the information content and ``unfolding'' properties of the time series' embedding related to dynamical systems, while the KL divergence-based approach provides a noise and outlier robust approach for identifying time series change points (injections in RF signals, e.g.). We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of these tools through a set of experiments encompassing diverse domains. In the space of radio frequency (RF) signal processing, we achieve accurate detection of signal injections under varying noise and interference conditions. Furthermore, we apply our methodology to electrocardiography (ECG) data, successfully identifying instances of ventricular fibrillation with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our tools for dynamic state detection by accurately identifying chaotic regimes within an intermittent signal. These results show the broad applicability of our framework for extracting meaningful insights from complex time series data across various scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Boolean Matrix Factorization using Integer Programming and Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) approximates a given binary input matrix as the product of two smaller binary factors. Unlike binary matrix factorization based on standard arithmetic, BMF employs the Boolean OR and AND operations for the matrix product, which improves interpretability and reduces the approximation error. It is also used in role mining and computer vision. In this paper, we first propose algorithms for BMF that perform alternating optimization (AO) of the factor matrices, where each subproblem is solved via integer programming (IP). We then design different approaches to further enhance AO-based algorithms by selecting an optimal subset of rank-one factors from multiple runs. To address the scalability limits of IP-based methods, we introduce new greedy and local-search heuristics. We also construct a new C++ data structure for Boolean vectors and matrices that is significantly faster than existing ones and is of independent interest, allowing our heuristics to scale to large datasets. We illustrate the performance of all our proposed methods and compare them with the state of the art on various real datasets, both with and without missing data, including applications in topic modeling and imaging.</description>
