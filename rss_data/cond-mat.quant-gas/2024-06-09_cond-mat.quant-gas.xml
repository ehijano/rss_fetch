      <title>Emergence of topological states in relaxation dynamics of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological concepts have been employed to understand the ground states of many strongly correlated systems, but it is still quite unclear if and how topology manifests itself in the relaxation dynamics. Here we uncover emergent topological phenomena in the time evolution of far-from-equilibrium one-dimensional interacting bosons. Beginning with simple product states, the system evolves into long-time stationary states with high energy that are nonthermal for a wide range of parameters, and they exhibit nonlocal string correlation that is characteristic of the symmetry-protected topological ground state of the Hamiltonian. In contrast, no topological feature is found in the stationary state as long as the system thermalizes. This difference is further corroborated by the distinct behaviour of quantum entanglement and edge states of the system. Our theoretical prediction can be examined by current experimental techniques and paves the way for a more comprehensive understanding of topological phases in nonequilibrium settings.</description>

      <title>Path-integral treatment of charged Bose polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The system of a charged impurity in an interacting Bose gas has gained significant attention due to the long-range ion-atom interactions and the study of transport properties. Here, the ground state energy of a charged Bose polaron is calculated within the Bogoliubov approximation for both the Fr\"ohlich and beyond-Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonians using a generalized Feynman variational path-integral approach, which obtained accurate results for other polaron problems. The generalized approach, which was used to improve the energy result for the neutral polaron, has resulted in a minor improvement, indicating that Feynman's approach is sufficient when the impurity-boson interaction is long-range. Beyond-Fr\"ohlich corrections results in the emergence of a divergence in the polaronic energy indicating a transition between the repulsive and attractive polaron regime. The path-integral approach with the beyond-Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian is also compared to a field-theory calculation from Christensen et al, 2021. The validity of the Bogoliubov approximation is investigated. The optical absorption has also been calculated within the Bogoliubov approximation for weak ion-atom interactions, and the effect of finite temperature has been studied. We show that the coupling of the ion to an oscillating external electric field offers a straigtforward experimental probe for the charged polaron in a Bose gas, different from but complementary to existing spectroscopic techniques.</description>

      <title>Achieving quantum advantage in a search for a minimal Goldbach partition with driven atoms in tailored potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p$ and $p'$, with $p \, , p'$ referred to as a Goldbach pair. In this article we present a quantum analogue protocol for detecting -- given a even number $N$ -- the existence of a so-called minimal Goldbach partition $N=p+p'$ with $p\equiv p_{\rm min}(N)$ being the so-called minimal Goldbach prime, i.e. the least possible value for $p$ among all the Goldbach pairs of $N$. The proposed protocol is effectively a quantum Grover algorithm with a modified final stage. Assuming that an approximate smooth upper bound $\mathcal{N}(N)$ for the number of primes less than or equal to $ p_{\rm min}(N)$ is known, our protocol will identify if the set of $\mathcal{N}(N)$ lowest primes contains the minimal Goldbach prime in approximately $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}(N)}$ steps, against the corresponding classical value $\mathcal{N}(N)$. In the larger context of a search for violations of Goldbach's conjecture, the quantum advantage provided by our scheme appears to be potentially convenient. E.g., referring to the current state-of-art numerical search for violations of the Goldbach conjecture among all even numbers up to $N_{\text{max}} = 4\times 10^{18}$ [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation 83, 2033 (2013)], a quantum realization of the search would deliver a quantum advantage factor of $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}(N_{\text{max}})} \approx 37$ and it will require a Hilbert space spanning $\mathcal{N}(N_{\text{max}}) \approx 1376$ basis states.</description>

      <title>Particle production and hadronization temperature of the massive Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the pair production, string breaking, and hadronization of a receding electron-positron pair using the bosonized version of the massive Schwinger model in quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 space-time dimensions. Specifically, we study the dynamics of the electric field in Bjorken coordinates by splitting it into a coherent field and its Gaussian fluctuations. We find that the electric field shows damped oscillations, reflecting pair production. Interestingly, the computation of the asymptotic total particle density per rapidity interval for large masses can be fitted using a Boltzmann factor, where the temperature can be related to the hadronization temperature in QCD. Lastly, we discuss the possibility of an analog quantum simulation of the massive Schwinger model using ultracold atoms, explicitly matching the potential of the Schwinger model to the effective potential for the relative phase of two linearly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Functional Determinant Approach and its Application to Polaron Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The functional determinant approach (FDA) is a simple method to compute exactly certain observables for ideal quantum systems and has been successfully applied to the Fermi polaron problem to obtain the dynamical overlap and spectral function. Unfortunately, its application to Bosonic ultracold gases is prohibited by the failure of the grand canonical ensemble for these systems. In this paper, we show how to circumvent this problem and develop a Bosonic FDA. This yields exact injection and ejection spectra for ideal Bose polarons at arbitrary temperatures. While coherent features visible at absolute zero quickly smear out with rising temperature as expected, the line width of the main peak is, counterintuitively, found to decrease near unitarity. Furthermore, we provide explicit formulas for the overlap operator, which allow to compute the necessary determinants for both Bose and Fermi polarons more efficiently than previously possible.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Dirac Integrals in Degenerate Regimes: A Novel Asymptotic Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize in a novel manner the physical properties of the low temperature Fermi gas in the degenerate domain as a function of temperature and chemical potential. For the first time we obtain low temperature $T$ results in the domain where several fermions are found within a de Broglie spatial cell. In this regime, the usual high degeneracy Sommerfeld expansion fails. The other known semi-classical Boltzmann domain applies when fewer than one particle is found in the de Broglie cell. We also improve on the understanding of the Sommerfeld expansion in the regime where the chemical potential is close to the mass and also in the high temperature regime. In these calculcations we use a novel characterization of the Fermi distribution allowing the separation of the finite and zero temperature phenomena. The relative errors of the three approximate methods (Boltzmann limit, Sommerfeld expansion, and the new domain of several particles in the de Broglie cell) are quantified.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of binding in doped and photo-doped Mott insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of bound states in chemically and photo-doped Mott insulators, mediated by spin and $\eta$-pairing fluctuations within both 2-leg ladder and 2D systems. To effectively describe the photo and chemically doped state on the same footings, we employ the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, resulting in a generalized $t$-$J$ model. Our results demonstrate that the binding energies and localization length in the chemically and photo-doped regimes are comparable, with $\eta$-pairing fluctuations not playing a crucial role. Furthermore, we show that manipulating the binding is possible through external periodic driving, a technique known as Floquet engineering, leading to significantly enhanced binding energies. We also roughly estimate the lifetime of photo-doped states under periodic driving conditions based on the Fermi golden rule. Lastly, we propose experimental protocols for realizing Hubbard excitons in cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Inequivalence of stochastic and Bohmian arrival times in time-of-flight experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent prediction [Com. Phys., 6, 195 (2023)] that time-of-flight experiments with ultracold atoms could test different interpretations of quantum mechanics, this work investigates the arrival times predicted by the stochastic interpretation, whereby quantum particles follow definite but non-deterministic and non-differentiable trajectories. The distribution of arrival times is obtained from a Fokker-Planck equation, and confirmed by direct simulation of trajectories. It is found to be in general different from the distribution predicted by the Bohmian interpretation, in which quantum particles follow definite deterministic and differentiable trajectories. This result suggests that trajectory-based interpretations of quantum mechanics could be experimentally discriminated.</description>
