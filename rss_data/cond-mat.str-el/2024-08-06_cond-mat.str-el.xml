      <title>Chiral Edge States Emerging on Anyon-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a symmetry-based approach to constructing lattice models for chiral topological phases, focusing on non-Abelian anyons. Using a 2+1D version of anyon chains and modular tensor categories(MTCs), we ensure exact MTC symmetry at the microscopic level. Numerical simulations using tensor networks demonstrate chiral edge modes for topological phases with Ising and Fibonacci anyons. Our method contrasts with conventional solvability approaches, providing a new theoretical avenue to explore strongly coupled 2+1D systems, revealing chiral edge states in non-Abelian anyonic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Criticality in the infinite-range Transverse Field Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum criticality in the infinite range Transverse-Field Ising Model. We find subtle differences with respect to the well-known single-site mean-field theory, especially in terms of gap, entanglement and quantum criticality. The calculations are based on numerical diagonalization of Hamiltonians with up to a few thousand spins. This is made possible by the enhanced symmetries of the model, which divide the Hamiltonian into many block-diagonal sectors. The finite temperature phase diagram and the characteristic jump in heat capacity closely resemble the behavior in mean-field theory. However, unlike mean-field theory where excitations are always gapped, the excitation gap in the infinite range model goes to zero from both the paramagnetic side and from the ferromagnetic side on approach to the quantum critical point. Also, contrary to mean-field theory, at the quantum critical point the Quantum Fisher Information becomes large, implying long-range multi-partite entanglement. We find that the main role of temperature is to shift statistical weights from one conserved sector to another. However, low energy excitations in each sector arise only near the quantum critical point implying that low energy quantum fluctuations can arise only in the vicinity of the quantum critical field where they can persist up to temperatures of order the exchange constant.</description>

      <title>Intertwined Superconductivity and Magnetism from Repulsive Interactions in Kondo Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While superconductors are conventionally established by attractive interactions, higher-temperature mechanisms for emergent electronic pairing from strong repulsive electron-electron interactions remain under considerable scrutiny. Here, we establish a strong-coupling mechanism for intertwined superconductivity and magnetic order from purely repulsive interactions in a Kondo-like bilayer system, composed of a two-dimensional Mott insulator coupled to a layer of weakly-interacting itinerant electrons. Combining large scale DMRG and Monte Carlo simulations, we find that superconductivity persists and coexists with magnetism over a wide range of interlayer couplings. We classify the resulting rich phase diagram and find 2-rung antiferromagnetic and 4-rung antiferromagnetic order in one-dimensional systems along with a phase separation regime, while finding that superconductivity coexists with either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic order in two dimensions. Remarkably, the model permits a rigorous strong-coupling analysis via localized spins coupled to charge-2e bosons through Kugel-Khomskii interactions, capturing the pairing mechanism in the presence of magnetism due to emergent attractive interactions. Our numerical analysis reveals that pairing remains robust well beyond the strong-coupling regime, establishing a new mechanism for superconductivity in coupled weakly- and strongly-interacting electron systems, relevant for infinite-layer nickelates and superconductivity in moire multilayer heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Local excitation of kagome spin ice magnetism in HoAgGe seen by scanning tunneling microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome spin ice can host frustrated magnetic excitations by flipping its local spin. Under an inelastic tunneling condition, the tip in a scanning tunneling microscope can flip the local spin, and we apply this technique to kagome metal HoAgGe with a long-range ordered spin ice ground state. Away from defects, we discover a pair of pronounced dips in the local tunneling spectrum at symmetrical bias voltages with negative intensity values, serving as a striking inelastic tunneling signal. This signal disappears above the spin ice formation temperature and has a dependence on the magnetic fields, demonstrating its intimate relation with the spin ice magnetism. We provide a two-level spin-flip model to explain the tunneling dips considering the spin ice magnetism under spin-orbit coupling. Our results uncover a local emergent excitation of spin ice magnetism in a kagome metal, suggesting that local electrical field induced spin flip climbs over a barrier caused by spin-orbital locking.</description>

      <title>Coupling of magnetism and transport properties to the lattice degrees of freedom in NdBaCo_2O_{5+{\delta}} ({\delta} ~ 0.65)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the origin of zero volume expansion below the Curie temperature (Tc), variable range hopping (VRH) behaviour using structural, magnetic, transport and thermal studies on the oxygen deficient double perovskite NdBaCo_2O_{5+{\delta}} ({\delta} = 0.65). The valence state of Co ions and the possible properties exhibited by such compound were studied using electronic structure calculations for {\delta} = 0.75. Careful investigation of structure shows that the compound stabilizes in tetragonal structure (P4/mmm) having 2a_p X 2a_p X 2a_p (222) superstructure, where a_p is the cubic perovskite lattice parameter. The compound exhibits a minimum in resistivity, ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic transitions around 375 K, 120 K (T_c) and 60 K, respectively with signature of Griffiths phase above T_c. Our detailed structural analysis suggests signature of the onset of the above magnetic transitions at temperatures well above its stabilisation at long range level thereby leading to VRH behaviour. The observed zero thermal expansion in volume below Tc appears to be due to competing magnetic interactions within and between the magnetic sublattices. Our electronic structure calculations show (a) the importance of electron-electron correlation in Nd 4f and Co 3d states (b) Co ions stabilize in intermediate spin (IS) state, having oxidation state less than +3 (c) half metallicity. Our results show the possibility of coupling between magnetism and ferroelectricity. We believe that our results especially on the valence state of the Co ion, zero thermal expansion in volume, short range magnetic orderings and the connection between different degrees of freedom will be helpful in clearing the ambiguities existing in literature on the nature of magnetism and thereby aiding in designing new functionalities.</description>

      <title>Mott size effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The typical material bismuth shows a several-fold change in electrical resistivity at 4 K over a 400 {\AA} film thickness period. In 2021, we discovered a novel size effect with a period of 25 {\AA} on strongly correlated compound CaRuO_3. The change in film thickness of only one nanometer leads to an increase in electrical resistivity at 4 K by a factor of several billion. However, the excitation energy of 2.4 eV on insulating CaRuO_3 is too large to explain the mechanism by conventional quantum well. In this study, we clarify that the increases in electrical resistivity are accompanied by lattice expansion and caused by the Mott transitions. We measured in-plane X-ray diffraction on CaRuO_3 films and found a 24.8 {\AA} periodic thickness oscillation of the lattice spacing d_{(004)}. We determined the nesting vector from the Fermi surface and revealed the spin density wave with a period equivalent to the size effect. We concluded that the antiferromagnetic correlation appearing in the boundary conditions triggers the periodic Mott insulators depending on the film thickness. We refer to the remarkable size effect stemming from strong electron correlation as the 'Mott size effect'.</description>

      <title>Competition between Kondo Effect and RKKY Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When magnetic moments are immersed into the Fermi sea of itinerant electrons, rich quantum physics emerges. This is relevant for a wide range of materials including heavy Fermion systems, high temperature superconductors like the cuprates, but also good metals with magnetic impurities, doped semiconductors like Si:P close to the metal-insulator transition, 2D materials like graphene and topological insulators. While each material has its specific properties, requiring detailed modelling, their electronic properties are to some degree governed by the competition between Kondo screening and indirect exchange couplings. In these lecture notes we give an introduction, starting with a review of formation of magnetic moments, the theory of the Kondo effect for a single magnetic impurity in a metal host and the derivation of RKKY coupling between magnetic impurities in a metal host. We review the Doniach diagram and Kondo lattice physics and give an introduction to a self consistent renormalization group theory, taking into account Kondo effect and RKKY coupling between magnetic impurities and review results obtained thereby. We review the effect of gaps and pseudo gaps on Kondo effect and RKKY couplings, and on their competition. Especially for dilute concentration of magnetic moments, disorder effects from randomly distributed impurities result in a distribution of both Kondo temperatures and RKKY couplings. Then, their competition becomes an even more complex problem. Moreover, disorder induced Anderson localization transitions may occur, affecting both Kondo effect and RKKY coupling severely, and changing their competition. These disorder effects on the spin competition are introduced and recent results are reviewed. We conclude with an outlook and list of, in our view, most pressing and interesting open problems.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of bipolarons from quadratic electron-phonon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In systems with linear electron-phonon interaction (EPI), bound states of polarons, or bipolarons, form by gaining energy from the lattice deformation. The quadratic EPI case is fundamentally different: bipolarons form because electrons lose less energy when the total charge density is "compacted". As the coupling constant is increased, the bipolarons first appear as extended (but finite radius) soliton-type states. They subsequently decrease in radius until their size reaches the inter-atomic scale. We present the first numerically exact solution of the bipolaron problem from quadratic EPI in the presence of both on-site Hubbard and long-range Coulomb repulsion, and compute estimates of the largest superconducting transition temperature within the bipolaron mechanism. We find that $T_c/\Omega$ ratios, where $\Omega$ is the optical phonon frequency, can be several times larger than what one may expect from the linear EPI provided the phonon frequency is increased by orders of magnitude on occupied sites. Electron-electron repulsion can be tolerated at the expense of stronger EPI and the most detrimental effect comes from the Coulomb potential because it easily eliminates extended soliton states.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern insulators in moir\'e flat bands with high Chern numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of zero-field fractional Chern insulators in moir\'e materials have attracted intensive research interests. However, most current theoretical and experimental attempts focus on systems with low Chern number bands, in analogy to the Landau levels. Here we propose candidate material systems for realizing fractional Chern insulators with higher Chern numbers. The material setup involves $\Gamma$-valley twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides in proximity to a skyrmion lattice. The skyrmion exchange potential induces a flat band with a high Chern number $C = -2$. Using the momentum-space projected exact diagonalization method, we perform a comprehensive study at various filling factors, confirming the generalized Jain series. Our research provides theoretical guidance on realizing unconventional fractional Chern insulators beyond the Landau level picture.</description>

      <title>Superconducting gap modulations: are they from pair density waves or pair-breaking scattering?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his seminal work published in Acta Physica Sinica in 1965, Yu Lu pointed out that the superconducting gap exhibits weak modulations near the pair-breaking magnetic impurity in a superconductor. In the past ten years, a series of high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy works reported weak superconducting gap modulations in certain superconductors and explained these phenomena as pair density waves. In line with Yu's discovery, Lee DH et al. pointed out that in many cases, the interference effect of pair-breaking scattering can also lead to superconducting gap modulations in space. We will discuss the distinction and unification of these two kinds of mechanisms, as well as their relevance to recent experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Correlation between $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and the Pseudogap Observed in the Optical Spectra of High $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ Superconducting Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the temperature dependences of the optical spectra for optimally and underdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+z}$ single crystals. Similarly to the other cuprates' cases, a gap-like conductivity suppression was observed with reducing the temperature from above $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, creating a peak in the conductivity spectrum. The conductivity peak energy was insensitive to the doping level, namely $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, which suggests that this gap is not a superconducting gap but is related to the pseudogap. Comparing the data of various mono-, double-, and triple-layer cuprates, we found a clear correlation between the optimal $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of each material and the pseudogap-related conductivity peak energy.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Quantum Phases in Open Systems: Steady State of Imaginary-Time Lindbladian Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study delves into the concept of quantum phases in open quantum systems, examining the shortcomings of existing approaches that focus on steady states of Lindbladians and highlighting their limitations in capturing key phase transitions. In contrast to these methods, we introduce the concept of imaginary-time Lindbladian evolution as an alternative framework. This new approach defines gapped quantum phases in open systems through the spectrum properties of the imaginary-Liouville superoperator. We find that, in addition to all pure gapped ground states, the Gibbs state of a stabilizer Hamiltonian at any finite temperature can also be characterized by our scheme, demonstrated through explicit construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to investigate the phase diagram for open systems with $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\sigma} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\tau}$ symmetry, including cases with nontrivial average symmetry protected topological order or spontaneous symmetry breaking order. Our findings demonstrate universal properties at quantum criticality, such as nonanalytic behaviors of steady-state observables, divergence of correlation lengths, and closing of the imaginary-Liouville gap. These results advance our understanding of quantum phase transitions in open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1908.10850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase diagrams and the nature of the phase transitions in multicomponent gauge theories with an Abelian gauge field are important topics with various physical applications. While an early renormalization-group-based study indicated that the direct transition from a fully ordered to a fully disordered state is continuous for $N = 1$ and $N &gt; 183$, recently it was demonstrated that the transition is discontinuous for $N = 2$. We quantitatively study the dependence on $N$ of the degree of discontinuity of this transition. Our results suggest that the transition is discontinuous at least up to $N = 7$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, at increased coupling strength, the phase transitions of the neutral and charged sectors of the model split, which for $N &gt; 2$ yields a new phase with composite order. The transition from the composite-order phase to the fully disordered phase is then also discontinuous, at least for $N = 3$ and $N = 4$. Via a duality argument, this indicates that van der Waals-type interaction between directed loops may be responsible for the discontinuous phase transitions in these models.</description>

Abstract: Results are presented for the dynamics of edge modes in interacting Floquet Ising chains. It is shown that in addition to the quasi-stable $0$ and $\pi$ edge modes, a third long lived edge mode arising from the operator product of the $0$ and $\pi$ edge modes exists. Depending on the microscopic parameters, this Floquet product mode is shown to have a substantially longer lifetime than the individual $0$ and $\pi$ modes. This is triggered by a scattering process which converts a $0$ mode into a $\pi$ mode while scattering two bulk excitations. This process can lead to a rapid decay of both $0$ and $\pi$ mode without affecting the product mode.</description>

      <title>Relevance of Anisotropy in the Kondo Effect -- Lessons From the Symplectic Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Kondo model with symplectic symmetry was recently put forward as the effective low-energy theory of a superconducting-island device coupled to multiple leads. This model, which possesses non-Fermi liquid physics and effective anyons, was argued to belong to the class of topological Kondo effects. Here, we clarify the extent of stability of its exotic fixed point using perturbative and numerical renormalization group in conjunction with bosonization and conformal field theory. In contrast to previous claims, we show that asymmetry in the coupling to the leads destabilizes the non-Fermi liquid. Other destabilizing perturbations include asymmetry in the superconducting pairing or internal energy of the individual quantum dots in the island. Nevertheless, these perturbations all generate the same relevant operators. Thus, only a small number of couplings need to be tuned individually, and these can be selected according to experimental convenience. Our results highlight a common misconception that anisotropy in the Kondo coupling is always irrelevant. As demonstrated, relevant terms will emerge whenever the group generators do not span the full space of impurity operators.

      <title>Frustrated hopping from orbital decoration of a primitive two-dimensional lattice</title>

Abstract: Materials hosting flat electronic bands are a central focus of condensed matter physics as promising venues for novel electronic ground states. Two-dimensional (2D) geometrically frustrated lattices such as the kagome, dice, and Lieb lattices are attractive targets in this direction, anticipated to realize perfectly flat bands. Synthesizing these special structures, however, poses a formidable challenge, exemplified by the absence of solid-state materials realizing the dice and Lieb lattices. An alternative route leverages atomic orbitals to create the characteristic electron hopping of geometrically frustrated lattices. This strategy promises to expand the list of candidate materials to simpler structures, but is yet to be demonstrated experimentally. Here, we report the realization of frustrated hopping in the van der Waals (vdW) intermetallic Pd$_5$AlI$_2$, emerging from orbital decoration of a primitive square lattice. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and quantum oscillations measurements, we demonstrate that the band structure of Pd$_5$AlI$_2$ includes linear Dirac-like bands intersected at their crossing point by a flat band, essential characteristics of frustrated hopping in the Lieb and dice lattices. Moreover, Pd$_5$AlI$_2$ is exceptionally stable, with the unusual bulk band structure and metallicity persisting in ambient conditions down to the monolayer limit. Our ability to realize an electronic structure characteristic of geometrically frustrated lattices establishes orbital decoration of primitive lattices as a new approach towards electronic structures that remain elusive to prevailing lattice-centric searches.</description>

      <title>Switchable anomalous Hall effect by selective mirror symmetry breaking in a kagome magnet GdMn6Ge6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The crystal symmetry plays a pivotal role in protecting the nontrivial electronic states in a topological phase. Manipulation of the crystal symmetry and hence the nontrivial topological states would serve as a fertile ground to explore exotic topological properties. Combining experimental and theoretical investigations, we demonstrate herein the flexible switch of nontrivial topological states in the single phase of kagome magnet GdMn6Ge6. The intrinsic anomalous Hall effect caused by distinct Berry curvatures along different crystallographic directions is realized through selectively breaking the mirror symmetries in these directions by external magnetic field, which is fully supported by the first-principles calculations. Our results set an explicit example demonstrating the strong correlation between structure symmetry and nontrivial topological states, as well as the switchable topological properties in a single magnetic topological phase.</description>

      <title>Molecular Pairing in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00869v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for how the weak phonon-mediated interaction ($J_{\rm A}\!=\!1\!\sim\!4$meV) wins over the prohibitive Coulomb repulsion ($U\!=\!30\!\sim\!60$meV) and leads to a superconductor in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). We find the pairing mechanism akin to that in the A$_3$C$_{60}$ family of molecular superconductors: Each AA stacking region of MATBG resembles a C$_{60}$ molecule, in that optical phonons can dynamically lift the degeneracy of the moir\'e orbitals, in analogy to the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect. Such induced $J_{\rm A}$ has the form of an inter-valley anti-Hund's coupling and is less suppressed than $U$ by the Kondo screening near a Mott insulator. Additionally, we also considered an intra-orbital Hund's coupling $J_{\rm H}$ that originates from the on-site repulsion of a carbon atom. Under a reasonable approximation of the realistic model, we prove that the renormalized local interaction between quasi-particles must have a pairing (negative) channel in a doped correlated insulator at $\nu=\pm(2+\delta\nu)$, albeit the bare interaction is positive definite. The proof is non-perturbative and based on exact asymptotic behaviors of the vertex function imposed by Ward identities. Existence of an optimal $U$ for superconductivity is predicted. We also analyzed the pairing symmetry. In a large area of the parameter space of $J_{\rm A}$, $J_{\rm H}$, the ground state has a nematic $d$-wave singlet pairing, which, however, can lead to a $p$-wave-like nodal structure due to the Berry's phase on Fermi surfaces (or Euler obstruction).</description>

      <title>Phase shifts, band geometry and responses in triple-Q charge and spin density waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triple-Q density waves are often realized in many materials such as charge density waves in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) and spin density waves, such as Skyrmion crystal, in B20 compounds. Compared with the single-Q density waves, triple-Q density waves have an internal degree of freedom (phase shift) made from the phase of the order parameters in addition to the translations of density waves. Although this phase shift has been studied in Ginzburg-Landau theory or in spin Hamiltonian, its impact on the electronic states has not yet been explored from the microscopic point of view. Here, we systematically investigate the interference of different Q density waves revealing its pivotal effects depending on the phase shift. We show that the phase shifts play a crucial role in affecting the interference effects of triple-Q density waves on electronic states. Due to such interference, the band geometry in the momentum space becomes nontrivial, where multiband Dirac-like fermions are induced near the Fermi energy. Furthermore, we explicitly establish that the nontrivial band geometry, combined with symmetry-breaking induced by phase shifts, leads to a variety of intriguing linear and nonlinear responses.</description>

      <title>Holstein polarons, Rashba-like spin splitting and Ising superconductivity in electron-doped MoSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interaction between electrons and phonons in solids is a key effect defining physical properties of materials such as electrical and thermal conductivity. In transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) the electron-phonon coupling results in the creation of polarons, quasiparticles that manifest themselves as discrete features in the electronic spectral function. In this study, we report the formation of polarons at the alkali dosed MoSe2 surface, where Rashba-like spin splitting of the conduction band states is caused by an inversion-symmetry breaking electric field. In addition, we observe the crossover from phonon-like to plasmon-like polaronic spectral features at MoSe2 surface with increasing doping. Our findings support the concept of electron-phonon coupling mediated superconductivity in electron-doped layered TMDC materials, observed using ionic liquid gating technology. Furthermore, the discovered spin-splitting at the Fermi level could offer crucial experimental validation for theoretical models of Ising-type superconductivity in these materials.</description>

      <title>Origin of the gossamer ferromagnetism in MnTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Absence of net magnetization in altermagnetis is both a blessing (no stray fields) and a curse (no obvious way to manipulate altermagnetic domains by external fields). Yet, MnTe was demonstrated experimentally to have no measurable stray fields and yet controllable by external magnetic filed - a win-win situation. In this paper we unravel the microscopic mechanism of this property. It appear to emerge from concerted action of three different mechanisms. Microscopic understanding of the beneficial properties of MnTe opens a road to controllable design of similar altermagnets for spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Excitons in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exciton is a Coulomb-driven bound state, which normally consists of an electron and a hole. Under the influence of charge fractionalization, an exotic construction of excitons arises from pairing between fractional particle and hole charge. Despite numerous theoretical considerations, experimental realization of fractional excitons remains largely unexplored. In this work, we report hallmark transport signatures of excitonic pairing that coexist with fractional quantum Hall effect states. By investigating the composition of interlayer excitons and their role in the construction of the underlying wavefunction, we describe two types of never-before-seen fractional quantum Hall effect orders. One can be viewed as the fractional analogue of the exciton condensate at total filling of one. The other involves a different type of exciton, which obeys fermionic and anyonic quantum statistics.</description>
