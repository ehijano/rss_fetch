      <title>3DAttGAN: A 3D Attention-based Generative Adversarial Network for Joint Space-Time Video Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many applications, including surveillance, entertainment, and restoration, there is a need to increase both the spatial resolution and the frame rate of a video sequence. The aim is to improve visual quality, refine details, and create a more realistic viewing experience. Existing space-time video super-resolution methods do not effectively use spatio-temporal information. To address this limitation, we propose a generative adversarial network for joint space-time video super-resolution. The generative network consists of three operations: shallow feature extraction, deep feature extraction, and reconstruction. It uses three-dimensional (3D) convolutions to process temporal and spatial information simultaneously and includes a novel 3D attention mechanism to extract the most important channel and spatial information. The discriminative network uses a two-branch structure to handle details and motion information, making the generated results more accurate. Experimental results on the Vid4, Vimeo-90K, and REDS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

      <title>Cuboid-Net: A Multi-Branch Convolutional Neural Network for Joint Space-Time Video Super Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for high-resolution videos has been consistently rising across various domains, propelled by continuous advancements in science, technology, and societal. Nonetheless, challenges arising from limitations in imaging equipment capabilities, imaging conditions, as well as economic and temporal factors often result in obtaining low-resolution images in particular situations. Space-time video super-resolution aims to enhance the spatial and temporal resolutions of low-resolution and low-frame-rate videos. The currently available space-time video super-resolution methods often fail to fully exploit the abundant information existing within the spatio-temporal domain. To address this problem, we tackle the issue by conceptualizing the input low-resolution video as a cuboid structure. Drawing on this perspective, we introduce an innovative methodology called "Cuboid-Net," which incorporates a multi-branch convolutional neural network. Cuboid-Net is designed to collectively enhance the spatial and temporal resolutions of videos, enabling the extraction of rich and meaningful information across both spatial and temporal dimensions. Specifically, we take the input video as a cuboid to generate different directional slices as input for different branches of the network. The proposed network contains four modules, i.e., a multi-branch-based hybrid feature extraction (MBFE) module, a multi-branch-based reconstruction (MBR) module, a first stage quality enhancement (QE) module, and a second stage cross frame quality enhancement (CFQE) module for interpolated frames only. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is not only effective for spatial and temporal super-resolution of video but also for spatial and angular super-resolution of light field.</description>

      <title>Quanv4EO: Empowering Earth Observation by means of Quanvolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant amount of remotely sensed data is generated daily by many Earth observation (EO) spaceborne and airborne sensors over different countries of our planet. Different applications use those data, such as natural hazard monitoring, global climate change, urban planning, and more. Many challenges are brought by the use of these big data in the context of remote sensing applications. In recent years, employment of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based algorithms have allowed a more efficient use of these data but the issues in managing, processing, and efficiently exploiting them have even increased since classical computers have reached their limits. This article highlights a significant shift towards leveraging quantum computing techniques in processing large volumes of remote sensing data. The proposed Quanv4EO model introduces a quanvolution method for preprocessing multi-dimensional EO data. First its effectiveness is demonstrated through image classification tasks on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, and later on, its capabilities on remote sensing image classification and filtering are shown. Key findings suggest that the proposed model not only maintains high precision in image classification but also shows improvements of around 5\% in EO use cases compared to classical approaches. Moreover, the proposed framework stands out for its reduced parameter size and the absence of training quantum kernels, enabling better scalability for processing massive datasets. These advancements underscore the promising potential of quantum computing in addressing the limitations of classical algorithms in remote sensing applications, offering a more efficient and effective alternative for image data classification and analysis.</description>

      <title>Trans2Unet: Neural fusion for Nuclei Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclei segmentation, despite its fundamental role in histopathological image analysis, is still a challenge work. The main challenge of this task is the existence of overlapping areas, which makes separating independent nuclei more complicated. In this paper, we propose a new two-branch architecture by combining the Unet and TransUnet networks for nuclei segmentation task. In the proposed architecture, namely Trans2Unet, the input image is first sent into the Unet branch whose the last convolution layer is removed. This branch makes the network combine features from different spatial regions of the input image and localizes more precisely the regions of interest. The input image is also fed into the second branch. In the second branch, which is called TransUnet branch, the input image will be divided into patches of images. With Vision transformer (ViT) in architecture, TransUnet can serve as a powerful encoder for medical image segmentation tasks and enhance image details by recovering localized spatial information. To boost up Trans2Unet efficiency and performance, we proposed to infuse TransUnet with a computational-efficient variation called "Waterfall" Atrous Spatial Pooling with Skip Connection (WASP-KC) module, which is inspired by the "Waterfall" Atrous Spatial Pooling (WASP) module. Experiment results on the 2018 Data Science Bowl benchmark show the effectiveness and performance of the proposed architecture while compared with previous segmentation models.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Deep Learning Methodologies and MRI Selection Techniques for Dementia Diagnosis in the Elderly Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dementia, a debilitating neurological condition affecting millions worldwide, presents significant diagnostic challenges. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology for the classification of demented and non-demented elderly patients using 3D brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. Our approach features a unique technique for selectively processing MRI slices, focusing on the most relevant brain regions and excluding less informative sections. This methodology is complemented by a confidence-based classification committee composed of three custom deep learning models: Dem3D ResNet, Dem3D CNN, and Dem3D EfficientNet. These models work synergistically to enhance decision-making accuracy, leveraging their collective strengths. Tested on the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies(OASIS) dataset, our method achieved an impressive accuracy of 94.12%, surpassing existing methodologies. Furthermore, validation on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset confirmed the robustness and generalizability of our approach. The use of explainable AI (XAI) techniques and comprehensive ablation studies further substantiate the effectiveness of our techniques, providing insights into the decision-making process and the importance of our methodology. This research offers a significant advancement in dementia diagnosis, providing a highly accurate and efficient tool for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>2D and 3D Deep Learning Models for MRI-based Parkinson's Disease Classification: A Comparative Analysis of Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) remains challenging. This study compares deep learning architectures for MRI-based PD classification, introducing the first three-dimensional (3D) implementation of Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (ConvKANs), a new approach that combines convolution layers with adaptive, spline-based activations. We evaluated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), ConvKANs, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) using three open-source datasets; a total of 142 participants (75 with PD and 67 age-matched healthy controls). For 2D analysis, we extracted 100 axial slices centred on the midbrain from each T1-weighted scan. For 3D analysis, we used the entire volumetric scans. ConvKANs integrate learnable B-spline functions with convolutional layers. GCNs represent MRI data as graphs, theoretically capturing structural relationships that may be overlooked by traditional approaches. Interpretability visualizations, including the first ConvKAN spline activation maps, and projections of graph node embeddings, were depicted. ConvKANs demonstrated high performance across datasets and dimensionalities, achieving the highest 2D AUROC (0.98) in one dataset and matching CNN peak 3D performance (1.00). CNN models performed well, while GCN models improved in 3D analyses, reaching up to 0.97 AUROC. 3D implementations yielded higher AUROC values compared to 2D counterparts across all models. ConvKAN implementation shows promise for MRI analysis in PD classification, particularly in the context of early diagnosis. The improvement in 3D analyses highlights the value of volumetric data in capturing subtle PD-related changes. While MRI is not currently used for PD diagnosis, these findings suggest its potential as a component of a multimodal diagnostic approach, especially for early detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers all-weather, high-resolution imaging capabilities, but its complex imaging mechanism often poses challenges for interpretation. In response to these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative generative model designed to transform SAR images into more intelligible optical images, thereby enhancing the interpretability of SAR images. Specifically, our model backbone is based on the recent diffusion models, which have powerful generative capabilities. We employ SAR images as conditional guides in the sampling process and integrate color supervision to counteract color shift issues effectively. We conducted experiments on the SEN12 dataset and employed quantitative evaluations using peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity, and fr\'echet inception distance. The results demonstrate that our model not only surpasses previous methods in quantitative assessments but also significantly enhances the visual quality of the generated images.</description>

      <title>Pose Estimation from Camera Images for Underwater Inspection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision localization is pivotal in underwater reinspection missions. Traditional localization methods like inertial navigation systems, Doppler velocity loggers, and acoustic positioning face significant challenges and are not cost-effective for some applications. Visual localization is a cost-effective alternative in such cases, leveraging the cameras already equipped on inspection vehicles to estimate poses from images of the surrounding scene. Amongst these, machine learning-based pose estimation from images shows promise in underwater environments, performing efficient relocalization using models trained based on previously mapped scenes. We explore the efficacy of learning-based pose estimators in both clear and turbid water inspection missions, assessing the impact of image formats, model architectures and training data diversity. We innovate by employing novel view synthesis models to generate augmented training data, significantly enhancing pose estimation in unexplored regions. Moreover, we enhance localization accuracy by integrating pose estimator outputs with sensor data via an extended Kalman filter, demonstrating improved trajectory smoothness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Toward an Integrated Decision Making Framework for Optimized Stroke Diagnosis with DSA and Treatment under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of stroke diagnosis and treatment under uncertainty, a critical issue given the rapid progression and severe consequences of stroke conditions such as aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations (AVM), and occlusions. Current diagnostic methods, including Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), face limitations due to high costs and its invasive nature. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach using a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. Our model integrates advanced diagnostic tools and treatment approaches with a decision-making algorithm that accounts for the inherent uncertainties in stroke diagnosis. Our approach combines noisy observations from CT scans, Siriraj scores, and DSA reports to inform the subsequent treatment options. We utilize the online solver DESPOT, which employs tree-search methods and particle filters, to simulate potential future scenarios and guide our strategies. The results indicate that our POMDP framework balances diagnostic and treatment objectives, striking a tradeoff between the need for precise stroke identification via invasive procedures like DSA and the constraints of limited healthcare resources that necessitate more cost-effective strategies, such as in-hospital or at-home observation, by relying only relying on simulation rollouts and not imposing any prior knowledge. Our study offers a significant contribution by presenting a systematic framework that optimally integrates diagnostic and treatment processes for stroke and accounting for various uncertainties, thereby improving care and outcomes in stroke management.</description>

      <title>High Efficiency Image Compression for Large Visual-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, large visual language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance and promising generalization capability in multi-modal tasks, thus replacing humans as receivers of visual information in various application scenarios. In this paper, we pioneer to propose a variable bitrate image compression framework consisting of a pre-editing module and an end-to-end codec to achieve promising rate-accuracy performance for different LVLMs. In particular, instead of optimizing an adaptive pre-editing network towards a particular task or several representative tasks, we propose a new optimization strategy tailored for LVLMs, which is designed based on the representation and discrimination capability with token-level distortion and rank. The pre-editing module and the variable bitrate end-to-end image codec are jointly trained by the losses based on semantic tokens of the large model, which introduce enhanced generalization capability for various data and tasks. {Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework could efficiently achieve much better rate-accuracy performance compared to the state-of-the-art coding standard, Versatile Video Coding.} Meanwhile, experiments with multi-modal tasks have revealed the robustness and generalization capability of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Self-Calibrated Variance-Stabilizing Transformations for Real-World Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised deep learning has become the method of choice for image denoising. It involves the training of neural networks on large datasets composed of pairs of noisy and clean images. However, the necessity of training data that are specific to the targeted application constrains the widespread use of denoising networks. Recently, several approaches have been developed to overcome this difficulty by whether artificially generating realistic clean/noisy image pairs, or training exclusively on noisy images. In this paper, we show that, contrary to popular belief, denoising networks specialized in the removal of Gaussian noise can be efficiently leveraged in favor of real-world image denoising, even without additional training. For this to happen, an appropriate variance-stabilizing transform (VST) has to be applied beforehand. We propose an algorithm termed Noise2VST for the learning of such a model-free VST. Our approach requires only the input noisy image and an off-the-shelf Gaussian denoiser. We demonstrate through extensive experiments the efficiency and superiority of Noise2VST in comparison to existing methods trained in the absence of specific clean/noisy pairs.</description>

      <title>Towards contrast-agnostic soft segmentation of the spinal cord</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spinal cord segmentation is clinically relevant and is notably used to compute spinal cord cross-sectional area (CSA) for the diagnosis and monitoring of cord compression or neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. While several semi and automatic methods exist, one key limitation remains: the segmentation depends on the MRI contrast, resulting in different CSA across contrasts. This is partly due to the varying appearance of the boundary between the spinal cord and the cerebrospinal fluid that depends on the sequence and acquisition parameters. This contrast-sensitive CSA adds variability in multi-center studies where protocols can vary, reducing the sensitivity to detect subtle atrophies. Moreover, existing methods enhance the CSA variability by training one model per contrast, while also producing binary masks that do not account for partial volume effects. In this work, we present a deep learning-based method that produces soft segmentations of the spinal cord. Using the Spine Generic Public Database of healthy participants ($\text{n}=267$; $\text{contrasts}=6$), we first generated participant-wise soft ground truth (GT) by averaging the binary segmentations across all 6 contrasts. These soft GT, along with aggressive data augmentation and a regression-based loss function, were used to train a U-Net model for spinal cord segmentation. We evaluated our model against state-of-the-art methods and performed ablation studies involving different loss functions and domain generalization methods. Our results show that using the soft segmentations along with a regression loss function reduces CSA variability ($p &lt; 0.05$, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The proposed spinal cord segmentation model generalizes better than the state-of-the-art methods amongst unseen datasets, vendors, contrasts, and pathologies (compression, lesions), while accounting for partial volume effects.</description>

      <title>LINEAR: Learning Implicit Neural Representation With Explicit Physical Priors for Accelerated Quantitative T1rho Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative T1rho mapping has shown promise in clinical and research studies. However, it suffers from long scan times. Deep learning-based techniques have been successfully applied in accelerated quantitative MR parameter mapping. However, most methods require fully-sampled training dataset, which is impractical in the clinic. In this study, a novel subject-specific unsupervised method based on the implicit neural representation is proposed to reconstruct T1rho-weighted images from highly undersampled k-space data, which only takes spatiotemporal coordinates as the input. Specifically, the proposed method learned a implicit neural representation of the MR images driven by two explicit priors from the physical model of T1rho mapping, including the signal relaxation prior and self-consistency of k-t space data prior. The proposed method was verified using both retrospective and prospective undersampled k-space data. Experiment results demonstrate that LINEAR achieves a high acceleration factor up to 14, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of suppressing artifacts and achieving the lowest error.</description>

      <title>SvANet: A Scale-variant Attention-based Network for Small Medical Object Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early detection and accurate diagnosis can predict the risk of malignant disease transformation, thereby increasing the probability of effective treatment. A mild syndrome with small infected regions is an ominous warning and is foremost in the early diagnosis of diseases. Deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been used to segment natural or medical objects, showing promising results. However, analyzing medical objects of small areas in images remains a challenge due to information losses and compression defects caused by convolution and pooling operations in CNNs. These losses and defects become increasingly significant as the network deepens, particularly for small medical objects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel scale-variant attention-based network (SvANet) for accurate small-scale object segmentation in medical images. The SvANet consists of Monte Carlo attention, scale-variant attention, and vision transformer, which incorporates cross-scale features and alleviates compression artifacts for enhancing the discrimination of small medical objects. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SvANet, achieving 96.12%, 96.11%, 89.79%, 84.15%, 80.25%, 73.05%, and 72.58% in mean Dice coefficient for segmenting kidney tumors, skin lesions, hepatic tumors, polyps, surgical excision cells, retinal vasculatures, and sperms, which occupy less than 1% of the image areas in KiTS23, ISIC 2018, ATLAS, PolypGen, TissueNet, FIVES, and SpermHealth datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>SAM2CLIP2SAM: Vision Language Model for Segmentation of 3D CT Scans for Covid-19 Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for effective segmentation of images that can be integrated into any model and methodology; the paradigm that we choose is classification of medical images (3-D chest CT scans) for Covid-19 detection. Our approach includes a combination of vision-language models that segment the CT scans, which are then fed to a deep neural architecture, named RACNet, for Covid-19 detection. In particular, a novel framework, named SAM2CLIP2SAM, is introduced for segmentation that leverages the strengths of both Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to accurately segment the right and left lungs in CT scans, subsequently feeding these segmented outputs into RACNet for classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. At first, SAM produces multiple part-based segmentation masks for each slice in the CT scan; then CLIP selects only the masks that are associated with the regions of interest (ROIs), i.e., the right and left lungs; finally SAM is given these ROIs as prompts and generates the final segmentation mask for the lungs. Experiments are presented across two Covid-19 annotated databases which illustrate the improved performance obtained when our method has been used for segmentation of the CT scans.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Extensions of Unbiased Risk Estimators for Unsupervised Magnetic Resonance Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to image denoising has notably challenged traditional denoising methods, particularly within complex noise scenarios prevalent in medical imaging. Despite the effectiveness of traditional and some DNN-based methods, their reliance on high-quality, noiseless ground truth images limits their practical utility. In response to this, our work introduces and benchmarks innovative unsupervised learning strategies, notably Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE), its extension (eSURE), and our novel implementation, the Extended Poisson Unbiased Risk Estimator (ePURE), within medical imaging frameworks.
  This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of these methods on MRI data afflicted with Gaussian and Poisson noise types, a scenario typical in medical imaging but challenging for most denoising algorithms. Our main contribution lies in the effective adaptation and implementation of the SURE, eSURE, and particularly the ePURE frameworks for medical images, showcasing their robustness and efficacy in environments where traditional noiseless ground truth cannot be obtained.</description>

      <title>TLRN: Temporal Latent Residual Networks For Large Deformation Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach, termed {\em Temporal Latent Residual Network (TLRN)}, to predict a sequence of deformation fields in time-series image registration. The challenge of registering time-series images often lies in the occurrence of large motions, especially when images differ significantly from a reference (e.g., the start of a cardiac cycle compared to the peak stretching phase). To achieve accurate and robust registration results, we leverage the nature of motion continuity and exploit the temporal smoothness in consecutive image frames. Our proposed TLRN highlights a temporal residual network with residual blocks carefully designed in latent deformation spaces, which are parameterized by time-sequential initial velocity fields. We treat a sequence of residual blocks over time as a dynamic training system, where each block is designed to learn the residual function between desired deformation features and current input accumulated from previous time frames. We validate the effectivenss of TLRN on both synthetic data and real-world cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image videos. Our experimental results shows that TLRN is able to achieve substantially improved registration accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/nellie689/TLRN.</description>

      <title>FCNR: Fast Compressive Neural Representation of Visualization Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FCNR, a fast compressive neural representation for tens of thousands of visualization images under varying viewpoints and timesteps. The existing NeRVI solution, albeit enjoying a high compression ratio, incurs slow speeds in encoding and decoding. Built on the recent advances in stereo image compression, FCNR assimilates stereo context modules and joint context transfer modules to compress image pairs. Our solution significantly improves encoding and decoding speed while maintaining high reconstruction quality and satisfying compression ratio. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we compare FCNR with state-of-the-art neural compression methods, including E-NeRV, HNeRV, NeRVI, and ECSIC.
