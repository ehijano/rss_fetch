      <title>Using Dynamic Safety Margins as Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an approach to design control barrier functions (CBFs) using the notion of dynamic safety margins (DSMs). In particular, it is shown that DSMs are CBFs for an augmented system. The proposed approach can handle multiple state and input constraints using the control-sharing property of CBFs. Moreover, it makes no assumption on the relative degree of the constraints. Numerical simulations show that the method outperforms existing DSM-based approaches, while also guaranteeing safety and recursive feasibility.</description>

      <title>Performance triggered adaptive model reduction for soil moisture estimation in precision irrigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate soil moisture information is crucial for developing precise irrigation control strategies to enhance water use efficiency. Soil moisture estimation based on limited soil moisture sensors is crucial for obtaining comprehensive soil moisture information when dealing with large-scale agricultural fields. The major challenge in soil moisture estimation lies in the high dimensionality of the spatially discretized agro-hydrological models. In this work, we propose a performance-triggered adaptive model reduction approach to address this challenge. The pro- posed approach employs a trajectory-based unsupervised machine learning technique, and a prediction performance-based triggering scheme is designed to govern model updates adaptively in a way such that the prediction error between the reduced model and the original model over a prediction horizon is maintained below a predetermined threshold. An adaptive extended Kalman filter (EKF) is designed based on the reduced model for soil moisture estimation. The applicability and performance of the proposed approach are evaluated extensively through the application to a simulated large-scale agricultural field.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Hybrid Simulation for Infrastructure Degradation Assessment: Conceptual Framework and Illustrative Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, the prospect of using real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) to study the effects of long-term or 'wear-and-tear' loads, such as exposure to harmful environmental conditions or fatigue, has remained underexplored. This study presents a conceptual framework to assess the impact of long-term degradation on infrastructure systems. The framework integrates the capabilities of RTHS with accelerated degradation techniques to evaluate the behavior of a degrading system over time. Experimental results obtained in this way not only capture the complex interactions but also provide a reliability-based method to determine the expected time-to-failure of the evaluated system. The developed framework is demonstrated using a virtual RTHS platform designed to test fiber-reinforced elastomeric isolators.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Largest RoCoF and Its Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) is a critical factor in ensuring frequency security, particularly in power systems with low inertia. Currently, most RoCoF security constrained optimal inertia dispatch methods and inertia market mechanisms predominantly rely on the center of inertia (COI) model. This model, however, does not account for the disparities in post-contingency frequency dynamics across different regions of a power system. Specifically, regional buses can exhibit significantly larger RoCoFs than that predicted by the system's COI, particularly in systems characterized by unevenly distributed inertia. In this letter, a post-contingency nodal RoCoF model is established, and the maximal initial RoCoF is further proven to occur at generator buses equipped with inertia, rather than at inertia-less load buses. This finding facilitates the development of the optimal nodal inertia dispatch method and the nodal inertia market mechanism in a convex and concise form. Our argument is further verified by the simulation results of the South East Australia power system under various scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Stability-Based Abstraction Framework for Reach-Avoid Control of Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Unknown Noise Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-state abstractions are widely studied for the automated synthesis of correct-by-construction controllers for stochastic dynamical systems. However, existing abstraction methods often lead to prohibitively large finite-state models. To address this issue, we propose a novel abstraction scheme for stochastic linear systems that exploits the system's stability to obtain significantly smaller abstract models. As a unique feature, we first stabilize the open-loop dynamics using a linear feedback gain. We then use a model-based approach to abstract a known part of the stabilized dynamics while using a data-driven method to account for the stochastic uncertainty. We formalize abstractions as Markov decision processes (MDPs) with intervals of transition probabilities. By stabilizing the dynamics, we can further constrain the control input modeled in the abstraction, which leads to smaller abstract models while retaining the correctness of controllers. Moreover, when the stabilizing feedback controller is aligned with the property of interest, then a good trade-off is achieved between the reduction in the abstraction size and the performance loss. The experiments show that our approach can reduce the size of the graph of abstractions by up to 90% with negligible performance loss.</description>

      <title>A neural network-based approach to hybrid systems identification for control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a machine learning-based model of an unknown dynamical system from a finite number of (state-input)-successor state data points, such that the model obtained is also suitable for optimal control design. We propose a specific neural network (NN) architecture that yields a hybrid system with piecewise-affine dynamics that is differentiable with respect to the network's parameters, thereby enabling the use of derivative-based training procedures. We show that a careful choice of our NN's weights produces a hybrid system model with structural properties that are highly favourable when used as part of a finite horizon optimal control problem (OCP). Specifically, we show that optimal solutions with strong local optimality guarantees can be computed via nonlinear programming, in contrast to classical OCPs for general hybrid systems which typically require mixed-integer optimization. In addition to being well-suited for optimal control design, numerical simulations illustrate that our NN-based technique enjoys very similar performance to state-of-the-art system identification methodologies for hybrid systems and it is competitive on nonlinear benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control of District Heating Grids Using Stabilizing Terminal Ingredients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transformation of fossil fuel-based district heating grids (DHGs) to CO$_2$-neutral DHGs requires the development of novel operating strategies. Model predictive control (MPC) is a promising approach, as knowledge about future heat demand and heat supply can be incorporated into the control, operating constraints can be ensured and the stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed. In this paper, we employ MPC for DHGs to control the system mass flows and injected heat flows. Following common practice, we derive terminal ingredients to stabilize given steady state temperatures and storage masses in the DHG. To apply MPC with terminal ingredients, it is crucial that the system under control is stabilizable. By exploiting the particular system structure, we give a sufficient condition for the stabilizability in terms of the grid topology and hence, for the applicability of the MPC scheme to DHGs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practicability of the application of MPC to an exemplary DHG in a numerical case study.</description>

      <title>Integrating SystemC-AMS Power Modeling with a RISC-V ISS for Virtual Prototyping of Battery-operated Embedded Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RISC-V cores have gained a lot of popularity over the last few years. However, being quite a recent and novel technology, there is still a gap in the availability of comprehensive simulation frameworks for RISC-V that cover both the functional and extra-functional aspects. This gap hinders progress in the field, as fast yet accurate system-level simulation is crucial for Design Space Exploration (DSE).
  This work presents an open-source framework designed to tackle this challenge, integrating functional RISC-V simulation (achieved with GVSoC) with SystemC-AMS (used to model extra-functional aspects, in detail power storage and distribution). The combination of GVSoC and SystemC-AMS in a single simulation framework allows to perform a DSE that is dependent on the mutual impact between functional and extra-functional aspects. In our experiments, we validate the framework's effectiveness by creating a virtual prototype of a compact, battery-powered embedded system.</description>

      <title>On the reduction of Linear Parameter-Varying State-Space models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an overview and comparative study of the state of the art in State-Order Reduction (SOR) and Scheduling Dimension Reduction (SDR) for Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) State-Space (SS) models, comparing and benchmarking their capabilities, limitations and performance. The use case chosen for these studies is an interconnected network of nonlinear coupled mass spring damper systems with three different configurations, where some spring coefficients are described by arbitrary user-defined static nonlinear functions. For SOR, the following methods are compared: Linear Time-Invariant (LTI), LPV and LFR-based balanced reductions, moment matching and parameter-varying oblique projection. For SDR, the following methods are compared: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), trajectory PCA, Kernel PCA and LTI balanced truncation, autoencoders and deep neural network. The comparison reveals the most suitable reduction methods for the different benchmark configurations, from which we provide use case SOR and SDR guidelines that can be used to choose the best reduction method for a given LPV-SS model.</description>

      <title>Learning-based model augmentation with LFRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANN) have proven to be effective in dealing with the identification nonlinear models for highly complex systems. To still make use of the prior information available from baseline models derived from, e.g., first-principles (FP), methods have been developed that integrate the prior knowledge into the identification algorithm for the ANN in a variety of methods. These methods have shown better estimation speeds and/or accuracy on unseen data. Among these methods are model augmentation structures. A variety of these structures have been considered in literature, there is however no unifying theory to these. In this paper, we propose a flexible linear-fractional-representation (LFR) based model augmentation structure. This model structure is able to represent many common model augmentation structures, thus unifying them under the proposed model structure. Furthermore, we introduce an identification algorithm capable of estimating the proposed model augmentation structure. The performance and generalization capabilities of the identification algorithm and the augmentation structure is demonstrated on a hardening mass-spring-damper simulation example.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Quantization on Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a widely used data-driven algorithm for estimating the Koopman Operator.This paper investigates how the estimation process is affected when the data is quantized. Specifically, we examine the fundamental connection between estimates of the operator obtained from unquantized data and those from quantized data. Furthermore, using the law of large numbers, we demonstrate that, under a large data regime, the quantized estimate can be considered a regularized version of the unquantized estimate. This key theoretical finding paves the way to accurately recover the unquantized estimate from quantized data. We also explore the relationship between the two estimates in the finite data regime. The theory is validated through repeated numerical experiments conducted on three different dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>On the Regret of Recursive Methods for Discrete-Time Adaptive Control with Matched Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-time adaptive controllers for systems with a matched uncertainty often comprise an online parameter estimator and a corresponding parameterized controller to cancel the uncertainty. However, such methods are often unimplementable, as they depend on an unobserved estimation error. We consider the equivalent discrete-time setting with a causal information structure. We propose a novel, online proximal point method-based adaptive controller, that under a weak persistence of excitation (PE) condition is asymptotically stable and achieves finite regret, scaling only with the time required to fulfill the PE condition. We show the same also for the widely-used recursive least squares with exponential forgetting controller under a stronger PE condition.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Real-Time Task Allocation for Stochastic Multi-Agent Systems under STL Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the control synthesis of heterogeneous stochastic linear multi-agent systems with real-time allocation of signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. Based on previous work, we decompose specifications into sub-specifications on the individual agent level. To leverage the efficiency of task allocation, a heuristic filter evaluates potential task allocation based on STL robustness. Subsequently, an auctioning algorithm determines the definite allocation of specifications. Finally, a control strategy is synthesized for each agent-specification pair using tube-based Model Predictive Control (MPC), ensuring provable probabilistic satisfaction. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods using a multi-bus scenario that highlights a promising extension to autonomous driving applications like crossing an intersection.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this pioneering study, we unveiled a groundbreaking approach for actuating rehabilitation robots through the innovative use of magnetic technology as a seamless haptic force generator, offering a leap forward in enhancing user interface and experience, particularly in end-effector-based robots for upper-limb extremity motor rehabilitation. We employed the Extended Kalman Filter to meticulously analyze and formalize the robotic system's nonlinear dynamics, showcasing the potential of this sophisticated algorithm in accurately tracking and compensating for disturbances, thereby ensuring seamless and effective motor training. The proposed planar robotic system embedded with magnetic technology was evaluated with the recruitment of human subjects. We reached a minimum RMS value of 0.2 and a maximum of 2.06 in our estimations, indicating our algorithm's capability for tracking the system behavior. Overall, the results showed significant improvement in smoothness, comfort, and safety during execution and motor training. The proposed novel magnetic actuation and advanced algorithmic control opens new horizons for the development of more efficient and user-friendly rehabilitation technologies.</description>

      <title>Proactive Service Assurance in 5G and B5G Networks: A Closed-Loop Algorithm for End-to-End Network Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The customization of services in Fifth-generation (5G) and Beyond 5G (B5G) networks relies heavily on network slicing, which creates multiple virtual networks on a shared physical infrastructure, tailored to meet specific requirements of distinct applications, using Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). It is imperative to ensure that network services meet the performance and reliability requirements of various applications and users, thus, service assurance is one of the critical components in network slicing. One of the key functionalities of network slicing is the ability to scale Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) in response to changing resource demand and to meet Customer Service Level agreements (SLAs).
  In this paper, we introduce a proactive closed-loop algorithm for end-to-end network orchestration, designed to provide service assurance in 5G and B5G networks. We focus on dynamically scaling resources to meet key performance indicators (KPIs) specific to each network slice and operate in parallel across multiple slices, making it scalable and capable of managing completely automatically real-time service assurance. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively fulfills service assurance requirements for different network slice types, thereby minimizing network resource utilization and reducing the over-provisioning of spare resources.</description>

      <title>ML KPI Prediction in 5G and B5G Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network operators are facing new challenges when meeting the needs of their customers. The challenges arise due to the rise of new services, such as HD video streaming, IoT, autonomous driving, etc., and the exponential growth of network traffic. In this context, 5G and B5G networks have been evolving to accommodate a wide range of applications and use cases. Additionally, this evolution brings new features, like the ability to create multiple end-to-end isolated virtual networks using network slicing. Nevertheless, to ensure the quality of service, operators must maintain and optimize their networks in accordance with the key performance indicators (KPIs) and the slice service-level agreements (SLAs).
  In this paper, we introduce a machine learning (ML) model used to estimate throughput in 5G and B5G networks with end-to-end (E2E) network slices. Then, we combine the predicted throughput with the current network state to derive an estimate of other network KPIs, which can be used to further improve service assurance. To assess the efficiency of our solution, a performance metric was proposed. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that our KPI prediction model outperforms those derived from other methods with the same or nearly the same computational time.</description>

      <title>Perfecting Periodic Trajectory Tracking: Model Predictive Control with a Periodic Observer ($\Pi$-MPC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Model Predictive Control (MPC), discrepancies between the actual system and the predictive model can lead to substantial tracking errors and significantly degrade performance and reliability. While such discrepancies can be alleviated with more complex models, this often complicates controller design and implementation. By leveraging the fact that many trajectories of interest are periodic, we show that perfect tracking is possible when incorporating a simple observer that estimates and compensates for periodic disturbances. We present the design of the observer and the accompanying tracking MPC scheme, proving that their combination achieves zero tracking error asymptotically, regardless of the complexity of the unmodelled dynamics. We validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating asymptotically perfect tracking on a high-dimensional soft robot with nearly 10,000 states and a fivefold reduction in tracking errors compared to a baseline MPC on small-scale autonomous race car experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing complex cooperative tasks in safety-critical environments poses significant challenges for Multi-Agent Systems, especially under conditions of partial observability. This work introduces a hybrid approach that integrates Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with control-theoretic methods to ensure safe and efficient distributed strategies. Our contributions include a novel setpoint update algorithm that dynamically adjusts agents' positions to preserve safety conditions without compromising the mission's objectives. Through experimental validation, we demonstrate significant advantages over conventional MARL strategies, achieving comparable task performance with zero safety violations. Our findings indicate that integrating safe control with learning approaches not only enhances safety compliance but also achieves good performance in mission objectives.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Functional Safety in Automotive AMS Circuits through Unsupervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the widespread use of safety-critical applications in the automotive field, it is crucial to ensure the Functional Safety (FuSa) of circuits and components within automotive systems. The Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuits prevalent in these systems are more vulnerable to faults induced by parametric perturbations, noise, environmental stress, and other factors, in comparison to their digital counterparts. However, their continuous signal characteristics present an opportunity for early anomaly detection, enabling the implementation of safety mechanisms to prevent system failure. To address this need, we propose a novel framework based on unsupervised machine learning for early anomaly detection in AMS circuits. The proposed approach involves injecting anomalies at various circuit locations and individual components to create a diverse and comprehensive anomaly dataset, followed by the extraction of features from the observed circuit signals. Subsequently, we employ clustering algorithms to facilitate anomaly detection. Finally, we propose a time series framework to enhance and expedite anomaly detection performance. Our approach encompasses a systematic analysis of anomaly abstraction at multiple levels pertaining to the automotive domain, from hardware- to block-level, where anomalies are injected to create diverse fault scenarios. By monitoring the system behavior under these anomalous conditions, we capture the propagation of anomalies and their effects at different abstraction levels, thereby potentially paving the way for the implementation of reliable safety mechanisms to ensure the FuSa of automotive SoCs. Our experimental findings indicate that our approach achieves 100% anomaly detection accuracy and significantly optimizes the associated latency by 5X, underscoring the effectiveness of our devised solution.</description>

      <title>Learning to Control Camera Exposure via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adjusting camera exposure in arbitrary lighting conditions is the first step to ensure the functionality of computer vision applications. Poorly adjusted camera exposure often leads to critical failure and performance degradation. Traditional camera exposure control methods require multiple convergence steps and time-consuming processes, making them unsuitable for dynamic lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose a new camera exposure control framework that rapidly controls camera exposure while performing real-time processing by exploiting deep reinforcement learning. The proposed framework consists of four contributions: 1) a simplified training ground to simulate real-world's diverse and dynamic lighting changes, 2) flickering and image attribute-aware reward design, along with lightweight state design for real-time processing, 3) a static-to-dynamic lighting curriculum to gradually improve the agent's exposure-adjusting capability, and 4) domain randomization techniques to alleviate the limitation of the training ground and achieve seamless generalization in the wild.As a result, our proposed method rapidly reaches a desired exposure level within five steps with real-time processing (1 ms). Also, the acquired images are well-exposed and show superiority in various computer vision tasks, such as feature extraction and object detection.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes collision-free optimal trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles in highway traffic, where vehicles need to deal with the interaction among each other. To address this issue, a novel optimal control framework is suggested, which couples the trajectory of surrounding vehicles with collision avoidance constraints. Additionally, we describe a trajectory optimization technique under state constraints, utilizing a planner based on Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, capable of numerically solving collision avoidance scenarios with surrounding vehicles. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach regarding interaction-based motion planning for different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Intrusion Tolerance for Networked Systems through Two-Level Feedback Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate intrusion tolerance for a system with service replicas as a two-level optimal control problem. On the local level node controllers perform intrusion recovery, and on the global level a system controller manages the replication factor. The local and global control problems can be formulated as classical problems in operations research, namely, the machine replacement problem and the inventory replenishment problem. Based on this formulation, we design TOLERANCE, a novel control architecture for intrusion-tolerant systems. We prove that the optimal control strategies on both levels have threshold structure and design efficient algorithms for computing them. We implement and evaluate TOLERANCE in an emulation environment where we run 10 types of network intrusions. The results show that TOLERANCE can improve service availability and reduce operational cost compared with state-of-the-art intrusion-tolerant systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present two datasets that we make publicly available for research. The data is collected in a testbed comprised of a custom-made Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) prototype and two regular OFDM transceivers within an anechoic chamber. First, we discuss the details of the testbed and equipment used, including insights about the design and implementation of our RIS prototype. We further present the methodology we employ to gather measurement samples, which consists of letting the RIS electronically steer the signal reflections from an OFDM transmitter toward a specific location. To this end, we evaluate a suitably designed configuration codebook and collect measurement samples of the received power with an OFDM receiver. Finally, we present the resulting datasets, their format, and examples of exploiting this data for research purposes.</description>

      <title>Systematic Solutions to Login and Authentication Security: A Dual-Password Login-Authentication Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credential theft and remote attacks are the most serious threats to authentication mechanisms. The crux of the problems is that we cannot control such behaviors. However, if a password does not contain user's secrets, stealing it is useless. If unauthorized inputs are disabled, the remote attacks can be invalidated. Thereby, credential secrets and input fields to our accounts can be controlled. Rather than encrypting passwords, we design a dual-password login-authentication mechanism, where a user-selected secret-free login password is converted into an untypable authentication password. Subsequently, the authenticatable functionality of the login password and the typable functionality of the authentication password may be disabled or invalidated so that the credential theft and remote attacks can be prevented. Thus, the usability-security trade-off and password reuse are resolved; local storage of authentication passwords is no longer necessary. More importantly, the password converter acts as an open hash algorithm, meaning that its intermediate elements can be used to define a truly unique identity of the login process to implement a novel dual-identity authentication. Particularly, the elements are concealed, inaccessible, and independent of any personal information, and therefore can be used to define a perfect unforgeable process identifier to identify and disable the unauthorized inputs.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Control Lyapunov-Value Functions for High-Dimensional Systems Using System Decomposition and Admissible Control Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) play a vital role in modern control applications, but finding them remains a problem. Recently, the control Lyapunov-value function (CLVF) and robust CLVF have been proposed as solutions for nonlinear time-invariant systems with bounded control and disturbance. However, the CLVF suffers from the ''curse of dimensionality,'' which hinders its application to practical high-dimensional systems. In this paper, we propose a method to decompose systems of a particular coupled nonlinear structure, in order to solve for the CLVF in each low-dimensional subsystem. We then reconstruct the full-dimensional CLVF and provide sufficient conditions for when this reconstruction is exact. Moreover, a point-wise optimal controller can be obtained using a quadratic program. We also show that when the exact reconstruction is impossible, the subsystems' CLVFs and their ``admissible control sets'' can be used to generate a Lipschitz continuous CLF. We provide several numerical examples to validate the theory and show computational efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for wireless networks of higher capacity requires key-enabling technologies. Optical wireless communication (OWC) arises as a complementary technology to radio frequency (RF) systems that can support high aggregate data rates. However, OWC systems face some challenges including beam-blockage. Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) can offer alternative pathways for the optical signal, ensuring continuous connectivity. In this work, we investigate the potential of using IRS in an indoor OWC network. In particular, we define a system model of indoor OWC that employs IRS in conjunction with angle diversity transmitters (ADT) using vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) arrays. The VCSEL beam is narrow, directed, and easy to block, however, it can deliver high data rates under eye safety regulations. Simulation results show that the deployment of IRS can significantly improve the achievable data rates of Laser-based OWC systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an optimal operation control strategy for an electro-thermal microgrid. Compared to existing work, our approach increases flexibility by operating the thermal network with variable flow temperatures and in that way explicitly exploits its inherent storage capacities. To this end, the microgrid is represented by a multi-layer network composed of an electrical and a thermal layer. We show that the system behavior can be represented by a discrete-time state model derived from DC power flow approximations and 1d incompressible Euler equations. Both layers are interconnected via heat pumps. By combining this model with desired operating objectives and constraints, we obtain a constrained convex optimization problem. This is used to derive a model predictive control scheme for the optimal operation of electro-thermal microgrids. The performance of the proposed operation control algorithm is demonstrated in a numerical case study.</description>

Abstract: We present a data-driven modeling and control framework for physics-based building emulators. Our approach consists of: (a) Offline training of differentiable surrogate models that accelerate model evaluations, provide cost-effective gradients, and maintain good predictive accuracy for the receding horizon in Model Predictive Control (MPC), and (b) Formulating and solving nonlinear building HVAC MPC problems. We extensively evaluate the modeling and control performance using multiple surrogate models and optimization frameworks across various test cases available in the Building Optimization Testing Framework (BOPTEST). Our framework is compatible with other modeling techniques and can be customized with different control formulations, making it adaptable and future-proof for test cases currently under development for BOPTEST. This modularity provides a path towards prototyping predictive controllers in large buildings, ensuring scalability and robustness in real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of security allocation in a networked control system under stealthy attacks. The system is comprised of interconnected subsystems represented by vertices. A malicious adversary selects a single vertex on which to conduct a stealthy data injection attack with the purpose of maximally disrupting a distant target vertex while remaining undetected. Defense resources against the adversary are allocated by a defender on several selected vertices. First, the objectives of the adversary and the defender with uncertain targets are formulated in a probabilistic manner, resulting in an expected worst-case impact of stealthy attacks. Next, we provide a graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient condition under which the cost for the defender and the expected worst-case impact of stealthy attacks are bounded. This condition enables the defender to restrict the admissible actions to dominating sets of the graph representing the network. Then, the security allocation problem is solved through a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework. Finally, the obtained results are validated through a numerical example of a 50-vertex networked control system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Load-altering attacks (LAAs) pose a significant threat to power systems with Internet of Things (IoT)-controllable load devices. This research examines the detrimental impact of LAAs on the voltage profile of distribution systems, taking into account the realistic load model with constant impedance Z, constant current I, and constant power P (ZIP). We derive closed-form expressions for computing the voltages of buses following LAA by making approximations to the power flow as well as the load model. We also characterize the minimum number of devices to be manipulated in order to cause voltage safety violations in the system. We conduct extensive simulations using the IEEE-33 bus system to verify the accuracy of the proposed approximations and highlight the difference between the attack impacts while considering constant power and the ZIP load model (which is more representative of real-world loads).</description>

The original problem is approximated by a drift control problem, to which we apply a recently developed computational method that is feasible for dimensions up to d=30 or more. To show that nearly optimal solutions are obtainable using this method, we present computational results for a variety of examples, including queueing network examples that have appeared previously in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Aggregate peak Electric Vehicle (EV) charging demand is a matter of growing concern for network operators as it severely limits the network's capacity, preventing its reliable operation. Various tariff schemes have been proposed to limit peak demand by incentivizing flexible asset users to shift their demand from peak periods. However, fewer studies quantify the effect of these tariff schemes on the aggregate level. In this paper, we compare the effect of a multi-level segmented network tariff with and without dynamic energy prices for individual EV users on the aggregate peak demand. Results based on real charging transactions from over 1200 public charging points in the Netherlands show that the segmented network tariff with flat energy prices results in more diverse load profiles with increasing aggregation, as compared to cost-optimized dispatch based on only dynamic day-ahead energy prices. When paired with dynamic energy prices, the segmented tariff still outperforms only dynamic energy price-based tariffs in reducing peaks. Results show that a balance between power thresholds and price per threshold is crucial in designing a suitable tariff, taking into account the needs of the power network. We also provide valuable insights to network operators by calculating the diversity factor for various peak demands per charging point.</description>

      <title>On Accessibility Fairness in Intermodal Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand Systems</title>

Abstract: Research on the operation of mobility systems so far has mostly focused on minimizing cost-centered metrics such as average travel time, distance driven, and operational costs. Whilst capturing economic indicators, such metrics do not account for transportation justice aspects. In this paper, we present an optimization model to plan the operation of Intermodal Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (I-AMoD) systems, where self-driving vehicles provide on-demand mobility jointly with public transit and active modes, with the goal to minimize the accessibility unfairness experienced by the population. Specifically, we first leverage a previously developed network flow model to compute the I-AMoD system operation in a minimum-time manner. Second, we formally define accessibility unfairness, and use it to frame the minimum-accessibility-unfairness problem and cast it as a linear program. We showcase our framework for a real-world case-study in the city of Eindhoven, NL. Our results show that it is possible to reach an operation that is on average fully fair at the cost of a slight travel time increase compared to a minimum-travel-time solution. Thereby we observe that the accessibility fairness of individual paths is, on average, worse than the average values obtained from flows, setting the stage for a discussion on the definition of accessibility fairness itself.</description>

      <title>SOStab: a Matlab Toolbox for Transient Stability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08889v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new Matlab toolbox, aimed at facilitating the use of polynomial optimization for stability analysis of nonlinear systems. In the past decade several decisive contributions made it possible to recast this type of problems as convex optimization ones that are tractable in modest dimensions. However, available software requires their user to be fluent in Sum-of-Squares programming, preventing them from being more widely explored by practitioners. To address this issue, SOStab entirely automates the writing and solving of optimization problems, and directly outputs relevant data for the user, while requiring minimal input. In particular, no specific knowledge of optimization is needed for implementation. The toolbox allows a user to obtain outer and inner approximates of the \ac{roa} of the operating point of different grid connected devices such as synchronous machines and power converters.</description>

      <title>Deep transfer learning for intrusion detection in industrial control networks: A comprehensive review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Globally, the external internet is increasingly being connected to industrial control systems. As a result, there is an immediate need to protect these networks from a variety of threats. The key infrastructure of industrial activity can be protected from harm using an intrusion detection system (IDS), a preventive mechanism that seeks to recognize new kinds of dangerous threats and hostile activities. This review examines the most recent artificial-intelligence techniques that are used to create IDSs in many kinds of industrial control networks, with a particular emphasis on IDS-based deep transfer learning (DTL). DTL can be seen as a type of information-fusion approach that merges and/or adapts knowledge from multiple domains to enhance the performance of a target task, particularly when labeled data in the target domain is scarce. Publications issued after 2015 were considered. These selected publications were divided into three categories: DTL-only and IDS-only works are examined in the introduction and background section, and DTL-based IDS papers are considered in the core section of this review. By reading this review paper, researchers will be able to gain a better grasp of the current state of DTL approaches used in IDSs in many different types of network. Other useful information, such as the datasets used, the type of DTL employed, the pre-trained network, IDS techniques, the evaluation metrics including accuracy/F-score and false-alarm rate, and the improvements gained, are also covered. The algorithms and methods used in several studies are presented, and the principles of DTL-based IDS subcategories are presented to the reader and illustrated deeply and clearly</description>

      <title>Quadratic Programming-based Reference Spreading Control for Dual-Arm Robotic Manipulation with Planned Simultaneous Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the aim of further enabling the exploitation of intentional impacts in robotic manipulation, a control framework is presented that directly tackles the challenges posed by tracking control of robotic manipulators that are tasked to perform nominally simultaneous impacts. This framework is an extension of the reference spreading control framework, in which overlapping ante- and post-impact references that are consistent with impact dynamics are defined. In this work, such a reference is constructed starting from a teleoperation-based approach. By using the corresponding ante- and post-impact control modes in the scope of a quadratic programming control approach, peaking of the velocity error and control inputs due to impacts is avoided while maintaining high tracking performance. With the inclusion of a novel interim mode, we aim to also avoid input peaks and steps when uncertainty in the environment causes a series of unplanned single impacts to occur rather than the planned simultaneous impact. This work in particular presents for the first time an experimental evaluation of reference spreading control on a robotic setup, showcasing its robustness against uncertainty in the environment compared to three baseline control approaches.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Safe Formation Control for Coupled Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The safe control of multi-robot swarms is a challenging and active field of research, where common goals include maintaining group cohesion while simultaneously avoiding obstacles and inter-agent collision. Building off our previously developed theory for distributed collaborative safety-critical control for networked dynamic systems, we propose a distributed algorithm for the formation control of robot swarms given individual agent dynamics, induced formation dynamics, and local neighborhood position and velocity information within a defined sensing radius for each agent. Individual safety guarantees for each agent are obtained using rounds of communication between neighbors to restrict unsafe control actions among cooperating agents through safety conditions derived from high-order control barrier functions. We provide conditions under which a swarm is guaranteed to achieve collective safety with respect to multiple obstacles using a modified collaborative safety algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of our distributed algorithm via simulation in a simplified physics-based environment.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Stochastic Neurons Based on Strain Engineered Low Barrier Nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic neurons are efficient hardware accelerators for solving a large variety of combinatorial optimization problems. "Binary" stochastic neurons (BSN) are those whose states fluctuate randomly between two levels +1 and -1, with the probability of being in either level determined by an external bias. "Analog" stochastic neurons (ASNs), in contrast, can assume any state between the two levels randomly (hence "analog") and can perform analog signal processing. They may be leveraged for such tasks as temporal sequence learning, processing and prediction. Both BSNs and ASNs can be used to build efficient and scalable neural networks. Both can be implemented with low (potential energy) barrier nanomagnets (LBMs) whose random magnetization orientations encode the binary or analog state variables. The difference between them is that the potential energy barrier in a BSN LBM, albeit low, is much higher than that in an ASN LBM. As a result, a BSN LBM has a clear double well potential profile, which makes its magnetization orientation assume one of two orientations at any time, resulting in the binary behavior. ASN nanomagnets, on the other hand, hardly have any energy barrier at all and hence lack the double well feature. That makes their magnetizations fluctuate in an analog fashion. Hence, one can reconfigure an ASN to a BSN, and vice-versa, by simply raising and lowering the energy barrier. If the LBM is magnetostrictive, then this can be done with local (electrically generated) strain. Such a reconfiguration capability heralds a powerful field programmable architecture for a p-computer, and the energy cost for this type of reconfiguration is miniscule.</description>

      <title>Output-feedback Synthesis Orbit Geometry: Quotient Manifolds and LQG Direct Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider direct policy optimization for the linear-quadratic Gaussian (LQG) setting. Over the past few years, it has been recognized that the landscape of stabilizing output-feedback controllers of relevance to LQG has an intricate geometry, particularly as it pertains to the existence of spurious stationary points. In order to address such challenges, in this paper, we first adopt a Riemannian metric for the space of stabilizing full-order minimal output-feedback controllers. We then proceed to prove that the orbit space of such controllers modulo coordinate transformation admits a Riemannian quotient manifold structure. This geometric structure is then used to develop a Riemannian gradient descent for the direct LQG policy optimization. We prove a local convergence guarantee with linear rate and show the proposed approach exhibits significantly faster and more robust numerical performance as compared with ordinary gradient descent for LQG. Subsequently, we provide reasons for this observed behavior; in particular, we argue that optimizing over the orbit space of controllers is the right theoretical and computational setup for direct LQG policy optimization.</description>
