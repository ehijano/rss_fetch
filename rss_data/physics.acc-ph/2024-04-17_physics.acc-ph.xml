      <title>Efficient 6-dimensional phase space reconstruction from experimental measurements using generative machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation accelerator concepts which hinge on the precise shaping of beam distributions, demand equally precise diagnostic methods capable of reconstructing beam distributions within 6-dimensional position-momentum spaces. However, the characterization of intricate features within 6-dimensional beam distributions using conventional diagnostic techniques necessitates hundreds of measurements, using many hours of valuable beam time. Novel phase space reconstruction techniques are needed to substantially reduce the number of measurements required to reconstruct detailed, high-dimensional beam features in order to resolve complex beam phenomena, and as feedback in precision beam shaping applications. In this study, we present a novel approach to reconstructing detailed 6-dimensional phase space distributions from experimental measurements using generative machine learning and differentiable beam dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that for a collection of synthetic beam distribution test cases that this approach can be used to resolve 6-dimensional phase space distributions using basic beam manipulations and as few as 20 2-dimensional measurements of the beam profile, without the need for prior data collection or model training. We also demonstrate an application of the reconstruction method in an experimental setting at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator, where it is able to reconstruct the beam distribution and accurately predict previously unseen measurements 75x faster than previous methods.</description>

      <title>Excitation of nonlinear second order betatron sidebands for Knock Out slow extraction at the 1/3 resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Knock Out resonant slow extraction is a standard method for extracting stored particle beams from synchrotrons by transverse excitation. Classically, the beam is excited with an RF field comprising a frequency band around one of the betatron sidebands. This article demonstrates that the 1/3 resonance commonly used for the slow extraction induces nonlinear motion, resulting in the appearance of additional sidebands of higher order at multiples of the betatron tune. Measured and simulated beam spectra are presented, revealing these sidebands and the beam's response to being excited at first and second order sidebands. The feasibility of using a second order sideband for the purpose of slow extraction is demonstrated. This results in a significant improvement in the temporal structure (spill quality) of the extracted beam, but at the cost of higher excitation power requirements. This is observed both experimentally and in tracking simulations. The mechanism behind the observed improvement is explained using beam dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>A "lighthouse" laser-driven staged proton accelerator allowing for ultrafast angular and spectral control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact laser-plasma acceleration of fast ions has made great strides since its discovery over two decades ago, resulting in the current generation of high-energy ($\geq 100\,\rm MeV$) ultracold beams over ultrashort ($\leq 1\,\rm ps$) durations. To unlock broader applications of these beams, we need the ability to tailor the ion energy spectrum. Here, we present a scheme that achieves precisely this by accelerating protons in a "lighthouse" fashion, whereby the highest-energy component of the beam is emitted in a narrow cone, well separated from the lower-energy components. This is made possible by a two-stage interaction in which the rear surface of the target is first set into rapid motion before the main acceleration phase. This approach offers the additional advantages of leveraging a robust sheath acceleration process in standard micron-thick targets and being optically controllable.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Influence of the Amplitude-Dependent Tune Shift on the Transverse Mode-Coupling Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the 3 GeV ring of the MAX IV Laboratory, a fourth generation ring-based synchrotron light source, an asymmetric influence of the sign of the amplitude-dependent tune shift (ADTS) on the transverse mode-coupling instability (TMCI) has been observed. Measurements of the instability, in dedicated single-bunch experiments at low chromaticity, revealed a significant dependence of the dynamics of the instability above threshold on the sign of the ADTS. While for a negative sign of the ADTS the crossing of the instability does not lead to a loss of beam current, a positive sign results in the loss of 40% or more of the beam current at the threshold. In order to investigate the observed asymmetry, systematic measurement of beam dynamics above the threshold have been conducted in combination with particle tracking simulations with mbtrack2 and theoretical calculations of the Landau damping due to the ADTS. The findings point towards an influence of the Landau damping in combination with the low synchrotron frequency, which indicates that this effect could become relevant in future low-emittance electron storage rings.</description>
