      <description>arXiv:2510.03928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The center of a semisimple Lie algebra can be described as the algebra of W-invariant functions on the dual of the Cartan subalgebra. The centers of many Lie superalgebras have a similar description, but the defining equivalence relation on the dual of the Cartan subalgebra is not given by a finite group action. Lagrangian equivalence relations that we introduce generalize the action of a subgroup of the orthogonal group. Using them, we present a new proof of a result by Ian Musson about the centers of Lie superalgebras. Our proof is not based on a case-by-case analysis.</description>

      <title>Weyl-invariant subspaces are (usually) not generic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a linear representation of a connected complex reductive group $G$. Given a choice of character $\theta$ of $G$, Geometric Invariant Theory defines a locus $V^{ss}_\theta(G) \subseteq V$ of semistable points. We give necessary, sufficient, and in some cases equivalent conditions for the existence of $\theta$ such that a maximal torus $T$ of $G$ acts on $V^{ss}_\theta(T)$ with finite stabilizers. In such cases, the stack quotient $[V^{ss}_\theta(G)/G]$ is is known to be Deligne-Mumford. Our proof uses the combinatorial structure of the weights of irreducible representations of semisimple groups. As an application we generalize the Grassmannian flop example of Donovan-Segal.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the singular twin monoid and its corresponding group, constructed from both algebraic and topological perspectives. We then classify all complex homogeneous $2$-local and $3$-local representations of this constructed group. Moreover, we study the irreducibility of these representations and provide clear conditions under which irreducibility holds. Our results give a structured approach to understanding this new algebraic object and its representations.</description>

      <title>Reducibility of Scalar Generalized Verma Modules of Minimal Parabolic Type II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let g be a exceptional complex simple Lie algebra and q be a parabolic subalgebra. A generalized Verma module M is called a scalar generalized Verma module if it is induced from a one-dimensional representation of q. In this paper, we will determine the first diagonal-reducible point of scalar generalized Verma modules associated to minimal parabolic subalgebras of exceptional Lie algebras by computing explicitly the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of the corresponding highest weight modules.</description>

      <title>Kronecker Coefficients and Simultaneous Conjugacy Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Kronecker coefficient is the multiplicity of an irreducible representation of a finite group $G$ in a tensor product of irreducible representations. We define Kronecker Hecke algebras and use them as a tool to study Kronecker coefficients in finite groups. We show that the number of simultaneous conjugacy classes in a finite group $G$ is equal to the sum of squares of Kronecker coefficients, and the number of simultaneous conjugacy classes that are closed under elementwise inversion is the sum of Kronecker coefficients weighted by Frobenius-Schur indicators. We use these tools to investigate which finite groups have multiplicity-free tensor products. We introduce the class of doubly real groups, and show that they are precisely the real groups which have multiplicity-free tensor products. We show that non-Abelian groups of odd order, non-Abelian finite simple groups, and most finite general linear groups do not have multiplicity-free tensor products.</description>

      <title>Tensor Product Decompositions, Limits in Excellent Filtrations, Affine Weyl Group Orbits, and Tableaux Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We express the outer multiplicities in the tensor products of two fundamental simple modules for an affine Kac-Moody algebra of type $A$ in terms of counting certain sets of multipartitions by exploring the stabilizing limits of certain excellent filtrations. This extends for all ranks a previously obtained result by Jakeli\'c and the second author for rank $1$. The same outer multiplicities were previously computed by Misra and Wilson in terms of counting certain sets of tableaux. By comparing these two expressions and by explicitly exhibiting a combinatorial description of level-$2$ affine Weyl group orbits, we establish the existence of a bijection between the Misra-Wilson set of tableaux and a disjoint union of certain sets of multipartitions.</description>

      <title>Jacobian Algebras of Species with Potentials and 2-Representation Finite Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $2$-representation finite $\mathbb{K}$-algebras obtained from tensor products of tensor algebras of species. In earlier work we computed the higher preprojective algebra of said algebras to be given as Jacobian algebras of certain species with potential $(S, W)$, which are self-injective and finite dimensional. Truncating these Jacobian algebras yields a rich source of $2$-representation finite $\mathbb{K}$-algebras. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that the set of all cuts of $(S, W)$ is transitive under successive cut-mutations. Furthermore, we show that cuts and cut-mutation correspond to truncated Jacobian algebras and $2$-APR tilting, respectively. Consequently, under certain assumptions, all truncated Jacobian algebras are related to each other via $2$-APR tilting. We produce various new examples of $2$-representation finite $\mathbb{K}$-algebras.</description>

      <title>The tetrahedral Horn problem and asymptotics of U(n) 6j symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horn's problem is concerned with characterizing the eigenvalues $(a,b,c)$ of Hermitian matrices $(A,B,C)$ satisfying the constraint $A+B=C$ and forming the edges of a triangle in the space of Hermitian matrices. It has deep connections to tensor product invariants, Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, geometric invariant theory and the intersection theory of Schubert varieties. This paper concerns the tetrahedral Horn problem which aims to characterize the tuples of eigenvalues $(a,b,c,d,e,f)$ of Hermitian matrices $(A,B,C,D,E,F)$ forming the edges of a tetrahedron, and thus satisfying the constraints $A+B=C$, $B+D=F$, $D+C=E$ and $A+F=E$.
  Here we derive new inequalities satisfied by the Schur-polynomials of such eigenvalues and, using eigenvalue estimation techniques from quantum information theory, prove their satisfaction up to degree $k$ implies the existence of approximate solutions with error $O(\ln k / k)$. Moreover, the existence of these tetrahedra is related to the semiclassical asymptotics of the $6j$-symbols for the unitary group $U(n)$, which are maps between multiplicity spaces that encode the associativity relation for tensor products of irreducible representations. Using our techniques, we prove the asymptotics of norms of these $6j$-symbols are either inverse-polynomial or exponential depending on whether there exists such tetrahedra of Hermitian matrices.</description>

      <title>Gross's conjecture: the dihedral case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quaternionic modular forms on $\mathsf{G}_2$ carry a surprisingly rich arithmetic structure. For example, they have a theory of Fourier expansions where the Fourier coefficients are indexed by totally real cubic rings. For quaternionic modular forms on $\mathsf{G}_2$ associated via functoriality with certain modular forms on $\mathrm{PGL}_2$, Gross conjectured in 2000 that their Fourier coefficients encode $L$-values of cubic twists of the modular form (echoing Waldspurger's work on Fourier coefficients of half-integral weight modular forms). We prove Gross's conjecture when the modular forms are dihedral, giving the first examples for which it is known.</description>

      <title>Implicit Models: Expressive Power Scales with Test-Time Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit models, an emerging model class, compute outputs by iterating a single parameter block to a fixed point. This architecture realizes an infinite-depth, weight-tied network that trains with constant memory, significantly reducing memory needs for the same level of performance compared to explicit models. While it is empirically known that these compact models can often match or even exceed larger explicit networks by allocating more test-time compute, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood.
  We study this gap through a nonparametric analysis of expressive power. We provide a strict mathematical characterization, showing that a simple and regular implicit operator can, through iteration, progressively express more complex mappings. We prove that for a broad class of implicit models, this process lets the model's expressive power scale with test-time compute, ultimately matching a much richer function class. The theory is validated across three domains: image reconstruction, scientific computing, and operations research, demonstrating that as test-time iterations increase, the complexity of the learned mapping rises, while the solution quality simultaneously improves and stabilizes.</description>

      <title>Chiral algebra, Wilson lines, and mixed Hodge structure of Coulomb branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find an intriguing relation between the chiral algebra and the mixed Hodge structure of the Coulomb branch of four dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$ superconformal field theories. We identify the space of irreducible characters of the $\mathcal{N} = 4$ $SU(N)$ chiral algebra $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ by analytically computing the Wilson line Schur index, and imposing modular invariance. We further establish a map from the $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ characters to the characters of the $\mathcal{T}_{p, N}$ chiral algebra. We extract the pure part of the mixed Hodge polynomial $PH_c$ of the Coulomb branch compactified on a circle, and prove that $PH_c$ encodes the representation theory of $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$. We expect this to be a new entry of the 4D mirror symmetry framework.</description>

Abstract: In 2020, F.Cesi introduced a random walk on the hyperoctahedral group $B_n$ and analysed its spectral gap when the allowed generators are transpositions and diagonal elements corresponding to singletons. In this paper we extend the allowed generators to transpositions and any diagonal elements, and characterise completely the set of representations from which the spectral gap arises. This settles a conjecture posed in Cesi's paper.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Aspects of Elliptic Schubert Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to extend two fundamental combinatorial results in Schubert calculus on flag manifolds from equivariant cohomology and $K$-theory to equivariant elliptic cohomology. The foundations of elliptic Schubert calculus were laid in a few relatively recent papers by Rim\'anyi, Weber, and Kumar. They include the recursive construction of elliptic Schubert classes via generalizations of the cohomology and $K$-theory push-pull operators and the study of the corresponding Demazure algebra. We derive a Billey-type formula for the localization of elliptic Schubert classes (for partial flag manifolds of arbitrary type) and a pipe dream model for their polynomial representatives in the case of type $A$ flag manifolds. The latter extends the pipe dream model for double Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials. We also study the degeneration of elliptic Schubert classes to $K$-theory, which recovers the corresponding classical formulas.</description>

      <title>F-invariant in cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11438v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider skew-symmetrizable (upper) cluster algebras with a compatible Poisson structure, called $\mathsf{\Lambda}$-(upper) cluster algebras. For any two good elements (e.g., cluster monomials) in a $\mathsf{\Lambda}$-upper cluster algebra, we introduce two invariants, called tropical invariant and $F$-invariant. We prove that (i) the product of two cluster monomials is still a cluster monomial if and only if their $F$-invariant is zero; (ii) if two cluster variables are log-canonical, then they are contained in the same cluster; and (iii) the notion of $F$-invariant for a pair of cluster monomials can be defined for any (upper) cluster algebra, regardless of whether it is a $\mathsf{\Lambda}$-(upper) cluster algebra.
  When restricting to cluster monomials, we prove that the tropical invariant and $F$-invariant respectively coincide with the $\Lambda$-invariant and twice $\mathfrak{d}$-invariant in the monoidal cluster categorification using various monoidal subcategories of finite-dimensional modules over quantum affine algebras and quiver Hecke algebras; and we prove that the $F$-invariant coincides with the $E$-invariant in the additive cluster categorification using the theory of quivers with potentials.
  Inspired by $F$-invariant, we introduce the dominant sets for seeds of cluster algebras as a replacement of torsion classes for $\tau$-tilting pairs in $\tau$-tilting theory. With the help of the dominant sets, we prove that the oriented exchange graphs of cluster algebras are acyclic. In particular, this implies that green mutations induce a partial order on the set of seeds (up to seed equivalence) of cluster algebras. We prove that the oriented exchange graphs of cluster algebras coincide with the Hasse quivers of the above posets of seeds.</description>

      <title>Representations from matrix varieties, and filtered RSK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix Schubert varieties (Fulton '92) carry natural actions of Levi groups. Their coordinate rings are thereby Levi-representations; what is a combinatorial counting rule for the multiplicities of their irreducibles? When the Levi group is a torus, (Knutson-Miller '04) answers the question. We present a general solution, a common refinement of the multigraded Hilbert series, the Cauchy identity, and the Littlewood-Richardson rule. Our result applies to any ``bicrystalline'' algebraic variety; we define these using the operators of (Kashiwara '95) and of (Danilov-Koshevoi '05, van Leeuwen '06). The proof introduces a ``filtered'' generalization of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence.</description>

      <title>Cluster Monomials in Graph Laurent Phenomenon Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laurent phenomenon algebras, first introduced by Lam and Pylyavskyy, are a generalization of cluster algebras that still possess many salient features of cluster algebras. Graph Laurent phenomenon algebras, defined by Lam and Pylyavskyy, are a subclass of Laurent phenomenon algebras whose structure is given by the data of a directed graph. In this paper, we prove that the cluster monomials of a graph Laurent phenomenon algebra form a linear basis, as conjectured by Lam and Pylyavskyy and analogous to a result for cluster algebras by Caldero and Keller. We also prove that, if the graph is a bidirected tree, the coefficients of the expansion of any monomial in terms of cluster monomials are nonnegative.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we prove that if (A, B, C) is a recollement of abelian categories, then Wakamatsu tilting (resp. weak support tau-tilting) subcategories in A and C can induce Wakamatsu tilting (resp. weak support tau-tilting) subcategories in B, and the converses hold under natural assumptions. As an application, we mainly consider the relationship of tau-cotorsion torsion triples in (A, B, C).</description>

      <title>Stratifying quiver Schur algebras via ersatz parity sheaves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the theory of parity sheaves, which allows for non-locally constant sheaves along strata. Our definition is tailored for proving the existence of (proper, quasihereditary, etc) stratifications of $\mathrm{Ext}$-algebras. We use this to study quiver Schur algebras $A(\alpha)$ for the cyclic quiver of length $2$. We find a polynomial quasihereditary structure on $A(\alpha)$ compatible with the categorified PBW basis of McNamara and Kleshchev-Muth, and sharpen their results to arbitrary characteristic. We also prove that semicuspidal algebras of $A(n\delta)$ are polynomial quasihereditary covers of semicuspidal algebras of the corresponding KLR algebra $R(n\delta)$, and compute them diagrammatically.</description>

      <title>Classification of coadjoint orbits for the maximal unipotent subgroup in the simple group of type F_4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let N be the maximal unipotent subgroup in the simple algebraic group of type {\Phi}. It naturally acts on the space dual to the Lie algebra n of N, and this action is called coadjoint. Such orbits play the key role in the orbit method of A.A. Kirillov. In this work, we classify the orbits of this action in the case of {\Phi} = F_4 in terms of supports of canonical forms. This means that we will present a set S of linear forms such that for any coadjoint orbit there exists a unique form from S belonging to that orbit. The set of canonical forms will be explicitly described in terms of supports.</description>

Abstract: Let $E/F$ be a finite cyclic extension of local fields of characteristic zero, of degree $d$, and $\kappa$ be a character of $F^\times$ whose kernel is $\mathrm{N}_{E/F}(E^\times)$. For $m\in \mathbb{N}^*$, we prove that every irreducible unitary representation of $\mathrm{GL}_m(E)$ has a $\kappa$-lift to $\mathrm{GL}_{md}(F)$, given by a character identity as in Henniart-Herb [HH]. Let ${\bf E}/{\bf F}$ be a finite cyclic extension of number fields, of degree $d$, and $\mathfrak{K}$ be a character of $\mathbb{A}_{\bf F}^\times$ whose kernel is ${\bf F}^\times \mathrm{N}_{{\bf E}/{\bf F}}(\mathbb{A}_{\bf E}^\times)$. We prove that every automorphic discrete representation of $\mathrm{GL}_m(\mathbb{A}_{\bf E})$ has a (strong) $\mathfrak{K}$-lift to $\mathrm{GL}_{md}(\mathbb{A}_{\bf F})$, i.e. compatible with the local lifting maps. We describe the image and the fibres of these local and global lifting maps. Locally, we also treat the elliptic representations.</description>

      <title>A Higgs category for the cluster variety of triples of flags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cluster variety of triples of flags (associated with a split simple Lie group of Dynkin type Delta) plays a key role in higher Teichmuller theory as developed by Fock-Goncharov, Jiarui Fei, Ian Le, ... and Goncharov-Shen. We refer to it as the basic triangle associated with Delta. In this paper, for simply laced Delta, we construct and study a Higgs category (in the sense of Yilin Wu) which we expect to categorify the basic triangle. This category is a certain exact dg category (in the sense of Xiaofa Chen) which is Frobenius and stably 2-Calabi-Yau. We show that it has indeed the expected cyclic group symmetry and that its derived category has the expected braid group symmetry. A key ingredient in our construction is a conjecture by Merlin Christ, whose proof occupies most of this paper. The proof is based on a new description of the Higgs category in terms of Gorenstein projective dg modules. Our techniques are in the spirit of Orlov in his work on triangulated categories of graded B-branes.</description>

      <title>Invariants and representations of the $\Gamma$-graded general linear Lie $\omega$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is considerable current interest in applications of generalised Lie algebras graded by an abelian group $\Gamma$ with a commutative factor $\omega$. This calls for a systematic development of the theory of such algebraic structures. We treat the representation theory and invariant theory of the $\Gamma$-graded general linear Lie $\omega$-algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$, where $V(\Gamma, \omega)$ is any finite dimensional $\Gamma$-graded vector space. Generalised Howe dualities over symmetric $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebras are established, from which we derive the first and second fundamental theorems of invariant theory, and a generalised Schur-Weyl duality. The unitarisable $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$-modules for two ``compact'' $\ast$-structures are classified, and it is shown that the tensor powers of $V(\Gamma, \omega)$ and their duals are unitarisable for the two compact $\ast$-structures respectively. A Hopf $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebra is constructed, which gives rise to a group functor corresponding to the general linear group in the $\Gamma$-graded setting. Using this Hopf $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebra, we realise simple tensor modules and their dual modules by mimicking the classic Borel-Weil theorem. We also analyse in some detail the case with $\Gamma={\mathbb Z}^{\dim{V(\Gamma, \omega)}}$ and $\omega$ depending on a complex parameter $q\ne 0$, where $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$ shares common features with the quantum general linear (super)group, but is better behaved especially when $q$ is a root of unity.</description>

      <title>Strongly Hopfian and Co-Hopfian Acts over Monoids: Structure and Characterizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and explore new classes of S-acts over a monoid S, namely, strongly Hopfian and strongly co-Hopfian acts, as well as their weaker counterparts, Hopfian and co-Hopfian acts. We investigate the relationships between these newly defined structures and well-studied classes of S-acts, including Noetherian, Artinian, injective, projective, quasi-injective, and quasi-projective acts. A key result shows that, under certain conditions, a quasi-projective (respectively quasi-injective) S-act that is strongly co-Hopfian (respectively strongly Hopfian) is also strongly Hopfian (respectively strongly co-Hopfian). Moreover, we provide a variety of examples and structural results concerning the behavior of subacts and quotient acts of strongly Hopfian and strongly co-Hopfian S-acts, further elucidating the internal structure and interrelationships within this extended framework.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Calabi--Yau quadruple as a generalization of Iyama--Yang's Calabi--Yau triple. For each $(d+1)$-Calabi--Yau quadruple, we show that the associated Higgs category is a $d$-Calabi--Yau Frobenius extriangulated category, which moreover admits a canonical $d$-cluster-tilting subcategory. Concrete examples arise from the construction of relative cluster categories and Higgs categories in the setting of ice quivers with potentials, as well as from the singularity category of an isolated singularity. As an application, we prove that both the relative Amiot--Guo--Keller's construction and the Higgs construction of a $(d+1)$-Calabi--Yau quadruple take silting reduction to Calabi--Yau reduction.</description>

      <title>On RoCK blocks of double covers of symmetric and alternating groups and the refined Brou\'e conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Kleshchev and Livesey proved the existence of RoCK $p$-blocks for double covers of symmetric and alternating groups over large enough coefficient rings. They proved that RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that these RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that in most cases the Morita and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for most of these RoCK blocks.</description>

      <title>Stanley decompositions of modules of covariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16749v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a complex reductive group, with finite-dimensional representations $W$ and $U$. The module of covariants for $W$ of type $U$ is the space of all $H$-equivariant polynomial maps $\varphi: W \longrightarrow U$. In this paper, we take $H$ to be one of the classical groups $\operatorname{GL}(V)$, $\operatorname{O}(V)$, or $\operatorname{Sp}(V)$, where $W$ is a direct sum of copies of $V$ and $V^*$, and $U$ is an arbitrary rational representation (with $U$ restricted to exterior powers of $V$ in the $H= \operatorname{O}(V)$ case). Our main result gives uniform Stanley decompositions of these modules of covariants, with Stanley spaces parametrized by combinatorial objects we call jellyfish. As a corollary, we write down the Hilbert series as a finite sum of rational functions, each with a combinatorial interpretation in terms of lattice paths. Notably, these results do not rely on the module being Cohen-Macaulay. We further apply our methods to invariant rings for $\operatorname{SL}(V)$ and $\operatorname{SO}(V)$. Our proofs (for $H = \operatorname{GL}(V)$ and $\operatorname{Sp}(V)$) rely on previous work by Jackson on standard monomial theory for dual reductive pairs, since classical modules of covariants can be viewed via Howe duality as Harish-Chandra modules of unitary highest weight representations of a certain real reductive group. As a first step toward extending this program to arbitrary unitary highest weight representations (including those of the exceptional groups), we establish analogous results uniformly for the Wallach representations of type ADE.</description>

      <title>Deformation of moduli spaces of meromorphic $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ via unfolding of irregular singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unfolding singular points in linear differential equations is a classical technique for studying the properties of irregular singularities by relating them to regular singularities. In this paper, we propose a general framework for unfolding unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic connections on the trivial principal $G$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$.
  One of our main results is the description of the unfolding of singularities in terms of deformations of their moduli spaces. We show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ can be deformed into a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$.
  Furthermore, we study the unfolding of additive Deligne-Simpson problems, in which the unfolding of irregular singularities naturally generates a family of such problems. As an application of our main result, we prove that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities admits a solution if and only if every unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem in the family admits a simultaneous solution.
  We also provide a combinatorial and diagrammatic framework of the unfolding process in terms of spectral types and unfolding diagrams. Finally, we address a conjecture proposed by Oshima concerning the existence of irreducible $G$-connections that realize prescribed spectral types and their unfoldings. Our main result gives an affirmative answer to this conjecture.</description>

Abstract: In this work we introduce a notion of tensor product of (twisted) quiver representations with relations in the category of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules. As a first application of our notion, we see that tensor products of polystable quiver bundles are polystable and later we use this to both deduce a quiver version of the Segre embedding and to identify distinguished closed subschemes of $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})$-character varieties of free abelian groups.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove a sharpened asymptotic for the growth of analytic torsion of congruence quotients of $\SL(n,\R)/\SO(n)$ in terms of the volume. The result is based on bounds on the trace of the heat kernel, allowing control of the large time behaviour of certain orbital integrals, as well as a careful analysis of error terms. The result requires the existence of $\lambda$-strongly acyclic representations, which we define and show exists in plenitude for any $\lambda&gt;0$. The motivation is possible applications to torsion in the cohomology of arithmetic groups.</description>

      <title>The characteristic quasi-polynomials of hyperplane arrangements with actions of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an equivariant version of the characteristic quasi-polynomials as the permutation characters on the complement of mod $q$ hyperplane arrangements. We prove that the permutation character is a quasi-polynomial in $q$, and show that it can be expressed by the sum of the induced characters of an equivariant version of the Ehrhart quasi-polynomials. Furthermore, we consider the case of the Coxeter arrangements, and compute in detail for type $A_\ell$.</description>

      <title>Graph enumeration for moduli spaces of curves and maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a calculus based on graph enumeration for calculating $S_n$-equivariant motivic invariants of graphically stratified moduli spaces. We apply our theory to the Deligne--Mumford moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}$ and to the space of torus-fixed stable maps $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(X, \beta)^{\mathbb{C}^\star}$ when the target $X$ admits an appropriate $\mathbb{C}^\star$-action, deriving new formulas in each case. A key role is played by the P\'olya--Petersen character of a graph, which enriches P\'olya's classical cycle index polynomial. This character is valued in an algebra $\Lambda^{[2]}$ of wreath product symmetric functions, which we study from combinatorial and representation--theoretic perspectives. We prove that this algebra may be viewed as the Grothendieck ring of the category of polynomial functors which take symmetric sequences of vector spaces to vector spaces, building on foundational work of Macdonald. This leads to a plethystic action of $\Lambda^{[2]}$ on the ring $\Lambda$ of ordinary symmetric functions. Using this action, we derive our formulas, which ultimately involve only ordinary symmetric functions and the Grothendieck ring of mixed Hodge structures.</description>

      <title>Strong cohomological integrality for symmetric stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a strong form of the cohomological integrality theorem, decomposing the cohomology of smooth symmetric stacks as the cohomological Hall induction of the intersection cohomology of the good moduli spaces of stacks of graded points. This generalizes the previous result by the second author together with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu to non-orthogonal stacks, and confirms a conjecture of the first author that the algebraic BPS cohomology of the quotient stack of a symmetric representation matches the intersection cohomology group whenever it is nonzero. As a consequence, we obtain a version of the cohomological integrality theorem for general 0-shifted symplectic stacks with good moduli spaces, as well as for the character stacks of general compact oriented $3$-manifolds with reductive gauge groups. As an application, we prove Halpern-Leistner's conjecture on the purity of the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks admitting proper good moduli spaces.
  Our proof combines a cohomological bound for the algebraic BPS cohomology, due to the first author and based on Efimov's lemma, with a vanishing-cycle argument due to the second author in collaboration with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu. We also give a purely geometric proof of the required cohomological bound.</description>

      <title>Affine representations of rational and pretzel knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study representations of rational and pretzel tangle and knot groups into the affine group $\mathrm{AGL}(1,\mathbb{C})$, via a TQFT that is valued in the category of spans of singular vector bundles over $\mathbb{C}^{\ast}$. For these families, we derive closed-form expressions for their Alexander polynomials and establish bounds on their zeros. Finally, we specialize the functor at $t=-1$ and analyze colorings of rational tangles in terms of spans of complex vector spaces.</description>
