      <title>Positive-Energy Dirac Particles and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic positive-energy wave equation proposed by P. Dirac in 1971 is an old but largely forgotten subject. The purpose of this note is to speculate that particles described by this equation (called here Dirac particles) are natural candidates for the dark matter. The reasoning is based on a fact that the internal structure of such particles simply prohibits their interaction with electromagnetic fields (at least with the minimal coupling) which is exactly what is required for dark matter. Dirac particles have quite unusual properties. In particular, they are transformed by an infinite-dimensional representation of the homogeneous Lorentz group, which clearly distinguishes them from all known elementary particles described by finite-dimensional representations and hints to a physics beyond the Standard Model. To clarify the topic, a brief review of the main features of {the above-mentioned} Dirac equation is given.</description>

      <title>Cartan-like formulation of electric Carrollian gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Cartan-like first-order action principle for electric Carrollian gravity. The action is invariant under the local homogeneous Carroll group, albeit in a different representation than the one obtained by gauging the Carroll algebra. Additionally, we show that this first-order action can be derived from a smooth Carrollian limit of the Einstein-Cartan action. The connection with the Hamiltonian and metric forms of the action for electric Carrollian gravity, as well as with previous works in the literature, is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Observational Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What can be measured by an observer in our universe? We address this question by constructing an algebra of gravitationally-dressed observables accessible to a comoving observer in FLRW spacetimes that are asymptotically de Sitter in the past, describing an inflationary epoch. An essential quantized degree of freedom is the zero-mode of the inflaton, which leads to fluctuations in the effective cosmological constant during inflation and prevents the existence of a maximum entropy state in the semiclassical limit. Due to the inaccessibility of measurements beyond our cosmological horizon, we demonstrate that all states are mixed with well-defined von Neumann entropy. For semiclassical states, the von Neumann entropy corresponds to the generalized entropy (up to a state-independent constant) of the observer's causal diamond, a fine-grained quantity that is sensitive to the initial conditions of the universe.</description>

      <title>SCFT deformations via uplifted solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A holographic method for implementing a particular supersymmetry-preserving deformation to 4d SCFTs is presented. At the heart of the procedure is a soliton solution of minimal $d=5$ gauged supergravity. Embedding this solution into ten- and eleven-dimensional string theory backgrounds of the form AdS$_5 \times M$, we systematically construct a range of new solutions. Each holographically realizes a twisted compactification of the SCFT$_4$ dual to the original background. In the IR, the resulting SQFTs flow to gapped three-dimensional systems. Using a variety of holographic observables, we give evidence for this interpretation and for confinement in the deformed SQFTs. Our method applies to any holographic solutions admitting a consistent truncation to minimal $d=5$ gauged supergravity, and can likely be generalized to solutions with other AdS$_d$ factors.</description>

      <title>Almost classical de Sitter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical-dS scenario in the type II string theories proposes to search for dS vacua of orientifold flux compactifications in a regime where string corrections to the compactified effective field theory are negligible. We study a minimal extension of this scenario in which the leading string corrections to the O-plane/D-brane actions at the 4-derivative order are included but higher orders as well as string corrections in the bulk are self-consistently neglected. Our proposal is motivated by a recent debate about dS solutions with O8-planes which circumvent a classical no-go theorem due to unusual sources leading to so-called permissive boundary conditions for the 10D supergravity fields. We argue that such sources do not arise in classical supergravity but ask whether including the 4-derivative corrections leads to sources that have a similar effect. However, we find that the 4-derivative corrections do not allow meta-stable dS in a class of models with O8-planes and/or D8-branes we consider. We also study related models which in addition contain O6-planes/D6-branes and find that again no meta-stable dS is allowed, both classically and including the 4-derivative corrections. While some of the arguments in this work require the backreaction of the O-plane/D-brane sources to be small, others are valid including the full backreaction.</description>

      <title>Global Embedding of Fibre Inflation in Perturbative LVS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a global embedding of the Fibre inflation model in perturbative large volume scenario (LVS) in which the inflationary potential is induced via a combination of string-loop corrections and higher derivative F$^4$-effects. The minimal Fibre inflation model developed in the standard LVS generically faces some strong bounds on the inflaton field range arising from the K\"ahler cone constraints, which subsequently creates a challenge for realising the cosmological observables while consistently respecting the underlying supergravity approximations. The main attractive feature of this proposal is to naturally alleviate this issue by embedding Fibre inflation in perturbative LVS.</description>

      <title>Bosonization of 2+1 dimensional fermions on the surface of topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional topological insulators can be described by an effective field theory involving two `hydrodynamic' Abelian gauge fields. The action contains a bulk topological BF term and a surface term, called loop model. This describes the massless 2+1 dimensional excitations and provides them with a semiclassical, yet non-trivial conformal invariant dynamics. Given that topological insulators are originally fermionic, this physical setting is ideal for realizing the bosonization of massless fermions in terms of gauge fields. Building on earlier analyses of the loop model, we find that fermions belong to the solitonic spectrum and can be described by Wilson lines, through the generalization of 1+1 dimensional vertex operators. Their correlation functions agree with conformal invariance. The bosonic loop model is then mapped into a fermionic theory by using the general construction of fermionic topological phases described in the literature. It requires the identification of the characteristic one-form $Z_2$ symmetry of the bosonic theory and its gauging, which originates the fermion number $(-1)^F$, the spin sectors and the time reversal symmetry obeying ${\cal T}^2=(-1)^F$. These results are detailed for the effective action and the partition function on the geometry $S^2\times S^1$.</description>

      <title>Huge BPS Operators and Fluid Dynamics in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the bulk dual of holography, huge operators correspond to sources so heavy that they fully backreact on the space-time geometry. Here we study the correlation function of three such huge operators when they are given by $1/2$ BPS operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory, dual to IIB Strings in $AdS_5 \times S^5$. We unveil simple matrix model representations for these correlators which we can sometimes solve analytically. For general huge operators, we translate these matrix model expressions into a $1+1$ dimensional hydrodynamical fluid problem. This fluid is integrable thus unveiling a novel integrable sector of the $AdS/CFT$ duality in a full fledged gravitational regime, very far from the usual free string planar regime where integrability reigns supreme. We explain how an adiabatic deformation method can be developed to yield the solution to an integrable discrete formulation of these fluids -- the rational Calogero-Moser Model -- so we can access the general three point correlation functions of generic huge $1/2$-BPS operators. Everything will be done on the gauge theory side of the duality. It would be fascinating to find the holographic dual of these matrix models and fluids.</description>

      <title>Basis for Non-Factorizable Superamplitudes in N = 1 Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a semi-standard Young tableau (SSYT) approach to construct a basis of non-factorizable superamplitudes in N = 1 massless supersymmetry. This amplitude basis can be directly translated to a basis for higher dimensional supersymmetric operators, yielding both the number of independent operators and their form. We deal with distinguishable (massless) chiral/vector superfields at first, then generalize the result to the indistinguishable case. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this method compared to the previously studied Hilbert series approach.</description>

      <title>The quasilocal energy and thermodynamic first law in accelerating AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the conserved energy of an accelerating AdS black hole by employing the quasilocal formalism, which links the off-shell ADT formalism with the off-shell covariant phase space formalism. In the presence of conical singularities in the accelerating black hole, the expression for the energy depends on the surface term derived from the variation of the action. The essential ingredient of our computations for the quasilocal energy is that the surface contributions come from the conical singularities as well as the ordinary radial boundary. Consequently, the resulting quasilocal energy naturally satisfies the thermodynamic first law for the black hole without any modifications to the thermodynamic variables. Additionally, we obtain the Smarr relation for the black hole using the differential operator method and the scaling argument of the relevant thermodynamic quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers a variation of the massive ambitwistor string model presented in arXiv:2301.11227 that describes supergravity and super-Yang-Mills on the Coulomb branch simultaneously with a single Lagrangian. All-multiplicity tree and one-loop amplitudes are evaluated and shown to have proper unitary factorization. The massless limit provides Einstein Yang-Mills Amplitudes including multiple gluon traces. It is argued that the cosmological constant vanishes at all orders of perturbation theory. As application results for Compton scattering are obtained and compared with ones in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Which relativistic field theories give rise to Kepler dynamics in the two-body problem? We consider a class of Hamiltonians that is the unique relativistic extension of the Kepler problem preserving its so(4) algebra, and have orbits related through time reparametrisation to orbits of the original Kepler problem. For three explicit examples, we give a natural interpretation in terms of spin-0,-1 and -2 interacting field theories in 5D. These are organically connected via the classical double copy, which therefore preserves maximal superintegrability.</description>

      <title>A clock is just a way to tell the time: gravitational algebras in cosmological spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02116v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the algebra of observables in semiclassical quantum gravity for cosmological backgrounds, focusing on two key examples: slow-roll inflation and evaporating Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes. In both cases, we demonstrate the existence of a nontrivial algebra of diffeomorphism-invariant observables \emph{without} the introduction of an external clock system or the presence of any asymptotic gravitational charges. Instead, the rolling inflaton field and the evaporating black hole act as physical clocks that allow a definition of gauge-invariant observables at $G = 0$. The resulting algebras are both Type II$_\infty$ factors, but neither is manifestly a crossed product algebra. We establish a connection between the Type II entropy of these algebras and generalized entropies for appropriate states. Our work extends previous results on Type II gravitational algebras and highlights the crucial role of out-of-equilibrium dynamics for defining gauge-invariant observables in semiclassical canonically quantised gravity. We also briefly discuss the construction of gauge-invariant algebras for compact wedges bounded by extremal surfaces in generic spacetimes (i.e. in the absence of any Killing symmetry). In contrast to the inflaton and black hole cases, this algebra does end up being a simple crossed product. No clock or asymptotic charges are required because of the absence of any symmetry in the classical background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02127v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that, one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or in other words Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity can be removed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the classical field theory of 2+1-dimensional Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory on an arbitrary spatial manifold. We first define a gauge covariant transverse electric field strength, which together with the gauge covariant scalar magnetic field strength can be taken as coordinates on the classical phase space. We then determine the Poisson-Dirac bracket and find that these coordinates are canonically conjugate to each other. The Hamiltonian is non-polynomial when expressed in terms of these coordinates, but can be expanded in a power series in the coupling constant with polynomial coefficients.</description>

      <title>Polyadic supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a polyadic analog of supersymmetry by considering the polyadization procedure (proposed by the author) applied to the toy model of one-dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The supercharges are generalized to polyadic ones using the $n$-ary sigma matrices defined in earlier work. In this way, polyadic analogs of supercharges and Hamiltonians take the cyclic shift block matrix form, and they can describe multidegenerated quantum states in a way that is different from the $N$-extended and multigraded SQM. While constructing the corresponding supersymmetry as an $n$-ary Lie superalgebra ($n$ is the arity of the initial associative multiplication), we have found new brackets with a reduced arity of $2\leq m&lt;n$ and a related series of $m$-ary superalgebras (which is impossible for binary superalgebras). In the case of even reduced arity $m$ we obtain a tower of higher order (as differential operators) even Hamiltonians, while for $m$ odd we get a tower of higher order odd supercharges, and the corresponding algebra consists of the odd sector only.</description>

      <title>Spectral representation in Klein space: simplifying celestial leaf amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the spectral representation in Klein space which is the split $(2,2)$ signature flat spacetime. The Klein space can be foliated into Lorentzian $\mathrm{AdS}_3 /\mathbb{Z}$ slices, and its identity resolution has both continuous and discrete parts. We calculate the identity resolution, and the plancherel measure in these slices. Using the foliation of Klein space into the slices, and the identity resolution, and the plancherel measure in each slices, we compute the spectral representation of the massive bulk-to-bulk propagator in Klein space. It can be expressed as the sum of product of two massive (or tachyonic) conformal primary wavefunctions, with both continuous and discrete parts, and sharing a common boundary coordinate. An interesting point in Klein space is that since the identity resolution has both discrete and continuous parts, a new type of conformal primary wavefunction naturally arises for the massive (or tachyonic) case. For the conformal primary wavefunctions, both the discrete and continuous parts involve integrating over the common boundary coordinate and the real (or imaginary) mass. In the discrete part, the conformal dimension is summed, whereas in the continuous part, it is integrated. The spectral representation in Klein space is a computational tool to derive conformal block expansions for celestial amplitude in Klein space and its building blocks called celestial leaf amplitudes, by integrating the particle interaction vertex over a single slice of foliation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate scalar field theories in a curved braided $L_\infty$-algebra formalism and analyse their correlation functions using Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization. We perform detailed calculations in cubic braided scalar field theory up to two-loop order and three-point multiplicity. The divergent tadpole contributions are eliminated by a suitable choice of central curvature for the $L_\infty$-structure, and we confirm the absence of UV/IR mixing. The calculations of higher loop and higher multiplicity correlators in homological perturbation theory are facilitated by the introduction of a novel diagrammatic calculus. We derive an algebraic version of the Schwinger-Dyson equations based on the homological perturbation lemma, and use them to prove the braided Wick theorem.</description>

      <title>Note on $Spin(3,1)$ tensors, the Dirac field and $GL(k, \mathbb{R})$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the rank decomposition of a real matrix $r$, which is a $Spin(3,1)$ tensor, leads to $2k$ Majorana bispinors, where $k= rank\: r$. The Majorana bispinors are determined up to local $GL(k, \mathbb{R})$ transformations. The bispinors are combined in pairs to form $k$ complex Dirac fields. We analyze in detail the case $k=1$, in which there is just one Dirac field with the standard Lagrangian. The $GL(1, \mathbb{R})$ symmetry gives rise to a new conserved current, different from the well known $U(1)$ current. The $U(1)$ symmetry is present too. All global continuous internal symmetries in the $k=1$ case form the $SO(2,1)$ group. As a side result, we clarify the discussed in literature issue whether there exist algebraic constraints for the matrix $r$ which would be equivalent to the condition $rank\: r=1$.</description>

      <title>Radial canonical AdS$_3$ gravity and $T\bar{T}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ an ADM deparametrization strategy to discuss the radial canonical formalism of asymptotically AdS$_3$ gravity. It leads to the identification of a radial 'time' before quantization, which is the volume time, canonically conjugate to York time. Holographically, this allows to interpret the semi-classical path integral of $T\bar T$ theory as a Schr\"odinger wavefunctional satisfying a Schr\"odinger evolution equation in volume time, and the $T\bar T$ operator expectation value in terms of the Hamiltonian that generates volume time translations -- both consistent with cut-off holography. We make use of the canonical perspective to construct the rotating BTZ solution from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, with a finite cut-off energy spectrum that has a known holographic $T\bar T$ interpretation, as well as semi-classical Wheeler-DeWitt states for that solution.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on a modified-gravity model with an exponential function of the curvature using the expansion history, the RSD, and the Pantheon$+$SH0ES data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering a well motivated $f(R)$ modified-gravity model, in which an exponential function of the curvature is included, in this paper we implement a statistical data analysis to set constraints on the parameters of the model, taking into account an analytic approximate solution for the expansion rate, $H(z)$. From the Monte Carlo Markov Chain-based analysis of the expansion rate evolution, the standardized SN distance modulus and the redshift space distortion observational data, we find that the preferred value for the perturbative parameter, $b$, quantifying the deviation of the $f(R)$ model from $\Lambda$CDM, lives in a region which excludes $b = 0$ at $\gtrsim 4.5 \sigma$ C.L., and that the predicted current value of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$, locates in between the two observational results currently under scrutiny from Planck and SH0ES collaborations, indicating that the proposed model would alleviate the apparent tension. Under the implemented approximate solution, and with the constraints obtained for the parameters, the proposed $f(R)$ model successfully reproduce the observational data and the predicted evolution of interesting cosmological parameters resemble the results of $\Lambda$CDM, as expected, while an oscillatory behavior of the dark energy equation of state is observed, pointing to deviation from the concordance cosmological model. The results presented here reinforces the conclusion that the $f(R)$ modified-gravity model represents a viable alternative to describe the evolution of the Universe, evading the challenges faced by $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>A generalized statistical model for fits to parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) form an essential part of particle physics calculations. Currently, the most precise predictions for these non-perturbative functions are generated through fits to global data. A problem that several PDF fitting groups encounter is the presence of tension in data sets that appear to pull the fits in different directions. In other words, the best fit depends on the choice of data set. Several methods to capture the uncertainty in PDFs in presence of seemingly inconsistent fits have been proposed and are currently in use. These methods are important to ensure that uncertainty in PDFs are not underestimated. Here we propose a novel method for estimating the uncertainty by introducing a generalized statistical model inspired by unsupervised machine learning techniques, namely the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Using a toy model of PDFs, we demonstrate how the GMM can be used to faithfully reconstruct the likelihood associated with PDF fits, which can in turn be used to accurately determine the uncertainty on PDFs, especially in presence of tension in the fitted data sets. We further show how this statistical model reduces to the usual chi-squared likelihood function for a consistent data set and provide measures to optimize the number of Gaussians in the GMM.</description>

      <title>New insights into axion freeze-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Freeze-in via the axion-photon coupling, $g_{\phi\gamma}$, can produce axions in the early Universe. At low reheating temperatures close to the minimum allowed value $T_{\rm reh}\approx T_{\rm BBN}\approx 10\,{\rm MeV}$, the abundance peaks for axion masses $m_\phi\approx T_{\rm reh}$. Such heavy axions are unstable and subsequently decay, leading to strong constraints on $g_{\phi\gamma}$ from astrophysics and cosmology. In this work, we revisit the computation of the freeze-in abundance and clarify important issues. We begin with a complete computation of the collision terms for the Primakoff process, electron-positron annihilation, and photon-to-axion (inverse-)decay, while approximately taking into account plasma screening and threshold effects. We then solve the Boltzmann equation for the full axion distribution function. We confirm previous results about the importance of both processes to the effective "relic abundance" (defined as density prior to decay), and provide useful fitting formulae to estimate the freeze-in abundance from the equilibrium interaction rate. For the distribution function, we find an out-of-equilibrium population of axions and introduce an effective temperature for them. We follow the evolution right up until decay, and find that the average axion kinetic energy is larger than a thermal relic by between 20\% and 80\%, which may have implications for limits on decaying axions from X-ray spectra. We extend our study to a two-axion system with quartic cross-coupling, and find that for typical/expected couplings, freeze-in of a second axion flavour by annihilations leads to a negligibly small contribution to the relic density.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory of $\text{SO}(2N)\rightarrow \text{SO}(N) \times \text{SO}(N)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and study the relativistic Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the $\text{SO}(2N)$ real symmetric second-rank tensor order parameter coupled to $N_f$ flavors of $4N$-component Majorana fermions in 2+1 dimensions. Such a tensor order parameter unifies all Lorentz-invariant mass-gap orders for $N$ two-component Dirac fermions in two dimensions except for the $\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet anomalous quantum Hall state. The value $N_f=1$ corresponds to the canonical Gross-Neveu model. Within the leading-order $\epsilon$-expansion around the upper critical dimension of $3+1$ the field theory exhibits a critical fixed point in its renormalization group flow which describes spontaneous symmetry breaking to $\text{SO}(N)\times \text{SO}(N)$ for the number of flavors of Majorana fermions higher than a critical value $N_{f,c2}\approx 2N$. For $N_{f, c1}&lt; N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ , with $N_{f,c1} \approx 1.080 N$ the critical fixed point resides in the unstable region of the theory where the effective potential is unbounded from below, whereas for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c1}$ there is no real critical fixed point, and the flow runs away. In either case, for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ the transition should become fluctuation-induced first-order, and we discuss the dependence of its size on the parameters in the theory. One-loop critical exponents for the new universality class at $N_{f, c2}&lt; N_f $ are computed and the flow diagram in various regimes is discussed.</description>

      <title>Solving the strong CP problem without axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate general conditions under which the strong CP problem is solved by spontaneous CP violation. Quark-mass matrix elements are polynomials in the CP-breaking order parameters, engineered such that their determinant is a real constant. This scheme permits only a limited number of textures. These conditions can be realized in supersymmetric theories with CP as an anomaly-free local flavour symmetry, suggesting a unified solution to the strong CP problem and the flavour puzzle. Our solution can be implemented using either modular invariance or a local U(1) symmetry. We present modular-invariant realizations where matter fields are assigned small modular weights $\pm2$ ($\pm1$), utilising higher levels $N=2$ ($N=3$). Heavy quarks are in general not required, but their presence allows for models where colored particles fill non-singlet representations of the flavour group.</description>

      <title>Ringdown stability: greybody factors as stable gravitational-wave observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasinormal mode spectrum of black holes plays a crucial role in the modelling of post-merger ringdown signals. However, the spectrum is extremely sensitive to small deformations of the system and describes the linear response only in a certain (not precisely defined) timeframe after the merger. We argue here that the greybody factors, recently shown to describe the ringdown spectral amplitude at relatively high frequencies, are instead stable under small perturbations of the system and free of certain ambiguities that plague the quasinormal mode spectrum. Our analysis also unveils a nontrivial interplay: while certain ringdown quantities are dominated by the contribution of spectrally unstable quasinormal modes, these modes conspire to produce stable observables. Thus, we propose a complementary approach to ringdown studies, which circumvents some limitations of the standard quasinormal mode description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This dissertation reviews several recent advances at the intersection of quantum information and holography. In holography, properties of quantum systems admit a gravitational interpretation via the AdS/CFT correspondence. For holographic states, boundary entanglement entropy is dual to bulk geodesic areas, known as Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces. Furthermore, the viability to possess a holographic dual at all is constrained by entanglement structure. Accordingly, entanglement enables a coarse classification of states in a Hilbert space. Similarly, state transformation under operator groups also provides a classification on the Hilbert space. Stabilizer states, for example, are invariant under large sets of operations and consequently can be simulated on a classical computer. Cayley graphs offer a useful representation for a group of operators, where vertices represent group elements and edges represent generators. The orbit of a state under action of the group can also be represented as a "reachability graph", a quotient of the group Cayley graph. Reachability graphs can be dressed to encode entanglement information, making them a useful tool for studying entanglement dynamics. Quotienting a reachability graph by group elements that fix a state computable, e.g. entanglement entropy, builds a "contracted graph". Contracted graphs explicitly bound state parameter evolution in quantum circuits. In this thesis, an upper bound on entanglement entropy evolution in Clifford circuits is presented. Another important property of quantum systems is magic, which quantifies the difficulty of simulating a quantum state. Magic and entanglement play complementary roles when describing emergent phenomena in AdS/CFT. This work describes the interplay of entanglement and magic, offering holographic consequences for magic as cosmic brane back-reaction.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Anarchy from Flavor Deconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flavor deconstruction refers to non-universal gauge extensions where the original gauge symmetry is deconstructed into separate copies, one for each family. A hierarchical chain of symmetry breaking provides an attractive low-scale solution to the flavor puzzle, consistent with flavor-changing neutral currents and finite naturalness. Although successful in explaining the origin of flavor hierarchies in the quark and charged lepton sectors, existing models have struggled with the large and seemingly anarchic mixing observed in neutrino oscillations. This letter identifies conditions under which neutrino anarchy may arise from flavor deconstruction in generic models with right-handed neutrinos. When deconstruction is applied to carefully chosen subgroups of the extended gauge symmetry, hierarchies in the seesaw formula cancel out.</description>

      <title>Spectral Flow for the Riemann zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, with Mussardo we defined a quantum mechanical problem of a single particle scattering with impurities wherein the quantized energy levels $E_n (\sigma)$ are exactly equal to the zeros of the Riemann $\zeta (s)$ where $\sigma = \Re (s)$ in the limit $\sigma \to 1/2$. The S-matrix is based on the Euler product and is unitary by construction, thus the underlying hamiltonian is hermitian and all eigenvalues must be real. Motivated by the Hilbert-P\'olya idea we study the spectral flows for $\{ E_n (\sigma) \}$. This leads to a simple criterion for the validity of the Riemann Hypothesis. The spectral flow arguments are simple enough that we present analogous results for the Generalized and Grand Riemann Hypotheses. We also illustrate our results for a counter example where the Riemann Hypothesis is violated since there is no underlying unitary S-matrix due to the lack of an Euler product.</description>

      <title>The Common Solution Space of General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the solution space for the field equations of Einstein's General Relativity for various static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. We consider the vacuum case, represented by the Schwarzschild black hole; the de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry, which includes a cosmological constant; the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m geometry, which accounts for the presence of charge. Additionally we consider the homogenenous and anisotropic locally rotational Bianchi II spacetime in the vacuum. Our analysis reveals that the field equations for these scenarios share a common three-dimensional group of point transformations, with the generators being the elements of the $D\otimes_{s}T_{2}$ Lie algebra, known as the semidirect product of dilations and translations in the plane. Due to this algebraic property the field equations for the aforementioned gravitational models can be expressed in the equivalent form of the null geodesic equations for conformally flat geometries. Consequently, the solution space for the field equations is common, and it is the solution space for the free particle in a flat space. This appoach open new directions on the construction of analytic solutions in gravitational physics and cosmology.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the compatibility of biased domain wall scenarios with current gravitational wave data. We show that the Cosmic Microwave Background bounds on the fractional density of gravitational waves at the time of decoupling may only slightly improve on the constraints that result from requiring that domain walls never dominate the cosmic energy budget. We show that, despite this, the range of energy scales of the domain-wall forming phase transitions are already quite constricted, even if the networks decay early in cosmological history. We also show that, if domain walls are to provide an explanation to the stochastic gravitational wave background that was recently detected by pulsar timing arrays, they not only have to decay early in the radiation dominated era but also their energy density would have to be close to dominating the energy density of the universe, which would require some fine tuning of the parameters of the models.</description>

      <title>Primordial gravitational wave backgrounds from phase transitions with next generation ground based detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Third generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will operate in the $(\text{few}-10^4)$ Hz frequency band, with a boost in sensitivity providing an unprecedented reach into primordial cosmology. Working concurrently with pulsar timing arrays in the nHz band, and LISA in the mHz band, these 3G detectors will be powerful probes of beyond the standard model particle physics on scales $T\gtrsim 10^{7}$GeV. Here we focus on their ability to probe phase transitions (PTs) in the early universe. We first overview the landscape of detectors across frequencies, discuss the relevance of astrophysical foregrounds, and provide convenient and up-to-date power-law integrated sensitivity curves for these detectors. We then present the constraints expected from GW observations on first order PTs and on topological defects (strings and domain walls), which may be formed when a symmetry is broken irrespective of the order of the phase transition. These constraints can then be applied to specific models leading to first order PTs and/or topological defects. In particular we discuss the implications for axion models, which solve the strong CP problem by introducing a spontaneously broken Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry. For post-inflationary breaking, the PQ scale must lie in the $10^{8}-10^{11}$ GeV range, and so the signal from a first order PQ PT falls within reach of ground based 3G detectors. A scan in parameter space of signal-to-noise ratio in a representative model reveals their large potential to probe the nature of the PQ transition. Additionally, in heavy axion type models domain walls form, which can lead to a detectable GW background. We discuss their spectrum and summarise the expected constraints on these models from 3G detectors, together with SKA and LISA.</description>

      <title>Piecewise linear potentials for false vacuum decay and negative modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bounce solutions and associated negative modes in the class of piecewise linear triangular-shaped potentials that may be viewed as approximations of smooth potentials. In these simple potentials, the bounce solution and action can be obtained analytically for a general spacetime dimension $D$. The eigenequations for the fluctuations around the bounce are universal and have the form of a Schr\"odinger-like equation with delta-function potentials. This Schr\"odinger equation is solved exactly for the negative modes whose number is confirmed to be one. The latter result may justify the usefulness of such piecewise linear potentials in the study of false vacuum decay.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian tails without stochastic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show, both analytically and numerically, that non-Gaussian tails in the probability density function of curvature perturbations arise in ultra-slow-roll inflation from the $\delta N$ formalism, without invoking stochastic inflation. Previously reported discrepancies between both approaches are a consequence of not correctly accounting for momentum perturbations. Once they are taken into account, both approaches agree to an excellent degree. The shape of the tail depends strongly on the phase space of inflation.</description>

Abstract: We compute amplitudes for the process $g^* g^* \to q \overline q V^*$ (two virtual gluons into a quark, antiquark and a boson) at the tree level using the spinor-helicity formalism. The resulting analytic expressions are much shorter than squared amplitudes obtained using trace methods. Our results can be used to expedite numerical calculations in phenomenological studies of the Drell-Yan process in high energy factorization framework.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Non-circular Deviation from the Kerr Paradigm and Its Observational Signatures: Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals and Lense-Thirring Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent gravitational wave observations and shadow imaging have demonstrated the astonishing consistency of the Kerr paradigm despite all the special symmetries assumed in deriving the Kerr metric. Hence, it is crucial to test the presence of these symmetries in astrophysical scenarios and constraint possible deviations from them, especially in strong field regimes. With this motivation, the present work aims to investigate the theoretical consequences and observational signatures of non-circularity in a unified theory-agnostic manner. For this purpose, we construct a general non-circular metric with a small parameterized deviation from Kerr. This metric preserves all the other properties of Kerr, such as stationarity, axisymmetry, geodesic separability and asymptotic flatness. Apart from the resulting mathematical simplifications, this assumption is crucial to disentangle the consequences of relaxing circularity from other symmetries. Then, after discussing various novel mathematical properties and interesting theoretical consequences, we perform a detailed analysis of extreme mass ratio inspirals and Lense-Thirring precession in the context of this newly constructed metric. Our study clearly shows the promising prospects of detecting and constraining even a slight non-circular deviation from the Kerr paradigm using the future gravitational wave observations by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.</description>

      <title>Toeplitz non-liquids and Toeplitz braiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of $3$D non-liquid states called ``Toeplitz non-liquids''. These states consist of a stack of $2$D twisted $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topologically ordered layers along the $z$-direction; nearby layers are coupled while keeping translational symmetry along $z$. The effective field theory is described by infinite Chern-Simons (iCS) theory, with a coefficient matrix called ``$K$-matrix'' that is of block-tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix-type. With open boundary conditions (OBC) along the $z$-direction, certain $K$-matrices exhibit an exotic phenomenon called ``Toeplitz braiding'', where the mutual braiding statistical phase between two anyons at opposite boundaries oscillates and remains non-zero in the thermodynamic limit. As a necessary condition, this requires boundary zero modes in the $K$-matrix spectrum under OBC. A key example is the $K$-matrix resembling the Hamiltonian of the $1$D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger insulator. Since the gauge invariance of Chern-Simons theory guarantees integer quantized entries for $K$-matrices, no usual global symmetries are needed to protect these zero modes or Toeplitz braiding. In order to obtain the general theory, we categorize $K$-matrices that support Toeplitz braiding into three types and analyze the conditions for each. We further numerically study the analytical results for all types of $K$-matrices. For comparison, a trivial case is numerically shown, where the mutual statistical phase angle decays exponentially to zero in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formalism of non-holomorphic modular flavor symmetry is developed, and the Yukawa couplings are level $N$ polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms satisfying the Laplacian condition. We find that the integer (even) weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms of level $N$ can be decomposed into multiplets of the finite modular group $\Gamma'_N$ ($\Gamma_N$). The original modular invariance approach is extended by the presence of negative weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms. The non-holomorphic modular flavor symmetry can be consistently combined with the generalized CP symmetry. We present three example models for lepton sector based on the $\Gamma_3\cong A_4$ modular symmetry, the charged lepton masses and the neutrino oscillation data can be accommodated very well, and the predictions for the leptonic CP violation phases and the effective Majorana neutrino mass are studied.</description>

      <title>Hybrid inflation and gravitational waves from accidentally light scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a hybrid-inflation model where the inflaton potential is generated radiatively, as gauge symmetries guarantee it to be accidentally flat at tree level. The model can be regarded as a small-field version of Natural Inflation, with inflation ending when the mass of a second scalar, the waterfall field, turns tachyonic. This provides a minimal, robust realisation of hybrid inflation, which predicts specific correlations among CMB observables. Tachyonic preheating leads to the production of gravitational waves which, for a low inflationary scale, might be detected by upcoming experiments. Simple variations of the model can give rise to topological defects, such as unstable domain walls. Their dynamics produces a stochastic gravitational-wave background, which can be compatible with the recent detection by pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Learning to grok: Emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in modular arithmetic tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models can solve tasks that were not present in the training set. This capability is believed to be due to in-context learning and skill composition. In this work, we study the emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in a collection of modular arithmetic tasks. Specifically, we consider a finite collection of linear modular functions $z = a \, x + b \, y \;\mathrm{mod}\; p$ labeled by the vector $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}_p^2$. We use some of these tasks for pre-training and the rest for out-of-distribution testing. We empirically show that a GPT-style transformer exhibits a transition from in-distribution to out-of-distribution generalization as the number of pre-training tasks increases. We find that the smallest model capable of out-of-distribution generalization requires two transformer blocks, while for deeper models, the out-of-distribution generalization phase is \emph{transient}, necessitating early stopping. Finally, we perform an interpretability study of the pre-trained models, revealing the highly structured representations in both phases; and discuss the learnt algorithm.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze a large class of effective Yang-Mills-Higgs models constructed in terms of adjoint scalars. In particular, we reproduce asymptotic properties of the confining string, suggested by lattice simulations of $SU(N)$ pure Yang-Mills theory, in models that are stable in the whole range of Higgs-field mass parameters. These properties include $N$-ality, Abelian-like flux-tube profiles, independence of the profiles with the $N$-ality of the quark representation, and Casimir scaling. We find that although these models are formulated in terms of many fields and possible Higgs potentials, a collective behavior can be established in a large region of parameter space, where the desired asymptotic behavior is realized.</description>

Abstract: We study real-time correlators for $N=4$ super Yang Mill fields coupled to a pair of entangled quarks using holography, in the setup that energy quanta sent from one quark perturb the quantum state of the fields and affect the other quark. We make the connection with the ER=EPR conjecture by considering the situation when two quarks are uniformly accelerating opposite to each other. The dynamics of quarks, in the gravity dual, is described by the string worldsheet theory, which in this case has the induced metric describing a two-sided AdS black hole, or a wormhole. Energy quanta sent by one of the quarks produce the shock wave on the worldsheet. We find the effect of shock wave on the boundary field correlators and we discuss the consequence for the ER=EPR conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Berry connections for supersymmetric ground states of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ GLSMs quantised on a circle, which are generalised periodic monopoles. Periodic monopole solutions may be encoded into difference modules, as shown by Mochizuki, or into an alternative algebraic construction given in terms of vector bundles endowed with filtrations. By studying the ground states in terms of a one-parameter family of supercharges, we relate these two different kinds of spectral data to the physics of the GLSMs. From the difference modules we derive novel difference equations for brane amplitudes, which in the conformal limit yield novel difference equations for hemisphere or vortex partition functions. When the GLSM flows to a nonlinear sigma model with K\"ahler target $X$, we show that the two kinds of spectral data are related to different (generalised) cohomology theories: the difference modules are related to the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$, whereas the vector bundles with filtrations are related to its equivariant K-theory.</description>

Abstract: The chiral algebra of a 4D $N\geq2$ superconformal field theory is a vertex operator algebra generated by the Schur subsector of the 4D theory and its rigid (yet rich) structure has been useful in constraining and classifying 4D N=2 SCFTs. We study how the chiral algebra arises from the worldsheet perspective. In the worldsheet CFT dual of 4D N=4 SYM at the free point, we extract the subsector that corresponds to the spacetime Schur operators at generic coupling, and show how they generate the chiral algebra. The result can be easily generalized to 4D N=2 superconformal field theories that arise as orbifolds of 4D N=4 SYM.</description>

Abstract: We study a nearly critical superfluid system from two complementary approaches. Within the first approach, we formulate a Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory (EFT) for the system when it is located slightly above the critical temperature. . The set of symmetries, particularly the dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) symmetry and chemical shift symmetry, strictly constrains the form of EFT action. Within the second approach, using the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh technique, we derive the effective action for a ``microscopic'' holographic superfluid, confirming the EFT construction. A systematic inclusion of non-Gaussianity is one highlight of present study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying complexity in quantum systems has witnessed a surge of interest in recent years, with Krylov-based measures such as Krylov complexity ($C_K$) and Spread complexity ($C_S$) gaining prominence. In this study, we investigate their interplay by considering the complexity of states represented by density matrix operators. After setting up the problem, we analyze a handful of analytical and numerical examples spanning generic two-dimensional Hilbert spaces, qubit states, quantum harmonic oscillators, and random matrix theories, uncovering insightful relationships. For generic pure states, our analysis reveals two key findings: (I) a correspondence between moment-generating functions (of Lanczos coefficients) and survival amplitudes, and (II) an early-time equivalence between $C_K$ and $2C_S$. Furthermore, for maximally entangled pure states, we find that the moment-generating function of $C_K$ becomes the Spectral Form Factor and, at late-times, $C_K$ is simply related to $NC_S$ for $N\geq2$ within the $N$-dimensional Hilbert space. Notably, we confirm that $C_K = 2C_S$ holds across all times when $N=2$. Through the lens of random matrix theories, we also discuss deviations between complexities at intermediate times and highlight subtleties in the averaging approach at the level of the survival amplitude.</description>

Abstract: Various observables in different four-dimensional superconformal Yang-Mills theories can be computed exactly as Fredholm determinants of truncated Bessel operators. We exploit this relation to determine their dependence on the 't Hooft coupling constant. Unlike the weak coupling expansion, which has a finite radius of convergence, the strong coupling expansion is factorially divergent, necessitating the inclusion of nonperturbative, exponentially small corrections. We develop a method to systematically compute these corrections and discuss the resurgent properties of the resulting transseries.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical Cobordism provides a powerful method to probe infinite distance limits in moduli/field spaces parameterized by scalars constrained by generic potentials, employing configurations of codimension-1 end of the world (ETW) branes. These branes, characterized in terms of critical exponents, mark codimension-1 boundaries in the spacetime in correspondence of finite spacetime distance singularities at which the scalars diverge. Using these tools, we explore the network of infinite distance singularities in the complex structure moduli space of Calabi-Yau fourfolds compactifications in M-theory with a four-form flux turned on, which is described in terms of normal intersecting divisors classified by asymptotic Hodge theory. We provide spacetime realizations for these loci in terms of networks of intersecting codimension-1 ETW branes classified by specific critical exponents which encapsulate the relevant information of the asymptotic Hodge structure characterizing the corresponding divisors.</description>

Abstract: Gauge theory compactified on an orbifold is defined by gauge symmetry, matter contents, and boundary conditions. There are equivalence classes (ECs), each of which consists of physically equivalent boundary conditions. We propose the powerful necessary conditions, trace conservation laws (TCLs), which achieve a sufficient classification of ECs in U(N) and SU(N) gauge theories on $T^2/Z_m$ orbifolds $(m=2,3,4,6)$. The TCLs yield the equivalent relations between the diagonal boundary conditions without relying on an explicit form of gauge transformations. The TCLs also show the existence of off-diagonal ECs, which consist only of off-diagonal matrices, on $T^2/Z_4$ and $T^2/Z_6$. After the sufficient classification, the exact numbers of ECs are obtained.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we evaluate the averages of conserved densities and currents associated to charges of generic spin in (1+1)-dimensional massive integrable Quantum Field Theories perturbed by the irrelevant $\mathrm{T\bar{T}}$ operator. By making use of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz approach and of the theory of Generalised Hydrodynamics, we study the non-equilibrium steady state averages of conserved densities and currents in a partitioning protocol. We show that in particular limits, averages can be evaluated exactly in terms of quantities known from the unperturbed theory. In the massless limit we recover known results for the energy and momentum currents and generalise those to any higher spin conserved quantities. We extend some of our results to perturbations of the generalised $\mathrm{T\bar{T}}$ type. For the massive free fermion theory, we find an analytic expression for the effective inverse temperature after at $\mathrm{T\bar{T}}$ perturbation in terms of the bare inverse temperature by making use of Lambert's $W$ function.</description>

      <title>On the Virasoro fusion and modular kernels at any irrational central charge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a series representation for the Virasoro fusion and modular kernels at any irrational central charge. Two distinct, yet closely related formulas are needed for the cases $c\in \mathbb C \backslash (-\infty,1]$ and $c &lt;1$. We also conjecture that the formulas have a well-defined limit as the central charge approaches rational values. Our proposal for $c &lt;1$ agrees numerically with the fusion transformation of the four-point spherical conformal blocks, whereas our proposal for $c\in \mathbb C \backslash (-\infty,1]$ agrees numerically with Ponsot and Teschner's integral formula for the fusion kernel. The case of the modular kernel is studied as a special case of the fusion kernel.</description>

      <title>The Poincar\'e and BMS flux-balance laws with application to binary systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.03164v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymptotically flat spacetimes admit both supertranslations and Lorentz transformations as asymptotic symmetries. Furthermore, they admit super-Lorentz transformations, namely superrotations and superboosts, as outer symmetries associated with super-angular momentum and super-center-of-mass charges. In this paper, we present comprehensively the flux-balance laws for all such BMS charges. We distinguish the Poincar\'e flux-balance laws from the proper BMS flux-balance laws associated with the three relevant memory effects defined from the shear, namely, the displacement, spin and center-of-mass memory effects. We scrutinize the prescriptions used to define the angular momentum and center-of-mass. In addition, we provide the exact form of all Poincar\'e and proper BMS flux-balance laws in terms of radiative symmetric tracefree multipoles. Fluxes of energy, angular momentum and octupole super-angular momentum arise at 2.5PN, fluxes of quadrupole supermomentum arise at 3PN and fluxes of momentum, center-of-mass and octupole super-center-of-mass arise at 3.5PN. We also show that the BMS flux-balance laws lead to integro-differential consistency constraints on the radiation-reaction forces acting on the sources. Finally, we derive the exact form of all BMS charges for both an initial Kerr binary and a final Kerr black hole in an arbitrary Lorentz and supertranslation frame, which allows to derive exact constraints on gravitational waveforms produced by binary black hole mergers from each BMS flux-balance law.</description>

      <title>Parity asymmetry of primordial scalar and tensor power spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03928v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is largely understood to be homogeneous and isotropic, the CMB power presents anomalies that seem to break down parity symmetry at large angular scales. We argue that the primordial scalar and tensor power spectra can be parity asymmetric by considering the existence of two distinct power spectra in the two parity conjugate regions of the CMB sky without introducing any additional parameters. We impose a superselection rule to the vacuum structure for (single field) inflationary quantum fluctuations based on discrete spacetime transformations ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$). As a result, we estimate the amplitude of power asymmetry in the scalar and tensor sectors at different scales of $ 10^{-4} {\rm Mpc^{-1}}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{-3}{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. In particular, we predict the parity asymmetry for the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) and quantify it for different models, like Starobinsky and $\alpha-$attractors single-field inflation.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Casimir effect of magnons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. The key concepts of quantum mechanics are quantum fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations of quantum fields confined in a finite-size system induce the zero-point energy shift. This quantum phenomenon, the Casimir effect, is one of the most striking phenomena of quantum mechanics in the sense that there are no classical analogs and has been attracting much attention beyond the hierarchy of energy scales, ranging from elementary particle physics to condensed matter physics, together with photonics. However, the non-Hermitian extension of the Casimir effect and the application to spintronics have not yet been investigated enough, although exploring energy sources and developing energy-efficient nanodevices are its central issues. Here we fill this gap. By developing a magnonic analog of the Casimir effect into non-Hermitian systems, we show that this non-Hermitian Casimir effect of magnons is enhanced as the Gilbert damping constant (i.e., the energy dissipation rate) increases. When the damping constant exceeds a critical value, the non-Hermitian Casimir effect of magnons exhibits an oscillating behavior, including a beating one, as a function of the film thickness and is characterized by the exceptional point. Our result suggests that energy dissipation serves as a key ingredient of Casimir engineering.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the bulk-boundary and restricted phase space (RPS) thermodynamics of Rissner-Nordstr\"om (R-N) AdS and 6-dimensional charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes. Also, we examine the topological characteristics of the considered black holes and compare them with the extended thermodynamics results. In fact, we have found that the topological behavior of the bulk-boundary thermodynamics is the same as that of the extended thermodynamics, whereas the RPS thermodynamics exhibits a distinct behavior. We also demonstrate that within the RPS formalism, there is only one critical point with a topological charge of +1 $(Q_t=+1)$. Additionally, for RPS formalism, the inclusion of higher derivative curvature terms in the form of Gauss-Bonnet gravity does not alter the topological classification of critical points in charged AdS black holes.</description>

      <title>Binary mergers in strong gravity background of Kerr black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers can take place close to a supermassive black hole (SMBH) while being in a bound orbit around the SMBH. In this paper, we study such bound triple systems and show that including the strong gravity effects of describing the SMBH with a Kerr metric can significantly modify the dynamics, as compared to a Newtonian point particle description of the SMBH. We extract the dynamics of the system, using a quadrupole approximation to the tidal forces due to the SMBH. We exhibit how the gyroscope precession is built into this dynamics, and find the secular Hamiltonian by both averaging over the inner and outer orbits, the latter being the orbit of the BBH around the SMBH. We study the long-time-scale dynamics, including the periastron precession and GW radiation-reaction of the binary system, finding that the strong gravity effects of the SMBH can enhance the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism, resulting in more cycles, higher maximum eccentricity, and thereby a shorter merger time, particularly when the binary is close to, or at, the innermost stable orbit of the SMBH. We end with an analysis of the peak frequency of the GW emission from the binary system, highlighting possible observable signatures in the LISA and ET frequency bands.</description>

      <title>From QFT to Boltzmann: Freeze-in in the presence of oscillating condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar dark matter (DM), and axions in particular, have an irreducible abundance of particles produced by freeze-in due to portal interactions with the Standard Model plasma in the early Universe. In addition, vacuum misalignment and other mechanisms can lead to the presence of a cold, oscillating condensate. Therefore, generically, the evolution of the DM in both forms, condensate and particles, needs to be studied simultaneously. In non-equilibrium quantum field theory, the condensate and particles are described by one- and two-point functions, respectively. The fundamental coupled equations of motion (EoMs) of these objects are non-local. To simplify the EoMs and bring them into a familiar form for relic abundance calculations, we perform a Markovianization process for a quasi-harmonically oscillating homogeneous condensate, leading to local EoMs for the particle distribution function and the envelope function of condensate oscillation. This reduces the dynamics to a pair of coupled Boltzmann equations, and we derive explicitly the form of the collision operators for all particle and condensate interactions.</description>

      <title>The harmonic oscillator on the Moyal-Groenewold plane: an approach via Lie groups and twisted Weyl tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06143v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the functional calculus of the harmonic oscillator on each Moyal-Groenewold plane, the noncommutative phase space which is a fundamental object in quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show that the harmonic oscillator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\omega)$ functional calculus for any angle $0 &lt; \omega &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$ and even a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus on the associated noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces, where $\Sigma_\omega=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt;\omega \}$. To achieve these results, we develop a connection with the theory of 2-step nilpotent Lie groups by introducing a notion of twisted Weyl tuple and connecting it to some semigroups of operators previously investigated by Robinson via group representations. Along the way, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{L}^p$-square-max decompositions lead to new insights between noncommutative ergodic theory and $R$-boundedness, and we prove a twisted transference principle, which is of independent interest. Our approach accommodate the presence of a constant magnetic field and they are indeed new even in the framework of magnetic Weyl calculus on classical $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. Our results contribute to the understanding of functional calculi on noncommutative spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the most basic evolution equations associated to the harmonic oscillator.</description>

Abstract: Using first-principle numerical simulations, we find a new spatially inhomogeneous phase in rigidly rotating $N_c = 3$ gluon plasma. This mixed phase simultaneously possesses both confining and deconfining phases in thermal equilibrium. Unexpectedly, the local critical temperature of the phase transition at the rotation axis does not depend on the angular frequency within a few percent accuracy. Even more surprisingly, an analytic continuation of our results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates a profound breaking of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law in the vicinity of the phase transition, with the confining (deconfining) phase appearing far (near) the rotation axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the counterintuitive possibility of extracting entangled quantum states from a reference state of an auxiliary system (the "embezzler") via local quantum operations while hardly perturbing the latter. We uncover a deep connection between the operational task of embezzling entanglement and the mathematical classification of von Neumann algebras. Our result implies that relativistic quantum fields are universal embezzlers: Any entangled state of any dimension can be embezzled from them with arbitrary precision. This provides an operational characterization of the infinite amount of entanglement present in the vacuum state of relativistic quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Embezzlement of entanglement, quantum fields, and the classification of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum information theoretic task of embezzlement of entanglement in the setting of von Neumann algebras. Given a shared entangled resource state, this task asks to produce arbitrary entangled states using local operations without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. We quantify the performance of a given resource state by the worst-case error. States for which the latter vanishes are 'embezzling states' as they allow to embezzle arbitrary entangled states with arbitrarily small error. The best and worst performance among all states defines two algebraic invariants for von Neumann algebras. The first invariant takes only two values. Either it vanishes and embezzling states exist, which can only happen in type III, or no state allows for nontrivial embezzlement. In the case of factors not of finite type I, the second invariant equals the diameter of the state space. This provides a quantitative operational interpretation of Connes' classification of type III factors within quantum information theory. Type III$_1$ factors are 'universal embezzlers' where every state is embezzling. Our findings have implications for relativistic quantum field theory, where type III algebras naturally appear. For instance, they explain the maximal violation of Bell inequalities in the vacuum. Our results follow from a one-to-one correspondence between embezzling states and invariant probability measures on the flow of weights. We also establish that universally embezzling ITPFI factors are of type III$_1$ by elementary arguments.</description>

      <title>Interplay Between Neutrino Kicks and Hydrodynamic Kicks of Neutron Stars and Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are observed with high space velocities and elliptical orbits in binaries. The magnitude of these effects points to natal kicks that originate from asymmetries during the supernova (SN) explosions. Using a growing set of long-time 3D SN simulations with the Prometheus-Vertex code, we explore the interplay of NS kicks that are induced by asymmetric neutrino emission and by asymmetric mass ejection. Anisotropic neutrino emission can arise from a large-amplitude dipolar convection asymmetry inside the proto-NS (PNS) termed LESA (Lepton-number Emission Self-sustained Asymmetry) and from aspherical accretion downflows around the PNS, which can lead to anisotropic neutrino emission (absorption) with a neutrino-induced NS kick roughly opposite to (aligned with) the kick by asymmetric mass ejection. In massive progenitors hydrodynamic kicks can reach up to more than 1300 km/s, whereas our calculated neutrino kicks reach (55-140) km/s (estimated upper bounds of (170-265) km/s) and only about (10-50) km/s, if LESA is the main cause of asymmetric neutrino emission. Therefore hydrodynamic NS kicks dominate in explosions of high-mass progenitors, whereas LESA-induced neutrino kicks dominate for NSs born in low-energy SNe of the lowest-mass progenitors, when these explode nearly spherically. Our models suggest that the Crab pulsar with its velocity of about 160 km/s, if born in the low-energy explosion of a low-mass, single-star progenitor, should have received a hydrodynamic kick in a considerably asymmetric explosion. Black holes, if formed by the collapse of short-lived PNSs and solely kicked by anisotropic neutrino emission, obtain velocities of only some km/s.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum criticality of nodal $d$-wave superconductivity, N\'eel order, and charge order on the square lattice at half-filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09502v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a SU(2) lattice gauge theory on the square lattice, with a single fundamental complex fermion and a single fundamental complex boson on each lattice site. Projective symmetries of the gauge-charged fermions are chosen so that they match with those of the spinons of the $\pi$-flux spin liquid. Global symmetries of all gauge-invariant observables are chosen to match with those of the particle-hole symmetric electronic Hubbard model at half-filling. Consequently, both the fundamental fermion and fundamental boson move in an average background $\pi$-flux, their gauge-invariant composite is the physical electron, and eliminating gauge fields in a strong gauge-coupling expansion yields an effective extended Hubbard model for the electrons. The SU(2) gauge theory displays several confining/Higgs phases: a nodal $d$-wave superconductor, and states with N\'eel, valence-bond solid, charge, or staggered current orders. There are also a number of quantum phase transitions between these phases which are very likely described by 2+1 dimensional deconfined conformal gauge theories, and we present large flavor expansions for such theories. These include the phenomenologically attractive case of a transition between a conventional insulator with a charge gap and N\'eel order, and a conventional $d$-wave superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov quasiparticles at 4 nodal points in the Brillouin zone. We also apply our approach to the honeycomb lattice, where we find a bicritical point at the junction of N\'eel, valence bond solid (Kekul\'e), and Dirac semi-metal phases.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in Multi-Metric Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a wide class of black hole solutions to the general theory of ghost free multi-metric gravity in arbitrary spacetime dimension, extending and generalising the known results in 4-dimensional dRGT massive gravity and bigravity. The solutions are split into three generic classes based on whether the metrics can be simultaneously diagonalised - one of which does not exist in dRGT massive gravity nor bigravity, and is only possible when one has more than two interacting metric fields. We also linearise the general multi-metric theory to determine the dynamics of the massive spin-2 modes, including examples where this can be done analytically, and use the linear theory to discuss the stability of the 4-dimensional multi-Schwarzchild and multi-Kerr solutions. We explain how the instabilities that plague these solutions in dRGT massive gravity and bigravity carry across to the general multi-metric theory, touching upon ideas of dimensional deconstruction to make sense of the results.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Solutions in Polynomial Affine Gravity with Torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Polynomial Affine Gravity is an alternative gravitational model, where the interactions are mediated solely by the affine connection, instead of the metric tensor. In this paper, we explore the space of solutions to the field equations when the torsion fields are turned on, in a homogeneous and isotropic (cosmological) scenario. We explore various metric structures that emerge in the space of solutions.</description>

      <title>Optimally scrambling chiral spin-chain with effective black hole geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is currently significant interest in emulating the essential characteristics of black holes, such as their Hawking radiation or their optimal scrambling behavior, using condensed matter models. In this article, we investigate a chiral spin-chain, whose mean field theory effectively captures the behavior of Dirac fermions in the curved spacetime geometry of a black hole. We find that within the region of the chain that describe the interior of the black hole, strong correlations prevail giving rise to many-body chaotic dynamics. Employing out-of-time-order correlations as a diagnostic tool, we numerically compute the associated Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, we observe a linear increase in the Lyapunov exponent with temperature within the black hole's interior at low temperatures, indicative of optimal scrambling behavior. This contrasts with the quadratic temperature dependence exhibited by the spin-chain on the region outside the black hole. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between black hole geometry and quantum chaos, offering insights into fundamental aspects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Updated observational constraints on spatially-flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM and XCDM cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study 6 LCDM models, with 4 allowing for non-flat geometry and 3 allowing for a non-unity lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We also study 6 XCDM models with a dynamical dark energy density X-fluid with equation of state $w$. For the non-flat models we use two different primordial power spectra, Planck $P(q)$ and new $P(q)$. These models are tested against: Planck 2018 CMB power spectra (P18) and lensing potential power spectrum (lensing), and an updated compilation of BAO, SNIa, $H(z)$, and $f\sigma_8$ data [non-CMB data]. P18 data favor closed geometry for the LCDM and XCDM models and $w&lt;-1$ (phantom-like dark energy) for the XCDM models while non-CMB data favor open geometry for the LCDM models and closed geometry and $w&gt;-1$ (quintessence-like dark energy) for the XCDM models. When P18 and non-CMB data are jointly analyzed there is weak evidence for open geometry and moderate evidence for quintessence-like dark energy. Regardless of data used, $A_L&gt;1$ is always favored. The XCDM model constraints obtained from CMB data and from non-CMB data are incompatible, ruling out the 3 $A_L = 1$ XCDM models at $&gt; 3\sigma$. In the 9 models not ruled out, for the P18+lensing+non-CMB data set we find little deviation from flat geometry and moderate deviation from $w=-1$. In all 6 non-flat models (not ruled out), open geometry is mildly favored, and in all 3 XCDM+$A_L$ models (not ruled out) quintessence-like dark energy is moderately favored (by at most $1.6 \sigma$). In the $A_L = 1$ non-flat LCDM cases, we find for P18+lensing+non-CMB data $\Omega_k = 0.0009 \pm 0.0017$ [$0.0008 \pm 0.0017$] for the Planck [new] $P(q)$ model, favoring open geometry. The flat LCDM model remains the simplest (largely) observationally-consistent cosmological model. Our cosmological parameter constraints obtained for the flat LCDM model (and other models) are the most restrictive results to date (Abridged).</description>

      <title>MEET-U Project I: The key drivers of the preference for dynamic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Joint analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurement by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) first data release, Type Ia supernovae (SNe) of the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DES5YR) release and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data favors a quintom-like dynamic dark energy model over the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model at $3.9\sigma$ level (Adame et al. 2024). We demonstrate that the preference for dynamic dark energy does not rely on the detailed modeling of CMB physics and remains at $3.2\sigma$ level when the full CMB likelihood is replaced by a CMB acoustic-oscillation angle ($\theta_\star$) prior and a baryon abundance ($\Omega_bh^2$) prior. By comparing the data with over $10^4$ $\Lambda$CDM-based simulations, we find that both DES5YR SNe and DESI BAO contribute significantly to the preference for dynamic dark energy. The preference for dynamic dark energy is unlikely (probability $\lesssim 0.02$) due to unknown systematics in DES5YR SNe and statistical fluctuations in DESI BAO, or vice versa.</description>

      <title>Compact moduli of Calabi-Yau cones and Sasaki-Einstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct proper moduli algebraic spaces of K-polystable $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano cones (a.k.a. Calabi-Yau cones) or equivalently their links i.e., Sasaki-Einstein manifolds with singularities.
  As a byproduct, it gives alternative algebraic construction of proper K-moduli of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties. In contrast to the previous algebraic proof of its properness ([BHLLX, LXZ]), we do not use the $\delta$-invariants ([FO, BJ]) nor the $L^2$-normalized Donaldson-Futaki invariants. We use the local normalized volume of [Li] and the higher $\Theta$-stable reduction instead.</description>

      <title>Interacting chiral fermions on the lattice with matrix product operator norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Hamiltonian formalism for simulating interacting chiral fermions on the lattice while preserving unitarity and locality and without breaking the chiral symmetry. The fermion doubling problem is circumvented by constructing a Fock space endowed with a semi-definite norm. When projecting our theory on the the single-particle sector, we recover the framework of Stacey fermions, and we demonstrate that the scaling limit of the free model recovers the chiral fermion field. Technically, we make use of a matrix product operator norm to mimick the boundary of a higher dimensional topological theory. As a proof of principle, we consider a single Weyl fermion on a periodic ring with Hubbard-type nearest-neighbor interactions and construct a variational generalized DMRG code to demonstrate that the ground state for large system sizes can be determined efficiently. As our tensor network approach does not exhibit any sign problem, we can add a chemical potential and study real-time evolution.</description>
