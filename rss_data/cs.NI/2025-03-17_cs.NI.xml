      <title>Motor Rotation Speed Estimation based on Magnetic Inductive Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation speed is a key metric for many applications, such as calibrating electric motors in a factory, monitoring a car's engine health, detecting faults in electrical appliances, and more. However, existing measurement techniques have several drawbacks, including the need for line-of-sight visibility, intrusive machine modification, fixed sensor deployment, or short sensing ranges. In this paper, we introduce MagTach, a handheld hardware-software system for rotation speed measurement that leverages electromagnetic field sensing to provide highly accurate and convenient readings.</description>

      <title>Reliable and Cost-Efficient IoT Connectivity for Smart Agriculture: A Comparative Study of LPWAN, 5G, and Hybrid Connectivity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart agriculture has transformed farming practices by enabling real time monitoring, data-driven decision making, and automation. However, ensuring reliable connectivity in diverse agricultural environments remains a critical challenge. This paper analyzes the performance trade offs between Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN), specifically LoRaWAN, NBIoT, and Sigfox and cellular networks (4G and 5G) in agricultural applications. Beyond a comprehensive literature review, this study evaluates hybrid LPWAN and 5G architectures that integrate the strengths of both network types to enhance cost-efficiency and connectivity reliability. Using real-world case studies, the findings demonstrate that hybrid LPWAN and 5G models can reduce connectivity costs by up to 30% while significantly improving network reliability in remote agricultural settings. This work provides actionable recommendations for selecting optimal IoT connectivity solutions based on agricultural requirements and proposes future research directions to further optimize IoT infrastructure in smart farming.</description>

      <title>Optimizing 6G Dense Network Deployment for the Metaverse Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the Metaverse envisions deeply immersive and pervasive connectivity in 6G networks, Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) emerges as a critical enabler to meet the demanding requirements of massive and immersive communications. IAB networks offer a scalable solution for expanding broadband coverage in urban environments. However, optimizing IAB node deployment to ensure reliable coverage while minimizing costs remains challenging due to location constraints and the dynamic nature of cities. Existing heuristic methods, such as Greedy Algorithms, have been employed to address these optimization problems. This work presents a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning ( DRL) approach for IAB network planning, tailored to future 6G scenarios that seek to support ultra-high data rates and dense device connectivity required by immersive Metaverse applications. We utilize Deep Q-Network (DQN) with action elimination and integrate DQN, Double Deep Q-Network ( DDQN), and Dueling DQN architectures to effectively manage large state and action spaces. Simulations with various initial donor configurations demonstrate the effectiveness of our DRL approach, with Dueling DQN reducing node count by an average of 12.3% compared to traditional heuristics. The study underscores how advanced DRL techniques can address complex network planning challenges in 6G-enabled Metaverse contexts, providing an efficient and adaptive solution for IAB deployment in diverse urban environments.</description>

      <title>PassiveBLE: Towards Fully Commodity-Compatible BLE Backscatter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) backscatter is a promising candidate for battery-free Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Unlike existing commodity-level BLE backscatter systems that only enable one-shot communication through BLE advertising packets, we propose PassiveBLE, a backscatter system that can establish authentic and fully compatible BLE connections on data channels. The key enabling techniques include (i) a synchronization circuit that can wake up tags and activate backscatter communications with symbol-level accuracy to facilitate BLE data packet generation; (ii) a distributed coding scheme that offloads the major encoding and processing burdens from tags to the excitation source while achieving high throughput; (iii) a BLE connection scheduler to enable fully compatible BLE connection interactions, including connection establishment, maintenance and termination for multiple backscatter tags. We prototype PassiveBLE tags with off-the-shelf components and also convert the circuits and control logic into ASIC design sketch, whose power consumptions are 491 uW and 9.9 uW, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that PassiveBLE achieves a success rate of over 99.9% in establishing commodity BLE connections. PassiveBLE also achieves commodity-compatible BLE communication with a high goodput of up to 974 kbps in LE 2M PHY mode and 532 kbps in LE 1M PHY mode, which is about 63.3 times higher than the previous commodity-level BLE backscatter system in the same mode.</description>

      <title>Experimental evaluation of xApp Conflict Mitigation Framework in O-RAN: Insights from Testbed deployment in OTIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conflict Mitigation (CM) in Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) is a topic that is gaining importance as commercial O-RAN deployments become more complex. Although research on CM is already covered in terms of simulated network scenarios, it lacks validation using real-world deployment and Over The Air (OTA) Radio Frequency (RF) transmission. Our objective is to conduct the first assessment of the Conflict Mitigation Framework (CMF) for O-RAN using a real-world testbed and OTA RF transmission. This paper presents results of an experiment using a dedicated testbed built in an O-RAN Open Test and Integration Center (OTIC) to confirm the validity of one of the Conflict Resolution (CR) schemes proposed by existing research. The results show that the implemented conflict detection and resolution mechanisms allow a significant improvement in network operation stability by reducing the variability of the measured Downlink (DL) throughput by 78%.</description>

      <title>Scalable Video Conferencing Using SDN Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-conferencing applications face an unwavering surge in traffic, stressing their underlying infrastructure in unprecedented ways. This paper rethinks the key building block for conferencing infrastructures -- selective forwarding units (SFUs). SFUs relay and adapt media streams between participants and, today, run in software on general-purpose servers. Our main insight, discerned from dissecting the operation of production SFU servers, is that SFUs largely mimic traditional packet-processing operations such as dropping and forwarding. Guided by this, we present Scallop, an SDN-inspired SFU that decouples video-conferencing applications into a hardware-based data plane for latency-sensitive and frequent media operations, and a software control plane for the (infrequent) remaining tasks, such as analyzing feedback signals. Our Tofino-based implementation fully supports WebRTC and delivers 7-210 times improved scaling over a 32-core commodity server, while reaping performance improvements by cutting forwarding-induced latency by 26 times.</description>

      <title>Non Line-of-Sight Optical Wireless Communication using Neuromorphic Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic or event cameras, inspired by biological vision systems, capture changes in illumination with high temporal resolution and efficiency, producing streams of events rather than traditional images. In this paper, we explore the use of neuromorphic cameras for passive optical wireless communication (OWC), leveraging their asynchronous detection of illumination changes to decode data transmitted through reflections of light from objects. We propose a novel system that utilizes neuromorphic cameras for passive visible light communication (VLC), extending the concept to Non Line-of-Sight (NLoS) scenarios through passive reflections from everyday objects. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using neuromorphic cameras for VLC, characterizing the performance of various modulation schemes, including traditional On-Off Keying (OOK) and advanced N-pulse modulation. We introduce an adaptive N-pulse modulation scheme that dynamically adjusts encoding based on the packet's bit composition, achieving higher data rates and robustness in different scenarios. Our results show that lighter-colored, glossy objects are better for NLoS communication, while larger objects and those with matte finishes experience higher error rates due to multipath reflections.</description>

      <title>LEACH-RLC: Enhancing IoT Data Transmission with Optimized Clustering and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play a pivotal role in enabling Internet of Things (IoT) devices with sensing and actuation capabilities. Operating in remote and resource-constrained environments, these IoT devices face challenges related to energy consumption, crucial for network longevity. Existing clustering protocols often suffer from high control overhead, inefficient cluster formation, and poor adaptability to dynamic network conditions, leading to suboptimal data transmission and reduced network lifetime. This paper introduces Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy with Reinforcement Learning-based Controller (LEACH-RLC), a novel clustering protocol designed to address these limitations by employing a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach for strategic selection of Cluster Heads (CHs) and node-to-cluster assignments. Additionally, it integrates a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to minimize control overhead by learning optimal timings for generating new clusters. LEACH-RLC aims to balance control overhead reduction without compromising overall network performance. Through extensive simulations, this paper investigates the frequency and opportune moments for generating new clustering solutions. Results demonstrate the superior performance of LEACH-RLC over state-of-the-art protocols, showcasing enhanced network lifetime, reduced average energy consumption, and minimized control overhead. The proposed protocol contributes to advancing the efficiency and adaptability of WSNs, addressing critical challenges in IoT deployments.</description>

      <title>Content-based Wake-up for Energy-efficient and Timely Top-k IoT Sensing Data Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy efficiency and information freshness are key requirements for sensor nodes serving Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications, where a sink node collects informative and fresh data before a deadline, e.g., to control an external actuator. Content-based wake-up (CoWu) activates a subset of nodes that hold data relevant for the sink's goal, thereby offering an energy-efficient way to attain objectives related to information freshness. This paper focuses on a scenario where the sink collects fresh information on top-k values, defined as data from the nodes observing the k highest readings at the deadline. We introduce a new metric called top-k Query Age of Information (k-QAoI), which allows us to characterize the performance of CoWu by considering the characteristics of the physical process. Further, we show how to select the CoWu parameters, such as its timing and threshold, to attain both information freshness and energy efficiency. The numerical results reveal the effectiveness of the CoWu approach, which is able to collect top-k data with higher energy efficiency while reducing k-QAoI when compared to round-robin scheduling, especially when the number of nodes is large and the required size of k is small.</description>
