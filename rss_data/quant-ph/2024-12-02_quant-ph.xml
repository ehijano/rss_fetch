      <title>Towards Supporting QIR: Thoughts on Adopting the Quantum Intermediate Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New records in the number of qubits and the fidelity of quantum computers continue to be set. Additionally, the quantum computing community is eager to leverage this immense computational power. However, to execute an application on hardware, it has to be translated into a sequence of hardware-specific instructions. To this end, intermediate representations play a crucial role in the software stack for a quantum computer to facilitate efficient optimizations. One of those intermediate representations is the Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR), proposed by Microsoft. In this article, we provide food for thought on how QIR can be adopted in different software tools. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches and outline related challenges. Finally, we conclude with an outlook on future directions using QIR.</description>

      <title>Increasing quantum speed limit via non-uniform magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum speed limit (QSL) defines the theoretical upper bound on how fast a quantum system can evolve between states. It imposes a fundamental constraint on the rate of quantum information processing. For a relativistic spin-up electron in a uniform magnetic field, QSL increased with the magnetic field strength till around $10^{15}$ Gauss, before saturating at a saturated QSL (SQSL) of 0.2407c, where c is the speed of light. We show that by using variable magnetic fields, it is possible to surpass this limit, achieving SQSL upto 0.4-0.6c. To attain this quantum phenomenon, we solve the evolution equation of relativistic electron in spatially varying magnetic fields and find that the energies of various electron states become non-degenerate as opposed to the constant magnetic field case. This redistribution of energy is the key ingredient to accomplish higher QSL and, thus, a high information processing speed. We further explore how QSL can serve as a bridge between relativistic and non-relativistic quantum dynamics, providing insights via the Bremermann-Bekenstein bound, a quantity which constrains the maximal rate of information production. We also propose a practical experimental setup to realize these advancements. These results hold immense potential for propelling fields of quantum computation, thermodynamics and metrology.</description>

      <title>Model validation and error attribution for a drifting qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubit performance is often reported in terms of a variety of single-value metrics, each providing a facet of the underlying noise mechanism limiting performance. However, the value of these metrics may drift over long time-scales, and reporting a single number for qubit performance fails to account for the low-frequency noise processes that give rise to this drift. In this work, we demonstrate how we can use the distribution of these values to validate or invalidate candidate noise models. We focus on the case of randomized benchmarking (RB), where typically a single error rate is reported but this error rate can drift over time when multiple passes of RB are performed. We show that using a statistical test as simple as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic on the distribution of RB error rates can be used to rule out noise models, assuming the experiment is performed over a long enough time interval to capture relevant low frequency noise. With confidence in a noise model, we show how care must be exercised when performing error attribution using the distribution of drifting RB error rate.</description>

      <title>Generating non-Clifford gate operations through exact mapping between Majorana fermions and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18736v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana fermions and their generalizations to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ parafermions are considered promising building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers for their ability to encode quantum information nonlocally. In such topological quantum computers, highly robust quantum gates are obtained by braiding pairs of these quasi-particles. However, it is well-known that braiding Majorana fermions or parafermions only leads to a Clifford gate, hindering quantum universality. This paper establishes an exact mapping between Majorana fermions to $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions in systems under total parity non-conserving and total parity conserving setting. It is revealed that braiding of Majorana fermions may lead to non-Clifford quantum gates in the 4-dimensional qudit representation spanned by $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions, whilst braiding of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions may similarly yield non-Clifford quantum gates in the qubit representation spanned by Majorana fermions. This finding suggests that topologically protected universal quantum computing may be possible with Majorana fermions ($\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions) by supplementing the usual braiding operations with the braiding of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions (Majorana fermions) that could be formed out of Majorana fermions ($\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions) via the mapping prescribed here. Finally, the paper discusses how braiding of Majorana fermions or $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions could be obtained via a series of parity measurements.</description>

      <title>Analytic solution to degenerate biphoton states generated in arrays of nonlinear waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveguide arrays are a powerful platform for studying and manipulating quantum states of light. When nonlinearity arises due to a spontaneous parametric down-conversion process, the degree of entanglement can increase, contrary to a linear array, enabling the generation of nonclassical biphoton states -- which are a valuable resource for various quantum technologies. In this work, we employed a supermodes approach to obtain an analytic solution for the evolution of degenerate biphoton states under the undepleted pump approximation. We examined the general features of our solution, including results for small arrays, propagation when only one waveguide is pumped, and the inversion problem of a target output state. Analytic results offer valuable physical insights into the propagation of light in arrays of nonlinear waveguides, and enable the determination of the initial conditions required to achieve a desired quantum state -- for example, the injection pump profile. In general, such calculations can be computationally demanding for large arrays. However, the numerical implementation of the proposed method scales efficiently -- both for the direct, and inverse problems. In future work, our approach could be extended to non-degenerate biphoton states. Also, it could be applied in the study of diffusion regimes, the introduction of disorder, and the development of reliable optimization methods for inverting arbitrary output states.</description>

      <title>Coherent deflection of atomic samples and positional mesoscopic superpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a protocol based on the interplay between superradiance and superabsorption to achieve the coherent deflection of an atomic sample due to the momentum transfer from the atoms to a cavity field. The coherent character of this momentum transfer, causing the atomic sample to deflect as a whole, follows from the collective nature of the atomic superradiant pulse and its superabsorption by the cavity field. The protocol is then used for the construction of positional mesoscopic atomic superpositions.</description>

      <title>Planckian Diffusion: The Ghost of Anderson Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that Anderson localization ceases to exist when a random medium begins to move, but another type of fundamental quantum effect, Planckian diffusion $D = \alpha\hbar/m$, rises to replace it, with $\alpha $ of order of unity. Planckian diffusion supercedes the Planckian speed limit $\tau= \alpha \hbar/k_B T,$ as it not only implies this relation in thermal systems but also applies more generally without requiring thermal equilibrium. Here we model a dynamic disordered system with thousands of itinerant impurities, having random initial positions and velocities. By incrementally increasing their speed from zero, we observe a transition from Anderson localization to Planckian diffusion, with $\alpha$ falling within the range of $0.5$ to $2$. Furthermore, we relate the breakdown of Anderson localization to three additional, distinctly different confirming cases that also exhibit Planckian diffusion $D\sim \hbar/m$, including one experiment on solid hydrogen. Our finding suggests that Planckian diffusion in dynamic disordered systems is as universal as Anderson localization in static disordered systems, which may shed light on quantum transport studies.</description>

      <title>A Trade-Off Between Path Entanglement and Quantum Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement often increases quantum measurement schemes' sensitivity. However, we find that in precision measurements with zero-mean Gaussian states, such as squeezed states, entanglement between different paths degrades measurement sensitivity. We prove an inverse relationship between entanglement entropy and sensitivity for measurements of single-mode phase shifts in multimode systems and for phase shifts on both modes in two-mode systems. In the two-mode case, which models devices such as interferometers, we find that entanglement strongly degrades differential phase sensitivity. Finally, we show that minimizing entanglement between paths maximizes the phase sensitivity of $N$-mode systems with zero-mean Gaussian state inputs.</description>

      <title>How Are Quantum Eigenfunctions of Hydrogen Atom Related To Its Classical Elliptic Orbits?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a highly-excited energy eigenfunction $\psi_{nlm}(\vec{r})$ of hydrogen atom can be approximated as an equal-weight superposition of classical elliptic orbits of energy $E_n$ and angular momentum $L=\sqrt{l(l+1)}\hbar$, and $z$ component of angular momentum $L_z=m\hbar$. This correspondence is established by comparing the quantum probability distribution $|\psi_{nlm}(\vec{r})|^2$ and the classical probability distribution $p_c(\vec{r})$ of an ensemble of such orbits. This finding illustrates a general principle: in the semi-classical limit, an energy eigenstate of a quantum system is in general reduced to a collection of classical orbits, rather than a single classical orbit. In light of this quantum-classical correspondence, we re-examine the classical singularity problem of a point mass falling toward a gravitational center. We find that Euler's intuition was correct: the mass point undergoes a sudden turn at the center.</description>

      <title>Control incompatibility in multiparameter quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical applications like quantum sensing and quantum imaging, there is often a necessity to estimate multiple parameters simultaneously. Although the ultimate precision limits for single-parameter estimation are well established, the precision limit of multi-parameter estimation is much less understood. This is primarily due to the inherent incompatibility of the optimal strategies for the estimation of different parameters, particularly those pertaining to optimal control.In this study, we tackle the critical issue of control incompatibility in multi-parameter estimation by presenting explicit cases that expose this challenge. Our research not only pioneers the exploration of control incompatibility but also highlights its pivotal role in the field. Furthermore, our work offers valuable insights into how to minimize trade-offs induced by control incompatibility and enhance precision. This paves the way for future investigations into control strategies that enable optimal estimation of multiple parameters that are incompatible.</description>

      <title>Effective temperature in approximate quantum many-body states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of numerically identifying the ground state of quantum many-body systems, approximate quantum wavefunction ansatzes are commonly employed. This study focuses on the spectral decomposition of these approximate quantum many-body states into exact eigenstates of the target Hamiltonian. The energy spectral decomposition could reflect the intricate physics at the interplay between quantum systems and numerical algorithms. Here we examine various parameterized wavefunction ansatzes constructed from neural networks, tensor networks, and quantum circuits, employing differentiable programming to numerically approximate ground states and imaginary-time evolved states. Our findings reveal a consistent exponential decay pattern in the spectral contributions of approximate quantum states across different ansatzes, optimization objectives, and quantum systems, characterized by small decay rates denoted as inverse effective temperatures. The effective temperature is related to ansatz expressiveness and accuracy and shows phase transition behaviors in learning imaginary-time evolved states. The universal picture and unique features suggest the significance and potential of the effective temperature in characterizing approximate quantum states.</description>

      <title>Fast pulsed photoemission from a double quantum well on a dielectric substrate as a dynamic process of inverse LEED leading to the generation of a charge and current density wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the rigorous quantum theory of the atomic photoeffect and the scenario of photoemission from a crystal as an inverse LEED process, pulsed photoemission from a flat thin-film photoemitter formed by a double quantum well on a dielectric substrate is investigated. The spatiotemporal dependences of the charge and current densities are calculated using the density matrix method. Asymptotic estimates are made in terms of the evolution of wave packets and the concepts of the extreme phase and fastest descent. The possibility of generating charge and current density waves as a result of the population and decay of quasi-stationary states of a doublet of a double quantum well under photoexcitation of electrons in conducting layers from inside this well is shown. For comparison, calculations were made for photoemission from a metal film on a substrate without a heterostructure: the double-well heterostructure increases, stabilizes, and extends the photocurrent pulse. A comparison of the contributions of the outgoing and incoming waves of the inverse LEED problem is made, and the relative smallness of the contribution of the incoming wave is quantitatively demonstrated</description>

      <title>Spin Phonon Relaxation Dynamics from a Conical Intersection of Trapped Rydberg Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-adiabatic processes near conical intersections are rooted in the stronger coupling between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Using a system of two trapped Rydberg ions, their high polarizability and strong dipolar interactions allow to form a conical intersection, where dynamics takes place on a microsecond time scale. Rydberg lifetimes are typically from a few to tens of microseconds, which could affect the conical dynamics. We study the effect of the finite lifetime of the Rydberg state on the vibronic dynamics around the conical intersection via analyzing the master equation. Through mean field and numerical calculations, damping dynamics are found in both the phonon populations and electronic states depending on the initial states. It is found that oscillatory vibronic dynamics can be seen clearly within the Rydberg lifetime, permitting to observe the conical effect in the trapped Rydberg ion system.</description>

      <title>Shallow Quantum Scalar Products with Phase Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of scalar products between two vectors is a common task in scientific computing and, by extension, in quantum computing. In this work, we introduce two alternative quantum circuits for computing scalar products with phase information, combining the structure of the swap test, the vacuum test, and the Hadamard test. These novel frameworks, called the zero-control and one-control tests, present different trade-offs between circuit depth and qubit count for accessing the scalar product between two quantum states. We demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the gate count for large numbers of qubits and decreases the scaling of quantum requirements compared to the Hadamard test.</description>

      <title>Training the parametric interactions in an analog bosonic quantum neural network with Fock basis measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks have the potential to be seamlessly integrated with quantum devices for the automatic recognition of quantum states. However, performing complex tasks requires a large number of neurons densely connected through trainable, parameterized weights - a challenging feat when using qubits. To address this, we propose leveraging bosonic modes and performing Fock basis measurements, enabling the extraction of an exponential number of features relative to the number of modes. Unlike qubits, bosons can be coupled through multiple parametric drives, with amplitudes, phases, and frequency detunings serving dual purposes: data encoding and trainable parameters. We demonstrate that these parameters, despite their differing physical dimensions, can be trained cohesively using backpropagation to solve benchmark tasks of increasing complexity. Furthermore, we show that training significantly reduces the number of measurements required for feature extraction compared to untrained quantum neural networks, such as quantum reservoir computing.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic-free optomechanically induced nonreciprocity may stimulate a wide range of practical applications in quantum technologies. However, how to suppress the thermal noise flow from the mechanical reservoir is still a difficulty encountered in achieving optomechanically nonreciprocal effects on a few- and even single-photon level. Here, we show how to realize thermal noise cancellation by quantum interference for optomechanically induced nonreciprocity in a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microresonator. We find that both nonreciprocal transmission and amplification can be achieved in the WGM microresonator when it coupled to two coupled mechanical resonators. More interestingly, the thermal noise can be suppressed when the two coupled mechanical resonators couple to a common thermal reservoir. The thermal noise cancellation is induced by the destructive quantum interference between the two flow paths of the thermal noises from the common reservoir. The scheme of quantum interference induced thermal noise cancellation can be applied in both sideband resolved and unresolved regimes, even with strong backscattering taken into account. Our work provides an effective way to achieve nonreciprocal effects on a few- or single-photon level without precooling the mechanical mode to the ground state.</description>

      <title>Sensing Based on Quantum Correlation of Photons in the Weak Nonlinear Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum correlation of photons based on quantum interference, such as unconventional photon blockade (UPB), has been extensively studied for realizing single-photon sources in weak nonlinear regime. However, how to use this effect for other practical applications is rarely studied. Here, we propose schemes to realize sensitive sensing by the quantum correlation of photons based on quantum interference. We demonstrate that UPB can be observed in the mixing field output from a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with two cavities in the two arms based on quantum interference. We show that the second-order correlation function of the output field is sensitive to the parameters of system and propose schemes to realize angular velocity and temperature sensing by measuring the second-order correlation of the photons output from the MZI. We find that the second-order correlation function of the output field is much more sensitive to the parameters of system than the mean photon number, which provides an application scenario for the quantum correlation of photons in sensitive sensing.</description>

      <title>Universal approximation of continuous functions with minimal quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional paradigm of quantum computing is discrete: it utilizes discrete sets of gates to realize bitstring-to-bitstring mappings, some of them arguably intractable for classical computers. In parameterized quantum approaches, widely used in quantum optimization and quantum machine learning, the input becomes continuous and the output represents real-valued functions. Various strategies exist to encode the input into a quantum circuit. While the bitstring-to-bitstring universality of quantum computers is quite well understood, basic questions remained open in the continuous case. For example, it was proven that full multivariate function universality requires either (i) a fixed encoding procedure with a number of qubits scaling as the dimension of the input or (ii) a tunable encoding procedure in single-qubit circuits. This reveals a trade-off between the complexity of the data encoding and the qubit requirements. The question of whether universality can be reached with a fixed encoding and constantly many qubits has been open for the last five years. In this paper, we answer this remaining fundamental question in the affirmative. We provide a constructive method to approximate arbitrary multivariate functions using just a single qubit and a fixed-generator parametrization, at the expense of increasing the depth. We also prove universality for a few of alternative fixed encoding strategies which may have independent interest. Our results rely on a combination of techniques from harmonic analysis and quantum signal processing.</description>

      <title>Impact of leakage to the dynamic of a ST$_0$ qubit implemented on a Double Quantum Dot device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin qubits in quantum dots are a promising technology for quantum computing due to their fast response time and long coherence times. An electromagnetic pulse is applied to the system for a specific duration to perform a desired rotation. To avoid decoherence, the amplitude and gate time must be highly accurate. In this work, we aim to study the impact of leakage during the gate time evolution of a spin qubit encoded in a double quantum dot device. We prove that, in the weak interaction regime, leakage introduces a shift in the phase of the time evolution operator, causing over- or under-rotations. Indeed, controlling the leakage terms is useful for adjusting the time needed to perform a quantum computation. This is crucial for running fault-tolerant algorithms and is beneficial for Quantum Error Mitigation techniques.</description>

      <title>Performance of a Superconducting Quantum Battery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a quantum battery model that demonstrates a quantum advantage while remaining feasible for experimental production is a considerable challenge. In this paper, we introduce a superconducting quantum battery (SQB) model that exhibits such an advantage. The model consists of two coupled superconducting qubits that interact during the unitary charging process while remaining in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. We first describe the model, provide evidence of the quantum advantage, and then discuss the fabrication process of the battery using superconducting qubits. Importantly, we derive analytical expressions for the ergotropy, instantaneous power, and capacity of the SQB, as well as their connection to quantum coherence. We demonstrate that leveraging the collective effects of Josephson energies and the coupling energy between qubits allows for optimization, resulting in improved energy redistribution and a significant enhancement in charging efficiency. This work highlights the complexities of tuning system parameters, which increase the potential for work extraction from the quantum battery, thereby providing a deeper understanding of the charging mechanisms involved. These findings can be applied to superconducting quantum circuit battery architectures, underscoring the feasibility of efficient energy storage in these systems. Our results pave the way for proposals of new superconducting devices capable of storing extractable work, emphasizing their potential for efficient energy storage.</description>

      <title>Quantum feedback control with a transformer neural network architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention-based neural networks such as transformers have revolutionized various fields such as natural language processing, genomics, and vision. Here, we demonstrate the use of transformers for quantum feedback control through a supervised learning approach. In particular, due to the transformer's ability to capture long-range temporal correlations and training efficiency, we show that it can surpass some of the limitations of previous control approaches, e.g.~those based on recurrent neural networks trained using a similar approach or reinforcement learning. We numerically show, for the example of state stabilization of a two-level system, that our bespoke transformer architecture can achieve unit fidelity to a target state in a short time even in the presence of inefficient measurement and Hamiltonian perturbations that were not included in the training set. We also demonstrate that this approach generalizes well to the control of non-Markovian systems. Our approach can be used for quantum error correction, fast control of quantum states in the presence of colored noise, as well as real-time tuning, and characterization of quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Maximal Steered Coherence in Accelerating Unruh-DeWitt Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence, a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, plays a crucial role in various quantum information tasks. However, preserving coherence under extreme conditions, such as relativistic acceleration, poses significant challenges. In this paper, we investigate the influence of Unruh temperature and energy levels on the evolution of maximal steered coherence (MSC) for different initial states. Our results reveal that MSC is strongly dependent on Unruh temperature, exhibiting behaviors ranging from monotonic decline to non-monotonic recovery, depending on the initial state parameter. Notably, when \Delta=1, MSC is generated as Unruh temperature increases. Additionally, we observe that higher energy levels help preserve or enhance MSC in the presence of Unruh effects. These findings offer valuable insights into the intricate relationship between relativistic effects and quantum coherence, with potential applications in developing robust quantum technologies for non-inertial environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Neural Networks in Practice: A Comparative Study with Classical Models from Standard Data Sets to Industrial Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image classification tasks are among the most prominent examples that can be reliably solved by classical machine learning models. In this study, we compare the performance of randomized classical and quantum neural networks as well as classical and quantum-classical hybrid convolutional neural networks for the task of binary image classification. To this end, we employ various data sets of increasing complexity - (i) an artificial hypercube dataset, (ii) MNIST handwritten digits, and (iii) real-world industrial images from laser cutting machines. We analyze the performance of the employed quantum models with respect to correlations between classification accuracy and various hyperparameters. For the random quantum neural networks, we additionally compare their performance with some known literature models and how top-performing models from one data set perform on the others. In general, we observe fairly similar performances of classical and quantum or hybrid models. Our study provides an industry perspective on the prospects of quantum machine learning for practical image classification tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional time-frequency encodings have the potential to significantly advance quantum information science; however, practical applications require precise knowledge of the encoded quantum states, which becomes increasingly challenging for larger Hilbert spaces. Self-guided tomography (SGT) has emerged as a practical and scalable technique for this purpose in the spatial domain. Here, we apply SGT to estimate time-frequency states using a multi-output quantum pulse gate. We achieve fidelities of more than 99\% for 3- and 5-dimensional states without the need for calibration or post-processing. We demonstrate the robustness of SGT against statistical and environmental noise, highlighting its efficacy in the photon-starved regime typical of quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cellular Automata on Symmetric Subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum cellular automata (QCA) on one-dimensional spin systems defined over a subalgebra of the full local operator algebra - the symmetric subalgebra under a finite Abelian group symmetry $G$. For systems where each site carries a regular representation of $G$, we establish a complete classification of such subalgebra QCAs based on two topological invariants: (1) a surjective homomorphism from the group of subalgebra QCAs to the group of anyon permutation symmetries in a $(2+1)d$ $G$ gauge theory; and (2) a generalization of the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner (GNVW) index that characterizes the flow of the symmetric subalgebra. Specifically, two subalgebra QCAs correspond to the same anyon permutation and share the same index if and only if they differ by a finite-depth unitary circuit composed of $G$-symmetric local gates. We also identify a set of operations that generate all subalgebra QCAs through finite compositions. As an example, we examine the Kramers-Wannier duality on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric subalgebra, demonstrating that it maps to the $e$-$m$ permutation in the two-dimensional toric code and has an irrational index of $\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, it cannot be extended to a QCA over the full local operator algebra and mixes nontrivially with lattice translations.</description>

      <title>The role of data-induced randomness in quantum machine learning classification tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has surged as a prominent area of research with the objective to go beyond the capabilities of classical machine learning models. A critical aspect of any learning task is the process of data embedding, which directly impacts model performance. Poorly designed data-embedding strategies can significantly impact the success of a learning task. Despite its importance, rigorous analyses of data-embedding effects are limited, leaving many cases without effective assessment methods. In this work, we introduce a metric for binary classification tasks, the class margin, by merging the concepts of average randomness and classification margin. This metric analytically connects data-induced randomness with classification accuracy for a given data-embedding map. We benchmark a range of data-embedding strategies through class margin, demonstrating that data-induced randomness imposes a limit on classification performance. We expect this work to provide a new approach to evaluate QML models by their data-embedding processes, addressing gaps left by existing analytical tools.</description>

Abstract: The unique photon-scattering phenomena of giant-atom systems offer a novel paradigm for exploring innovative quantum optics phenomena and applications. Here, we investigate a giant-atom configuration embedded in a dual-rail waveguide, whose scattering behavior is analytically derived based on a four-port model and affected by both waveguide-induced and interatomic interaction phases. One can modulate these phases to achieve targeted routing and non-reciprocal scattering of photons. Furthermore, using such a configuration, we propose quantum applications such as quantum storage, path-encoded quantum gates (e.g., CNOT gate), quantum teleportation, and quantum circulators. This configuration can be implemented with state-of-the-art solid-state quantum systems, enabling a wide range of quantum applications and facilitating the development of quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Hardware Power through Optimal Pulse Profiling for Each Qubit Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the scaling development of quantum computers, the calibration process emerges as a critical challenge. Existing calibration methods, utilizing the same pulse waveform for two-qubit gates across the device, overlook hardware differences among physical qubits and lack efficient parallel calibration. In this paper, we enlarge the pulse candidates for two-qubit gates to three pulse waveforms, and introduce a fine-grained calibration protocol. In the calibration protocol, three policies are proposed to profile each qubit pair with its optimal pulse waveform. Afterwards, calibration subgraphs are introduced to enable parallel calibraton through identifying compatible calibration operations. The protocol is validated on real machine with up to 127 qubits. Real-machine experiments demonstrates a minimum gate error of 0.001 with a median error of 0.006 which is 1.84x reduction compared to default pulse waveform provided by IBM. On device level, a double fold increase in quantum volume as well as 2.3x reduction in error per layered gate are achieved. The proposed protocol leverages the potential current hardware and could server as an important step toward fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Solving the Nonlinear Vlasov Equation on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mapping of the nonlinear, electrostatic Vlasov equation with Krook type collision operators, discretized on a (1 + 1) dimensional grid, onto a recent Carleman linearization based quantum algorithm for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with quadratic nonlinearities. We show that the quantum algorithm is guaranteed to converge only when the plasma parameters take unphysical values. This is due to the high level of dissipation in the ODE system required for convergence, that far exceeds the physical dissipation effect provided by the Krook operator. Additionally, we derive upper bounds for the query- and gate complexities of the quantum algorithm in the limit of large grid sizes. We conclude that these are polynomially larger than the time complexity of the corresponding classical algorithms. We find that this is mostly due to the dimension, sparsity and norm of the Carleman linearized evolution matrix.</description>

      <title>On the characterization of Schmidt number breaking and annihilating channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission of high dimensional entanglement through quantum channels is a significant area of interest in quantum information science. The certification of high dimensional entanglement is usually done through Schmidt numbers. Schmidt numbers quantify the entanglement dimension of quantum states. States with high Schmidt numbers provide a larger advantage in various quantum information processing tasks compared to quantum states with low Schmidt numbers. However, some quantum channels can reduce the Schmidt number of states. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of Schmidt number breaking channels which reduce the Schmidt number of bipartite composite systems. From a resource theoretic perspective, it becomes imperative to identify channels that preserve the Schmidt number. Based on our characterization we lay down prescriptions to identify such channels which are non-resource breaking, i.e., preserve the Schmidt number. Additionally, we introduce a new class of quantum channels, termed Schmidt number annihilating channels which reduce the Schmidt number of a quantum state that is a part of a larger composite system. Finally, we study the connection between entanglement breaking, Schmidt number breaking, and Schmidt number annihilating channels.</description>

      <title>Limitations of Quantum Approximate Optimization in Solving Generic Higher-Order Constraint-Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to deliver a quantum advantage on combinatorial optimization problems is still unclear. Recently, a scaling advantage over a classical solver was postulated to exist for random 8-SAT at the satisfiability threshold. At the same time, the viability of quantum error mitigation for deep circuits on near-term devices has been put in doubt. Here, we analyze the QAOA's performance on random Max-$k$XOR as a function of $k$ and the clause-to-variable ratio. As a classical benchmark, we use the Mean-Field Approximate Optimization Algorithm (MF-AOA) and find that it performs better than or equal to the QAOA on average. Still, for large $k$ and numbers of layers $p$, there may remain a window of opportunity for the QAOA. However, by extrapolating our numerical results, we find that reaching high levels of satisfaction would require extremely large $p$, which must be considered rather difficult both in the variational context and on near-term devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing flexible native entanglement gates can significantly reduce circuit complexity. We propose a novel gate integrating iswap and cphase operations within a single gate cycle. We theoretically show one possible realization of this gate for superconducting qubits using bichromatic parametric drives at distinct frequencies. We show how various parameters, such as drive amplitudes and frequencies, can control entanglement parameters. This approach enhances gate versatility, opening pathways for more efficient quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Optimal Frequency Estimation of Stochastic AC Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classically, measurement bandwidth limits the achievable frequency resolution of stochastic time-dependent fields. We frame the problem of frequency measurement as the estimation of the noise parameter of a dephasing quantum channel. Using this framework, we find an exact upper bound for estimating frequency centroids and separations. In particular, given two closely separated frequencies with separation $\omega_r$, the quantum Fisher information (QFI) upper bound is approximately $2/\omega_r^2$, inversely proportional to the separation parameter. We show that this is achievable with a superposition of Dicke states, and show that GHZ states improve precision over unentangled states, achieving Heisenberg scaling in the low-bandwidth limit. This work established a robust framework for stochastic AC signal sensing and can be extended to an arbitrary number of frequencies.</description>

      <title>Utilizing encoding time as a resource to enhance quantum sensing by probe qubit dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a system in which an impurity qubit is immersed in a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate whose collective excitations act as a depasing reservoir for the qubit. The relative dipole-dipole interaction strength is estimated by the probe qubit dephasing. The ultimate precision of this estimation is quantified by the quantum Fisher information, which can be obtained by means of measuring quantum coherence of the probe qubit. Our findings indicate that, in the interval where roton excitations appear, the quantum Fisher information oscillates periodically with the encoding time $t$, and the amplitude of these oscillations increases alongside the extension of $t$. Moreover, we analytically determine that the envelope curve formed by the local maximum points satisfies the functional relationship $At+Bt^{1/2}+C$ during long-term encoding scenarios, where $A$, $B$, $C$ are positive numbers. It is also revealed that the highly non-Markovian effects caused by the roton softening of the excitation spectrum allow long encoding time to serve as a resource for enhancing sensing precision. Our work provides a new pathway for enhancing the sensing precision of dephasing qubits.</description>

      <title>Unitary-transformed projective squeezing: applications for circuit-knitting and state-preparation of non-Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable (CV) quantum computing is a promising candidate for quantum computation because it can utilize infinite-dimensional Hilbert space even with one mode and efficiently handle continuous values. Although the photonic platforms have been considered as a leading platform for CV computation, hybrid systems comprising qubits and bosonic modes, e.g., superconducting hardware, have shown significant developments because they can prepare non-Gaussian state by utilizing the nonlinear interaction between the qubits and the bosonic modes. However, the experimentally realizable size of hybrid hardware is currently restricted. Moreover, the fidelity of the non-Gaussian state is still limited. In this work, by developing the projective squeezing method, we establish the formalism for projecting quantum states onto the states that are unitary-transformed from the squeezed vacuum at the expense of the sampling cost. Based on this formalism, we propose methods for simulating larger quantum devices and projecting the state onto one of the typical non-Gaussian states, the cubic phase state, with a higher squeezing level and higher nonlinearity. For practical implementation, we can apply the smeared projector either by linear-combination-of-unitaries or virtual quantum error detection algorithms by leveraging the interactions in hybrid systems of qubits and bosonic modes. We numerically verify the performance of our methods and also show that the effect of photon-loss errors can be suppressed due to projection.</description>

      <title>Fundamental bounds on precision and response for quantum trajectory observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision and response of trajectory observables offer valuable insights into the behavior of nonequilibrium systems. For classical systems, trade-offs between these characteristics and thermodynamic costs, such as entropy production and dynamical activity, have been established through uncertainty relations. Quantum systems, however, present unique challenges, where quantum coherence can enhance precision and violate classical uncertainty relations. In this study, we derive trade-off relations for stochastic observables in Markovian open quantum systems. Specifically, we present three key results: (i) a quantum generalization of the thermo-kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the relative fluctuations of currents in terms of entropy production and dynamical activity; (ii) a quantum inverse uncertainty relation, which constrains the relative fluctuations of arbitrary counting observables based on their instantaneous fluctuations and the spectral gap of the symmetrized Liouvillian; and (iii) a quantum response kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the response of observables to kinetic perturbations in terms of dynamical activity. These fundamental bounds, validated numerically using a three-level maser, provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between precision, response, and thermodynamic costs in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of continuous time crystals and quasi-crystals in spin gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous time crystal (CTC) and quasi-crystal (CTQC) are two novel phases of matter characterized by the spontaneous breaking of continuous time-translation symmetry. To date, realizations of CTCs with periodic oscillations have been reported in only a few physical platforms, and their complex properties still require further exploration. Additionally, CTQCs, which feature quasi-periodic oscillations at multiple incommensurate frequencies, remain elusive. Here we report the experimental observation of CTC and CTQC signatures in noble-gas nuclear spins that interact nonlinearly with each other through feedback mechanisms. The observed limit cycle and quasi-periodic phases display persistent spin oscillations with coherence times extending beyond several hours. Notably, these oscillations are robust against noise perturbations and exhibit random time phases upon repetitive realization, epitomizing the continuous time-translation symmetry-breaking intrinsic to CTCs and CTQCs. As the feedback strength increases, the system undergoes a phase transition into a new phase characterized by chaotic oscillations, indicative of the ``melting" of time crystals. Interestingly, within certain feedback regimes, we even observe an unusual reverse phase transition from a chaotic phase back to time crystal phases. This work broadens the catalog of new phases of spin gas and unlocks opportunities in precision measurements, including multimode masers and tests of fundamental symmetries.</description>

Then, we show our numerical results of thermal field theories in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. Both fermion and scalar fields will be discussed. These studies aim to understand thermal fixed points for our forthcoming work on studying thermalisation in quantum field theories in real time quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing based Feature Selection in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning (ML) models. This work investigates the utility of quantum annealing for the feature selection process in an ML-pipeline, used for maximizing the mutual information (MI) or conditional mutual information (CMI) of the underlying feature space. Calculating the optimal set of features that maximize the MI or CMI is computationally intractable for large datasets on classical computers, even with approximative methods. This study employs a Mutual Information Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (MIQUBO) formulation, enabling its solution on a quantum annealer. We demonstrate the capability of this approach to identify the best feature combinations that maximize the MI or CMI. To showcase its real-world applicability, we solve the MIQUBO problem to forecast the prices of used excavators. Our results demonstrate that for datasets with a small MI concentration the MIQUBO approach can provide a significant improvement over MI-only based approaches, dependent on the dimension of the selected feature space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how local distinguishability can restrict global properties of bi-partite states. We begin exploring how non-locality becomes limited by optimal local state discrimination and observe a non-trivial trade-off between CHSH violation and success probability of local discrimination. We extend our findings to bounding the maximally entangled sate fidelity and global observables such as the energy. Our results show that optimal local state discrimination can become a powerful tool to limit global behaviours, e.g. from entangled adversaries in quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Gradient projection method for constrained quantum control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we adopt the Gradient Projection Method (GPM) to problems of quantum control. For general $N$-level closed and open quantum systems, we derive the corresponding adjoint systems and gradients of the objective functionals, and provide the projection versions of the Pontryagin maximum principle and the GPM, all directly in terms of quantum objects such as evolution operator, Hamiltonians, density matrices, etc. Various forms of the GPM, including one- and two-step, are provided and compared. We formulate the GPM both for closed and open quantum systems, latter for the general case with simultaneous coherent and incoherent controls. The GPM is designed to perform local gradient based optimization in the case when bounds are imposed on the controls. The main advantage of the method is that it allows to exactly satisfy the bounds, in difference to other approaches such as adding constraints as weight to objective. We apply the GPM to several examples including generation of one- and two-qubit gates and two-qubit Bell and Werner states for models of superconducting qubits under the constraint when controls are zero at the initial and final times, and steering an open quantum system state to a target density matrix for simulating action of the Werner-Holevo channel, etc.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry postulates play a crucial role in various reconstructions of quantum mechanics. Discrete and continuous symmetries are considered in different approaches. The continuous case better matches the physical needs for mathematical models of dynamical processes and is studied here. Applying the representation theory of the orthomodular lattices, we show that the continuous symmetry, together with spectrality and a few further requirements, entails that the underlying mathematical structure of a finite-dimensional generalized probabilistic theory becomes a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomness is a critical resource of modern cryptosystems. Quantum mechanics offers the best properties of an entropy source in terms of unpredictability. However, these sources are often fragile and can fail silently. Therefore, statistical tests on their outputs should be performed continuously. Testing a sequence for randomness can be very resource-intensive, especially for longer sequences, and transferring this to other systems can put the secrecy at risk. In this paper, we present a method that allows a third party to publicly perform statistical testing without compromising the confidentiality of the random bits by connecting the quality of a public sequence to the private sequence generated using a quantum process. We implemented our protocol over two different optical systems and compared them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast entangling gate operations are a fundamental prerequisite for quantum simulation and computation. We propose an entangling scheme for arbitrary pairs of ions in a linear crystal, harnessing the high electric polarizability of highly excited Rydberg states. An all-to-all quantum gate connectivity is based on an initialization of a pair of ions to a superposition of ground- and Rydberg-states by laser excitation, followed by the entangling gate operation which relies on a state-dependent frequency shift of collective vibrational modes of the crystal. This gate operation requires applying an electric waveform to trap electrodes. Employing transverse collective modes of oscillation, we reveal order of $\mu s$ operation times within any of the qubit pairs in a small crystal. In our calculation, we are taking into account realistic experimental conditions and feasible electric field ramps. The proposed gate operation is ready to be combined with a scalable processor architecture to reconfigure the qubit register, either by shuttling ions or by dynamically controlling optical tweezer potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While experimental measurements of photon correlations have become routine in laboratories, theoretical access to these quantities for the light generated in complex nanophotonic devices remains a major challenge. Current methods are limited to specific simplified cases and lack generality. Here we present a novel method that provides access to photon statistics resolved in space and frequency in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. Within the macroscopic QED framework, we develop a practical tool to compute electric field correlations for complex quantum systems by including lossy two-level systems that act as field detectors within the system. To make the implementation feasible, we use a recently developed multi-emitter few-mode quantization method to correctly account for fully retarded light propagation to the detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique by studying the photon correlations of one and two emitters in close proximity to a plasmonic nanoparticle. The simulations show that even in these relatively simple configurations, the light statistics exhibit a strong angular dependence. These results highlight the importance of going beyond conventional quantum-optical approaches to fully capture the analyzed physical effects and enable the study of the quantum light generation in realistic nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A clever choice and design of gate sets can reduce the depth of a quantum circuit, and can improve the quality of the solution one obtains from a quantum algorithm. This is especially important for near-term quantum computers that suffer from various sources of error that propagate with the circuit depth. Parametrized gates in particular have found use in both near-term algorithms and circuit compilation. The one- and two-qubit versions of these gates have been demonstrated on various computing architectures. The neutral atom platform has the capability to implement native $N$-qubit gates (for $N \geq 2$). However, one needs to first find the control functions that implement these gates on the hardware. We study the numerical optimization of neural networks towards obtaining families of controls $-$ laser pulses to excite an atom to Rydberg states $-$ that implement phase gates with one and two controls, the $\mathrm{C_1P}$ and $\mathrm{C_2P}$ gates respectively, on neutral atom hardware. The pulses we obtain have a duration significantly shorter than the loss time scale, set by decay from the Rydberg state. Further, they do not require single-site addressability and are smooth. Hence, we expect our gates to have immediate benefits for quantum algorithms implemented on current neutral atom hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution with Basis-Dependent Detection Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a promising technology for secure communication. Nevertheless, QKD is still treated with caution in certain contexts due to potential gaps between theoretical models and actual QKD implementations. A common assumption in security proofs is that the detection probability at the receiver, for a given input state, is independent of the measurement basis, which might not always be verified and could lead to security loopholes. This paper presents a security proof for QKD protocols that does not rely on the above assumption and is thus applicable in scenarios with detection probability mismatches, even when induced by the adversary. We demonstrate, through simulations, that our proof can extract positive key rates for setups vulnerable to large detection probability mismatches. This is achieved by monitoring whether an adversary is actively exploiting such vulnerabilities, instead of considering the worst-case scenario as in previous proofs. Our work highlights the importance of accounting for basis-dependent detection probabilities and provides a concrete solution for improving the security of practical QKD systems.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Key Distribution System for Mobile Platforms with Highly Indistinguishable States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two users to exchange a provably secure key for cryptographic applications. In prepare-and-measure QKD protocols, the states must be indistinguishable to prevent information leakage to an eavesdropper performing a side-channel attack. Here, we measure the indistinguishability of quantum states in a prepare-and-measure three-state BB84 polarization-based decoy state protocol using resonant-cavity light-emitting diodes (RC-LEDs) as the source in the transmitter. We make the spatial, spectral, and temporal DOF of the generated quantum states nearly indistinguishable using a spatial filter single-mode fiber, a narrow-band spectral filter, and adjustable timing of the electrical pulses driving the RC-LEDs, respectively. The sources have fully indistinguishable transverse spatial modes. The measured fractional mutual information between an assumed eavesdropper and the legitimate receiver is $2.39\times10^{-5}$ due to the spectral distinguishability and $4.31\times10^{-5}$ for the temporal distinguishability. The source is integrated into a full QKD system operating in a laboratory environment, where we achieve a raw key rate of 532 Kbits/s with an average quantum bit error rate of 1.83\%. The low system size, weight, and power make it suitable for mobile platforms such as uncrewed aerial vehicles (drones) or automobiles.</description>

      <title>Reverse-type Data Processing Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum data processing inequality states that two quantum states become harder to distinguish when a noisy channel is applied. On the other hand, a reverse quantum data processing inequality characterizes whether a pair of states remains distinguishable after the application of a noisy channel. In this work, we explore these concepts through contraction and expansion coefficients of quantum channels. We show that many quantum channels do not have a non-zero expansion coefficient, which means that they cannot admit a reverse data-processing inequality. Furthermore, we propose a comparative approach by introducing a relative expansion coefficient, to assess how one channel expands relative entropy compared to another. We show that this relative expansion coefficient is positive for various pairs of quantum channels, including depolarizing, generalized dephasing, and amplitude damping channels, allowing us to establish a reverse-type data processing inequality for several settings. As an application, we construct a class of less noisy quantum channels that are non-degradable. This work contributes new mathematical tools for evaluating quantum information preservation across channels.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum-enhanced classical simulation for patches of quantum landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the capabilities of classical simulation methods is key to identifying where quantum computers are advantageous. Not only does this ensure that quantum computers are used only where necessary, but also one can potentially identify subroutines that can be offloaded onto a classical device. In this work, we show that it is always possible to generate a classical surrogate of a sub-region (dubbed a "patch") of an expectation landscape produced by a parameterized quantum circuit. That is, we provide a quantum-enhanced classical algorithm which, after simple measurements on a quantum device, allows one to classically simulate approximate expectation values of a subregion of a landscape. We provide time and sample complexity guarantees for a range of families of circuits of interest, and further numerically demonstrate our simulation algorithms on an exactly verifiable simulation of a Hamiltonian variational ansatz and long-time dynamics simulation on a 127-qubit heavy-hex topology.</description>

      <title>Input-Output Optics as a Causal Time Series Mapping: A Generative Machine Learning Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of many-body quantum systems to an optical pulse can be extremely challenging to model. Here we explore the use of neural networks, both traditional and generative, to learn and thus simulate the response of such a system from data. The quantum system can be viewed as performing a complex mapping from an input time-series (the optical pulse) to an output time-series (the systems response) which is often also an optical pulse. Using both the transverse and non-integrable Ising models as examples, we show that not only can temporal convolutional networks capture the input/output mapping generated by the system but can also be used to characterize the complexity of the mapping. This measure of complexity is provided by the size of the smallest latent space that is able to accurately model the mapping. We further find that a generative model, in particular a variational auto-encoder, significantly outperforms traditional auto-encoders at learning the complex response of many-body quantum systems. For the example that generated the most complex mapping, the variational auto-encoder produces outputs that have less than 10% error for more than 90% of inputs across our test data.</description>

      <title>Universal non-Hermitian transport in disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In disordered Hermitian systems, localization of energy eigenstates prohibits wave propagation. In non-Hermitian systems, however, wave propagation is possible even when the eigenstates of Hamiltonian are exponentially localized by disorders. We find in this regime that non-Hermitian wave propagation exhibits novel universal scaling behaviors without Hermitian counterpart. Furthermore, our theory demonstrates how the tail of imaginary-part density of states dictates wave propagation in the long-time limit. Specifically, for the three typical classes, namely the Gaussian, the uniform, and the linear imaginary-part density of states, we obtain logarithmically suppressed sub-ballistic transport, and two types of subdiffusion with exponents that depend only on spatial dimensions, respectively. Our work highlights the fundamental differences between Hermitian and non-Hermitian Anderson localization, and uncovers unique universality in non-Hermitian wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Algorithms for the Deterministic L-system Inductive Inference Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L-systems can be made to model and create simulations of many biological processes, such as plant development. Finding an L-system for a given process is typically solved by hand, by experts, in a hugely time-consuming process. It would be significant if this could be done automatically from data, such as from sequences of images. In this paper, we are interested in inferring a particular type of L-system, deterministic context-free L-system (D0L-system) from a sequence of strings. We introduce the characteristic graph of a sequence of strings, which we then utilize to translate our problem (inferring D0L-system) in polynomial time into the maximum independent set problem (MIS) and the SAT problem. After that, we offer a classical exact algorithm and an approximate quantum algorithm for the problem.</description>

      <title>Learning Feedback Mechanisms for Measurement-Based Variational Quantum State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a self-learning protocol that incorporates measurement and feedback into variational quantum circuits for efficient quantum state preparation. By combining projective measurements with conditional feedback, the protocol learns state preparation strategies that extend beyond unitary-only methods, leveraging measurement-based shortcuts to reduce circuit depth. Using the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state as a benchmark, the protocol learns high-fidelity state preparation by overcoming a family of measurement induced local minima through adjustments of parameter update frequencies and ancilla regularization. Despite these efforts, optimization remains challenging due to the highly non-convex landscapes inherent to variational circuits. The approach is extended to larger systems using translationally invariant ans\"atze and recurrent neural networks for feedback, demonstrating scalability. Additionally, the successful preparation of a specific AKLT state with desired edge modes highlights the potential to discover new state preparation protocols where none currently exist. These results indicate that integrating measurement and feedback into variational quantum algorithms provides a promising framework for quantum state preparation.</description>

      <title>It's Quick to be Square: Fast Quadratisation for Quantum Toolchains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of the envisioned use-cases for quantum computers involve optimisation processes. While there are many algorithmic primitives to perform the required calculations, all eventually lead to quantum gates operating on quantum bits, with an order as determined by the structure of the objective function and the properties of target hardware. When the structure of the problem representation is not aligned with structure and boundary conditions of the executing hardware, various overheads to degrade the computation may arise, possibly negating any possible quantum advantage.
  Therefore, automatic transformations of problem representations play an important role in quantum computing when descriptions (semi-)targeted at humans must be cast into forms that can be executed on quantum computers. Mathematically equivalent formulations are known to result in substantially different non-functional properties depending on hardware, algorithm and detail properties of the problem. Given the current state of noisy-intermediate scale quantum hardware (NISQ), these effects are considerably more pronounced than in classical computing. Likewise, efficiency of the transformation itself is relevant because possible quantum advantage may easily be eradicated by the overhead of transforming between representations. In this paper we consider a specific class of higher-level representations (polynomial unbiased binary optimisation problems), and devise novel automatic transformation mechanisms into widely used quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation problems that substantially improve efficiency and versatility over the state of the art. We also identify what influence factors of lower-level details can be abstracted away in the transformation process, and which details must be made available to higher-level abstractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a classical environment and subject to constraints that drive it out of equilibrium is described. The evolution of the system is governed by the quantum-classical Liouville equation. Rather than evaluating the evolution of the mixed quantum-classical density operator, we derive exact equations of motion for the nonequilibrium average values of a set of operators or variables, along with correlation function expressions for the dissipative coefficients that enter these equations. These equations are obtained by requiring that the exact nonequilibrium averages are equal to local nonequilibrium averages that depend on auxiliary fields whose values satisfy evolution equations obtained using projection operator methods. The results are illustrated by deriving reaction-diffusion equations coupled to fluid hydrodynamic equations for a dilute solution of quantum particles that can exist in two metastable states. Nonequilibrium steady states are discussed along with the reaction rate and diffusion correlation functions that characterize such states.</description>

      <title>Laser cooling trapped-ion crystal modes beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser cooling methods for trapped ions are most commonly studied at low energies, i.e., in the Lamb-Dicke regime. However, ions in experiments are often excited to higher energies for which the Lamb-Dicke approximation breaks down. Here we construct a non-perturbative, semiclassical method for predicting the energy-dependent cooling dynamics of trapped-ion crystals with potentially many internal levels and motional modes beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime. This method allows accurate and efficient modeling of a variety of interesting phenomena, such as the breakdown of EIT cooling at high energies and the simultaneous cooling of multiple high-temperature modes. We compare its predictions both to fully-quantum simulations and to experimental data for a broadband EIT cooling method on a Raman $S$-$D$ transition in $^{138}$Ba${^+}$. We find the method can accurately predict cooling rates over a wide range of energies relevant to trapped ion experiments. Our method complements fully quantum models by allowing for fast and accurate predictions of laser-cooling dynamics at much higher energy scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near infrared emission in silicon carbide is relevant for quantum technology specifically single photon emission and spin qubits for integrated quantum photonics, quantum communication and quantum sensing. In this paper we study the fluorescence emission of direct femtosecond laser written array of color centres in silicon carbide followed by thermal annealing. We show that in high energy laser writing pulses regions a near telecom O-band ensemble fluorescence emission is observed after thermal annealing and it is tentatively attributed to the nitrogen vacancy centre in silicon carbide. Further in the low energy laser irradiation spots after annealing, we fabricated few divacancy, PL5 and PL6 types and demonstrate their optical spin read-out, and coherent spin manipulation (Rabi and Ramsey oscillations and spin echo). We show that direct laser writing and thermal annealing can yield bright near telecom emission and preserve the spin coherence time of divacancy at room temperature.</description>

Abstract: We implement a variational quantum algorithm to investigate the chiral condensate in a 1+1 dimensional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge theory. The algorithm is evaluated using a proposed Monte Carlo sampling method, which allows the extension to large qubit systems. The obtained results through quantum simulations on classical and actual quantum hardware are in good agreement with exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian, revealing the phenomena of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration as functions of both temperature and chemical potential. Our findings underscore the potential of near-term quantum computing for exploring QCD systems at finite temperature and density in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Universal Reconstruction of Complex Magnetic Profiles with Minimum Prior Assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the intricate magnetic structures of materials is crucial for the advancements in material science, spintronics, and geology. Recent developments of quantum-enabled magnetometers, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, have enabled direct imaging of magnetic field distributions associated with a wide variety of magnetic profiles. However, reconstructing the magnetization of a sample from a measured magnetic field map poses a complex inverse problem, which can be further complicated by the presence of measurement noise, finite spatial resolution, and the sample-to-sensor distance. While magnetic field distributions are typically measured through various available imaging methods, accurately reconstructing the underlying structures from these maps remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient GPU-based method for reconstructing magnetic source quantities (i.e. spatially varying magnetization density) from measured magnetic fields with minimum prior assumptions. We validate our method by simulating diverse magnetic structures under realistic experimental conditions, including multi-domain ferromagnetism and magnetic spin textures such as skyrmion, anti-skyrmion, and meron. Experimentally, we apply our technique to investigate the magnetic field maps from a lunar rock (Apollo lunar mare basalt sample 10003,184) obtained using a wide-field quantum diamond microscope. The reconstructed magnetic domains of the lunar rock are consistent with current paleomagnetic knowledge. Our approach provides a versatile and universal tool for investigating complex magnetization profiles, paving the way for future quantum sensing experiments.</description>

      <title>Deformed algebraic structure of angular momenta: GUP perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of a minimal length scale by various quantum gravity candidates (such as string/M theory, Doubly Special Relativity, Loop Quantum Gravity and others) have suggested modification of Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP), resulting in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP).
  In this short review, we investigate the origins of the GUP and examine higher-order models, focusing on the linear plus quadratic form of the GUP. We extend the concept of minimal length to minimal angular resolution, which plays a crucial role in modifying angular momentum and its associated algebra. A comparison is made between the standard angular momentum commutator algebra and that modified by the GUP. Finally, we review its application in the hydrogen atom spectra and and discuss future endeavors.</description>

      <title>Generating Sets of Stochastic Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of a generating set for stochastic matrices -- a subset of matrices whose repeated composition generates the entire set. Understanding such generating sets requires specifying the "indivisible elements" and "building blocks" within the set, which serve as fundamental components of the generation process. Expanding upon prior studies, we develop a framework that formalizes divisibility in the context of stochastic matrices. We provide a sufficient condition for divisibility that is shown to be necessary in dimension $n=3$, while for $n=2$, all stochastic matrices are shown to be divisible. Using these results, we construct generating sets for dimensions $2$ and $3$ by specifying the indivisible elements, and, importantly, we give an upper bound for the number of factors required from the generating set to produce the entire semigroup.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible Symmetry-Enriched Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noninvertible symmetry generalizes traditional group symmetries, advancing our understanding of quantum matter, especially one-dimensional gapped quantum systems. In critical lattice models, it is usually realized as emergent symmetries in the corresponding low-energy conformal field theories. In this work, we study critical lattice models with the noninvertible Rep($D_8$) symmetry in one dimension. This leads us to a new class of quantum critical points (QCP), noninvertible symmetry-enriched QCPs, as a generalization of known group symmetry-enriched QCPs. They are realized as phase transitions between one noninvertible symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase and another different one or spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase. We identify their low-energy properties and topological features through the Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) duality transformation. We argue that distinct noninvertible symmetry-enriched QCPs can not be smoothly connected without a phase transition or a multi-critical point.</description>

      <title>Designer gapped and tilted Dirac cones in lateral graphene superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a planar array of bipolar waveguides in graphene can be used to engineer gapped and tilted two-dimensional Dirac cones within the electronic band structure. The presence of these gapped and tilted Dirac cones is demonstrated through a superlattice tight-binding model and verified using a transfer matrix calculation. By varying the applied gate voltages, the tilt parameter of these Dirac cones can be controlled and their gaps can be tuned to fall in the terahertz range. The possibility of gate-tunable gapped Dirac cones gives rise to terahertz applications via interband transitions and designer Landau level spectra both of which can be controlled via Dirac cone engineering. We anticipate that our paper will encourage Dirac cone tilt and gap engineering for gate-tunable device applications in lateral graphene superlattices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Lieb-Robinson bounds for commuting long-range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have revealed the intricate effect of long-range interactions on information transport in quantum many-body systems: In $D$ spatial dimensions, interactions decaying as a power-law $r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha &gt; 2D+1$ exhibit a Lieb-Robinson bound (LRB) with a linear light cone and the threshold $2D+1$ is sharp in general. Here, we observe that mutually commuting, long-range interactions satisfy an enhanced LRB of the form $t \, r^{-\alpha}$ for any $\alpha &gt; 0$. In particular, the linear light cone occurs at $\alpha = 1$ in any dimension. Part of our motivation stems from quantum error-correcting codes. As applications, we derive enhanced bounds on ground state correlations and an enhanced local perturbations perturb locally (LPPL) principle for which we adapt a recent subharmonicity argument of Wang-Hazzard. Similar enhancements hold for commuting interactions with stretched exponential decay.</description>

      <title>Diode effect in Fraunhofer patterns of disordered multi-terminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the role of different spatial inhomogeneities in generating the conditions for the appearance of a superconducting diode effect in the Fraunhofer pattern of wide Josephson junctions. Through the scattering matrix approach, we highlight the role of mirror symmetry of the junction in forbidding the diode effect in both the two-terminal and the multi-terminal case. As sources of mirror symmetry breaking, we study spatial potentials of long and short wavelength with respect to the size of the system, mimicking the effect of side gates and atomic scale disorder, respectively, as well as the geometry of the junction, and assess their impact on the diode effect. As a common trend, we observe qualitatively similar rectification patterns magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern by destructing interference. In multi-terminal mirror-symmetric setups, we single out the phase at additional terminals as a controllable knob to tune the diode effect at the finite field. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in wide junctions.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Klein-Gordon and Dirac oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have recently shown that the space of initial data (covariant phase space) of the relativistic oscillator in Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ is a homogeneous K\"ahler-Einstein manifold $Z_6$=AdS$_7$/U(1)=U(3,1)/U(3)$\times$U(1). It was also shown that the energy eigenstates of the quantum relativistic oscillator form a direct sum of two weighted Bergman spaces of holomorphic (particles) and antiholomorphic (antiparticles) square-integrable functions on the covariant phase space $Z_6$ of the classical oscillator. Here we show that the covariant phase space of the supersymmetric version of the relativistic oscillator (oscillating spinning particle) is the odd tangent bundle of the space $Z_6$. Quantizing this model yields a Dirac oscillator equation on the phase space whose solution space is a direct sum of two spinor spaces parametrized by holomorphic and antiholomorphic functions on the odd tangent bundle of $Z_6$. After expanding the general solution in Grassmann variables, we obtain components of the spinor field that are holomorphic and antiholomorphic functions from Bergman spaces on $Z_6$ with different weight functions. Thus, the supersymmetric model under consideration is exactly solvable, Lorentz covariant and unitary.</description>

      <title>Continuous Approximation of the Fully Connected Ising Hamiltonian: Exact Ground State Solutions for a Novel Class of Ising Models with Applications to Fidelity Assessment in Ising Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel analytical approach to solving large-scale Ising problems by reformulating the discrete Ising Hamiltonian into a continuous framework. This transformation enables us to derive exact solutions for a non-trivial class of fully connected Ising models. To validate our method, we conducted numerical experiments comparing our analytical solutions with those obtained from a quantum-inspired Ising algorithm and a quantum Ising machine. The results demonstrate that the quantum-inspired algorithm and brute-force method successfully align with our solutions, while the quantum Ising machine exhibits notable deviations. Our method offers promising avenues for analytically solving diverse Ising problem instances, while the class of Ising problems addressed here provides a robust framework for assessing the fidelity of Ising machines.</description>

      <title>Below threshold nonsequential double ionization with linearly polarized two-color fields I: symmetry and dominance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate laser-induced nonsequential double ionization with linearly polarized bichromatic fields, focusing on the recollision-excitation with subsequent ionization (RESI) mechanism. Using the strong-field approximation, we assess how the symmetries of the field influence the dominant events. Furthermore, we show that, by manipulating the field parameters such as the field frequencies and relative phase between the two driving waves, one can influence the correlated electron-momentum distributions. Specific features of a linearly polarized bichromatic field are that the momentum distributions of the second electron are no longer centered around vanishing momenta and that there may be more than one ionization event per half cycle. This can be used to confine the RESI distributions to specific momentum regions and to determine a hierarchy of parameters that make an event dominant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The backreaction of quantum degrees of freedom on classical backgrounds is a poorly understood topic in theoretical physics. Most often it is treated within the semiclassical approximation with the help of various ad hoc prescriptions accounting for the effect of quantum excitations on the dynamics of the background. We focus on two popular ones: (i) the mean-field approximation whereby quantum degrees of freedom couple to the classical background via their quantum expectation values; (ii) the (stochastic) Truncated Wigner method whereby the fully coupled system is evolved using classical equations of motion for various randomly sampled initial conditions of the quantum degree of freedom, and a statistical average is performed a posteriori. We evaluate the performance of each method in a simple toy model against a fully quantum mechanical treatment, and identify its regime of validity. We interpret the results in terms of quantum entanglement and loss of classicality of the background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a small system is coupled to a bath, it is generally assumed that the state of the bath remains unaffected by the system due to the bath's large number of degrees of freedom. Here we show theoretically that this assumption can be easily violated for photonic baths typically used in experiments involving superconducting circuits. We analyze the dynamics of a voltage-biased Josephson junction coupled to a photonic bath, represented as a long Josephson junction chain. Our findings show that the system can reach a non-equilibrium steady state where the photonic degrees of freedom become significantly overheated, leading to a qualitative change in the current-voltage $I-V$ curve. This phenomenon is analogous to the Joule effect observed in electrical conductors, where flowing current can substantially heat up electrons. Recognizing this effect is crucial for the many applications of high-impedance environments in quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modular crossed product algebras have recently assumed an important role in perturbative quantum gravity as they lead to an intrinsic regularization of entanglement entropies by introducing quantum reference frames (QRFs) in place of explicit regulators. This is achieved by imposing certain boost constraints on gravitons, QRFs and other fields. Here, we revisit the question of how these constraints should be understood through the lens of perturbation theory and particularly the study of linearization (in)stabilities, exploring when linearized solutions can be integrated to exact ones. Our aim is to provide some clarity about the status of justification, under various conditions, for imposing such constraints on the linearized theory in the $G_N\to0$ limit as they turn out to be of second-order. While for spatially compact spacetimes there is an essentially unambiguous justification, in the presence of boundaries or the absence of isometries this depends on whether one is also interested in second-order observables. Linearization (in)stabilities occur in any gauge-covariant field theory with non-linear equations and to address this in a unified framework, we translate the subject from the usual canonical formulation into a systematic covariant phase space language. This overcomes theory-specific arguments, exhibiting the universal structure behind (in)stabilities, and permits us to cover arbitrary generally covariant theories. We comment on the relation to modular flow and illustrate our findings in several gravity and gauge theory examples.</description>

      <title>Operator Valued Flow Equation Approach to the Bosonic Lattice Polaron: Dispersion Renormalization Beyond the Fr\"ohlich Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the ground state properties of a lattice Bose polaron, a quasiparticle arising from the interaction between an impurity confined to an optical lattice and a surrounding homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate hosting phononic modes. We present an extension of Wegner's and Wilson's flow equation approach, the operator valued flow equation approach, which allows us to calculate the renormalized dispersion of the polaron and assess the role of two-phonon scattering processes on the dispersion. The results obtained in this way are compared to a variational mean-field approach. We find that in certain impurity phonon interaction regimes the shape of the dispersion is significantly altered by the inclusion of two-phonon scattering events as opposed to only single-phonon scattering events. Moreover, our results predict that a polaronic bound state may emerge, which is not present in Fr\"ohlich-type models that only consider single-phonon scattering events.</description>

Abstract: We study the collapse of an attractive Bose-Einstein condensate, where an unstable system evolves towards a singularity, by numerically solving the underlying cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We find good agreement between our simulations and the atom-loss measurements with a $^{39}$K condensate. Our simulations reveal an interplay of weak collapse and the propensity of the system to form a hotspot, and we uncover new scaling laws that govern this behavior. We also identify promising signatures of the theoretically predicted, but so far experimentally elusive, elastic three-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Bohmian Mechanics at Space-Time Singularities. I. Timelike Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0070</link>
      <description>arXiv:0708.0070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an extension of Bohmian mechanics to a curved background space-time containing a singularity. The present paper focuses on timelike singularities. We use the naked timelike singularity of the super-critical Reissner-Nordstrom geometry as an example. While one could impose boundary conditions at the singularity that would prevent the particles from falling into the singularity, we are interested here in the case in which particles have positive probability to hit the singularity and get annihilated. The wish for reversibility, equivariance, and the Markov property then dictates that particles must also be created by the singularity, and indeed dictates the rate at which this must occur. That is, a stochastic law prescribes what comes out of the singularity. We specify explicit equations of a model involving an interior-boundary condition on the wave function at the singularity, which can be used also in other versions of quantum theory besides Bohmian mechanics. As the resulting theory involves particle creation and annihilation, it can be regarded as a quantum field theory, and the stochastic process for the Bohmian particles is analogous to Bell-type quantum field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.07795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify points of difference between Invariant Set Theory and standard quantum theory, and show that these lead to noticeable differences in predictions between the two theories. We design a number of experiments to test which of these predictions corresponds to our world. If these experiments were undertaken, they would allow us to investigate whether standard quantum theory or invariant set theory best describes reality. These tests can also be deployed on theories sharing similar properties (e.g. Penrose's gravitational collapse theory).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.06872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of tensor network based machine learning methods to scale to large image and text data sets. For that, we study how the mutual information between a subregion and its complement scales with the subsystem size $L$, similarly to how it is done in quantum many-body physics. We find that for text, the mutual information scales as a power law $L^\nu$ with a close to volume law exponent, indicating that text cannot be efficiently described by 1D tensor networks. For images, the scaling is close to an area law, hinting at 2D tensor networks such as PEPS could have an adequate expressibility. For the numerical analysis, we introduce a mutual information estimator based on autoregressive networks, and we also use convolutional neural networks in a neural estimator method.</description>

      <title>Can multipartite entanglement be characterized by two-point connected correlation functions ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.03605v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss under which conditions multipartite entanglement in mixed quantum states can be characterized only in terms of two-point connected correlation functions, as it is the case for pure states. In turn, the latter correlations are defined via a suitable combination of (disconnected) one- and two-point correlation functions. In contrast to the case of pure states, conditions to be satisfied turn out to be rather severe. However, we were able to identify some interesting cases, as when the point-independence is valid of the one-point correlations in each possible decomposition of the density matrix, or when the operators that enter in the correlations are (semi-)positive/negative defined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gate-teleportation circuits are arguably among the most basic examples of computations believed to provide a quantum computational advantage: In seminal work [Quantum Inf. Comput., 4(2):134--145], Terhal and DiVincenzo have shown that these circuits elude simulation by efficient classical algorithms under plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions. Here we consider possibilistic simulation [Phys. Rev. A 106, 062430 (2022)], a particularly weak form of this task where the goal is to output any string appearing with non-zero probability in the output distribution of the circuit. We show that even for single-qubit Clifford-gate-teleportation circuits this simulation problem cannot be solved by constant-depth classical circuits with bounded fan-in gates. Our results are unconditional and are obtained by a reduction to the problem of computing the parity, a well-studied problem in classical circuit complexity.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for classical Boolean functions via adaptive measurements: Exponential reductions in space-time resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The limited computational power of constant-depth quantum circuits can be boosted by adapting future gates according to the outcomes of mid-circuit measurements. We formulate computation of a variety of Boolean functions in the framework of adaptive measurement-based quantum computation using a cluster state resource and a classical side-processor that can add bits modulo 2, so-called $l2$-MBQC. Our adaptive approach overcomes a known challenge that computing these functions in the nonadaptive setting requires a resource state that is exponentially large in the size of the computational input. In particular, we construct adaptive $l2$-MBQC algorithms based on the quantum signal processing technique that compute the mod-$p$ functions with the best known scaling in the space-time resources (i.e., qubit count, quantum circuit depth, classical memory size, and number of calls to the side-processor). As the subject is diverse and has a long history, the paper includes reviews of several previously constructed algorithms and recasts them as adaptive $l2$-MBQCs using cluster state resources. Our results constitute an alternative proof of an old theorem regarding an oracular separation between the power of constant-depth quantum circuits and constant-depth classical circuits with unbounded fan-in NAND and mod-$p$ gates for any prime $p$.</description>

      <title>Homological Quantum Rotor Codes: Logical Qubits from Torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13723v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formally define homological quantum rotor codes which use multiple quantum rotors to encode logical information. These codes generalize homological or CSS quantum codes for qubits or qudits, as well as linear oscillator codes which encode logical oscillators. Unlike for qubits or oscillators, homological quantum rotor codes allow one to encode both logical rotors and logical qudits in the same block of code, depending on the homology of the underlying chain complex. In particular, a code based on the chain complex obtained from tessellating the real projective plane or a M\"{o}bius strip encodes a qubit. We discuss the distance scaling for such codes which can be more subtle than in the qubit case due to the concept of logical operator spreading by continuous stabilizer phase-shifts. We give constructions of homological quantum rotor codes based on 2D and 3D manifolds as well as products of chain complexes. Superconducting devices being composed of islands with integer Cooper pair charges could form a natural hardware platform for realizing these codes: we show that the $0$-$\pi$-qubit as well as Kitaev's current-mirror qubit -- also known as the M\"{o}bius strip qubit -- are indeed small examples of such codes and discuss possible extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Processing large amounts of data to this day causes difficulties due to the lack of power resources. Classical algorithms implement a chain of actions, requiring a certain time to execute, as well as space in the form of RAM. Parallelization, if it can be used, allows to gain time, but also needs buffering of all parallel actions. Quantum computing acts as an attractive alternative to parallel computing with qubits, qudits and their distinctive properties. The quantum algorithm proposed in this paper allows to search for the best (closest to a given) element in a random data array by storing all its initial elements in a superposition. This allows to perform the search operations on all elements at the same time and due to the same to save the amount of RAM.</description>

      <title>Synthetic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories based on parametric excitations of trapped ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed scheme for the analog quantum simulation of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories in crystals of trapped ions, which exploits a more efficient hybrid encoding of the gauge and matter fields using the native internal and motional degrees of freedom. We introduce a versatile toolbox based on parametric excitations corresponding to different spin-motion-coupling schemes that induce a tunneling of the ions vibrational excitations conditioned to their internal qubit state. This building block, when implemented with a single trapped ion, corresponds to a minimal $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, where the qubit plays the role of the gauge field on a synthetic link, and the vibrational excitations along different trap axes mimic the dynamical matter fields two synthetic sites, each carrying a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge. To evaluate their feasibility, we perform numerical simulations of the state-dependent tunneling using realistic parameters, and identify the leading sources of error in future experiments. We discuss how to generalise this minimal case to more complex settings by increasing the number of ions, moving from a single link to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ plaquette, and to an entire $\mathbb{Z}_2$ chain. We present analytical expressions for the gauge-invariant dynamics and the corresponding confinement, which are benchmarked using matrix product state simulations.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Quantum Advantage in Communication with Minimal Input Scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In communication complexity-like problems, previous studies have shown either an exponential quantum advantage or an unbounded quantum advantage with an exponentially large input set $\Theta(2^{n})$ bits with respect to classical communication $\Theta(n)$ bits. In the former, the quantum and classical separation grows exponentially in input while the latter's quantum communication resource is a constant. Remarkably, it was still open whether an unbounded quantum advantage exists while the inputs do not scale exponentially. Here we answer this question affirmatively using an input size of optimal order. Considering two variants as tasks: 1) distributed computation of relation and 2) {\it relation reconstruction}, we study the one-way zero-error communication complexity of a relation induced by a distributed clique labelling problem for orthogonality graphs. While we prove no quantum advantage in the first task, we show an {\it unbounded quantum advantage} in relation reconstruction without public coins. Specifically, for a class of graphs with order $m$, the quantum complexity is $\Theta(1)$ while the classical complexity is $\Theta(\log m)$. Remarkably, the input size is $\Theta(\log m)$ bits and the order of its scaling with respect to classical communication is {\it minimal}. This is exponentially better compared to previous works. Additionally, we prove a lower bound (linear in the number of maximum cliques) on the amount of classical public coin necessary to overcome the separation in the scenario of restricted communication and connect this to the existence of Orthogonal Arrays. Finally, we highlight some applications of this task to semi-device-independent dimension witnessing as well as to the detection of Mutually Unbiased Bases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exchangeability is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It allows to model situations where the order of observations does not matter. The classical de Finetti's theorem provides a representation of infinitely exchangeable sequences of random variables as mixtures of independent and identically distributed variables. The quantum de Finetti theorem extends this result to symmetric quantum states on tensor product Hilbert spaces. It is well known that both theorems do not hold for finitely exchangeable sequences. The aim of this work is to investigate two lesser-known representation theorems, which were developed in classical probability theory to extend de Finetti's theorem to finitely exchangeable sequences by using quasi-probabilities and quasi-expectations. With the aid of these theorems, we illustrate how a de Finetti-like representation theorem for finitely exchangeable sequences can be formulated through a mathematical representation which is formally equivalent to quantum theory (with boson-symmetric density matrices). We then show a promising application of this connection to the challenge of defining entanglement for indistinguishable bosons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we investigate no-resonance conditions for quantum many body chaotic systems and random matrix models. No-resonance conditions are properties of the spectrum of a model, usually employed as a theoretical tool in the analysis of late time dynamics. The first order no-resonance condition holds when a spectrum is non-degenerate, while higher order no-resonance conditions imply sums of an equal number of energies are non-degenerate outside of permutations of the indices. This resonance condition is usually assumed to hold for quantum chaotic models. In this work we use several tests from random matrix theory to demonstrate that the statistics of sums of eigenvalues, that are of interest to due to the no-resonance conditions, have Poisson statistics, and lack level repulsion. This result is produced for both a quantum chaotic Hamiltonian as well as the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble and Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble. This implies some models may have violations of the no-resonance condition or "near" violations. We finish the paper by generalizing important bounds in quantum equilibration theory to cases where the no-resonance conditions are violated, and to the case of random matrix models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12702v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a classical algorithm for simulating universal quantum circuits composed of "free" nearest-neighbour matchgates or equivalently fermionic-linear-optical (FLO) gates, and "resourceful" non-Gaussian gates. We achieve the promotion of the efficiently simulable FLO subtheory to universal quantum computation by gadgetizing controlled phase gates with arbitrary phases employing non-Gaussian resource states. Our key contribution is the development of a novel phase-sensitive algorithm for simulating FLO circuits. This allows us to decompose the resource states arising from gadgetization into free states at the level of statevectors rather than density matrices. The runtime cost of our algorithm for estimating the Born-rule probability of a given quantum circuit scales polynomially in all circuit parameters, except for a linear dependence on the newly introduced FLO extent, which scales exponentially with the number of controlled-phase gates. More precisely, as a result of finding optimal decompositions of relevant resource states, the runtime doubles for every maximally resourceful (e.g., swap or CZ) gate added. Crucially, this cost compares very favourably with the best known prior algorithm, where each swap gate increases the simulation cost by a factor of approximately 9. For a quantum circuit containing arbitrary FLO unitaries and $k$ controlled-Z gates, we obtain an exponential improvement $O(4.5^k)$ over the prior state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Extending Classically Simulatable Bounds of Clifford Circuits with Nonstabilizer States via Framed Wigner Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wigner function formalism has played a pivotal role in examining the non-classical aspects of quantum states and their classical simulatability. Nevertheless, its application in qubit systems faces limitations due to negativity induced by Clifford gates. In this work, we propose a novel classical simulation method for qubit Clifford circuits based on the framed Wigner function, an extended form of the Wigner function with an additional phase degree of freedom. In our framework, Clifford gates do not induce negativity by switching to a suitable frame; thereby, a wide class of nonstabilizer states can be represented positively. By leveraging this technique, we show that some marginal outcomes of Clifford circuits with nonstabilizer state inputs can be efficiently sampled at polynomial time and memory costs. We develop a graph-theoretical approach to identify classically simulatable marginal outcomes and apply it to log-depth random Clifford circuits. We also present the outcome probability estimation scheme using the framed Wigner function and discuss its precision. Our approach opens new avenues for utilizing quasi-probabilities to explore classically simulatable quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Universal validity of the second law of information thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adiabatic measurements, followed by feedback and erasure protocols, have often been considered as a model to embody Maxwell's Demon paradox and to study the interplay between thermodynamics and information processing. Such studies have led to the conclusion, now widely accepted in the community, that Maxwell's Demon and the second law of thermodynamics can peacefully coexist because any gain provided by the demon must be offset by the cost of performing the measurement and resetting the demon's memory to its initial state. Statements of this kind are collectively referred to as second laws of information thermodynamics and have recently been extended to include quantum theoretical scenarios. However, previous studies in this direction have made several assumptions, particularly about the feedback process and the demon's memory readout, and thus arrived at statements that are not universally applicable and whose range of validity is not clear. In this work, we fill this gap by precisely characterizing the full range of quantum feedback control and erasure protocols that are overall consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. This leads us to conclude that the second law of information thermodynamics is indeed universal: it must hold for any quantum feedback control and erasure protocol, regardless of the measurement process involved, as long as the protocol is overall compatible with thermodynamics. Our comprehensive analysis not only encompasses new scenarios but also retrieves previous ones, doing so with fewer assumptions. This simplification contributes to a clearer understanding of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement, a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, has captured significant attention in the era of quantum information science. In multipartite quantum systems, entanglement plays a crucial role in facilitating various quantum information processing tasks, such as quantum teleportation and dense coding. In this article, we review the theory of multipartite entanglement measures, with a particular focus on the genuine as well as the operational meaning of multipartite entanglement measures. By providing a thorough and valuable insight on this field, we hope that this review would inspire and guide researchers in their endeavors to further develop novel approaches for characterizing multipartite entanglement.</description>

      <title>Physical Meaning of Neumann and Robin Boundary Conditions for the Schr\"odinger Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-relativistic Schr\"odinger equation on a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with boundary is often considered with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions ($\psi(x)=0$ for $x$ on the boundary), homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions ($\partial_n \psi(x)=0$ for $x$ on the boundary and $\partial_n$ the normal derivative), or Robin boundary conditions ($\partial_n\psi(x)=\alpha\psi(x)$ for $x$ on the boundary and $\alpha$ a real parameter). Physically, the Dirichlet condition applies if the potential is much higher outside than inside the domain (``potential well''). We ask, when does the Neumann or Robin condition apply physically? Our answer is, when the potential is much lower (at the appropriate level) in a thin layer along the surface of a potential well, or when a negative delta potential of the appropriate strength is added at a surface close to the surface of the potential well.</description>

      <title>Problem-tailored Simulation of Energy Transport on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03924v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of conserved quantities like spin and charge is fundamental to characterizing the behavior of quantum many-body systems. Numerically simulating such dynamics is generically challenging, which motivates the consideration of quantum computing strategies. However, the relatively high gate errors and limited coherence times of today's quantum computers pose their own challenge, highlighting the need to be frugal with quantum resources. In this work we report simulations on quantum hardware of infinite-temperature energy transport in the mixed-field Ising chain, a paradigmatic many-body system that can exhibit a range of transport behaviors at intermediate times. We consider a chain with $L=12$ sites and find results broadly consistent with those from ideal circuit simulators over 90 Trotter steps, containing up to 990 entangling gates. To obtain these results, we use two key problem-tailored insights. First, we identify a convenient basis$\unicode{x2013}$the Pauli $Y$ basis$\unicode{x2013}$in which to sample the infinite-temperature trace and provide theoretical and numerical justifications for its efficiency relative to, e.g., the computational basis. Second, in addition to a variety of problem-agnostic error mitigation strategies, we employ a renormalization strategy that compensates for global nonconservation of energy due to device noise. We discuss the applicability of the proposed sampling approach beyond the mixed-field Ising chain and formulate a variational method to search for a sampling basis with small sample-to-sample fluctuations for an arbitrary Hamiltonian. This opens the door to applying these techniques in more general models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gates form a powerful class of quantum gates, imparting arbitrarily chosen phases to the Fock states of a cavity. However, for short pulses, coherent errors limit the performance. Here we demonstrate in theory and experiment that such errors can be completely suppressed, provided that the pulse times exceed a specific limit. The resulting shorter gate times also reduce incoherent errors. Our approach needs only a small number of frequency components, the resulting pulses can be interpreted easily, and it is compatible with fault-tolerant schemes.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetry-breaking-coupling-enhanced sensing of quantum reservoirs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the utilization of a single generalized dephasing qubit for sensing a quantum reservoir, where the antisymmetric coupling between the qubit and its reservoir is broken. It is found that in addition to the decay factor encoding channel, the antisymmetric coupling breaking gives rise to another phase factor encoding channel. We introduce an optimal measurement for the generalized dephasing qubit which enables the practical measurement precision to reach the theoretical ultimate precision quantified by the quantum signal-to-noise ratio (QSNR). As an example, the generalized dephasing qubit is employed to estimate the $s$-wave scattering length of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. It is found that the phase-induced QSNR caused by the antisymmetric coupling breaking is at least two orders of magnitude higher than the decay-induced QSNR at the millisecond timescale and the optimal relative error can achieve a scaling $\propto 1/t$ with $t$ being the encoding time in long-term encoding. Our work opens a way for supersensitive sensing of quantum reservoirs.</description>

      <title>The classical-quantum limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard notion of a classical limit, represented schematically by $\hbar\rightarrow 0$, provides a method for approximating a quantum system by a classical one. In this work we explain why the standard classical limit fails when applied to subsystems, and show how one may resolve this by explicitly modelling the decoherence of a subsystem by its environment. Denoting the decoherence time $\tau$, we demonstrate that a double scaling limit in which $\hbar \rightarrow 0$ and $\tau \rightarrow 0$ such that the ratio $E_f =\hbar /\tau$ remains fixed leads to an irreversible open-system evolution with well-defined classical and quantum subsystems. The main technical result is showing that, for arbitrary Hamiltonians, the generators of partial versions of the Wigner, Husimi and Glauber-Sudarshan quasiprobability distributions may all be mapped in the above double scaling limit to the same completely-positive classical-quantum generator. This provides a regime in which one can study effective and consistent classical-quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We study a generic family of Lindblad master equations modeling bipartite open quantum systems, where one tries to stabilize a quantum system by carefully designing its interaction with another, dissipative, quantum system-a strategy known as quantum reservoir engineering. We provide sufficient conditions for convergence of the considered Lindblad equations; our setting accommodates the case where steady-states are not unique but rather supported on a given subspace of the underlying Hilbert space. We apply our result to a Lindblad master equation modeling engineered multi-photon emission and absorption processes, a setting that received considerable attention in recent years due to its potential applications for the stabilization of so-called cat qubits.</description>

      <title>Projective toric designs, quantum state designs, and mutually unbiased bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Toric $t$-designs, or equivalently $t$-designs on the diagonal subgroup of the unitary group, are sets of points on the torus over which sums reproduce integrals of degree $t$ monomials over the full torus. Motivated by the projective structure of quantum mechanics, we develop the notion of $t$-designs on the projective torus, which have a much more restricted structure than their counterparts on full tori. We provide various new constructions of toric and projective toric designs and prove bounds on their size. We draw connections between projective toric designs and a diverse set of mathematical objects, including difference and Sidon sets from the field of additive combinatorics, symmetric, informationally complete positive operator valued measures and complete sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) from quantum information theory, and crystal ball sequences of certain root lattices. Using these connections, we prove bounds on the maximal size of dense $B_t \bmod m$ sets. We also use projective toric designs to construct families of quantum state designs. In particular, we construct families of (uniformly-weighted) quantum state $2$-designs in dimension $d$ of size exactly $d(d+1)$ that do not form complete sets of MUBs, thereby disproving a conjecture concerning the relationship between designs and MUBs (Zhu 2015). We then propose a modification of Zhu's conjecture and discuss potential paths towards proving this conjecture. We prove a fundamental distinction between complete sets of MUBs in prime-power dimensions versus in dimension $6$ (and, we conjecture, in all non-prime-power dimensions), the distinction relating to group structure of the corresponding projective toric design. Finally, we discuss many open questions about the properties of these projective toric designs and how they relate to other questions in number theory, geometry, and quantum information.</description>

Abstract: The decoding of error syndromes of surface codes with classical algorithms may slow down quantum computation. To overcome this problem it is possible to implement decoding algorithms based on artificial neural networks. This work reports a study of decoders based on convolutional neural networks, tested on different code distances and noise models. The results show that decoders based on convolutional neural networks have good performance and can adapt to different noise models. Moreover, explainable machine learning techniques have been applied to the neural network of the decoder to better understand the behaviour and errors of the algorithm, in order to produce a more robust and performing algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random walk algorithms are crucial for sampling and approximation problems in statistical physics and theoretical computer science. The mixing property is necessary for Markov chains to approach stationary distributions and is facilitated by walks. Quantum walks show promise for faster mixing times than classical methods but lack universal proof, especially in finite group settings. Here, we investigate the continuous-time quantum walks on Cayley graphs of the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ for odd $n$, generated by the smallest inverse closed symmetric subset. We present a significant finding that, in contrast to the classical mixing time on these Cayley graphs, which typically takes at least order $\Omega(n^2 \log(1/2\epsilon))$, the continuous-time quantum walk mixing time on $D_{2n}$ is of order $O(n (\log n)^5 \log(1/\epsilon))$, achieving a quadratic improvement over the classical case. Our paper advances the general understanding of quantum walk mixing on Cayley graphs, highlighting the improved mixing time achieved by continuous-time quantum walks on $D_{2n}$. This work has potential applications in algorithms for a class of sampling problems based on non-abelian groups.</description>

Abstract: Photon blockade enhancement is an exciting and promising subject that has been well studied for photons in cavities. However, whether photon blockade can be enhanced in the output fields remains largely unexplored. We show that photon blockade can be greatly enhanced in the mixing output field of a nonlinear cavity and an auxiliary (linear) cavity, where no direct coupling between the nonlinear and auxiliary cavities is needed. We uncover a biquadratic scaling relation between the second-order correlation of the photons in the output field and intracavity nonlinear interaction strength, in contrast to a quadratic scaling relation for the photons in a nonlinear cavity. We identify that this scaling enhancement of photon blockade in the output field is induced by the destructive interference between two of the paths for two photons passing through the two cavities. We then extend the theory to the experimentally feasible Jaynes-Cummings model consisting of a two-level system strongly coupled to one of the two uncoupled cavities and also predict a biquadratic scaling law in the mixing output field. Our proposed scheme is general and can be extended to enhance blockade in other bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Tracking light-matter correlations in the Optical Bloch Equations: Dynamics, Energetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical Bloch Equations (OBEs) are coarse-grained equations modeling the dynamics of driven quantum emitters coupled to heat baths. At the fundamental level, they are derived from the evolution of isolated emitter-field systems ruled by autonomous collision models (ACMs), where the fields encompass both drives and baths. The OBEs have given rise to consistent thermodynamic analyses, where work (heat) flows from the drive (bath). These models do not explicitly capture the emitter-field correlations formed within each collision. Here we build a new kind of ACM which keeps track of these correlations, and exploit it to propose a new thermodynamic framework where correlations play a central role. Within each collision, each system is shown to be driven by an effective Hamiltonian, while a remnant term captures the effect of correlations. On the emitter side, this results in splitting the thermal dissipator in two terms: self-driving term proportional to the atom coherences in the energy basis, and a correlation term. On the field side, the two respectively impact the field amplitude and fluctuations, resulting in a physically observable splitting. Following this, we define work-like (heat-like) flows as the energy changes stemming from the effective Hamiltonian dynamics (correlating processes) which are accessible through -dyne or spectroscopic measurements. Our approach differs from former analyses by the emitter self-work, yielding a tighter expression of the second law. We relate this tightening to the extra-knowledge about the field state, as compared to open system frameworks. This new ACM can be extended to study the impact of correlations on various quantum open systems. It deepens the current understanding of quantum thermodynamics, energy management at quantum scales and can be probed in state-of-the-art quantum hardware, such as superconducting and photonic circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments have revealed deterministic and exact protocols for performing complex conjugation, inversion, and transposition of a general $d$-dimensional unknown unitary operation using a finite number of queries to a black-box unitary operation. In this work, we establish analytical lower bounds for the query complexity of unitary inversion, transposition, and complex conjugation. Specifically, our lower bound of $d^2$ for unitary inversion demonstrates the asymptotic optimality of the deterministic exact inversion protocol, which operates with $O(d^2)$ queries. We introduce a novel framework utilizing differentiation to derive these lower bounds on query complexity for general differentiable functions $f: \mathrm{SU}(d)\to \mathrm{SU}(d)$. As a corollary, we prove that a catalytic protocol -- a new concept recently noted in the study of exact unitary inversion -- is impossible for unitary complex conjugation. Furthermore, we extend our framework to the probabilistic setting, where transformations must succeed with a certain probability, revealing a potential trade-off between the number of queries and the required success probability.</description>

Abstract: Nonclassical states are an important class of states in quantum mechanics, particularly for applications in quantum information theory. Optomechanical systems are invaluable platforms for exploring and harnessing these states. In this study, we focus on a mirror-in-the-middle optomechanical system. In the absence of losses, a separable state, composed of the product of coherent states, evolves into an entangled state. Furthermore, we demonstrate that generating a two-mode Schr\"odinger-cat state depends on the optomechanical coupling. Additionally, when the optical modes are uncoupled from the mechanical mode, we find no entanglement for certain nonzero optomechanical coupling intensities. We exactly solve the Gorini-Kossalokowinki-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation, highlighting the direct influence of the reservoir on the dynamics when mechanical losses are considered. Then, we discuss vacuum one-photon superposition states to obtain exact entanglement dynamics using concurrence as a quantifier. Our results show that mechanical losses in the mirror attenuate the overall entanglement of the system.</description>

For manufacturers, the conventional method of assessing the quantumness of single-photon-based QRNGs through mean and variance comparisons of photon counts is statistically unreliable due to finite sample sizes. Given the sub-Poissonian statistics of single photons, confirming the underlying distribution is crucial for validating a QRNG's quantumness. We propose a more efficient two-fold statistical approach to ensure the quantumness of optical sources with the desired confidence level. Additionally, we demonstrate that the output of QRNGs from exponential and uniform distributions exhibit similarity under device noise, deriving corresponding photon statistics and conditions for $\epsilon$-randomness.
  From the user's perspective, the fundamental parameters of a QRNG are quantumness, efficiency (random entropy and random number generation rate), and cost. Our analysis reveals that these parameters depend on three factors, namely, expected photon count per unit time, external reference cycle duration, and detection efficiency. A lower expected photon count enhances entropy but increases cost and decreases the generation rate. A shorter external reference cycle boosts entropy but must exceed a minimum threshold to minimize timing errors, with minor impacts on cost and rate. Lower detection efficiency enhances entropy and lowers cost but reduces the generation rate. Finally, to validate our results, we perform statistical tests like NIST, Dieharder, AIS-31, ENT etc. over the data simulated with different values of the above parameters. Our findings can empower manufacturers to customize QRNGs to meet user needs effectively.</description>

      <title>Refrence-Frame-Independent Quantum Key Distribution over 250 km of Optical Fiber</title>

Abstract: The reference-frame-independent quantum key distribution (RFI QKD) protocol enables QKD systems to function effectively despite slowly varying reference frames, offering a distinct advantage in practical scenarios, particularly in mobile platforms. In this study, we successfully distribute secure key bits over a 250-km optical fiber distance by developing an RFI QKD system with a repetition rate of 150 MHz. Benefiting from high repetition rate, we achieve a finite-key secret key rate of 49.65 bit/s at a distance of 200 km, which is more than three times higher than state-of-the-art systems. Our work dramatically extends the transmission distance and enhances the secret key rate of RFI QKD, significantly promoting its practical application.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers have attracted much attention in recent years. This is because the development of the actual quantum machine is accelerating. Research on how to use quantum computers is active in the fields such as quantum chemistry and machine learning, where vast amounts of computation are required. However, in weather and climate simulations, less research has been done despite similar computational demands. In this study, a quantum computing algorithm is applied to a problem of the atmospheric science. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using a quantum simulator. The results show that it can achieve the same simulations as a conventional algorithm designed for classical computers. More specifically, the stochastically fluctuating behavior of a multi-cloud model was obtained using classical Monte Carlo method, and comparable results are also achieved by utilizing probabilistic outputs of computed quantum states. Our results show that quantum computers have a potential to be useful for the atmospheric and oceanic science, in which stochasticity is widely inherent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design and explore patterned aperiodic lattices consisting of coupled isospectral cells that vary across the lattice. Each resulting band consists of three distinct energy domains with two mobility edges marking the transition from single center localized to delocalized states and vice versa. The characteristic localization length emerges due to a competition of the involved phase gradient on basis of a local rotation and the coupling between the cells which allows us to understand the localization mechanism and its evolution. The fraction of localized versus delocalized eigenstates can be tuned by changing the gradient between the cells of the lattice. We outline the perspectives of investigation of this novel class of isospectrally patterned aperiodic lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation via Free Binary Decision Diagram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01671v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation (QSP) is a fundamental task in quantum computation to prepare a quantum state for a given classical description of the quantum state. The classical description of an $n$-qubit quantum state may have $\exp(O(n))$ parameters in general, which are inherently inefficient to deal with in the worst case; however, in many practical cases, we may be able to employ suitable data structures to represent such large-scale data in a compressed way, e.g., by using a free binary decision diagram (FBDD), a rooted directed acyclic graph with two terminal nodes to concisely represent a Boolean function. We here construct a quantum algorithm for QSP when the classical description of a quantum state is given by an FBDD with weighted edges, and analyze the space, and time complexity of QSP in this setting. We provide a nontrivial example of an $n$-qubit state that can be represented by a weighted FBDD with $N=O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ nodes rather than $\mathrm{exp}(O(n))$. We show that any quantum state represented by the weighted FBDD with $N$ nodes can be prepared by an $O(N)$-sized quantum circuit using $N$ ancillary qubits, exponentially improving the required circuit size for QSP compared to other BDD-based QSPs. We also provide another example of an $n$-qubit state that can be represented by a weighted FBDD with $N=O(n^2)$ nodes, and $O(n^2)$ ancillary qubits, but cannot be prepared efficiently by a QSP based on the amplitude amplification. These results provide techniques to employ FBDDs as a tool for broadening the possibility of efficient QSP.</description>

      <title>Motion-driven quantum dissipation in an open electronic system with nonlocal interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates with relative motion. We model the degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field and select a nonlocal potential to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, assuming one plate slides relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. The numerical plots show that, as a function of momentum the vacuum occupation number is isotropic for a motion speed v = 0 and anisotropic for nonzero v. Due to energy transfer between the plates, the process of relative motion induces on-shell excitations, similar to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Therefore, we can study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces via quantum action. The numerical results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action for the motion boost and the dissipative force have a threshold as a function of v, and both are positively correlated with v.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a graphical method to describe and analyze non-Gaussian quantum states using a hypergraph framework. These states are pivotal resources for quantum computing, communication, and metrology, but their characterization is hindered by their complex high-order correlations. The formalism encapsulates transformation rules for any Gaussian unitary operation and local quadrature measurement, offering a visually intuitive tool for manipulating such states through experimentally feasible pathways. Notably, we develop methods for the generation of complex hypergraph states with more or higher-order hyperedges from simple structures through Gaussian operations only, facilitated by our graphical rules. We present illustrative examples on the preparation of non-Gaussian states rooted in these graph-based formalisms, revealing their potential to advance continuous-variable general quantum computing capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of diamond Lamb wave resonators that feature mechanical compression modes with ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin properties. The degree of localization in the mechanical Wannier-Stark ladder, which is determined by the ratio of coupling rate to frequency spacing between adjacent resonators, sets the effective range of phonon-mediated coupling between spin qubits. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been developed and analyzed. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the proposed Wannier-Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental imperfections. The development of quantum networks of spin qubits with long-range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly developed quantum low-density parity-check codes in a solid-state system.</description>

Abstract: We introduce semidefinite programming hierarchies for benchmarking relevant entanglement properties in the high-dimensional steering scenario. Firstly, we provide a general method for detecting the entanglement dimensionality through certification of the Schmidt number. Its key feature is that the computational cost is independent of the Schmidt number under consideration. Secondly, we provide a method to estimate the fidelity of the source with any maximally entangled state. Using only basic computational means, we demonstrate the usefulness of these methods, which can be directly used to analyse experiments on high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main obstacles for achieving a practical quantum advantage in quantum computing lies in the relatively small number of qubits currently available in quantum hardware. Here, we show how to circumvent this problem in the context of eigenvalue problems obtained by the finite element method, via the use of an adaptive algorithm for quantum annealers -- the Adaptive Quantum Annealer Eigensolver (AQAE) -- in a way that only a few qubits are required to achieve a high precision. As an example, we apply AQAE to eigenvalue problems that are relevant in a wide range of contexts, such as electromagnetism, acoustics and seismology, and quantify its robustness against different types of experimental errors. Our approach could be applied to other algorithms, and makes it possible to take the most of current Noisy-Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices.</description>

      <title>How to correct Ehrenfest nonadiabatic dynamics in open quantum systems: Ehrenfest plus random force (E$+$$\sigma$) dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One key challenge in the study of nonadiabatic dynamics in open quantum systems is to balance computational efficiency and accuracy. Although Ehrenfest dynamics (ED) is computationally efficient and well-suited for large complex systems, ED often yields inaccurate results. To address these limitations, we improve the accuracy of the traditional ED by adding a random force (E$+$$\sigma$). In this work, the construction of random forces is considered in Markovian and non-Markovian scenarios, and we ensure the dynamics satisfy the detailed balance in both scenarios. By comparing our E$+$$\sigma$ with existing methods such as the electronic friction model and surface hopping, we furthermore validate its reliability. In addition, E$+$$\sigma$ model still retains the high efficiency of the ED and does not incur much additional computation. We believe that this method provides an alternative to accurately describe mixed quantum-classical dynamics in open quantum systems, particularly for large complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information entropy is regarded as a measure of coherence between the observed system and the environment or between many-body. It is commonly described as the uncertainty and purity of a mixed state of a quantum system. Different from traditional information entropy, we introduce a new perspective, aiming to decompose the quantum state and focus on the total amount of information contained in the components that constitute the legal quantum state itself. Based on $\chi^2$ divergence, we define the posterior information content of quantum pure states. We analytically proved that the upper bound of the posterior information of a 2-qubit system is exactly equal to 2. At the same time, we found that when the number of qubits n&gt;2 in the quantum system, the process of calculating the upper bound of the posterior information can always be summarized as a standard semi-definite programming. Combined with numerical experiments, we generalized the previous hypothesis: A composite quantum system composed of n-qubits, the upper bound of the posterior information should be equal to n.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum collision describe open quantum systems through repeated interactions with a coarse-grained environment. However, a complete certification of these models is lacking, as no complete error bounds on the simulation of system observables have been established. Here, we show that Markovian and non-Markovian collision models can be recovered analytically from chain mapping techniques starting from a general microscopic Hamiltonian. This derivation reveals a previously unidentified source of error -- induced by an unfaithful sampling of the environment -- in dynamics obtained with collision models that can become dominant for small but finite time-steps. With the complete characterization of this error, all collision models errors are now identified and quantified, which enables the promotion of collision models to the class of numerically exact methods. To confirm the predictions of our equivalence results, we implemented a non-Markovian collision model of the Spin Boson Model, and identified, as predicted, a regime in which the collision model is fundamentally inaccurate.</description>

      <title>From classical probability densities to quantum states: quantization of Gaussians for arbitrary orderings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary focus of this work is to investigate how the most emblematic classical probability density, namely a Gaussian, can be mapped to a valid quantum states. To explore this issue, we consider a Gaussian whose squared variance depends on a parameter $\lambda$. Specifically, depending on the value of $\lambda$, we study what happens in the classical-quantum correspondence as we change the indeterminacy of the classical particle. Furthermore, finding a correspondence between a classical state and a quantum state is not a trivial task. Quantum observables, described by Hermitian operators, do not generally commute, so a precise ordering must be introduced to resolve this ambiguity. In this work, we study two different arbitrary orderings: the first is an arbitrary ordering of the position and momentum observables; the second, which is the main focus of the present work, is an arbitrary ordering of the annihilation and creation operators. In this latter case, we find the interesting result that even a $\delta$-function, which in general has no quantum correspondence, can be mapped into a valid quantum state for a particular ordering, specifically the antinormal one (all creation operators are to the right of all annihilation operators in the product). This means that the Gaussian probability density corresponds to a valid quantum state, regardless of how localized classical particles are in phase space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage via Solving Multivariate Quadratics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new way to (non-interactively, verifiably) demonstrate Quantum Advantage by solving the average-case $\mathsf{NP}$ search problem of finding a solution to a system of (underdetermined) multivariate quadratic equations over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_2$ drawn from a specified distribution. In particular, we design a distribution of degree-2 polynomials $\{p_i(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\}_{i\in [m]}$ for $m&lt;n$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$ for which we show that there is a quantum polynomial-time algorithm that simultaneously solves $\{p_i(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=y_i\}_{i\in [m]}$ for a random vector $(y_1,\ldots,y_m)$. On the other hand, while a solution exists with high probability, we conjecture that it is classically hard to find one based on classical cryptanalysis that we provide, including a comprehensive review of all known relevant classical algorithms for solving multivariate quadratics. Our approach proceeds by examining the Yamakawa-Zhandry (FOCS 2022) quantum advantage scheme and replacing the role of the random oracle with our multivariate quadratic equations. Our work therefore gives several new perspectives:
  First, our algorithm gives a counterexample to the conventional belief that generic classically hard multivariate quadratic systems are also quantumly hard.
  Second, based on cryptanalytic evidence, our work gives an explicit simple replacement for the random oracle from the work of Yamakawa and Zhandry. We show how to instantiate the random oracle with families of just degree two multivariate polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_2$.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Enhancing Entanglement for Two-Photon-Driven Rabi Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A control scheme is proposed that leverages reinforcement learning to enhance entanglement by modulating the two-photon-driven amplitude in a Rabi model. The quantum phase diagram versus the amplitude of the two-photon process and the coupling between the cavity field and the atom in the Rabi model, is indicated by the energy spectrum of the hybrid system, the witness of entanglement, second order correlation, and negativity of Wigner function. From a dynamical perspective, the behavior of entanglement can reflect the phase transition and the reinforcement learning agent is employed to produce temporal sequences of control pulses to enhance the entanglement in the presence of dissipation. The entanglement can be enhanced in different parameter regimes and the control scheme exhibits robustness against dissipation. The replaceability of the controlled system and the reinforcement learning module demonstrates the generalization of this scheme. This research paves the way of positively enhancing quantum resources in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Accelerating two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy simulations with a probe qubit protocol</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) is a powerful tool for exploring quantum effects in energy transport within photosynthetic systems and investigating novel material properties. However, simulating the dynamics of these experiments poses significant challenges for classical computers due to the large system sizes, long timescales and numerous experiment repetitions involved. This paper introduces the probe qubit protocol (PQP)-for quantum simulation of 2DES on quantum devices-addressing these challenges. The PQP offers several enhancements over standard methods, notably reducing computational resources, by requiring only a single-qubit measurement per circuit run and achieving Heisenberg scaling in detection frequency resolution, without the need to apply expensive controlled evolution operators in the quantum circuit. The implementation of the PQP protocol requires only one additional ancilla qubit, the probe qubit, with one-to-all connectivity and two-qubit interactions between each system and probe qubits. We evaluate the computational resources necessary for this protocol in detail, demonstrating its function as a dynamic frequency-filtering method through numerical simulations. We find that simulations of the PQP on classical and quantum computers enable a reduction on the number of measurements, i.e. simulation runtime, and memory savings of several orders of magnitude relatively to standard quantum simulation protocols of 2DES. The paper discusses the applicability of the PQP on near-term quantum devices and highlights potential applications where this spectroscopy simulation protocol could provide significant speedups over standard approaches such as the quantum simulation of 2DES applied to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex in green sulphur bacteria.</description>

      <title>Fast, accurate, and error-resilient noise spectroscopy via basis optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing scalable quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors that operate at molecular scales. Yet, existing methods for such noise spectroscopy face fundamental difficulties, including their reliance on severe approximations and the need for extensively averaged measurements. Here, we propose an alternative approach that processes the commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements using a novel self-consistent optimization framework to extract the noise power spectrum that characterizes the interaction between a qubit or quantum sensor and its environment. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is robust to the presence of measurement errors. We introduce a protocol to quantify confidence intervals and a physically motivated heuristic to determine which new dynamical decoupling measurement can improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that the previous measurements of low-frequency noise had overestimated its strength by an order of magnitude. Our method's noise spectrum reconstructions uncover previously unsuspected structure and offer unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>EQNN: Enhanced Quantum Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the maturation of quantum computing technology, research has gradually shifted towards exploring its applications. Alongside the rise of artificial intelligence, various machine learning methods have been developed into quantum circuits and algorithms. Among them, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) can map inputs to quantum circuits through Feature Maps (FMs) and adjust parameter values via variational models, making them applicable in regression and classification tasks. However, designing a FM that is suitable for a given application problem is a significant challenge. In light of this, this study proposes an Enhanced Quantum Neural Network (EQNN), which includes an Enhanced Feature Map (EFM) designed in this research. This EFM effectively maps input variables to a value range more suitable for quantum computing, serving as the input to the variational model to improve accuracy. In the experimental environment, this study uses mobile data usage prediction as a case study, recommending appropriate rate plans based on users' mobile data usage. The proposed EQNN is compared with current mainstream QNNs, and experimental results show that the EQNN achieves higher accuracy with fewer quantum logic gates and converges to the optimal solution faster under different optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Boundary Condition and the Auxiliary Phase in Feynman Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.06675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When employing Feynman path integrals to compute propagators in quantum physics, the concept of summing over the set of all paths is not always naive. In fact, an auxiliary phase often has to be included as a weight for each summand. In this article we discuss the nature of those phase factors for the various types of boundary conditions including all three of the Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin types, as well as their mixtures. We verify that for a free particle confined on a line segment, the resulting formula on the propagator matches those arising from the Schrodinger equation, with a trivial normalization factor.</description>

Abstract: We point out that there is a stable configuration of metal plates where the Casimir force is vanishing in axion electrodynamics. We consider a concrete setup involving Weyl semimetals, which hosts an axion-like effect on the electromagnetism, towards the measurement of the axionic effect on the Casimir force. Our setup realizes zero Casimir force between metals and may be useful for the search for new force mediated by light particles at the micrometer scale.</description>

Abstract: We have measured the geopotential difference between two locations separated by $457~\mathrm{km}$ by comparison of two optical lattice clocks via an interferometric fiber link, utilizing the gravitational redshift of the clock transition frequency. The $^{87}$Sr clocks have been compared side-by-side before and after one of the clocks was moved to the remote location. The chronometrically measured geopotential difference of $3918.1(2.6)\,\mathrm{m^2 \, s^{-2}}$ agrees with an independent geodetic determination of $3915.88(0.30)\,\mathrm{m^2 \, s^{-2}}$. The uncertainty of the chronometric geopotential difference is equivalent to an uncertainty of $27~\mathrm{cm}$ in height.</description>

      <title>Strong enhancement of superconductivity on finitely ramified fractal lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Sierpinski gasket (triangle) and carpet (square) lattices as examples, we theoretically study the properties of fractal superconductors. For that, we focus on the phenomenon of $s$-wave superconductivity in the Hubbard model with attractive on-site potential and employ the Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach and the theory of superfluid stiffness. For the case of the Sierpinski gasket, we demonstrate that fractal geometry of the underlying crystalline lattice can be strongly beneficial for superconductivity, not only leading to a considerable increase of the critical temperature $T_c$ as compared to the regular triangular lattice but also supporting macroscopic phase coherence of the Cooper pairs. In contrast, the Sierpinski carpet geometry does not lead to pronounced effects, and we find no substantial difference as compared with the regular square lattice. We conjecture that the qualitative difference between these cases is caused by different ramification properties of the fractals.</description>

      <title>Faster randomized partial trace estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop randomized matrix-free algorithms for estimating partial traces, a generalization of the trace arising in quantum physics and chemistry. Our algorithm improves on the typicality-based approach used in [T. Chen and Y-C. Cheng, \emph{Numerical computation of the equilibrium-reduced density matrix for strongly coupled open quantum systems}, J. Chem. Phys. 157, 064106 (2022)] by deflating important subspaces (e.g. corresponding to the low-energy eigenstates) explicitly. This results in a significant variance reduction, leading to several order-of-magnitude speedups over the previous state of the art. We then apply our algorithm to study the thermodynamics of several Heisenberg spin systems, particularly the entanglement spectrum and ergotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Wigner chain in a periodic potential is a paradigmatic example of geometric frustration with long-range interactions. The dynamics emulates the Frenkel-Kontorova model with Coulomb interactions. In the continuum approximation, dislocations are sine-Gordon solitons with power-law decaying tails. We show that their action is mapped into a massive, long-range (1+1) Thirring model, where the solitons are charged fermionic excitations over an effective Dirac sea. We identify the corresponding mean field theory and show that the Coulomb interactions destabilize structures commensurate with the periodic substrate, suppressing their onset and giving rise to {\it interaction-induced} lubrication. Our study identifies the role of long-range interactions on determining nanofriction. Our predictions can be probed in state-of-the-art trapped ion experiments.</description>

      <title>Critical analysis of multiple reentrant localization in an antiferromagnetic helix with transverse electric field: Hopping dimerization-free scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02778v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reentrant localization (RL), a recently prominent phenomenon, traditionally links to the interplay of staggered correlated disorder and hopping dimerization, as indicated by prior research. Contrary to this paradigm, our present study demonstrates that hopping dimerization is not a pivotal factor in realizing RL. Considering a helical magnetic system with antiferromagnetic ordering, we uncover spin-dependent RL at multiple energy regions, in the {\em absence} of hopping dimerization. This phenomenon persists even in the thermodynamic limit. The correlated disorder in the form of Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model is introduced by applying a transverse electric field to the helical system, circumventing the use of traditional substitutional disorder. We conduct a finite-size scaling analysis on the observed reentrant phases to identify critical points, determine associated critical exponents, and examine the scaling behavior linked to localization transitions. Additionally, we explore the parameter space to identify the conditions under which the reentrant phases occur. Described within a tight-binding framework, present work provides a novel outlook on RL, highlighting the crucial role of electric field, antiferromagnetic ordering, and the helicity of the geometry. Potential applications and experimental realizations of RL phenomena are also explored.</description>

      <title>Electroweak parameters from mixed SU(2) Yang-Mills Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the thermal phase structure of pure SU(2) quantum Yang-Mills theory, we describe the electron at rest as an extended particle, a droplet of radius $r_0\sim a_0$, where $a_0$ is the Bohr radius. This droplet is of vanishing pressure and traps a monopole within its bulk at a temperature of $T_c=7.95$ keV. The monopole is the Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit. It is interpreted in an electric-magnetically dual way. Utilizing a spherical mirror-charge construction, we approximate the droplet's charge at a value of the electromagnetic fine-structure constant $\alpha$ of $\alpha^{-1}\sim 134$ for soft external probes. It is shown that the droplet does not exhibit an electric dipole or quadrupole moment due to averages of its far-field electric potential over monopole positions. We also calculate the mixing angle $\theta_{\rm W}\sim 30^{\circ}$ which belongs to deconfining phases of two SU(2) gauge theories of very distinct Yang-Mills scales ($\Lambda_{\rm e}=3.6\,$keV and $\Lambda_{\rm CMB}\sim 10^{-4}\,$eV). Here, the condition that the droplet's bulk thermodynamics is stable determines the value of $\theta_W$. The core radius of the monopole, whose inverse equals the droplet's mass in natural units, is about 1% of $r_0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17357v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement measures of many-body states have been increasingly useful to characterize phases of matter. Here we explore a surprising connection between mixed state entanglement and 't Hooft anomaly. More specifically, we consider lattice systems in $d$ space dimensions with anomalous symmetry $G$ where the anomaly is characterized by an invariant in the group cohomology $H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$. We show that any mixed state $\rho$ that is strongly symmetric under $G$, in the sense that $G\rho\propto\rho$, is necessarily $(d+2)$-nonseparable, i.e. is not the mixture of tensor products of $d+2$ states in the Hilbert space. Furthermore, such states cannot be prepared from any $(d+2)$-separable states using finite-depth local quantum channels, so the nonseparability is long-ranged in nature. We provide proof of these results in $d\leq1$, and plausibility arguments in $d&gt;1$. The anomaly-nonseparability connection thus allows us to generate simple examples of mixed states with nontrivial long-ranged multipartite entanglement. In particular, in $d=1$ we found an example of intrinsically mixed quantum phase, in the sense that states in this phase cannot be two-way connected to any pure state through finite-depth local quantum channels. We also analyze mixed anomaly involving both strong and weak symmetries, including systems constrained by the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type of anomaly. We find that, while strong-weak mixed anomaly in general does not constrain quantum entanglement, it does constrain long-range correlations of mixed states in nontrivial ways. Namely, such states are not symmetrically invertible and not gapped Markovian, generalizing familiar properties of anomalous pure states.</description>

Abstract: Coupled non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equations are crucial in describing dynamics of many particle systems. We present a quantum imaginary time evolution (ITE) algorithm as a solution to such equations in the case of nuclear Hartree-Fock equations. Under a simplified Skyrme interaction model, we calculate the ground state energy of an oxygen-16 nucleus and demonstrate that the result is in agreement with the classical ITE algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that two-body losses induce a collective excitation in a harmonically trapped one-dimensional Bose gas, even in the absence of a quench in the trap or any other external perturbation. Focusing on the dissipatively fermionized regime, we perform an exact mode expansion of the rapidity distribution function and characterize the emergence of the collective motion. We find clear coherent oscillations in the widths of the gas both in position and rapidity space as well as in the phase space quadrupole mode of the gas. We compare this motion to that of the well known breathing mode in the absence of losses and find that they differ in the motion of the density profile. We also discuss the role of losses in the collective motion of the gas following various other protocols, such as the removal of losses after a finite hold time, and when the harmonic trap is also quenched.</description>

      <title>Genuine N-partite entanglement in Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum information tasks in a gravitational background require multipartite entanglement for effective processing. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the properties of multipartite entanglement in a relativistic setting. In this paper, we study genuine N-partite entanglement of massless Dirac fields in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, characterized by the presence of a black hole event horizon (BEH) and a cosmological event horizon (CEH). We obtain the general analytical expression of genuine N-partite entanglement shared by $n$ observers near BEH and $m$ ($n+m=N$) observers near CEH. It is shown that genuine N-partite entanglement monotonically decreases with the decrease of the mass of the black hole, suggesting that the Hawking effect of the black hole destroys quantum entanglement. It is interesting to note that genuine N-partite entanglement is a non-monotonic function of the cosmological constant, meaning that the Hawking effect of the expanding universe can enhance quantum entanglement. This result contrasts with multipartite entanglement in single-event horizon spacetime, offering a new perspective on the Hawking effect in multi-event horizon spacetime.</description>

      <title>Fractal ground state of ion chains in periodic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapped ions in a periodic potential are a paradigm of a frustrated Wigner crystal. The dynamics is captured by a long-range Frenkel-Kontorova model. The classical ground state can be mapped to the one of an antiferromagnetic spin chain with long-range interactions in a magnetic field, whose strength is determined by the mismatch between chain's and substrate lattice's periodicity. The mapping is exact when the substrate potential is a piecewise harmonic potential and holds for any two-body interaction decaying as $1/r^\alpha$ with the distance $r$. The ground state is a devil's staircase of regular, periodic structures as a function of the mismatch, whose range of stability depends also on the coefficient $\alpha$. While the staircase is well defined in the thermodynamic limit for $\alpha&gt;1$, for Coulomb interactions, $\alpha=1$, it disappears and the sliding-to-pinned transitions becomes crossovers. However, due to the logarithmic convergence to the thermodynamic limit characteristic of the Coulomb potential, the staircase is found for any finite number of ions. We discuss the experimental parameters as well as the features that allow one to observe and reveal our predictions in experimental platforms. These dynamics are a showcase of the versatility of trapped ion platforms for exploring the interplay between frustration and interactions.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional correlation propagation dynamics with a cluster discrete phase-space method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium dynamics of highly-controlled quantum systems is a challenging issue in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics, relevant to recent experimental developments of analog and digital quantum simulations. In this work, we develop a discrete phase-space approach for general SU($N$) spin systems that utilizes cluster mean field equations, which capture non-trivial quantum correlations inside each cluster, beyond the capability of the standard discrete truncated Wigner approximation for individual classical spins. Our formalism, based on a cluster phase-point operator, enables efficient numerical samplings of cluster phase-space variables, where the total number of noise variables for a direct product state is independent of the specific way in which the entire system is divided into multiple equally sized finite clusters. We numerically demonstrate that the cluster discrete truncated Wigner approximation (C-dTWA) method can reproduce key results in a recent experiment on correlation propagation dynamics in a two dimensional Bose-Hubbard system. We further compare the results of C-dTWA for clusters of $2\times 2$ sites with those from a two-dimensional tensor network method and discuss that both approaches agree very well in the short-time region, where the energy conservation is well maintained in the tensor network simulations. Since we formulate the C-dTWA method in a general form, it has the potential for application to various dynamical problems in isolated and open quantum systems, even in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Relaxation dynamics in the (double) sine-Gordon model: An open-system viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of integrability breaking on the relaxation dynamics of the (double) sine-Gordon model. Compared to previous studies, we apply an alternative viewpoint motivated by open-system physics by separating the phase field into homogeneous and inhomogeneous parts, describing a quantum pendulum (subsystem) and an interacting phononic bath (environment). To study the relaxation dynamics in the model, we perform quantum quenches using the mini-superspace-based truncated Hamiltonian approach developed recently and simulate the real-time evolution of various entanglement measures and the energy transfer between the subsystem and its environment. Our findings demonstrate that in the presence of integrability-breaking perturbations, the relaxation dynamics is substantially faster, signalled by the increase of entanglement and energy transfer between the quantum pendulum and the phonon bath.</description>

      <title>Multi-product Zeno effect with higher order convergence rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To implement the dynamics of a projected Hamiltonian or Lindbladian, the quantum Zeno effect is a fundamental quantum phenomenon that approximates the effective dynamic by intersecting the Hamiltonian or Lindblad evolution by any quantum operation that converges to the desired projected subspace. Unlike the related Trotter product formula, the best-known convergence rate of the quantum Zeno effect is limited to the order $1/n$. In this work, we improve the convergence rate using a multi-product formula to achieve any power of $1/n^{K+1}$, employing a modified Chernoff Lemma, a modified Dunford-Segal approximation, and the holomorphic functional calculus. We briefly illustrate this scheme using the bosonic cat code as an example, along with a broader class of cases governed by the `Bang-Bang' method for decoupling systems from their environment.</description>

      <title>How quantum computing can enhance biomarker discovery for multi-factorial diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomarkers play a central role in medicine's gradual progress towards proactive, personalized precision diagnostics and interventions. However, finding biomarkers that provide very early indicators of a change in health status, particularly for multi-factorial diseases, has been challenging. Discovery of such biomarkers stands to benefit significantly from advanced information processing and means to detect complex correlations, which quantum computing offers. In this perspective paper, quantum algorithms, particularly in machine learning, are mapped to key applications in biomarker discovery. The opportunities and challenges associated with the algorithms and applications are discussed. The analysis is structured according to different data types - multi-dimensional, time series, and erroneous data - and covers key data modalities in healthcare - electronic health records (EHRs), omics, and medical images. An outlook is provided concerning open research challenges.</description>

      <title>Phase Space Representation of the Density Operator: Bopp Pseudodifferential Calculus and Moyal Product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bopp shifts, introduced in 1956, played a pivotal role in the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics. As demonstrated in our previous work, Bopp's construction provides a phase-space perspective of quantum mechanics that is closely connected to the Moyal star product and its role in deformation quantization. In this paper, we both review and expand on our exploration of Bopp quantization, emphasizing its relationship with the Moyal product and its applications in elementary deformation quantization. Notably, we apply these constructions to the density operator, which represents mixed states in quantum mechanics, offering novel insights into its role within this framework.</description>

      <title>Second-order correlation and squeezing of photons in cavities with ultrastrong magnon-photon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the second-order photon correlation function in cavity-magnon systems, focusing on ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities within the ultra-strong coupling regime, and extending beyond the rotating-wave approximation. By deriving exact integral solutions for the second-order correlation function, we demonstrate that counter-rotating magnon-photon interactions induce quadrature squeezing in the cavity mode. Furthermore, we show that tuning the anisotropic magnon-cavity couplings enhance the squeezing effect by changing the level repulsion of the magnon-cavity photon hybrid mode without increasing cavity photon occupation number. Our study reveals distinct quantum correlation behaviors in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities: For ferromagnetic cavities, we show that squeezing increases with coupling strength asymmetry, whereas in antiferromagnetic case, magnon modes with opposite chirality suppress quantum effects and imposes a lower bound on correlation functions. These findings provide a pathway to optimize photon blockade and quantum information processing in magnon-cavity systems in the ultrastrong coupling limit.</description>
