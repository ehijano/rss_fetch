      <title>Thermodynamic Signature of Logical Depth in Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the internal logical structure of a quantum circuit can leave a distinct thermodynamic signature under progressive decoherence. By comparing deep, conditionally branching circuits with shallow, uniform counterparts-while controlling for overall halting probability and physical resources-we show that branching architectures induce greater entropy flow into the environment. This effect is captured by a logical depth factor $L_d$, which quantifies entropy accumulation during environmental interactions. We validate our framework through detailed analysis of two 4-branch quantum circuits, demonstrating greater entropy production with $L_d \approx 1.615$ for conditional versus uniform architectures. An ancilla-based experimental protocol using controlled-phase gates provides a concrete pathway for detecting these thermodynamic signatures on current quantum platforms. Our results establish logical depth as a physically measurable quantity with implications for circuit design, compilation strategies, and verification protocols.</description>

      <title>Stochastic thermodynamics of computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.05669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the major resource requirements of computers - ranging from biological cells to human brains to high-performance (engineered) computers - is the energy used to run them. Those costs of performing a computation have long been a focus of research in physics, going back to the early work of Landauer. One of the most prominent aspects of computers is that they are inherently nonequilibrium systems. However, the early research was done when nonequilibrium statistical physics was in its infancy, which meant the work was formulated in terms of equilibrium statistical physics. Since then there have been major breakthroughs in nonequilibrium statistical physics, which are allowing us to investigate the myriad aspects of the relationship between statistical physics and computation, extending well beyond the issue of how much work is required to erase a bit. In this paper I review some of this recent work on the `stochastic thermodynamics of computation'. After reviewing the salient parts of information theory, computer science theory, and stochastic thermodynamics, I summarize what has been learned about the entropic costs of performing a broad range of computations, extending from bit erasure to loop-free circuits to logically reversible circuits to information ratchets to Turing machines. These results reveal new, challenging engineering problems for how to design computers to have minimal thermodynamic costs. They also allow us to start to combine computer science theory and stochastic thermodynamics at a foundational level, thereby expanding both.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Frequency Moment Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the second frequency moment of a stream up to $(1\pm\varepsilon)$ multiplicative error requires at most $O(\log n / \varepsilon^2)$ bits of space, due to a seminal result of Alon, Matias, and Szegedy. It is also known that at least $\Omega(\log n + 1/\varepsilon^{2})$ space is needed. We prove an optimal lower bound of $\Omega\left(\log \left(n \varepsilon^2 \right) / \varepsilon^2\right)$ for all $\varepsilon = \Omega(1/\sqrt{n})$. Note that when $\varepsilon&gt;n^{-1/2 + c}$, where $c&gt;0$, our lower bound matches the classic upper bound of AMS. For smaller values of $\varepsilon$ we also introduce a revised algorithm that improves the classic AMS bound and matches our lower bound.</description>
