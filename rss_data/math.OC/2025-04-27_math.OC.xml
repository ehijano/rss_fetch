      <title>A Newton-type Method for Non-smooth Under-determined Systems of Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variant of Newton's algorithm applied to under-determined systems of non-smooth equations. The notion of regularity employed in our work is based on Newton differentiability, which generalizes semi-smoothness. The classic notion of Newton differentiability does not suffice for our purpose, due to the existence of multiple zeros and as such we extend it to uniform Newton differentiability. In this context, we can show that the distance between the iterates and the set of zeros of the system decreases super-linearly. For the special case of smooth equations, the assumptions of our algorithm are simplified. Finally, we provide some numerical examples to showcase the behavior of our proposed method. The key example is a toy model of complementarity constraint problems, showing that our method has great application potential across engineering fields.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Move Schemes on Simulated Annealing Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing an effective move-generation function for Simulated Annealing (SA) in complex models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical experiments to examine the impact of various move-generation parameters -- such as how many particles are moved and by what distance at each iteration -- under different temperature schedules and system sizes. Our numerical studies, carried out on both the Lennard-Jones problem and an additional benchmark, reveal that moving exactly one randomly chosen particle per iteration offers the most efficient performance. We analyze acceptance rates, exploration properties, and convergence behavior, providing evidence that partial-coordinate updates can outperform full-coordinate moves in certain high-dimensional settings. These findings offer practical guidelines for optimizing SA methods in a broad range of complex optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>Ergodic control of McKean-Vlasov systems on the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an optimal control problem with ergodic (long term average) reward for a McKean-Vlasov dynamics, where the coefficients of a controlled stochastic differential equation depend on the marginal law of the solution. Starting from the associated infinite time horizon expected discounted reward, we construct both the value $\lambda$ of the ergodic problem and an associated function $\phi$, which provide a viscosity solution to an ergodic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation of elliptic type. In contrast to previous results, we consider the function $\phi$ and the HJB equation on the Wasserstein space, using concepts of derivatives with respect to probability measures. The pair $(\lambda,\phi)$ also provides information on limit behavior of related optimization problems, for instance results of Abelian-Tauberian type or limits of value functions of control problems for finite time horizon when the latter tends to infinity. Many arguments are simplified by the use of a functional relation for $\phi$ in the form of a suitable dynamic programming principle.</description>

      <title>Efficient Tree Generation for Globally Optimal Decisions under Probabilistic Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world problems require making sequences of decisions where the outcomes of each decision are probabilistic and uncertain, and the availability of different actions is constrained by the outcomes of previous actions. There is a need to generate policies that are adaptive to uncertainty, globally optimal, and yet scalable as the state space grows. In this paper, we propose the generation of optimal decision trees, which dictate which actions should be implemented in different outcome scenarios, while maximizing the expected reward of the strategy. Using a combination of dynamic programming and mixed-integer linear optimization, the proposed methods scale to problems with large but finite state spaces, using problem-specific information to prune away large subsets of the state space that do not yield progress towards rewards. We demonstrate that the presented approach is able to find the globally optimal decision tree in linear time with respect to the number states explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global optimization of black-box functions is challenging in high dimensions. We introduce a conceptual adaptive random search framework, Branching Adaptive Surrogate Search Optimization (BASSO), that combines partitioning and surrogate modeling for subregion sampling. We present a finite-time analysis of BASSO, and establish conditions under which it is theoretically possible to scale to high dimensions. While we do not expect that any implementation will achieve the theoretical ideal, we experiment with several BASSO variations and discuss implications on narrowing the gap between theory and implementation. Numerical results on test problems are presented.</description>

      <title>Upper and lower bounds of the value function for optimal control in the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of nonsmooth analysis in the Wasserstein space to finite-horizon optimal control problems for nonlocal continuity equations. We characterize the value function as a strict viscosity solution of the corresponding Bellman equation using the notions of $\varepsilon$-subdifferentials and $\varepsilon$-superdifferentials. The main paper's result is the fact that continuous subsolutions and supersolutions of this Bellman equation yield lower and upper bounds for the value function. These estimates rely on proximal calculus in the space of probability measures and the Moreau-Yosida regularization. Furthermore, the upper estimates provide a family of approximately optimal feedback strategies that realize the concept of proximal aiming.</description>

      <title>The Symmetry Coefficient of Positively Homogeneous Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bregman distance is a central tool in convex optimization, particularly in first-order gradient descent and proximal-based algorithms. Such methods enable optimization of functions without Lipschitz continuous gradients by leveraging the concept of relative smoothness, with respect to a reference function $h$. A key factor in determining the full range of allowed step sizes in Bregman schemes is the symmetry coefficient, $\alpha(h)$, of the reference function $h$. While some explicit values of $\alpha(h)$ have been determined for specific functions $h$, a general characterization has remained elusive. This paper explores two problems: ($\textit{i}$) deriving calculus rules for the symmetry coefficient and ($\textit{ii}$) computing $\alpha(\lVert\cdot\rVert_2^p)$ for general $p$. We establish upper and lower bounds for the symmetry coefficient of sums of positively homogeneous Legendre functions and, under certain conditions, provide exact formulas for these sums. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $\alpha(\lVert\cdot\rVert_2^p)$ is independent of dimension and propose an efficient algorithm for its computation. Additionally, we prove that $\alpha(\lVert\cdot\rVert_2^p)$ asymptotically equals, and is lower bounded by, the function $1/(2p)$, offering a simpler upper bound for step sizes in Bregman schemes. Finally, we present closed-form computations for specific cases such as $p \in \{6,8,10\}$.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to Optimizing Industrial Thermal Spraying through Comparative Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving both high quality and cost-efficiency are two critical yet often conflicting objectives in manufacturing and maintenance processes. Quality standards vary depending on the specific application, while cost-effectiveness remains a constant priority. These competing objectives lead to multi-objective optimization problems, where algorithms are employed to identify Pareto-optimal solutions-compromise points which provide decision-makers with feasible parameter settings. The successful application of such optimization algorithms relies on the ability to model the underlying physical system, which is typically complex, through either physical or data-driven approaches, and to represent it mathematically. This paper applies three multi-objective optimization algorithms to determine optimal process parameters for high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) thermal spraying. Their ability to enhance coating performance while maintaining process efficiency is systematically evaluated, considering practical constraints and industrial feasibility. Practical validation trials are conducted to verify the theoretical solutions generated by the algorithms, ensuring their applicability and reliability in real-world scenarios. By exploring the performance of these diverse algorithms in an industrial setting, this study offers insights into their practical applicability, guiding both researchers and practitioners in enhancing process efficiency and product quality in the coating industry.</description>

      <title>Primal-dual programs for the constrained optimal impulse control: discounted model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies constrained optimal impulse control problems of a deterministic system described by a (semi)flow, where the performance measures are the discounted total costs including both the costs incurred with applying impulses as well as running costs. We formulate the relaxed problem and the associated primal convex programs in measures together with the dual programs, and establish the relevant duality results. As an application, we formulate and justify a general procedure for obtaining optimal $(J+1)$-mixed strategies for the original impulse control problems. This procedure is illustrated with a solved example.</description>

      <title>On monotone completion of risk markets: Limit results for incomplete risk markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a competitive market with risk-averse participants. We assume that agents' risks are measured by coherent risk measures introduced by Artzner et al. (1999). Fundamental theorems of welfare economics have long established the equivalence of competitive equilibria and system welfare optimization (see, e.g., Samuelson (1947)). These have been extended to the case of risk-averse agents with complete risk markets in Ralph and Smeers (2015). In this paper, we consider risk trading in incomplete markets and introduce a mechanism to complete the market iteratively while monotonically enhancing welfare.</description>

      <title>Model Error Covariance Estimation for Weak Constraint Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State estimates from weak constraint 4D-Var data assimilation can vary significantly depending on the data and model error covariances. As a result, the accuracy of these estimates heavily depends on the correct specification of both model and observational data error covariances. In this work, we assume that the data error is known and and focus on estimating the model error covariance by framing weak constraint 4D-Var as a regularized inverse problem, where the inverse model error covariance serves as the regularization matrix. We consider both isotropic and non-isotropic forms of the model error covariance. Using the representer method, we reduce the 4D-Var problem from state space to data space, enabling the efficient application of regularization parameter selection techniques. The Representer method also provides an analytic expression for the optimal state estimate, allowing us to derive matrix expressions for the three regularization parameter selection methods i.e. the L-curve, generalized cross-validation (GCV), and the Chi-square method. We validate our approach by assimilating simulated data into a 1D transport equation modeling wildfire smoke transport under various observational noise and forward model perturbations. In these experiments the goal is to identify the model error covariances that accurately capture the influence of observational data versus model predictions on assimilated state estimates. The regularization parameter selection methods successfully estimate hyperparameters for both isotropic and non-isotropic model error covariances, that reflect whether the first guess model predictions are more or less reliable than the observational data. The results further indicate that isotropic variances are sufficient when the first guess is more accurate than the data whereas non-isotropic covariances are preferred when the observational data is more reliable.</description>

      <title>Fictitious Play in Extensive-Form Games of Imperfect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-term behavior of the fictitious play process in repeated extensive-form games of imperfect information with perfect recall. Each player maintains incorrect beliefs that the moves at all information sets, except the one at which the player is about to make a move, are made according to fixed random strategies, independently across all information sets. Accordingly, each player makes his moves at any of his information sets to maximize his expected payoff assuming that, at any other information set, the moves are made according to the empirical frequencies of the past moves. We extend the well-known Monderer-Shapley result [1] on the convergence of the empirical frequencies to the set of Nash equilibria to a certain class of extensive-form games with identical interests. We then strengthen this result by the use of inertia and fading memory, and prove the convergence of the realized play-paths to an essentially pure Nash equilibrium in all extensive-form games of imperfect information with identical interests.</description>

      <title>Ultra-fast feature learning for the training of two-layer neural networks in the two-timescale regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of gradient methods for the training of mean-field single hidden layer neural networks with square loss. Observing this is a separable non-linear least-square problem which is linear w.r.t. the outer layer's weights, we consider a Variable Projection (VarPro) or two-timescale learning algorithm, thereby eliminating the linear variables and reducing the learning problem to the training of the feature distribution. Whereas most convergence rates or the training of neural networks rely on a neural tangent kernel analysis where features are fixed, we show such a strategy enables provable convergence rates for the sampling of a teacher feature distribution. Precisely, in the limit where the regularization strength vanishes, we show that the dynamic of the feature distribution corresponds to a weighted ultra-fast diffusion equation. Relying on recent results on the asymptotic behavior of such PDEs, we obtain guarantees for the convergence of the trained feature distribution towards the teacher feature distribution in a teacher-student setup.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of Lie and Strang splitting for operator-valued differential Riccati equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential Riccati equations (DREs) are semilinear matrix- or operator-valued differential equations with quadratic non-linearities. They arise in many different areas, and are particularly important in optimal control of linear quadratic regulators, where they provide the optimal feedback control laws. In the context of control of partial differential equations, these Riccati equations are operator-valued. To approximate their solutions, both spatial and temporal discretizations are needed. While the former have been well analyzed in the literature, there are very few rigorous convergence analyses of time stepping methods applied to DREs, particularly in the infinite-dimensional, operator-valued setting. In view of this, we analyze two numerical time-stepping schemes, the Lie and Strang splitting methods, in such a setting. The analysis relies on the assumption that the uncontrolled system evolves via an operator that generates an analytic semigroup, and that either the initial condition is sufficiently smooth, or the nonlinearity in the DRE is sufficiently smoothing. These assumptions are mild, in the sense that they are not enough to even guarantee continuity in operator-norm of the exact solution to the DRE. However, they imply certain regularity in a pointwise sense, which can be leveraged to prove convergence in operator-norm with the classical orders. The results are illustrated by four numerical experiments, where convergence with the expected order is correlated with the relevant assumptions being fulfilled. The experiments also demonstrate that matrix-valued DREs which arise as spatial discretizations of operator-valued DREs behave similarly, unless the discretization is coarse.</description>

      <title>Boosting-Enabled Robust System Identification of Partially Observed LTI Systems Under Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of system identification of partially observed linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Given input-output data, we provide non-asymptotic guarantees for identifying the system parameters under general heavy-tailed noise processes. Unlike previous works that assume Gaussian or sub-Gaussian noise, we consider significantly broader noise distributions that are required to admit only up to the second moment. For this setting, we leverage tools from robust statistics to propose a novel system identification algorithm that exploits the idea of boosting. Despite the much weaker noise assumptions, we show that our proposed algorithm achieves sample complexity bounds that nearly match those derived under sub-Gaussian noise. In particular, we establish that our bounds retain a logarithmic dependence on the prescribed failure probability. Interestingly, we show that such bounds can be achieved by requiring just a finite fourth moment on the excitatory input process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing a convex quadratic function over a bounded polyhedral set. We design a new framework based on SDP relaxations and cutting plane methods for solving the associated reference value problem. The major novelty is a new way to generate valid cuts through the doubly nonnegative (DNN) relaxation. We establish various theoretical properties of the DNN relaxation, including its equivalence with the Shor relaxation of an equivalent quadratically constrained problem, the strong duality, and the generation of valid cuts from an approximate solution of the DNN relaxation returned by an arbitrary SDP solver. Computational results on both real and synthetic data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method and its ability to solve high-dimensional problems with dense data. In particular, our new algorithm successfully solves in 3 days the reference value problem arising from computational biology for a dataset containing more than 300,000 instances of dimension 78. In contrast, CPLEX or Gurobi is estimated to require years of computational time for the same dataset on the same computing platform.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Stochastic Heavy Ball Method With Approximate Gradients and/or Block Updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16241v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the convergence of the stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) algorithm under more general conditions than in the current literature. Specifically, (i) The stochastic gradient is permitted to be biased, and also, to have conditional variance that grows over time (or iteration number). This feature is essential when applying SHB with zeroth-order methods, which use only two function evaluations to approximate the gradient. In contrast, all existing papers assume that the stochastic gradient is unbiased and/or has bounded conditional variance. (ii) The step sizes are permitted to be random, which is essential when applying SHB with block updating. The sufficient conditions for convergence are stochastic analogs of the well-known Robbins-Monro conditions. This is in contrast to existing papers where more restrictive conditions are imposed on the step size sequence. (iii) Our analysis embraces not only convex functions, but also more general functions that satisfy the PL (Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz) and KL (Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz) conditions. (iv) If the stochastic gradient is unbiased and has bounded variance, and the objective function satisfies (PL), then the iterations of SHB match the known best rates for convex functions. (v) We establish the almost-sure convergence of the iterations, as opposed to convergence in the mean or convergence in probability, which is the case in much of the literature. (vi) Each of the above convergence results continue to hold if full-coordinate updating is replaced by any one of three widely-used updating methods. In addition, numerical computations are carried out to illustrate the above points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptive sieving (AS) strategy for solving general sparse machine learning models by effectively exploring the intrinsic sparsity of the solutions, wherein only a sequence of reduced problems with much smaller sizes need to be solved. We further apply the proposed AS strategy to generate solution paths for large-scale sparse optimization problems efficiently. We establish the theoretical guarantees for the proposed AS strategy including its finite termination property. Extensive numerical experiments are presented in this paper to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the AS strategy to solve large-scale machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Certifying solutions of degenerate semidefinite programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the algorithmic aspects of solving feasibility problems of semidefinite programming (SDP), aka linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Since in some SDP instances all feasible solutions have irrational entries, numerical solvers that work with rational numbers can only find an approximate solution. We study the following question: is it possible to certify feasibility of a given SDP using an approximate solution that is sufficiently close to some exact solution? Existing approaches make the assumption that there exist rational feasible solutions (and use techniques such as rounding and lattice reduction algorithms). We propose an alternative approach that does not need this assumption. More specifically, we show how to construct a system of polynomial equations whose set of real solutions is guaranteed to have an isolated correct solution (assuming that the target exact solution is maximum-rank). This allows, in particular, to use algorithms from real algebraic geometry for solving systems of polynomial equations, yielding a hybrid (or symbolic-numerical) method for SDPs. We experimentally compare it with a pure symbolic method; the hybrid method was able to certify feasibility of many SDP instances on which the exact method failed. Our approach may have further applications, such as refining an approximate solution using methods of numerical algebraic geometry for systems of polynomial equations.</description>

      <title>Mean-field stochastic linear quadratic control problem with random coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04621v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first prove that the mean-field stochastic linear quadratic (MFSLQ for short) control problem with random coefficients has a unique optimal control and derive a preliminary stochastic maximum principle to characterize this optimal control by an optimality system. However, because of the term of the form $\mathbb{E}[A_1(\cdot)^\top Y(\cdot)] $ in the adjoint equation, which cannot be represented in the form $\mathbb{E}[A_1(\cdot)^\top]\mathbb{E} [Y(\cdot)] $, we cannot solve this optimality system explicitly. To this end, we decompose the MFSLQ control problem into two problems without the mean-field terms, and one of them is a constrained problem. The constrained SLQ control problem is solved explicitly by an extended LaGrange multiplier method developed in this article.</description>

      <title>Kernel-Based Optimal Control: An Infinitesimal Generator Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel operator-theoretic approach for optimal control of nonlinear stochastic systems within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our learning framework leverages data samples of system dynamics and stage cost functions, with only control penalties and constraints provided. The proposed method directly learns the infinitesimal generator of a controlled stochastic diffusion in an infinite-dimensional hypothesis space. We demonstrate that our approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions, enabling a data-driven solution to the optimal control problems. Furthermore, our learning framework includes nonparametric estimators for uncontrolled infinitesimal generators as a special case. Numerical experiments, ranging from synthetic differential equations to simulated robotic systems, showcase the advantages of our approach compared to both modern data-driven and classical nonlinear programming methods for optimal control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives two different proofs to a structural theorem of decreasing minimization (lexicographic optimization) on integrally convex sets. The theorem states that the set of decreasingly minimal elements of an integrally convex set can be represented as the intersection of a unit discrete cube and a face of the convex hull of the given integrally convex set. The first proof resorts to the Fenchel-type duality theorem in discrete convex analysis and the second is more elementary using Farkas' lemma.</description>

      <title>Global Optimization of Gas Transportation and Storage: Convex Hull Characterizations and Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gas transportation and storage has become one of the most relevant and important optimization problems in energy systems. This problem inherently includes highly nonlinear and nonconvex aspects due to gas physics, and discrete aspects due to the control decisions of active network elements. Obtaining even locally optimal solutions for this problem presents significant mathematical and computational challenges for system operators. In this paper, we formulate the gas transportation and storage problem as a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) through disjunctions on the flow directions. Moreover, we study the nonconvex sets induced by gas physics and propose mixed-integer second-order cone programming relaxations for the nonconvex MINLP problem. The proposed relaxations are based on the convex hull representations of two nonconvex sets: Firstly, we give the convex hull representation of the nonconvex set for pipes and show that it is second-order cone representable. Secondly, we also give a complete characterization of the extreme points of the nonconvex set for compressors and show that the convex hull of the extreme points is power cone representable. Moreover, for practical applications, we propose a second-order cone outer-approximation for the nonconvex set for compressors. To obtain (near) globally optimal solutions, we develop an algorithmic framework based on our convex hull results. We evaluate our framework through extensive computational experiments on various GasLib networks in comparison with the convex relaxations from the literature and a state-of-the-art global solver. Our results highlight the computational efficiency and convergence performance of our convex relaxation method compared to other methods. Moreover, our method also consistently provides (near) global solutions as well as high-quality warm-starting points for local solvers.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns models and convergence principles for dealing with stochasticity in a wide range of algorithms arising in nonlinear analysis and optimization in Hilbert spaces. It proposes a flexible geometric framework within which existing solution methods can be recast and improved, and new ones can be designed. Almost sure weak, strong, and linear convergence results are established in particular for stochastic fixed point iterations, the stochastic gradient descent method, and stochastic extrapolated parallel algorithms for feasibility problems. In these areas, the proposed algorithms exceed the features and convergence guarantees of the state of the art. Numerical applications to signal and image recovery are provided.</description>

      <title>Knapsack with compactness: a semidefinite approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The min-knapsack problem with compactness constraints extends the classical knapsack problem, in the case of ordered items, by introducing a restriction ensuring that they cannot be too far apart. This problem has applications in statistics, particularly in the detection of change-points in time series. In this paper, we propose a semidefinite programming approach for this problem, incorporating compactness in constraints or in objective. We study and compare the different relaxations, and argue that our method provides high-quality heuristics and tight bounds. In particular, the single hyperparameter of our penalized semidefinite models naturally balances the trade-off between compactness and accuracy of the computed solutions. Numerical experiments illustrate, on the hardest instances, the effectiveness and versatility of our approach compared to the existing mixed-integer programming formulation.</description>

      <title>Quick Updates for the Perturbed Static Output Feedback Control Problem in Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16178v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for efficiently updating a nominal stabilizing static output feedback (SOF) controller in perturbed linear systems. As operating points and state-space matrices change in dynamic systems, accommodating updates to the SOF controller are necessary. Traditional methods address such changes by re-solving for the updated SOF gain, which is often \textit{(i)} computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the problem or \textit{(ii)} infeasible due the limitations of its semidefinite programming relaxations. To overcome this, we leverage the concept of \textit{minimum destabilizing real perturbation} to formulate a norm minimization problem that yields fast, reliable controller updates. This approach accommodates a variety of known perturbations, including abrupt changes, model inaccuracies, and equilibrium-dependent linearizations. We also introduce geometric metrics to quantify the proximity to instability and rigorously define stability-guaranteed regions. Extensive numerical simulations validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. We demonstrate the results on the SOF control of mutlti-machine power networks with changing operating points, and demonstrate that the computed quick updates produce comparable solutions to the SOF ones, while requiring orders of magnitude less time.</description>

      <title>Sampled-Data Primal-Dual Gradient Dynamics in Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a versatile approach capable of accommodating diverse control requirements that holds significant promise for a broad spectrum of industrial applications. Noteworthy challenges associated with MPC include the substantial computational burden, which is sometimes considered excessive even for linear systems. Recently, a rapid computation method that guides the input toward convergence with the optimal control problem solution by employing primal-dual gradient (PDG) dynamics as a controller has been proposed for linear MPCs. However, stability has been ensured under the assumption that the controller is a continuous-time system, leading to potential instability when the controller undergoes discretization and is implemented as a sampled-data system. In this paper, we propose a discrete-time dynamical controller, incorporating specific modifications to the PDG approach, and present stability conditions relevant to the resulting sampled-data system. Additionally, we introduce an extension designed to enhance control performance, that was traded off in the original. Numerical examples substantiate that our proposed method, which can be executed in only 1 $\mu$s in a standard laptop, not only ensures stability with considering sampled-data implementation but also effectively enhances control performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator serves as the theoretical backbone for machine learning of dynamical control systems, where the operator is heuristically approximated by extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD). In this paper, we propose SafEDMD, a novel stability- and certificate-oriented EDMD-based controller design framework. Our approach leverages a reliable surrogate model generated in a data-driven fashion in order to provide closed-loop guarantees. In particular, we establish a controller design based on semi-definite programming with guaranteed stabilization of the underlying nonlinear system. As central ingredient, we derive proportional error bounds that vanish at the origin and are tailored to control tasks. We illustrate the developed method by means of several benchmark examples and highlight the advantages over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) has been a powerful method in sparse signal recovery and approximation. However, OMP suffers computational issues when the signal has a large number of non-zeros. This paper advances OMP and its extension called generalized OMP (gOMP) by offering fast algorithms for the orthogonal projection of the input signal at each iteration. The proposed modifications directly reduce the computational complexity of OMP and gOMP. Experiment results verified the improvement in computation time. This paper also provides sufficient conditions for exact signal recovery. For general signals with additive noise, the approximation error is at the same order as OMP (gOMP), but is obtained within much less time.</description>

Abstract: In the framework of sub-Riemannian Manifolds, a relevant question is: what are the \enquote{metric lines} (i.e., the isometric embedding of the real line)? This article presents a conjecture classifying the metric lines in Carnot groups and takes the first steps in answering this question for \enquote{arbitrary rank} Carnot groups. We classify the metric lines of the Engel-type groups $\Eng(n)$ (Theorem 1.2), whose sub-Riemannian structure is defined on a non-integrable distribution of rank $n+1$. Our approach is a new method, called the sequence method, which we began to develop to study metric lines in the jet space.</description>

      <title>Pinning control of chimera states in systems with higher-order interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the mechanisms behind synchronization phenomena is of paramount importance in nonlinear science. In particular, the emergence of chimera states, patterns in which order and disorder coexist simultaneously, continues to puzzle scholars, due to its elusive nature. Recently, it has been shown that higher-order (many-body) interactions greatly enhance the presence of chimera states, which are easier to be found and more persistent. In this work, we show that the higher-order framework is fertile not only for the emergence of chimera states, but also for its control. Via pinning control, a technique consisting in applying a forcing to a subset of the nodes, we are able to trigger the emergence of chimera states with only a small fraction of controlled nodes, at striking contrast with the case without higher-order interactions. We show that our setting is robust for different higher-order topologies and types of pinning control and, finally, we give a heuristic interpretation of the results via phase reduction theory. Our numerical and theoretical results provide further understanding on how higher-order interactions shape collective behaviors in nonlinear dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Estimating out-of-sample risk for models trained on large high-dimensional datasets is an expensive but essential part of the machine learning process, enabling practitioners to optimally tune hyperparameters. Cross-validation (CV) serves as the de facto standard for risk estimation but poorly trades off high bias ($K$-fold CV) for computational cost (leave-one-out CV). We propose a randomized approximate leave-one-out (RandALO) risk estimator that is not only a consistent estimator of risk in high dimensions but also less computationally expensive than $K$-fold CV. We support our claims with extensive simulations on synthetic and real data and provide a user-friendly Python package implementing RandALO available on PyPI as randalo and at https://github.com/cvxgrp/randalo.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Reduced Order Modelling for Unsteady Parametrized Optimal Control Problems in 3D Cardiovascular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20828</link>

Abstract: This paper presents a projection-based reduced order modelling (ROM) framework for unsteady parametrized optimal control problems (OCP$_{(\mu)}$s) arising from cardiovascular (CV) applications. In real-life scenarios, accurately defining outflow boundary conditions in patient-specific models poses significant challenges due to complex vascular morphologies, physiological conditions, and high computational demands. These challenges make it difficult to compute realistic and reliable CV hemodynamics by incorporating clinical data such as 4D magnetic resonance imaging. To address these challenges, we focus on controlling the outflow boundary conditions to optimize CV flow dynamics and minimize the discrepancy between target and computed flow velocity profiles. The fluid flow is governed by unsteady Navier--Stokes equations with physical parametric dependence, i.e. the Reynolds number. Numerical solutions of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s require substantial computational resources, highlighting the need for robust and efficient ROMs to perform real-time and many-query simulations. Here, we aim at investigating the performance of a projection-based reduction technique that relies on the offline-online paradigm, enabling significant computational cost savings. The Galerkin finite element method is used to compute the high-fidelity solutions in the offline phase. We implemented a nested-proper orthogonal decomposition (nested-POD) for fast simulation of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s that encompasses two stages: temporal compression for reducing dimensionality in time, followed by parametric-space compression on the precomputed POD modes. We tested the efficacy of the methodology on vascular models, namely an idealized bifurcation geometry and a patient-specific coronary artery bypass graft, incorporating stress control at the outflow boundary, observing consistent speed-up with respect to high-fidelity strategies.</description>
