      <title>DNABERT-2: Fine-Tuning a Genomic Language Model for Colorectal Gene Enhancer Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene enhancers control when and where genes switch on, yet their sequence diversity and tissue specificity make them hard to pinpoint in colorectal cancer. We take a sequence-only route and fine-tune DNABERT-2, a transformer genomic language model that uses byte-pair encoding to learn variable-length tokens from DNA. Using assays curated via the Johnston Cancer Research Centre at Queen's University Belfast, we assembled a balanced corpus of 2.34 million 1 kb enhancer sequences, applied summit-centered extraction and rigorous de-duplication including reverse-complement collapse, and split the data stratified by class. With a 4096-term vocabulary and a 232-token context chosen empirically, the DNABERT-2-117M classifier was trained with Optuna-tuned hyperparameters and evaluated on 350742 held-out sequences. The model reached PR-AUC 0.759, ROC-AUC 0.743, and best F1 0.704 at an optimized threshold (0.359), with recall 0.835 and precision 0.609. Against a CNN-based EnhancerNet trained on the same data, DNABERT-2 delivered stronger threshold-independent ranking and higher recall, although point accuracy was lower. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a second-generation genomic language model with BPE tokenization to enhancer classification in colorectal cancer, demonstrating the feasibility of capturing tumor-associated regulatory signals directly from DNA sequence alone. Overall, our results show that transformer-based genomic models can move beyond motif-level encodings toward holistic classification of regulatory elements, offering a novel path for cancer genomics. Next steps will focus on improving precision, exploring hybrid CNN-transformer designs, and validating across independent datasets to strengthen real-world utility.</description>

      <title>GenVarFormer: Predicting gene expression from long-range mutations in cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishing the rare "driver" mutations that fuel cancer progression from the vast background of "passenger" mutations in the non-coding genome is a fundamental challenge in cancer biology. A primary mechanism that non-coding driver mutations contribute to cancer is by affecting gene expression, potentially from millions of nucleotides away. However, existing predictors of gene expression from mutations are unable to simultaneously handle interactions spanning millions of base pairs, the extreme sparsity of somatic mutations, and generalize to unseen genes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GenVarFormer (GVF), a novel transformer-based architecture designed to learn mutation representations and their impact on gene expression. GVF efficiently predicts the effect of mutations up to 8 million base pairs away from a gene by only considering mutations and their local DNA context, while omitting the vast intermediate sequence. Using data from 864 breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we demonstrate that GVF predicts gene expression with 26-fold higher correlation across samples than current models. In addition, GVF is the first model of its kind to generalize to unseen genes and samples simultaneously. Finally, we find that GVF patient embeddings are more informative than ground-truth gene expression for predicting overall patient survival in the most prevalent breast cancer subtype, luminal A. GVF embeddings and gene expression yielded concordance indices of $0.706^{\pm0.136}$ and $0.573^{\pm0.234}$, respectively. Our work establishes a new state-of-the-art for modeling the functional impact of non-coding mutations in cancer and provides a powerful new tool for identifying potential driver events and prognostic biomarkers.</description>

      <title>scUnified: An AI-Ready Standardized Resource for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables systematic delineation of cellular states and interactions, providing crucial insights into cellular heterogeneity. Building on this potential, numerous computational methods have been developed for tasks such as cell clustering, cell type annotation, and marker gene identification. To fully assess and compare these methods, standardized, analysis-ready datasets are essential. However, such datasets remain scarce, and variations in data formats, preprocessing workflows, and annotation strategies hinder reproducibility and complicate systematic evaluation of existing methods. To address these challenges, we present scUnified, an AI-ready standardized resource for single-cell RNA sequencing data that consolidates 13 high-quality datasets spanning two species (human and mouse) and nine tissue types. All datasets undergo standardized quality control and preprocessing and are stored in a uniform format to enable direct application in diverse computational analyses without additional data cleaning. We further demonstrate the utility of scUnified through experimental analyses of representative biological tasks, providing a reproducible foundation for the standardized evaluation of computational methods on a unified dataset.</description>

      <title>Nephrobase Cell+: Multimodal Single-Cell Foundation Model for Decoding Kidney Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Large foundation models have revolutionized single-cell analysis, yet no kidney-specific model currently exists, and it remains unclear whether organ-focused models can outperform generalized models. The kidney's complex cellular architecture further complicate integration of large-scale omics data, where current frameworks trained on limited datasets struggle to correct batch effects, capture cross-modality variation, and generalize across species. Methods: We developed Nephrobase Cell+, the first kidney-focused large foundation model, pretrained on ~100 billion tokens from ~39.5 million single-cell and single-nucleus profiles across 4,319 samples. Nephrobase Cell+ uses a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with gene-token cross-attention and a mixture-of-experts module for scalable representation learning. Results: Nephrobase Cell+ sets a new benchmark for kidney single-cell analysis. It produces tightly clustered, biologically coherent embeddings in human and mouse kidneys, far surpassing previous foundation models such as Geneformer, scGPT, and UCE, as well as traditional methods such as PCA and autoencoders. It achieves the highest cluster concordance and batch-mixing scores, effectively removing donor/assay batch effects while preserving cell-type structure. Cross-species evaluation shows superior alignment of homologous cell types and &gt;90% zero-shot annotation accuracy for major kidney lineages in both human and mouse. Even its 1B-parameter and 500M variants consistently outperform all existing models. Conclusions: Nephrobase Cell+ delivers a unified, high-fidelity representation of kidney biology that is robust, cross-species transferable, and unmatched by current single-cell foundation models, offering a powerful resource for kidney genomics and disease research.</description>

      <title>SynthPert: Enhancing LLM Biological Reasoning via Synthetic Reasoning Traces for Cellular Perturbation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells, and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.</description>

      <title>scSiameseClu: A Siamese Clustering Framework for Interpreting single-cell RNA Sequencing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals cell heterogeneity, with cell clustering playing a key role in identifying cell types and marker genes. Recent advances, especially graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods, have significantly improved clustering performance. However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps: (1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance. Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that scSiameseClu outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell clustering, cell type annotation, and cell type classification, providing a powerful tool for scRNA-seq data interpretation.</description>

      <title>scCDCG: Efficient Deep Structural Clustering for single-cell RNA-seq via Deep Cut-informed Graph Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is essential for unraveling cellular heterogeneity and diversity, offering invaluable insights for bioinformatics advancements. Despite its potential, traditional clustering methods in scRNA-seq data analysis often neglect the structural information embedded in gene expression profiles, crucial for understanding cellular correlations and dependencies. Existing strategies, including graph neural networks, face challenges in handling the inefficiency due to scRNA-seq data's intrinsic high-dimension and high-sparsity. Addressing these limitations, we introduce scCDCG (single-cell RNA-seq Clustering via Deep Cut-informed Graph), a novel framework designed for efficient and accurate clustering of scRNA-seq data that simultaneously utilizes intercellular high-order structural information. scCDCG comprises three main components: (i) A graph embedding module utilizing deep cut-informed techniques, which effectively captures intercellular high-order structural information, overcoming the over-smoothing and inefficiency issues prevalent in prior graph neural network methods. (ii) A self-supervised learning module guided by optimal transport, tailored to accommodate the unique complexities of scRNA-seq data, specifically its high-dimension and high-sparsity. (iii) An autoencoder-based feature learning module that simplifies model complexity through effective dimension reduction and feature extraction. Our extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrate scCDCG's superior performance and efficiency compared to 7 established models, underscoring scCDCG's potential as a transformative tool in scRNA-seq data analysis.

      <title>A Statistical Framework for Co-Mediators of Zero-Inflated Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of cellular heterogeneity, enabling detailed molecular profiling at the individual cell level. However, integrating high-dimensional single-cell data into causal mediation analysis remains challenging due to zero inflation and complex mediator structures. We propose a novel mediation framework leveraging zero-inflated negative binomial models to characterize cell-level mediator distributions and beta regression for zero-inflation proportions. The model can identify expression level as well as expressed proportion that could mediate disease-leading causal pathway. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate improved power and controlled false discovery rates. We further illustrate the utility of this approach through application to ROSMAP single-cell transcriptomic data, uncovering biologically meaningful mediation effects that enhance understanding of disease mechanisms.</description>

      <title>K-Dense Analyst: Towards Fully Automated Scientific Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity of modern bioinformatics analysis has created a critical gap between data generation and developing scientific insights. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in scientific reasoning, they remain fundamentally limited when dealing with real-world analytical workflows that demand iterative computation, tool integration and rigorous validation. We introduce K-Dense Analyst, a hierarchical multi-agent system that achieves autonomous bioinformatics analysis through a dual-loop architecture. K-Dense Analyst, part of the broader K-Dense platform, couples planning with validated execution using specialized agents to decompose complex objectives into executable, verifiable tasks within secure computational environments. On BixBench, a comprehensive benchmark for open-ended biological analysis, K-Dense Analyst achieves 29.2% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing language model (GPT-5) by 6.3 percentage points, representing nearly 27% improvement over what is widely considered the most powerful LLM available. Remarkably, K-Dense Analyst achieves this performance using Gemini 2.5 Pro, which attains only 18.3% accuracy when used directly, demonstrating that our architectural innovations unlock capabilities far beyond the underlying model's baseline performance. Our insights demonstrate that autonomous scientific reasoning requires more than enhanced language models, it demands purpose-built systems that can bridge the gap between high-level scientific objectives and low-level computational execution. These results represent a significant advance toward fully autonomous computational biologists capable of accelerating discovery across the life sciences.</description>
