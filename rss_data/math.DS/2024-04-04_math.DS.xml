      <title>On the selection of subaction and measure for perturbed potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that when the Aubry set for a Lipschitz continuous potential is a subshift of finite type, then the pressure function converges exponentially fast to its asymptote as the temperature goes to 0. The speed of convergence turns out to be the unique eigenvalue for the matrix whose entries are the costs between the different irreducible pieces of the Aubry set.  For a special case of Walter potential we show that pertubation of that potential that go faster to zero than the pressure do not change the selection, nor for the subaction, neither for the limit measure a zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Positive topological entropy for the Standard Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for the standard map family, for all values of the parameter, except one, the mapping has positive topological entropy. The main tool is the following result.
  Let $S$ be a compact connected orientable surface and $f:S \rightarrow S$ an area preserving orientation preserving $C \e 1$ diffeomorphism of $S$. Assume that $U$ is an invariant domain of $S$ such that $fr_S{U}$ has a finite number of connected components.
  Let $b$ be a regular ideal boundary point of $U$ which is fixed under the induced action by $f$ on the ideal boundary of $U$, and let $\hat{f}:C(b) \rightarrow C(b)$ the homeomorphism on the corresponding circle of prime ends.
  Let $Z(b)$ be the impression of $b$ in $S$ and assume that all fixed points of $f$ in $Z(b)$ are non degenerate.
  If there exists a fixed prime end $e \in C(b)$ then we know the following.
  \begin{enumerate} \item If $p$ is the principal point of $e$ then $p$ is also a fixed point of $Z(b)$ and $p$ is a saddle. \item $C(b)$ has a finite number of fixed prime ends and there exists a finite singular covering $ \phi :C(b) \rightarrow Z(b)$, which is a semiconjugacy between the mapping of prime ends on $C(b)$ and the restriction of $f$ to $Z(b)$. In particular, $Z(b)$ is the connected union of finitely many saddle connections and the corresponding saddles. \end{enumerate} This can be seen as a two dimensional generalization of the dynamics of homeomorphisms of the circle with fixed points.</description>

      <title>Structure of Morse flows with at most six singular points on the torus with a hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe all possible topological structures of Morse flows and typical gradient saddle-nod bifurcation of flows on the 2-dimensional torus with a hole in the case that the number of singular point of flows is at most six. To describe structures, we use separatrix diagrams of flows. The saddle-node bifurcation is specified by selecting a separatrix in the separatrix diagram of the flow befor the bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Resource-consumer dynamics in drylands: modeling the role of plant-plant facilitation-competition shifts with a piecewise system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In drylands, water availability determines plant population densities and whether they cooperate via facilitation or compete. When water scarcity intensifies, plant densities decrease and competition for water surpasses the benefits of soil improvement by facilitator plants, involving an abrupt shift from facilitation to competition. Here, we model this facilitation-competition shift using a piecewise system in a resource species such as grasses studying its impact on a resource-consumer dynamical system. First, the dynamics of each system are introduced separately. The competitive system, by setting conditions to have a monodromic equilibrium in the first quadrant, has no limit cycles. With a monodromy condition in the same quadrant, the cooperative system only has a hyperbolic, small amplitude limit cycle, allowing for an oscillating coexistence. The dynamic properties of the piecewise system become richer. We here prove the extension of the center-focus problem in this particular case, and from a weak focus of order three, we find 3 limit cycles arising from it. We also study the case assuming continuity in the piecewise system. Finally, we present a special and restricted way of obtaining a limit cycle of small amplitude in a pseudo-Hopf bifurcation type. Our results suggest that abrupt density-dependent functional shifts, such as those described in drylands, could introduce novel dynamical phenomena. Our work also provides a theoretical framework to model and investigate sharp density-dependent processes in Ecology.</description>

      <title>Fully chaotic conservative models for some torus homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study homotopic-to-the-identity torus homeomorphisms, whose rotation set has nonempty interior. We prove that any such map is monotonically semiconjugate to a homeomorphism that preserves the Lebesgue measure, and that has the same rotation set. Furthermore, the dynamics of the quotient map has several interesting chaotic traits: for instance, it is topologically mixing, has a dense set of periodic points and is continuum-wise expansive. In particular, this shows that a convex compact set of $\mathbb{R}^2$ with nonempty interior is the rotation set of the lift of a homeomorphism of $\mathbb{T}^2$ if and only if it is the rotation set of the lift of a conservative homeomorphism.</description>

      <title>A remark on omega limit sets for non-expansive dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study systems of time-invariant ordinary differential equations whose flows are non-expansive with respect to a norm, meaning that the distance between solutions may not increase. Since non-expansiveness (and contractivity) are norm-dependent notions, the topology of $\omega$-limit sets of solutions may depend on the norm. For example, and at least for systems defined by real-analytic vector fields, the only possible $\omega$-limit sets of systems that are non-expansive with respect to polyhedral norms (such as $\ell^p$ norms with $p =1$ or $p=\infty$) are equilibria. In contrast, for non-expansive systems with respect to Euclidean ($\ell^2$) norm, other limit sets may arise (such as multi-dimensional tori): for example linear harmonic oscillators are non-expansive (and even isometric) flows, yet have periodic orbits as $\omega$-limit sets. This paper shows that the Euclidean linear case is what can be expected in general: for flows that are contractive with respect to any strictly convex norm (such as $\ell^p$ for any $p\not=1,\infty$), and if there is at least one bounded solution, then the $\omega$-limit set of every trajectory is also an omega limit set of a linear time-invariant system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study piecewise injective, but not necessarily globally injective, contracting maps on a compact subset of \(\bR^d\). We prove that generically the attractor and the set of discontinuities are disjoint, and hence the attractor consists of periodic orbits. In addition, we prove that piecewise injective contractions are generically topologically stable.</description>

      <title>On the comparison between phenomenological and kinetic theories of gas mixtures with applications to flocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the compression between the phenomenological and kinetic models for a mixture of gases from the viewpoint of collective dynamics. In the case in which constituents are Eulerian gases, balance equations for mass, momentum, and energy are the same in the main differential part, but production terms due to the interchanges between constituents are different. They coincide only when the thermal and mechanical diffusion are sufficiently small. In this paper, we first verify that both models satisfy the universal requirements of conservation laws of total mass, momentum, and energy, Galilean invariance and entropy principle. Following the work of Ha and Ruggeri (ARMA 2017), we consider spatially homogeneous models which correspond to the generalizations of the Cucker Smale model with the thermal effect. In these circumstances, we provide analytical results for the comparison between two resulting models and also present several numerical simulations to complement analytical results.</description>

      <title>Angular spectra of linear dynamical systems in discrete time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the notion of an angular spectrum for a linear discrete time nonautonomous dynamical system. The angular spectrum comprises all accumulation points of longtime averages formed by maximal principal angles between successive subspaces generated by the dynamical system. The angular spectrum is bounded by angular values which have previously been investigated by the authors. In this contribution we derive explicit formulas for the angular spectrum of some autonomous and specific nonautonomous systems. Based on a reduction principle we set up a numerical method for the general case; we investigate its convergence and apply the method to systems with a homoclinic orbit and a strange attractor. Our main theoretical result is a theorem on the invariance of the angular spectrum under summable perturbations of the given matrices (roughness theorem). It applies to systems with a so-called complete exponential dichotomy (CED), a concept which we introduce in this paper and which imposes more stringent conditions than those underlying the exponential dichotomy spectrum.</description>

      <title>The central limit theorems for integrable Hamiltonian systems perturbed by white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the dynamics of integrable stochastic Hamiltonian systems. Utilizing the Nagaev-Guivarc'h method, we obtain several generalized results of the central limit theorem. Making use of this technique and the Birkhoff ergodic theorem, we prove that the invariant tori persist under stochastic perturbations. Moreover, they asymptotically follow a Gaussian distribution, which gives a positive answer to the stability of integrable stochastic Hamiltonian systems over time. Our results hold true for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises, and their intensities can be not small.</description>

      <title>Observability of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the observability of nonlinear Dynamical Systems over Finite Fields (DSFF) through the Koopman operator framework. In this work, given a nonlinear DSFF, we construct a linear system of the smallest dimension, called the Linear Output Realization (LOR), which can generate all the output sequences of the original nonlinear system through proper choices of initial conditions (of the associated LOR). We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the observability of a nonlinear system and establish that the maximum number of outputs sufficient for computing the initial condition is precisely equal to the dimension of the LOR. Further, when the system is not known to be observable, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the unique reconstruction of initial conditions for specific output sequences.</description>

      <title>Solving the $KP$ problem with the Global Cartan Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric methods have useful application for solving problems in a range of quantum information disciplines, including the synthesis of time-optimal unitaries in quantum control. In particular, the use of Cartan decompositions to solve problems in optimal control, especially lambda systems, has given rise to a range of techniques for solving the so-called $KP$-problem, where target unitaries belong to a semi-simple Lie group manifold $G$ whose Lie algebra admits a $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{k} \oplus \mathfrak{p}$ decomposition and time-optimal solutions are represented by subRiemannian geodesics synthesised via a distribution of generators in $\mathfrak{p}$. In this paper, we propose a new method utilising global Cartan decompositions $G=KAK$ of symmetric spaces $G/K$ for generating time-optimal unitaries for targets $-iX \in [\frak{p},\frak{p}] \subset \frak{k}$ with controls $-iH(t) \in \frak{p}$. Target unitaries are parametrised as $U=kac$ where $k,c \in K$ and $a = e^{i\Theta}$ with $\Theta \in \frak{a}$. We show that the assumption of $d\Theta=0$ equates to the corresponding time-optimal unitary control problem being able to be solved analytically using variational techniques. We identify how such control problems correspond to the holonomies of a compact globally Riemannian symmetric space, where local translations are generated by $\mathfrak{p}$ and local rotations are generated by $[\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{p}]$.</description>

      <title>Balian-Bloch Wave Invariants for Nearly Degenerate Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is part I of a series in which we aim to show that the singular support of the wave trace and the length spectrum of a smooth, strictly convex, and bounded planar billiard table are generally distinct objects. We derive an asymptotic trace formula for the regularized resolvent which is dual to the wave trace and contains the same information. To do this, we consider a class of periodic orbits which have nearly degenerate Poincar\'e maps and study their leading order behavior as the deformation parameter goes to zero, generating large coefficients in the wave trace. We also keep careful track of the Maslov indices, which will allow us to match contributions of opposite signs in our subsequent paper. Each cancellation of coefficients in the resolvent trace corresponds to making the wave trace one degree smoother. The resolvent based approach is due to Balian and Bloch and was significantly expanded upon by Zelditch in a foundational series of papers [Zel09], [Zel04a], [Zel04c] and [Zel00].</description>

      <title>A Dual Geometric Test for Forward-Flatness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forward-flatness is a generalization of static feedback linearizability and a special case of a more general flatness concept for discrete-time systems. Recently, it has been shown that this practically quite relevant property can be checked by computing a unique sequence of involutive distributions which generalizes the well-known static feedback linearization test. In this paper, a dual test for forward-flatness based on a unique sequence of integrable codistributions is derived. Since the main mathematical operations for determining this sequence are the intersection of codistributions and the calculation of Lie derivatives of 1-forms, it is computationally quite efficient. Furthermore, the formulation with codistributions also facilitates a comparison with the existing discrete-time literature regarding the closely related topic of dynamic feedback linearization, which is mostly formulated in terms of 1-forms rather than vector fields. The presented results are illustrated by two examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural fluctuations have played a crucial role in affecting the dynamics of pervasive diseases such as the coronavirus. Examining the effects of irregular unsettling disturbances on epidemic models is important for understanding these dynamics. In this study, we introduce a mathematical model for the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) dynamics of the coronavirus, incorporating perturbations in the contact rate through Levy noise. The utilization of the Levy process is essential for the protection and control of diseases. We delve into the dynamics of both the deterministic model and the global positive solution of the stochastic model, establishing their existence and uniqueness. Additionally, we explore conditions for the termination and persistence of the infection. Furthermore, we derive the basic reproduction number, a critical determinant of disease extinction or persistence. Numerical results indicate that COVID-19 dissipates from the population when the reproduction number is less than one in the presence of significant or minor noise. Conversely, controlling epidemic diseases becomes challenging when the reproduction number exceeds one. To illustrate this phenomenon, we provide numerical simulations, offering insights into the dynamics of the disease and the efficacy of control measures</description>

      <title>The Dynamical Degrees of Rational Surface Automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09662v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The induced action on the Picard group of a rational surface automorphism with positive entropy can be identified with an element of the Coxeter group associated to $E_n, n\ge 10$ diagram. It follows that the set of dynamical degrees of rational surface automorphisms is a subset of the spectral radii of elements in the Coxeter group. This article concerns the realizability of an element of the Coxeter group as an automorphism on a rational surface with an irreducible reduced anti-canonical curve. For any unrealizable element, we explicitly construct a realizable element with the same spectral radius. Hence, we show that the set of dynamical degrees and the set of spectral radii of the Coxeter group are, in fact, identical. This has been shown by Uehara in \cite{Uehara:2010} by explicitly constructing a rational surface automorphism. This construction depends on a decomposition of an element of the Coxeter group. Our proof is conceptual and provides a simple description of elements of the Coxeter group, which are realized by automorphisms on anti-canonical rational surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix an irrational number $\alpha$ and a smooth, positive, real function $\mathfrak{p}$ on the circle. If current position is $x\in \mathbb R/\mathbb Z$ then in the next step jump to $x+\alpha$ with probability $\mathfrak{p}(x)$ or to $x-\alpha$ with probability $1-\mathfrak{p}(x)$. In 1999 Sinai has proven that if $\mathfrak{p}$ is asymmetric (in certain sense) or $\alpha$ is Diophantine then the Markov process possesses a unique stationary distribution. Next year Conze and Guivarc'h showed the uniqueness of stationary distribution for an arbitrary irrational angle $\alpha$. In this note we present a new proof of latter result.</description>

      <title>A challenger to elliptic billiards fails: String construction over convex polygons and the Birkhoff--Poritsky conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the billiard claimed to be a possible counterexample to the Birkhoff-Poritsky conjecture is actually not a counterexample. We also show that for a billiard in a table obtained by the string construction over any convex polygon, this polygon is a core of the billiard dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the superadditive pressure for 1-typical, one-step, matrix-cocycle potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(\Sigma_T,\sigma)$ be a subshift of finite type with primitive adjacency matrix $T$, $\psi:\Sigma_T \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ a H\"older continuous potential, and $\mathcal{A}:\Sigma_T \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}_d(\mathbb{R})$ a 1-typical, one-step cocycle. For $t \in \mathbb{R}$ consider the sequences of potentials $\Phi_t=(\varphi_{t,n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ defined by $$\varphi_{t,n}(x):=S_n \psi(x) + t\log \|\mathcal{A}^n(x)\|, \: \forall n \in \mathbb{N}.$$ Using the family of transfer operators defined in this setting by Park and Piraino, for all $t&lt;0$ sufficiently close to 0 we prove the existence of Gibbs-type measures for the superadditive sequences of potentials $\Phi_t$. This extends the results of the well-understood subadditive case where $t \geq 0$. Prior to this, Gibbs-type measures were only known to exist for $t&lt;0$ in the conformal, the reducible, the positive, or the dominated, planar settings, in which case they are Gibbs measures in the classical sense. We further prove that the topological pressure function $t \mapsto P_{\mathrm{top}}(\Phi_t,\sigma)$ is analytic in an open neighbourhood of 0 and has derivative given by the Lyapunov exponents of these Gibbs-type measures.</description>

      <title>On the space of subgroups of Baumslag-Solitar groups I: perfect kernel and phenotype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a Baumslag-Solitar group, we study its space of subgroups from a topological and dynamical perspective. We first determine its perfect kernel (the largest closed subset without isolated points). We then bring to light a natural partition of the space of subgroups into one closed subset and countably many open subsets that are invariant under the action by conjugation. One of our main results is that the restriction of the action to each piece is topologically transitive. This partition is described by an arithmetically defined function, that we call the phenotype, with values in the positive integers or infinity. We eventually study the closure of each open piece and also the closure of their union. We moreover identify in each phenotype a (the) maximal compact invariant subspace.</description>

      <title>Homogeneity of arithmetic quantum limits for hyperbolic $4$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We work toward the arithmetic quantum unique ergodicity (AQUE) conjecture for sequences of Hecke--Maass forms on hyperbolic $4$-manifolds. We show that limits of such forms can only scar on totally geodesic $3$-submanifolds, and in fact that all ergodic components of the microlocal lift other than the uniform measure arise from the uniform measures on these submanifolds.</description>
