      <title>Design and Implementation of a High-Precision Wind-Estimation UAV with Onboard Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate real-time wind vector estimation is essential for enhancing the safety, navigation accuracy, and energy efficiency of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Traditional approaches rely on external sensors or simplify vehicle dynamics, which limits their applicability during agile flight or in resource-constrained platforms. This paper proposes a real-time wind estimation method based solely on onboard sensors. The approach first estimates external aerodynamic forces using a disturbance observer (DOB), and then maps these forces to wind vectors using a thin-plate spline (TPS) model. A custom-designed wind barrel mounted on the UAV enhances aerodynamic sensitivity, further improving estimation accuracy. The system is validated through comprehensive experiments in wind tunnels, indoor and outdoor flights. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistently high-accuracy wind estimation across controlled and real-world conditions, with speed RMSEs as low as \SI{0.06}{m/s} in wind tunnel tests, \SI{0.22}{m/s} during outdoor hover, and below \SI{0.38}{m/s} in indoor and outdoor dynamic flights, and direction RMSEs under \ang{7.3} across all scenarios, outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the method provides vertical wind estimates -- unavailable in baselines -- with RMSEs below \SI{0.17}{m/s} even during fast indoor translations.</description>

      <title>Metrics, KPIs, and Taxonomy for Data Valuation and Monetisation - Internal Processes Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data valuation and monetisation are emerging as central challenges in data-driven economies, yet no unified framework exists to measure or manage data value across organisational contexts. This paper presents a systematic literature review of metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to data valuation and monetisation, focusing on the Internal Processes Perspective of the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). As part of a broader effort to explore all four BSC perspectives, we identify, categorise, and interrelate hundreds of metrics within a comprehensive taxonomy structured around three core clusters: Data Quality, Governance &amp; Compliance, and Operational Efficiency. The taxonomy consolidates overlapping definitions, clarifies conceptual dependencies, and links technical, organisational, and regulatory indicators that underpin data value creation. By integrating these dimensions, it provides a foundation for the development of standardised and evidence-based valuation frameworks. Beyond its theoretical contribution, the taxonomy supports ongoing practical applications in decision-support systems and data valuation models, advancing the broader goal of establishing a coherent, dynamic approach to assessing and monetising data across industries.</description>

      <title>Unified Smart Factory Model: A model-based Approach for Integrating Industry 4.0 and Sustainability for Manufacturing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Unified Smart Factory Model (USFM), a comprehensive framework designed to translate high-level sustainability goals into measurable factory-level indicators with a systematic information map of manufacturing activities. The manufacturing activities were modelled as set of manufacturing, assembly and auxiliary processes using Object Process Methodology, a Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) language. USFM integrates Manufacturing Process and System, Data Process, and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Selection and Assessment in a single framework. Through a detailed case study of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assembly factory, the paper demonstrates how environmental sustainability KPIs can be selected, modelled, and mapped to the necessary data, highlighting energy consumption and environmental impact metrics. The model's systematic approach can reduce redundancy, minimize the risk of missing critical information, and enhance data collection. The paper concluded that the USFM bridges the gap between sustainability goals and practical implementation, providing significant benefits for industries specifically SMEs aiming to achieve sustainability targets.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Orchestration Artificial Intelligence by the Ten Criteria with Control-Plane Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly assume consequential decision-making roles, a widening gap has emerged between technical capabilities and institutional accountability. Ethical guidance alone is insufficient to counter this challenge; it demands architectures that embed governance into the execution fabric of the ecosystem. This paper presents the Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI, a comprehensive assurance framework that integrates human input, semantic coherence, audit and provenance integrity into a unified Control-Panel architecture. Unlike conventional agentic AI initiatives that primarily focus on AI-to-AI coordination, the proposed framework provides an umbrella of governance to the entire AI components, their consumers and human participants. By taking aspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance initiative, this work demonstrates that trustworthiness can be systematically incorporated (by engineering) into AI systems, ensuring the execution fabric remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control.</description>

      <title>A Proof of Success and Reward Distribution Protocol for Multi-bridge Architecture in Cross-chain Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-bridge blockchain solutions enable cross-chain communication. However, they are associated with centralization and single-point-of-failure risks. This paper proposes Proof of Success and Reward Distribution (PSCRD), a novel multi-bridge response coordination and incentive distribution protocol designed to address the challenges. PSCRD introduces a fair reward distribution system that equitably distributes the transfer fee among participating bridges, incentivizing honest behavior and sustained commitment. The purpose is to encourage bridge participation for higher decentralization and lower single-point-of-failure risks. The mathematical analysis and simulation results validate the effectiveness of PSCRD using two key metrics: the Gini index, which demonstrates a progressive improvement in the fairness of the reward distribution as new bridge groups joined the network; and the Nakamoto coefficient, which shows a significant improvement in decentralization over time. These findings highlight that PSCRD provides a more resilient and secure cross-chain bridge system without substantially increasing user costs.</description>

      <title>A Markov Decision Process Framework for Early Maneuver Decisions in Satellite Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Markov decision process (MDP) framework to autonomously make guidance decisions for satellite collision avoidance maneuver (CAM) and a reinforcement learning policy gradient (RL-PG) algorithm to enable direct optimization of guidance policy using historic CAM data. In addition to maintaining acceptable collision risks, this approach seeks to minimize the average propellant consumption of CAMs by making early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete action and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when to initiate the maneuver. The MDP models decision rewards using analytical models of collision risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. By deciding to maneuver earlier than conventional methods, the Markov policy effectively favors CAMs that achieve comparable rates of collision risk reduction while consuming less propellant. Using historical data of tracked conjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive parameter-sensitivity study. When evaluated on synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy consumes significantly less propellant overall and per maneuver in comparison to a conventional cut-off policy that initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On historical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant overall but consumes less propellant per maneuver. For both historical and synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy is slightly more conservative in identifying conjunctions events that warrant CAMs in comparison to cutoff policies.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Molecular Language Models (HMLMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping computational and network biology by enabling new approaches to decode cellular communication networks. We introduce Hierarchical Molecular Language Models (HMLMs), a novel framework that models cellular signaling as a specialized molecular language, where signaling molecules function as tokens, protein interactions define syntax, and functional consequences constitute semantics. HMLMs employ a transformer-based architecture adapted to accommodate graph-structured signaling networks through information transducers, mathematical entities that capture how molecules receive, process, and transmit signals. The architecture integrates multi-modal data sources across molecular, pathway, and cellular scales through hierarchical attention mechanisms and scale-bridging operators that enable information flow across biological hierarchies. Applied to a complex network of cardiac fibroblast signaling, HMLMs outperformed traditional approaches in temporal dynamics prediction, particularly under sparse sampling conditions. Attention-based analysis revealed biologically meaningful crosstalk patterns, including previously uncharacterized interactions between signaling pathways. By bridging molecular mechanisms with cellular phenotypes through AI-driven molecular language representation, HMLMs establish a foundation for biology-oriented large language models (LLMs) that could be pre-trained on comprehensive pathway datasets and applied across diverse signaling systems and tissues, advancing precision medicine and therapeutic discovery.</description>
