      <title>Texture tomography with high angular resolution utilizing sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to the reconstruction of scanning probe x-ray diffraction tomography data with anisotropic poly crystalline samples. The method involves reconstructing a voxel map containing an orientation distribution function in each voxel of an extended 3D sample. This method differs from existing approaches by not relying on a peak-finding and is therefore applicable to sample systems consisting of small and highly mosaic crystalline domains that are not handled well by existing methods. Samples of interest include bio-minerals and a range of small-graines microstructures common in engineering metals. By choosing a particular kind of basis functions, we can effectively utilize non-negativity in orientation-space for samples with sparse texture. This enables us to achieve stable solutions at high angular resolutions where the problem would otherwise be under determined. We demonstrate the new approach using data from a shot peened martensite sample where we are able to map the twinning micro structure in the interior of a bulk sample without resolving the individual lattice domains. We also demonstrate the approach on a piece of gastropods shell with a mosaic micro structure.</description>

      <title>Moment Unfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deconvolving ("unfolding'') detector distortions is a critical step in the comparison of cross section measurements with theoretical predictions in particle and nuclear physics. However, most existing approaches require histogram binning while many theoretical predictions are at the level of statistical moments. We develop a new approach to directly unfold distribution moments as a function of another observable without having to first discretize the data. Our Moment Unfolding technique uses machine learning and is inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We demonstrate the performance of this approach using jet substructure measurements in collider physics. With this illustrative example, we find that our Moment Unfolding protocol is more precise than bin-based approaches and is as or more precise than completely unbinned methods.</description>

      <title>Cumulative Advantage of Brokerage in Academia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Science is a collaborative endeavor in which "who collaborates with whom" profoundly influences scientists' career trajectories and success. Despite its relevance, little is known about how scholars facilitate new collaborations among their peers. In this study, we quantify brokerage in academia and study its effect on the careers of physicists worldwide. We find that early-career participation in brokerage increases later-stage involvement for all researchers, with increasing participation rates and greater career impact among more successful scientists. This cumulative advantage process suggests that brokerage contributes to the unequal distribution of success in academia. Surprisingly, this affects both women and men equally, despite women being more junior in all brokerage roles and lagging behind men's participation due to their late and slow arrival to physics. Because of its cumulative nature, promoting brokerage opportunities to early career scientists might help reduce the inequalities in academic success.</description>

      <title>Global Optimisation of Black-Box Functions with Generative Models in the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new uncertainty estimator for gradient-free optimisation of black-box simulators using deep generative surrogate models. Optimisation of these simulators is especially challenging for stochastic simulators and higher dimensions. To address these issues, we utilise a deep generative surrogate approach to model the black box response for the entire parameter space. We then leverage this knowledge to estimate the proposed uncertainty based on the Wasserstein distance - the Wasserstein uncertainty. This approach is employed in a posterior agnostic gradient-free optimisation algorithm that minimises regret over the entire parameter space. A series of tests were conducted to demonstrate that our method is more robust to the shape of both the black box function and the stochastic response of the black box than state-of-the-art methods, such as efficient global optimisation with a deep Gaussian process surrogate.</description>

      <title>Network analysis with quantum dynamics clarifies why photosystem II exploits both chlorophyll a and b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.04848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In green plants, chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b are the predominant pigments bound to light-harvesting proteins. While the individual characteristics of these chlorophylls are well understood, the advantages of their coexistence remain unclear. In this study, we establish a method to simulate excitation energy transfer within the entire photosystem II supercomplex by employing network analysis integrated with quantum dynamic calculations. We then investigate the effects of the coexistence of chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b by comparing various chlorophyll compositions. Our results reveal that the natural chlorophyll composition allows the excited energy to preferentially flow through specific domains that act as safety valves, preventing downstream overflow. Our findings suggest that the light-harvesting proteins in a photosystem II supercomplex achieve evolutionary advantages with the natural chlorophyll-a/b ratio, capturing light energy efficiently and safely across various light intensities. Using our framework, one can better understand how green plants harvest light energy and adapt to changing environmental conditions.</description>
