      <title>Evaluating Deep Regression Models for WSI-Based Gene-Expression Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction of mRNA gene-expression profiles directly from routine whole-slide images (WSIs) using deep learning models could potentially offer cost-effective and widely accessible molecular phenotyping. While such WSI-based gene-expression prediction models have recently emerged within computational pathology, the high-dimensional nature of the corresponding regression problem offers numerous design choices which remain to be analyzed in detail. This study provides recommendations on how deep regression models should be trained for WSI-based gene-expression prediction. For example, we conclude that training a single model to simultaneously regress all 20530 genes is a computationally efficient yet very strong baseline.</description>

      <title>FlexLMM: a Nextflow linear mixed model framework for GWAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Summary: Linear mixed models are a commonly used statistical approach in genome-wide association studies when population structure is present. However, naive permutations to empirically estimate the null distribution of a statistic of interest are not appropriate in the presence of population structure, because the samples are not exchangeable with each other. For this reason we developed FlexLMM, a Nextflow pipeline that runs linear mixed models while allowing for flexibility in the definition of the exact statistical model to be used. FlexLMM can also be used to set a significance threshold via permutations, thanks to a two-step process where the population structure is first regressed out, and only then are the permutations performed. We envision this pipeline will be particularly useful for researchers working on multi-parental crosses among inbred lines of model organisms or farm animals and plants.
  Availability and implementation: The source code and documentation for the FlexLMM is available at https://github.com/birneylab/flexlmm.</description>

      <title>OmniGenBench: Automating Large-scale in-silico Benchmarking for Genomic Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancements in artificial intelligence in recent years, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), have fueled expectations for breakthroughs in genomic foundation models (GFMs). The code of nature, hidden in diverse genomes since the very beginning of life's evolution, holds immense potential for impacting humans and ecosystems through genome modeling. Recent breakthroughs in GFMs, such as Evo, have attracted significant investment and attention to genomic modeling, as they address long-standing challenges and transform in-silico genomic studies into automated, reliable, and efficient paradigms. In the context of this flourishing era of consecutive technological revolutions in genomics, GFM studies face two major challenges: the lack of GFM benchmarking tools and the absence of open-source software for diverse genomics. These challenges hinder the rapid evolution of GFMs and their wide application in tasks such as understanding and synthesizing genomes, problems that have persisted for decades. To address these challenges, we introduce GFMBench, a framework dedicated to GFM-oriented benchmarking. GFMBench standardizes benchmark suites and automates benchmarking for a wide range of open-source GFMs. It integrates millions of genomic sequences across hundreds of genomic tasks from four large-scale benchmarks, democratizing GFMs for a wide range of in-silico genomic applications. Additionally, GFMBench is released as open-source software, offering user-friendly interfaces and diverse tutorials, applicable for AutoBench and complex tasks like RNA design and structure prediction. To facilitate further advancements in genome modeling, we have launched a public leaderboard showcasing the benchmark performance derived from AutoBench. GFMBench represents a step toward standardizing GFM benchmarking and democratizing GFM applications.</description>

      <title>Organization and Dynamics of Chromosomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How long threadlike eukaryotic chromosomes fit tidily in the small volume of the nucleus without significant entanglement is just beginning to be understood, thanks to major advances in experimental techniques. Several polymer models, which reproduce contact maps that measure the probabilities that two loci are in spatial contact, have predicted the three-dimensional structures of interphase chromosomes. Data-driven approaches, using contact maps as input, predict that mitotic helical chromosomes are characterized by switch in handedness, referred to as "perversion". By using experimentally derived effective interactions between chromatin loci in simulations, structures of conventional and inverted nuclei have been accurately predicted. Polymer theory and simulations show that the dynamics of individual loci in chromatin exhibit subdiffusive behavior but the diffusion exponents are broadly distributed, which accords well with experiments. Although coarse-grained models are successful, many challenging problems remain, which require the creation of new experimental and computational tools to understand genome biology.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Driven Feature Selection and Engineering for Genotype Data with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting phenotypes with complex genetic bases based on a small, interpretable set of variant features remains a challenging task. Conventionally, data-driven approaches are utilized for this task, yet the high dimensional nature of genotype data makes the analysis and prediction difficult. Motivated by the extensive knowledge encoded in pre-trained LLMs and their success in processing complex biomedical concepts, we set to examine the ability of LLMs in feature selection and engineering for tabular genotype data, with a novel knowledge-driven framework. We develop FREEFORM, Free-flow Reasoning and Ensembling for Enhanced Feature Output and Robust Modeling, designed with chain-of-thought and ensembling principles, to select and engineer features with the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs. Evaluated on two distinct genotype-phenotype datasets, genetic ancestry and hereditary hearing loss, we find this framework outperforms several data-driven methods, particularly on low-shot regimes. FREEFORM is available as open-source framework at GitHub: https://github.com/PennShenLab/FREEFORM.</description>
