      <title>Approaches to studying virus pangenome variation graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pangenome variation graphs (PVGs) allow for the representation of genetic diversity in a more nuanced way than traditional reference-based approaches. Here we focus on how PVGs are a powerful tool for studying genetic variation in viruses, offering insights into the complexities of viral quasispecies, mutation rates, and population dynamics. PVGs allow for the representation of genetic diversity in a more nuanced way than traditional reference-based approaches. PVGs originated in human genomics and hold great promise for viral genomics. Previous work has been constrained by small sample sizes and gene-centric methods, PVGs enable a more comprehensive approach to studying viral diversity. Large viral genome collections should be used to make PVGs, which offer significant advantages: we outline accessible tools to achieve this. This spans PVG construction, PVG file formats, PVG manipulation and analysis, PVG visualisation, measuring PVG openness, and mapping reads to PVGs. Additionally, the development of PVG-specific formats for mutation representation and personalised PVGs that reflect specific research questions will further enhance PVG applications. Although challenges remain, particularly in managing nested variants and optimising error detection, PVGs offer a promising direction for viral population genomics. These advances will enable more accurate and comprehensive detection of viral mutations, contributing to a deeper understanding of viral evolution and genotype-phenotype associations.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive comparison of tools for fitting mutational signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mutational signatures connect characteristic mutational patterns in the genome with biological or chemical processes that take place in cancers. Analysis of mutational signatures can help elucidate tumor evolution, prognosis, and therapeutic strategies. Although tools for extracting mutational signatures de novo have been extensively benchmarked, a similar effort is lacking for tools that fit known mutational signatures to a given catalog of mutations. We fill this gap by comprehensively evaluating twelve signature fitting tools on synthetic mutational catalogs with empirically-driven signature weights corresponding to eight cancer types. On average, SigProfilerSingleSample and SigProfilerAssignment/MuSiCal perform best for small and large numbers of mutations per sample, respectively. We further show that ad hoc constraining the list of reference signatures is likely to produce inferior results. Evaluation of real mutational catalogs suggests that the activity of signatures that are absent in the reference catalog poses considerable problems to all evaluated tools.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning in Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics Data Analysis: Advances and Challenges from a Data Science Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized our capacity to investigate cellular properties, functions, and interactions in both cellular and spatial contexts. However, the analysis of single-cell and spatial omics data remains challenging. First, single-cell sequencing data are high-dimensional and sparse, often contaminated by noise and uncertainty, obscuring the underlying biological signals. Second, these data often encompass multiple modalities, including gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and spatial locations. Integrating these diverse data modalities is crucial for enhancing prediction accuracy and biological interpretability. Third, while the scale of single-cell sequencing has expanded to millions of cells, high-quality annotated datasets are still limited. Fourth, the complex correlations of biological tissues make it difficult to accurately reconstruct cellular states and spatial contexts. Traditional feature engineering-based analysis methods struggle to deal with the various challenges presented by intricate biological networks. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool capable of handling high-dimensional complex data and automatically identifying meaningful patterns, offering significant promise in addressing these challenges. This review systematically analyzes these challenges and discusses related deep learning approaches. Moreover, we have curated 21 datasets from 9 benchmarks, encompassing 58 computational methods, and evaluated their performance on the respective modeling tasks. Finally, we highlight three areas for future development from a technical, dataset, and application perspective. This work will serve as a valuable resource for understanding how deep learning can be effectively utilized in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses, while inspiring novel approaches to address emerging challenges.</description>

      <title>Chromosomal rearrangements and transposable elements in locally adapted island Drosophila</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.09801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chromosomal rearrangements, particularly those mediated by transposable elements (TEs), can drive adaptive evolution by creating chimeric genes, inducing de novo gene formation, or altering gene expression. Here, we investigate rearrangements evolutionary role during habitat shifts in two locally adapted populations, Drosphila santomea and Drosphila yakuba, who have inhabited the island S\~ao Tom\'e for 500,000 and 10,000 years respectively. Using the D. yakuba- D. santomea species complex, we identified 16,480 rearrangements in the two island populations and the ancestral mainland African population of D. yakuba. We find a disproportionate association with TEs, with 83.5% of rearrangements linked to TE insertions or TE-facilitated ectopic recombination. Using significance thresholds based on neutral expectations, we identify 383 and 468 significantly differentiated rearrangements in island D. yakuba and D. santomea, respectively, relative to the mainland population. Of these, 99 and 145 rearrangements also showed significant differential gene expression, highlighting the potential for adaptive solutions from rearrangements and TEs. Within and between island populations, we find significantly different proportions of rearrangements originating from new mutations versus standing variation depending on TE association, potentially suggesting adaptive genetic mechanisms differ based on the timing of habitat shifts. Functional analyses of rearrangements most likely driving local adaptation revealed enrichment for stress response pathways, including UV tolerance and DNA repair, in high-altitude D. santomea. These findings suggest that chromosomal rearrangements may act as a source of genetic innovation, and provides insight into evolutionary processes that SNP-based analyses might overlook.</description>
