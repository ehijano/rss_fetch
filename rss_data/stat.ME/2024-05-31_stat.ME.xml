      <title>Comparison of Point Process Learning and its special case Takacs-Fiksel estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Cronie et al. (2024) introduced the notion of cross-validation for point processes and a new statistical methodology called Point Process Learning (PPL). In PPL one splits a point process/pattern into a training and a validation set, and then predicts the latter from the former through a parametrised Papangelou conditional intensity. The model parameters are estimated by minimizing a point process prediction error; this notion was introduced as the second building block of PPL. It was shown that PPL outperforms the state-of-the-art in both kernel intensity estimation and estimation of the parameters of the Gibbs hard-core process. In the latter case, the state-of-the-art was represented by pseudolikelihood estimation. In this paper we study PPL in relation to Takacs-Fiksel estimation, of which pseudolikelihood is a special case. We show that Takacs-Fiksel estimation is a special case of PPL in the sense that PPL with a specific loss function asymptotically reduces to Takacs-Fiksel estimation if we let the cross-validation regime tend to leave-one-out cross-validation. Moreover, PPL involves a certain type of hyperparameter given by a weight function which ensures that the prediction errors have expectation zero if and only if we have the correct parametrisation. We show that the weight function takes an explicit but intractable form for general Gibbs models. Consequently, we propose different approaches to estimate the weight function in practice. In order to assess how the general PPL setup performs in relation to its special case Takacs-Fiksel estimation, we conduct a simulation study where we find that for common Gibbs models we can find loss functions and hyperparameters so that PPL typically outperforms Takacs-Fiksel estimation significantly in terms of mean square error. Here, the hyperparameters are the cross-validation parameters and the weight function estimate.</description>

      <title>Canonical Correlation Analysis as Reduced Rank Regression in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a widespread technique for discovering linear relationships between two sets of variables $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ and $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times q}$. In high dimensions however, standard estimates of the canonical directions cease to be consistent without assuming further structure. In this setting, a possible solution consists in leveraging the presumed sparsity of the solution: only a subset of the covariates span the canonical directions. While the last decade has seen a proliferation of sparse CCA methods, practical challenges regarding the scalability and adaptability of these methods still persist. To circumvent these issues, this paper suggests an alternative strategy that uses reduced rank regression to estimate the canonical directions when one of the datasets is high-dimensional while the other remains low-dimensional. By casting the problem of estimating the canonical direction as a regression problem, our estimator is able to leverage the rich statistics literature on high-dimensional regression and is easily adaptable to accommodate a wider range of structural priors. Our proposed solution maintains computational efficiency and accuracy, even in the presence of very high-dimensional data. We validate the benefits of our approach through a series of simulated experiments and further illustrate its practicality by applying it to three real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Inference in semiparametric formation models for directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a semiparametric model for dyadic link formations in directed networks. The model contains a set of degree parameters that measure different effects of popularity or outgoingness across nodes, a regression parameter vector that reflects the homophily effect resulting from the nodal attributes or pairwise covariates associated with edges, and a set of latent random noises with unknown distributions. Our interest lies in inferring the unknown degree parameters and homophily parameters. The dimension of the degree parameters increases with the number of nodes. Under the high-dimensional regime, we develop a kernel-based least squares approach to estimate the unknown parameters. The major advantage of our estimator is that it does not encounter the incidental parameter problem for the homophily parameters. We prove consistency of all the resulting estimators of the degree parameters and homophily parameters. We establish high-dimensional central limit theorems for the proposed estimators and provide several applications of our general theory, including testing the existence of degree heterogeneity, testing sparse signals and recovering the support. Simulation studies and a real data application are conducted to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Joint Modeling for Longitudinal Magnitude Data with Informative Dropout: an Application to Critical Care Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In various biomedical studies, the focus of analysis centers on the magnitudes of data, particularly when algebraic signs are irrelevant or lost. To analyze the magnitude outcomes in repeated measures studies, using models with random effects is essential. This is because random effects can account for individual heterogeneity, enhancing parameter estimation precision. However, there are currently no established regression methods that incorporate random effects and are specifically designed for magnitude outcomes. This article bridges this gap by introducing Bayesian regression modeling approaches for analyzing magnitude data, with a key focus on the incorporation of random effects. Additionally, the proposed method is extended to address multiple causes of informative dropout, commonly encountered in repeated measures studies. To tackle the missing data challenge arising from dropout, a joint modeling strategy is developed, building upon the previously introduced regression techniques. Two numerical simulation studies are conducted to assess the validity of our method. The chosen simulation scenarios aim to resemble the conditions of our motivating study. The results demonstrate that the proposed method for magnitude data exhibits good performance in terms of both estimation accuracy and precision, and the joint models effectively mitigate bias due to missing data. Finally, we apply proposed models to analyze the magnitude data from the motivating study, investigating if sex impacts the magnitude change in diaphragm thickness over time for ICU patients.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Factor Analysis of High-dimensional Recurrent Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent event time data arise in many studies, including biomedicine, public health, marketing, and social media analysis. High-dimensional recurrent event data involving large numbers of event types and observations become prevalent with the advances in information technology. This paper proposes a semiparametric dynamic factor model for the dimension reduction and prediction of high-dimensional recurrent event data. The proposed model imposes a low-dimensional structure on the mean intensity functions of the event types while allowing for dependencies. A nearly rate-optimal smoothing-based estimator is proposed. An information criterion that consistently selects the number of factors is also developed. Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of these inference tools. The proposed method is applied to grocery shopping data, for which an interpretable factor structure is obtained.</description>

      <title>Reduced Rank Regression for Mixed Predictor and Response Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the generalized mixed reduced rank regression method, GMR$^3$ for short. GMR$^3$ is a regression method for a mix of numeric, binary and ordinal response variables. The predictor variables can be a mix of binary, nominal, ordinal, and numeric variables. For dealing with the categorical predictors we use optimal scaling. A majorization-minimization algorithm is derived for maximum likelihood estimation under a local independence assumption. We discuss in detail model selection for the dimensionality or rank, and the selection of predictor variables. We show an application of GMR$^3$ using the Eurobarometer Surveys data set of 2023.</description>

      <title>Targeted Sequential Indirect Experiment Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific hypotheses typically concern specific aspects of complex, imperfectly understood or entirely unknown mechanisms, such as the effect of gene expression levels on phenotypes or how microbial communities influence environmental health. Such queries are inherently causal (rather than purely associational), but in many settings, experiments can not be conducted directly on the target variables of interest, but are indirect. Therefore, they perturb the target variable, but do not remove potential confounding factors. If, additionally, the resulting experimental measurements are multi-dimensional and the studied mechanisms nonlinear, the query of interest is generally not identified. We develop an adaptive strategy to design indirect experiments that optimally inform a targeted query about the ground truth mechanism in terms of sequentially narrowing the gap between an upper and lower bound on the query. While the general formulation consists of a bi-level optimization procedure, we derive an efficiently estimable analytical kernel-based estimator of the bounds for the causal effect, a query of key interest, and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in confounded, multivariate, nonlinear synthetic settings.</description>

      <title>A unified framework of principal component analysis and factor analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Principal component analysis and factor analysis are fundamental multivariate analysis methods. In this paper a unified framework to connect them is introduced. Under a general latent variable model, we present matrix optimization problems from the viewpoint of loss function minimization, and show that the two methods can be viewed as solutions to the optimization problems with specific loss functions. Specifically, principal component analysis can be derived from a broad class of loss functions including the L2 norm, while factor analysis corresponds to a modified L0 norm problem. Related problems are discussed, including algorithms, penalized maximum likelihood estimation under the latent variable model, and a principal component factor model. These results can lead to new tools of data analysis and research topics.</description>

      <title>Accounting for Mismatch Error in Small Area Estimation with Linked Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In small area estimation different data sources are integrated in order to produce reliable estimates of target parameters (e.g., a mean or a proportion) for a collection of small subsets (areas) of a finite population. Regression models such as the linear mixed effects model or M-quantile regression are often used to improve the precision of survey sample estimates by leveraging auxiliary information for which means or totals are known at the area level. In many applications, the unit-level linkage of records from different sources is probabilistic and potentially error-prone. In this paper, we present adjustments of the small area predictors that are based on either the linear mixed effects model or M-quantile regression to account for the presence of linkage error. These adjustments are developed from a two-component mixture model that hinges on the assumption of independence of the target and auxiliary variable given incorrect linkage. Estimation and inference is based on composite likelihoods and machinery revolving around the Expectation-Maximization Algorithm. For each of the two regression methods, we propose modified small area predictors and approximations for their mean squared errors. The empirical performance of the proposed approaches is studied in both design-based and model-based simulations that include comparisons to a variety of baselines.</description>

      <title>Item response parameter estimation performance using Gaussian quadrature and Laplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Item parameter estimation in pharmacometric item response theory (IRT) models is predominantly performed using the Laplace estimation algorithm as implemented in NONMEM. In psychometrics a wide range of different software tools, including several packages for the open-source software R for implementation of IRT are also available. Each have their own set of benefits and limitations and to date a systematic comparison of the primary estimation algorithms has not been evaluated. A simulation study evaluating varying number of hypothetical sample sizes and item scenarios at baseline was performed using both Laplace and Gauss-hermite quadrature (GHQ-EM). In scenarios with at least 20 items and more than 100 subjects, item parameters were estimated with good precision and were similar between estimation algorithms as demonstrated by several measures of bias and precision. The minimal differences observed for certain parameters or sample size scenarios were reduced when translating to the total score scale. The ease of use, speed of estimation and relative accuracy of the GHQ-EM method employed in mirt make it an appropriate alternative or supportive analytical approach to NONMEM for potential pharmacometrics IRT applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Approximations of Count Distributions and Forecasts for Poisson-Lindley Integer Autoregressive Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although many time series are realizations from discrete processes, it is often that a continuous Gaussian model is implemented for modeling and forecasting the data, resulting in incoherent forecasts. Forecasts using a Poisson-Lindley integer autoregressive (PLINAR) model are compared to variations of Gaussian forecasts via simulation by equating relevant moments of the marginals of the PLINAR to the Gaussian AR. To illustrate utility, the methods discussed are applied and compared using a discrete series with model parameters being estimated using each of conditional least squares, Yule-Walker, and maximum likelihood.</description>

      <title>Tempered Multifidelity Importance Sampling for Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the parameters of compact binaries which coalesce and produce gravitational waves is a challenging Bayesian inverse problem. Gravitational-wave parameter estimation lies within the class of multifidelity problems, where a variety of models with differing assumptions, levels of fidelity, and computational cost are available for use in inference. In an effort to accelerate the solution of a Bayesian inverse problem, cheaper surrogates for the best models may be used to reduce the cost of likelihood evaluations when sampling the posterior. Importance sampling can then be used to reweight these samples to represent the true target posterior, incurring a reduction in the effective sample size. In cases when the problem is high dimensional, or when the surrogate model produces a poor approximation of the true posterior, this reduction in effective samples can be dramatic and render multifidelity importance sampling ineffective. We propose a novel method of tempered multifidelity importance sampling in order to remedy this issue. With this method the biasing distribution produced by the low-fidelity model is tempered, allowing for potentially better overlap with the target distribution. There is an optimal temperature which maximizes the efficiency in this setting, and we propose a low-cost strategy for approximating this optimal temperature using samples from the untempered distribution. In this paper, we motivate this method by applying it to Gaussian target and biasing distributions. Finally, we apply it to a series of problems in gravitational wave parameter estimation and demonstrate improved efficiencies when applying the method to real gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Factor Augmented Tensor-on-Tensor Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the prediction task of tensor-on-tensor regression in which both covariates and responses are multi-dimensional arrays (a.k.a., tensors) across time with arbitrary tensor order and data dimension. Existing methods either focused on linear models without accounting for possibly nonlinear relationships between covariates and responses, or directly employed black-box deep learning algorithms that failed to utilize the inherent tensor structure. In this work, we propose a Factor Augmented Tensor-on-Tensor Neural Network (FATTNN) that integrates tensor factor models into deep neural networks. We begin with summarizing and extracting useful predictive information (represented by the ``factor tensor'') from the complex structured tensor covariates, and then proceed with the prediction task using the estimated factor tensor as input of a temporal convolutional neural network. The proposed methods effectively handle nonlinearity between complex data structures, and improve over traditional statistical models and conventional deep learning approaches in both prediction accuracy and computational cost. By leveraging tensor factor models, our proposed methods exploit the underlying latent factor structure to enhance the prediction, and in the meantime, drastically reduce the data dimensionality that speeds up the computation. The empirical performances of our proposed methods are demonstrated via simulation studies and real-world applications to three public datasets. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve substantial increases in prediction accuracy and significant reductions in computational time compared to benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sufficient Dimension Reduction via Hellinger Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a new theory and method for sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) in single-index models, where SDR is a sub-field of supervised dimension reduction based on conditional independence. Our work is primarily motivated by the recent introduction of the Hellinger correlation as a dependency measure. Utilizing this measure, we develop a method capable of effectively detecting the dimension reduction subspace, complete with theoretical justification. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances and outperforms existing SDR methods. This improvement is largely attributed to our proposed method's deeper understanding of data dependencies and the refinement of existing SDR techniques.</description>

      <title>Task-Agnostic Machine Learning-Assisted Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is playing an increasingly important role in scientific research. In conjunction with classical statistical approaches, ML-assisted analytical strategies have shown great promise in accelerating research findings. This has also opened up a whole new field of methodological research focusing on integrative approaches that leverage both ML and statistics to tackle data science challenges. One type of study that has quickly gained popularity employs ML to predict unobserved outcomes in massive samples and then uses the predicted outcomes in downstream statistical inference. However, existing methods designed to ensure the validity of this type of post-prediction inference are limited to very basic tasks such as linear regression analysis. This is because any extension of these approaches to new, more sophisticated statistical tasks requires task-specific algebraic derivations and software implementations, which ignores the massive library of existing software tools already developed for complex inference tasks and severely constrains the scope of post-prediction inference in real applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel statistical framework for task-agnostic ML-assisted inference. It provides a post-prediction inference solution that can be easily plugged into almost any established data analysis routine. It delivers valid and efficient inference that is robust to arbitrary choices of ML models, while allowing nearly all existing analytical frameworks to be incorporated into the analysis of ML-predicted outcomes. Through extensive experiments, we showcase the validity, versatility, and superiority of our method compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Personalized Predictions from Population Level Experiments: A Study on Alzheimer's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to infer patient level outcomes from population level randomized control trials (RCTs). In this pursuit, we utilize the recently proposed synthetic nearest neighbors (SNN) estimator. At its core, SNN leverages information across patients to impute missing data associated with each patient of interest. We focus on two types of missing data: (i) unrecorded outcomes from discontinuing the assigned treatments and (ii) unobserved outcomes associated with unassigned treatments. Data imputation in the former powers and de-biases RCTs, while data imputation in the latter simulates "synthetic RCTs" to predict the outcomes for each patient under every treatment. The SNN estimator is interpretable, transparent, and causally justified under a broad class of missing data scenarios. Relative to several standard methods, we empirically find that SNN performs well for the above two applications using Phase 3 clinical trial data on patients with Alzheimer's Disease. Our findings directly suggest that SNN can tackle a current pain point within the clinical trial workflow on patient dropouts and serve as a new tool towards the development of precision medicine. Building on our insights, we discuss how SNN can further generalize to real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Dispersion Integer-Valued GARCH Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general class of INteger-valued Generalized AutoRegressive Conditionally Heteroscedastic (INGARCH) processes by allowing time-varying mean and dispersion parameters, which we call time-varying dispersion INGARCH (tv-DINGARCH) models. More specifically, we consider mixed Poisson INGARCH models and allow for dynamic modeling of the dispersion parameter (as well as the mean), similar to the spirit of the ordinary GARCH models. We derive conditions to obtain first and second-order stationarity, and ergodicity as well. Estimation of the parameters is addressed and their associated asymptotic properties are established as well. A restricted bootstrap procedure is proposed for testing constant dispersion against time-varying dispersion. Monte Carlo simulation studies are presented for checking point estimation, standard errors, and the performance of the restricted bootstrap approach. We apply the tv-DINGARCH process to model the weekly number of reported measles infections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, from January 2001 to May 2013, and compare its performance to the ordinary INGARCH approach.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for Extreme Quantile Regression with an Application to Forecasting of Flood Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Risk assessment for extreme events requires accurate estimation of high quantiles that go beyond the range of historical observations. When the risk depends on the values of observed predictors, regression techniques are used to interpolate in the predictor space. We propose the EQRN model that combines tools from neural networks and extreme value theory into a method capable of extrapolation in the presence of complex predictor dependence. Neural networks can naturally incorporate additional structure in the data. We develop a recurrent version of EQRN that is able to capture complex sequential dependence in time series. We apply this method to forecast flood risk in the Swiss Aare catchment. It exploits information from multiple covariates in space and time to provide one-day-ahead predictions of return levels and exceedance probabilities. This output complements the static return level from a traditional extreme value analysis, and the predictions are able to adapt to distributional shifts as experienced in a changing climate. Our model can help authorities to manage flooding more effectively and to minimize their disastrous impacts through early warning systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral Change Point Estimation for High Dimensional Time Series by Sparse Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate time series may be subject to partial structural changes over certain frequency band, for instance, in neuroscience. We study the change point detection problem with high dimensional time series, within the framework of frequency domain. The overarching goal is to locate all change points and delineate which series are activated by the change, over which frequencies. In practice, the number of activated series per change and frequency could span from a few to full participation. We solve the problem by first computing a CUSUM tensor based on spectra estimated from blocks of the time series. A frequency-specific projection approach is applied for dimension reduction. The projection direction is estimated by a proposed tensor decomposition algorithm that adjusts to the sparsity level of changes. Finally, the projected CUSUM vectors across frequencies are aggregated for change point detection. We provide theoretical guarantees on the number of estimated change points and the convergence rate of their locations. We derive error bounds for the estimated projection direction for identifying the frequency-specific series activated in a change. We provide data-driven rules for the choice of parameters. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated by simulation and a stock returns application.</description>

      <title>Individualized Dynamic Latent Factor Model for Multi-resolutional Data with Application to Mobile Health</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12392v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile health has emerged as a major success for tracking individual health status, due to the popularity and power of smartphones and wearable devices. This has also brought great challenges in handling heterogeneous, multi-resolution data which arise ubiquitously in mobile health due to irregular multivariate measurements collected from individuals. In this paper, we propose an individualized dynamic latent factor model for irregular multi-resolution time series data to interpolate unsampled measurements of time series with low resolution. One major advantage of the proposed method is the capability to integrate multiple irregular time series and multiple subjects by mapping the multi-resolution data to the latent space. In addition, the proposed individualized dynamic latent factor model is applicable to capturing heterogeneous longitudinal information through individualized dynamic latent factors. Our theory provides a bound on the integrated interpolation error and the convergence rate for B-spline approximation methods. Both the simulation studies and the application to smartwatch data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Multinomial Canonical Decomposition Model, with emphasis on the analysis of Multivariate Binary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to decompose the canonical parameter of a multinomial model into a set of participant scores and category scores. Both sets of scores are linearly constraint to represent external information about the participants and categories. For the estimation of the parameters of the decomposition, we derive a majorization-minimization algorithm. We place special emphasis on the case where the categories represent profiles of binary response variables. In that case, the multinomial model becomes a regression model for multiple binary response variables and researchers might be interested in the relationship of an external variable for the participant (i.e., a predictor) and one of the binary response variable or in the relationship between this predictor and the association among binary response variables. We derive interpretational rules for these relationships in terms of changes in log odds or log odds ratios. Connections between our multinomial canonical decomposition and loglinear models, multinomial logistic regression, multinomial reduced rank logistic regression, and double constrained correspondence analysis are discussed. We illustrate our methodology with two empirical data sets.</description>

      <title>Participation bias in the estimation of heritability and genetic correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is increasingly recognized that participation bias can pose problems for genetic studies. Recently, to overcome the challenge that genetic information of non-participants is unavailable, it is shown that by comparing the IBD (identity by descent) shared and not-shared segments among the participants, one can estimate the genetic component underlying participation. That, however, does not directly address how to adjust estimates of heritability and genetic correlation for phenotypes correlated with participation. Here, for phenotypes whose mean differences between population and sample are known, we demonstrate a way to do so by adopting a statistical framework that separates out the genetic and non-genetic correlations between participation and these phenotypes. Crucially, our method avoids making the assumption that the effect of the genetic component underlying participation is manifested entirely through these other phenotypes. Applying the method to 12 UK Biobank phenotypes, we found 8 have significant genetic correlations with participation, including body mass index, educational attainment, and smoking status. For most of these phenotypes, without adjustments, estimates of heritability and the absolute value of genetic correlation would have underestimation biases.</description>

      <title>Nuisance Function Tuning for Optimal Doubly Robust Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimators of doubly robust functionals typically rely on estimating two complex nuisance functions, such as the propensity score and conditional outcome mean for the average treatment effect functional. We consider the problem of how to estimate nuisance functions to obtain optimal rates of convergence for a doubly robust nonparametric functional that has witnessed applications across the causal inference and conditional independence testing literature. For several plug-in type estimators and a one-step type estimator, we illustrate the interplay between different tuning parameter choices for the nuisance function estimators and sample splitting strategies on the optimal rate of estimating the functional of interest. For each of these estimators and each sample splitting strategy, we show the necessity to undersmooth the nuisance function estimators under low regularity conditions to obtain optimal rates of convergence for the functional of interest. By performing suitable nuisance function tuning and sample splitting strategies, we show that some of these estimators can achieve minimax rates of convergence in all H\"older smoothness classes of the nuisance functions.</description>

      <title>Latent Factor Analysis in Short Panels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop inferential tools for latent factor analysis in short panels. The pseudo maximum likelihood setting under a large cross-sectional dimension n and a fixed time series dimension T relies on a diagonal TxT covariance matrix of the errors without imposing sphericity nor Gaussianity. We outline the asymptotic distributions of the latent factor and error covariance estimates as well as of an asymptotically uniformly most powerful invariant (AUMPI) test for the number of factors based on the likelihood ratio statistic. We derive the AUMPI characterization from inequalities ensuring the monotone likelihood ratio property for positive definite quadratic forms in normal variables. An empirical application to a large panel of monthly U.S. stock returns separates month after month systematic and idiosyncratic risks in short subperiods of bear vs. bull market based on the selected number of factors. We observe an uptrend in the paths of total and idiosyncratic volatilities while the systematic risk explains a large part of the cross-sectional total variance in bear markets but is not driven by a single factor. Rank tests show that observed factors struggle spanning latent factors with a discrepancy between the dimensions of the two factor spaces decreasing over time.</description>

      <title>Federated Causal Inference from Observational Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized data sources are prevalent in real-world applications, posing a formidable challenge for causal inference. These sources cannot be consolidated into a single entity owing to privacy constraints. The presence of dissimilar data distributions and missing values within them can potentially introduce bias to the causal estimands. In this article, we propose a framework to estimate causal effects from decentralized data sources. The proposed framework avoid exchanging raw data among the sources, thus contributing towards privacy-preserving causal learning. Three instances of the proposed framework are introduced to estimate causal effects across a wide range of diverse scenarios within a federated setting. (1) FedCI: a Bayesian framework based on Gaussian processes for estimating causal effects from federated observational data sources. It estimates the posterior distributions of the causal effects to compute the higher-order statistics that capture the uncertainty. (2) CausalRFF: an adaptive transfer algorithm that learns the similarities among the data sources by utilizing Random Fourier Features to disentangle the loss function into multiple components, each of which is associated with a data source. It estimates the similarities among the sources through transfer coefficients, and hence requiring no prior information about the similarity measures. (3) CausalFI: a new approach for federated causal inference from incomplete data, enabling the estimation of causal effects from multiple decentralized and incomplete data sources. It accounts for the missing data under the missing at random assumption, while also estimating higher-order statistics of the causal estimands. The proposed federated framework and its instances are an important step towards a privacy-preserving causal learning model.</description>

      <title>Loop Polarity Analysis to Avoid Underspecification in Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning is a powerful set of techniques for detecting complex patterns in data. However, when the causal structure of that process is underspecified, deep learning models can be brittle, lacking robustness to shifts in the distribution of the data-generating process. In this paper, we turn to loop polarity analysis as a tool for specifying the causal structure of a data-generating process, in order to encode a more robust understanding of the relationship between system structure and system behavior within the deep learning pipeline. We use simulated epidemic data based on an SIR model to demonstrate how measuring the polarity of the different feedback loops that compose a system can lead to more robust inferences on the part of neural networks, improving the out-of-distribution performance of a deep learning model and infusing a system-dynamics-inspired approach into the machine learning development pipeline.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and Statistical Properties of the Ordinary Least Squares Interpolator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning research has uncovered the phenomenon of benign overfitting for overparameterized statistical models, which has drawn significant theoretical interest in recent years. Given its simplicity and practicality, the ordinary least squares (OLS) interpolator has become essential to gain foundational insights into this phenomenon. While properties of OLS are well established in classical, underparameterized settings, its behavior in high-dimensional, overparameterized regimes is less explored (unlike for ridge or lasso regression) though significant progress has been made of late. We contribute to this growing literature by providing fundamental algebraic and statistical results for the minimum $\ell_2$-norm OLS interpolator. In particular, we provide algebraic equivalents of (i) the leave-$k$-out residual formula, (ii) Cochran's formula, and (iii) the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem in the overparameterized regime. These results aid in understanding the OLS interpolator's ability to generalize and have substantive implications for causal inference. Under the Gauss-Markov model, we present statistical results such as an extension of the Gauss-Markov theorem and an analysis of variance estimation under homoskedastic errors for the overparameterized regime. To substantiate our theoretical contributions, we conduct simulations that further explore the stochastic properties of the OLS interpolator.</description>

      <title>CaRiNG: Learning Temporal Causal Representation under Non-Invertible Generation Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying the underlying time-delayed latent causal processes in sequential data is vital for grasping temporal dynamics and making downstream reasoning. While some recent methods can robustly identify these latent causal variables, they rely on strict assumptions about the invertible generation process from latent variables to observed data. However, these assumptions are often hard to satisfy in real-world applications containing information loss. For instance, the visual perception process translates a 3D space into 2D images, or the phenomenon of persistence of vision incorporates historical data into current perceptions. To address this challenge, we establish an identifiability theory that allows for the recovery of independent latent components even when they come from a nonlinear and non-invertible mix. Using this theory as a foundation, we propose a principled approach, CaRiNG, to learn the CAusal RepresentatIon of Non-invertible Generative temporal data with identifiability guarantees. Specifically, we utilize temporal context to recover lost latent information and apply the conditions in our theory to guide the training process. Through experiments conducted on synthetic datasets, we validate that our CaRiNG method reliably identifies the causal process, even when the generation process is non-invertible. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach considerably improves temporal understanding and reasoning in practical applications.</description>

      <title>A Unification of Exchangeability and Continuous Exposure and Confounder Measurement Errors: Probabilistic Exchangeability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07910v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exchangeability concerning a continuous exposure, X, implies no confounding bias when identifying average exposure effects of X, AEE(X). When X is measured with error (Xep), two challenges arise in identifying AEE(X). Firstly, exchangeability regarding Xep does not equal exchangeability regarding X. Secondly, the non-differential error assumption (NDEA) could be overly stringent in practice. To address them, this article proposes unifying exchangeability and exposure and confounder measurement errors with three novel concepts. The first, Probabilistic Exchangeability (PE), states that the outcomes of those with Xep=e are probabilistically exchangeable with the outcomes of those truly exposed to X=eT. The relationship between AEE(Xep) and AEE(X) in risk difference and ratio scales is mathematically expressed as a probabilistic certainty, termed exchangeability probability (Pe). Squared Pe (Pe2) quantifies the extent to which AEE(Xep) differs from AEE(X) due to exposure measurement error through mechanisms not akin to confounding mechanisms. The coefficient of determination (R2) in the regression of Xep against X may sometimes be sufficient to measure Pe2. The second concept, Emergent Pseudo Confounding (EPC), describes the bias introduced by exposure measurement error through mechanisms akin to confounding mechanisms. PE requires controlling for EPC, which is weaker than NDEA. The third, Emergent Confounding, describes when bias due to confounder measurement error arises. Adjustment for E(P)C can be performed like confounding adjustment. This paper provides maximum insight into when AEE(Xep) is an appropriate surrogate of AEE(X) and how to measure the difference between these two. Differential errors could be addressed and may not compromise causal inference.</description>
