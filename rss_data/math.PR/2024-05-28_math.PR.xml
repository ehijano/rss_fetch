      <title>On the Growth of the Extremal and Cluster Level Sets in Branching Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the limiting extremal and cluster point processes of branching Brownian motion. The former records the heights of all extreme values of the process, while the latter records the relative heights of extreme values in a genealogical neighborhood of order unity around a local maximum thereof. For the extremal point process, we show that the mass of upper level sets $[-v, \infty)$ grows as $C_\star Z v e^{\sqrt{2} v}(1+o(1))$ as $v \to \infty$, almost surely, where $Z$ is the limit of the associated derivative martingale and $C_\star \in (0, \infty)$ is a universal constant. For the cluster point process, we show that the logarithm of the mass of $[-v, \infty)$ grow as $\sqrt{2}v$ minus random fluctuations of order $v^{2/3}$, which are governed by an explicit law in the limit. The first result improves upon the works of Cortines et al. (arXiv:1703.06529) and Mytnik et al. (arXiv:2009.02042) in which asymptotics are shown in probability, while the second makes rigorous the derivation in the physics literature by Mueller et al. (arXiv:1910.06382) and Le et al. (arXiv:2207.07672) and resolves a conjecture thereof.</description>

      <title>Random coverage from within with variable radii, and Johnson-Mehl cover times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact planar region $A$, let $\tau_A$ be the (random) time it takes for $A$ to be fully covered by a spatial birth-growth process in $A$ with seeds arriving as a unit-intensity Poisson point process in $A \times [0,\infty)$, where upon arrival each seed grows at unit rate in all directions. We show that if $\partial A$ is smooth or polygonal then $\Pr [ \pi \tau_{sA}^3 - 6 \log s - 4 \log \log s \leq x]$ tends to $\exp(- (\frac{81}{4\pi})^{1/3} |A|e^{-x/3} -
  (\frac{9}{2\pi^2})^{1/3} |\partial A| e^{-x/6})$ in the large-$s$ limit; the second term in the exponent is due to boundary effects, the importance of which was not recognized in earlier work on this model. We present similar results in higher dimensions (where boundary effects dominate). These results are derived using new results on the asymptotic probability of covering $A$ with a high-intensity spherical Poisson Boolean model \emph{restricted to $A$} with grains having iid small random radii, which generalize recent work of the author that dealt only with grains of deterministic radius.</description>

      <title>Sharp deviation bounds for midpoint and endpoint of geodesics in exponential last passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For exponential last passage percolation on the plane we analyse the probability that the point-to-line geodesic exhibits an atypically large transversal fluctuation at the endpoint as well as the probability that the point-to-point geodesic exhibits an atypically large transversal fluctuation at the halfway point. In particular, we show that $p^*_n(t)$, the probability that the point-to-line geodesic from the origin to the line $x+y=2n$ ends at $(n-t(2n)^{2/3}, n+t(2n)^{2/3})$ satisfies that $n^{2/3}p^*_n(t)=\exp(-(\frac{4}{3}+o(1))t^{3})$ for $t$ large and $p_{n,\frac{1}{2}}(t)$, the probability that the geodesic from the origin to the point $(n,n)$ passes through the point $(\frac{1}{2}n-tn^{2/3}, \frac{1}{2} n+tn^{2/3})$, satisfies $n^{2/3}p_{n,\frac{1}{2}}(t)=\exp(-(\frac{8}{3}+o(1))t^3)$ for $t$ large. The latter result solves a special case of a conjecture from Liu (PTRF, 2022).</description>

      <title>An extension of the cogrowth formula to arbitrary subsets of the tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is the probability that a random walk in the free group ends in a proper power? Or in a primitive element? We present a formula that computes the exponential decay rate of the probability that a random walk on a regular tree ends in a given subset, in terms of the exponential decay rate of the analogous probability of the non-backtracking random walk. This generalizes the well-known cogrowth formula of Grigorchuk, Cohen and Northshield.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos and phase transition in a stochastic model for a social network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model for a social network with N interacting social actors. This model is a system of interacting marked point processes in which each point process indicates the successive times in which a social actor expresses a "favorable" (+1) or "contrary" (-1) opinion. The orientation and the rate at which an actor expresses an opinion is influenced by the social pressure exerted on this actor. The social pressure of an actor is reset to 0 when the actor expresses an opinion, and simultaneously the social pressures on all the other actors change by h/N in the direction of the opinion that was just expressed.
  We prove propagation of chaos of the system, as N diverges to infinity, to a limit nonlinear jumping stochastic differential equation. Moreover, we prove that under certain conditions the limit system exhibits a phase transition described as follows. If h is smaller or equal than a certain threshold, the limit system has only the null Dirac measure as an invariant probability measure, corresponding to a vanishing social pressure on all actors. However, if h is greater than the threshold, the system has two additional non-trivial invariant probability measures. One of these measures has support on the positive real numbers and the other is obtained by symmetrization with respect to 0, having thus support on the negative real numbers.</description>

      <title>The Quadratic Variation of Gauss-Markov Semimartingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The covariance function of a Gauss-Markov process evaluated at points $(s,t)$ admits a representation as a product of a function of $\min(s,t)$ and a function of $\max(s,t)$. We call these functions the covariance factors of a Gauss-Markov process, and give the expression of the quadratic variation of a Gauss-Markov semimartingale in terms of its covariance factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An "element-free" probability distribution is what remains of a probability distribution after we forget the elements to which the probabilities were assigned. These objects naturally arise in Bayesian statistics, in situations where elements are used as labels and their specific identity is not important.
  This paper develops the structural theory of element-free distributions, using multisets and category theory. We give operations for moving between element-free and ordinary distributions, and we show that these operations commute with multinomial sampling. We then exploit this theory to prove two representation theorems. These theorems show that element-free distributions provide a natural representation for key random structures in Bayesian nonparametric clustering: exchangeable random partitions, and random distributions parametrized by a base measure.</description>

      <title>Tamed Langevin sampling under weaker conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to deep learning which often fail standard Lipschitz smoothness requirements, we examine the problem of sampling from distributions that are not log-concave and are only weakly dissipative, with log-gradients allowed to grow superlinearly at infinity. In terms of structure, we only assume that the target distribution satisfies either a log-Sobolev or a Poincar\'e inequality and a local Lipschitz smoothness assumption with modulus growing possibly polynomially at infinity. This set of assumptions greatly exceeds the operational limits of the "vanilla" unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), making sampling from such distributions a highly involved affair. To account for this, we introduce a taming scheme which is tailored to the growth and decay properties of the target distribution, and we provide explicit non-asymptotic guarantees for the proposed sampler in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, total variation, and Wasserstein distance to the target distribution.</description>

      <title>Sparsification of Phylogenetic Covariance Matrices of $k$-Regular Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a tree $T=(V,E)$ with root $\circ$ and edge length function $\ell:E\to\mathbb{R}_+$. The phylogenetic covariance matrix of $T$ is the matrix $C$ with rows and columns indexed by $L$, the leaf set of $T$, with entries $C(i,j):=\sum_{e\in[i\wedge j,o]}\ell(e)$, for each $i,j\in L$. Recent work [15] has shown that the phylogenetic covariance matrix of a large, random binary tree $T$ is significantly sparsified with overwhelmingly high probability under a change-of-basis with respect to the so-called Haar-like wavelets of $T$. This finding notably enables manipulating the spectrum of covariance matrices of large binary trees without the necessity to store them in computer memory but instead performing two post-order traversals of the tree. Building on the methods of [15], this manuscript further advances their sparsification result to encompass the broader class of $k$-regular trees, for any given $k\ge2$. This extension is achieved by refining existing asymptotic formulas for the mean and variance of the internal path length of random $k$-regular trees, utilizing hypergeometric function properties and identities.</description>

      <title>When is exponential asymptotic optimality achievable in average-reward restless bandits?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete-time infinite-horizon average-reward restless bandit problem. We propose a novel policy that maintains two dynamic subsets of arms: one subset of arms has a nearly optimal state distribution and takes actions according to an Optimal Local Control routine; the other subset of arms is driven towards the optimal state distribution and gradually merged into the first subset. We show that our policy is asymptotically optimal with an $O(\exp(-C N))$ optimality gap for an $N$-armed problem, under the mild assumptions of aperiodic-unichain, non-degeneracy, and local stability. Our policy is the first to achieve exponential asymptotic optimality under the above set of easy-to-verify assumptions, whereas prior work either requires a strong Global Attractor assumption or only achieves an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap. We further discuss the fundamental obstacles in significantly weakening our assumptions. In particular, we prove a lower bound showing that local stability is fundamental for exponential asymptotic optimality.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Approximate Message Passing Algorithms for Spiked Matrix Models with Rotationally Invariant Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a rank one signal matrix from an observed matrix generated by corrupting the signal with additive rotationally invariant noise. We develop a new class of approximate message-passing algorithms for this problem and provide a simple and concise characterization of their dynamics in the high-dimensional limit. At each iteration, these algorithms exploit prior knowledge about the noise structure by applying a non-linear matrix denoiser to the eigenvalues of the observed matrix and prior information regarding the signal structure by applying a non-linear iterate denoiser to the previous iterates generated by the algorithm. We exploit our result on the dynamics of these algorithms to derive the optimal choices for the matrix and iterate denoisers. We show that the resulting algorithm achieves the smallest possible asymptotic estimation error among a broad class of iterative algorithms under a fixed iteration budget.</description>

      <title>Drawing with Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing (a multiset of) coloured balls from an urn is one of the most basic models in discrete probability theory. Three modes of drawing are commonly distinguished: multinomial (draw-replace), hypergeometric (draw-delete), and P\'olya (draw-add). These drawing operations are represented as maps from urns to distributions over multisets of draws. The set of urns is a metric space via the Wasserstein distance. The set of distributions over draws is also a metric space, using Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein. It is shown that these three draw operations are all isometries, that is, they exactly preserve the Wasserstein distances. Further, drawing is studied in the limit, both for large urns and for large draws. First it is shown that, as the urn size increases, the Wasserstein distances go to zero between hypergeometric and multinomial draws, and also between P\'olya and multinomial draws. Second, it is shown that, as the draw size increases, the Wasserstein distance goes to zero (in probability) between an urn and (normalised) multinomial draws from the urn. These results are known, but here, they are formulated in a novel manner as limits of Wasserstein distances. We call these two limit results the law of large urns and the law of large draws.</description>

      <title>Short-time Fokker-Planck propagator beyond the Gaussian approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a perturbation approach to calculate the short-time propagator, or transition density, of the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation, to in principle arbitrary order in the time increment. Our approach preserves probability exactly and allows us to evaluate expectation values of analytical observables to in principle arbitrary accuracy; to showcase this, we derive perturbation expansions for the moments of the spatial increment, the finite-time Kramers-Moyal coefficients, and the mean medium entropy production rate. For an explicit multiplicative-noise system with available analytical solution, we validate all our perturbative results. Throughout, we compare our perturbative results to those obtained from the widely used Gaussian approximation of the short-time propagator; we demonstrate that this Gaussian propagator leads to errors that can be many orders of magnitude larger than those resulting from our perturbation approach. Potential applications of our results include parametrizing diffusive stochastic dynamics from observed time series, and sampling path spaces of stochastic trajectories numerically.</description>

Abstract: We prove that under certain mild moment and continuity assumptions, the $d$-dimensional Gaussian free field is the only stochastic process in $d\geq 2$ that is translation invariant, exhibits a certain scaling, and satisfies the usual domain Markov property. Our proof is based on a decomposition of the underlying functional space in terms of radial processes and spherical harmonics.</description>

Abstract: We consider stochastic gradient descents on the space of large symmetric matrices of suitable functions that are invariant under permuting the rows and columns using the same permutation. We establish deterministic limits of these random curves as the dimensions of the matrices go to infinity while the entries remain bounded. Under a ``small noise'' assumption the limit is shown to be the gradient flow of functions on graphons whose existence was established in~\cite{oh2021gradient}. We also consider limits of stochastic gradient descents with added properly scaled reflected Brownian noise. The limiting curve of graphons is characterized by a family of stochastic differential equations with reflections and can be thought of as an extension of the classical McKean-Vlasov limit for interacting diffusions to the graphon setting. The proofs introduce a family of infinite-dimensional exchangeable arrays of reflected diffusions and a novel notion of propagation of chaos for large matrices of diffusions converging to such arrays in a suitable sense.</description>

Abstract: The theory of normal variance mixture distributions is used to provide elementary derivations of closed-form expressions for the definite integrals $\int_0^\infty x^{-2\nu}\cos(bx)\gamma(\nu,\alpha x^2)\,\mathrm{d}x$ (for $\nu&gt;1/2$, $b&gt;0$ $\alpha&gt;0$) and $\int_0^\infty x^{2\nu-1}\cos(bx)\Gamma(-\nu,\alpha x^2)\,\mathrm{d}x$ (for $\nu&gt;0$, $b&gt;0$ $\alpha&gt;0$), where $\gamma(a,x)$ and $\Gamma(a,x)$ are the lower and upper incomplete gamma functions, respectively. The method of proof is of independent interest and could be used to derive further new definite integral formulas.</description>

      <title>Non-backtracking eigenvalues and eigenvectors of random regular graphs and hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-backtracking operator of a graph is a powerful tool in spectral graph theory and random matrix theory. Most existing results for the non-backtracking operator of a random graph concern only eigenvalues or top eigenvectors. In this paper, we take the first step in analyzing its bulk eigenvector behaviors. We demonstrate that for the non-backtracking operator $B$ of a random $d$-regular graph, its eigenvectors corresponding to nontrivial eigenvalues are completely delocalized with high probability. Additionally, we show complete delocalization for a reduced $2n \times 2n$ non-backtracking matrix $\tilde{B}$. By projecting all eigenvalues of $\tilde{B}$ onto the real line, we obtain an empirical measure that converges weakly in probability to the Kesten-McKay law for fixed $d\geq 3$ and to a semicircle law as $d \to\infty$ with $n \to\infty$. We extend our analysis to random regular hypergraphs, including the limiting measure of the real part of the spectrum for $\tilde{B}$, $\ell_{\infty}$-norm bounds for the eigenvectors of $\tilde{B}$ and $B$, and a deterministic relation between eigenvectors of $B$ and the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix.
  As an application, we analyze the non-backtracking spectrum of the regular stochastic block model (RSBM) and provide a spectral method based on eigenvectors of $\tilde{B}$ to recover the community structure exactly. We also show that there exists an isolated real eigenvalue with an informative eigenvector inside the circle of radius $\sqrt{d_1+d_2-1}$ in the spectrum of $B$, analogous to the "eigenvalue insider" phenomenon for the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi stochastic block model conjectured in Dall'Amico et al. (2019).</description>

      <title>Reflected Brownian Motion in a wedge: sum-of-exponential absorption probability at the vertex and differential properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Brownian motion with drift in a wedge of angle $\beta$ which is obliquely reflected on each edge along angles $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$. We assume that the classical parameter $\alpha=\frac{\delta+\varepsilon - \pi}{\beta}$ is greater than $1$ and we focus on transient cases where the process can either be absorbed at the vertex or escape to infinity. We show that $\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^*$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for the absorption probability, seen as a function of the starting point, to be written as a finite sum of terms of exponential product form. In such cases, we give expressions for the absorption probability and its Laplace transform. When $\alpha\in\mathbb{Z}+\frac{\pi}{\beta}\mathbb{Z}$ we find explicit D-algebraic expression for the Laplace transform. Our results rely on Tutte's invariant method and on a recursive compensation approach.</description>

      <title>Deep learning scheme for forward utilities using ergodic BSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a probabilistic numerical method for a class of forward utilities in a stochastic factor model. For this purpose, we use the representation of dynamic consistent utilities with mean of ergodic Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (eBSDEs) introduced by Liang and Zariphopoulou in [27]. We establish a connection between the solution of the ergodic BSDE and the solution of an associated BSDE with random terminal time $\tau$ , defined as the hitting time of the positive recurrent stochastic factor V . The viewpoint based on BSDEs with random horizon yields a new characterization of the ergodic cost $\lambda$ which is a part of the solution of the eBSDEs. In particular, for a certain class of eBSDEs with quadratic generator, the Cole-Hopf transform leads to a semi-explicit representation of the solution as well as a new expression of the ergodic cost $\lambda$. The latter can be estimated with Monte Carlo methods. We also propose two new deep learning numerical schemes for eBSDEs, where the ergodic cost $\lambda$ is optimized according to a loss function at the random horizon $\tau$ or taking into account the whole trajectory. Finally, we present numerical results for different examples of eBSDEs and forward utilities along with the associated investment strategies.</description>

      <title>Renormalized stochastic pressure equation with log-correlated Gaussian coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study periodic solutions to the following divergence-form stochastic partial differential equation with Wick-renormalized gradient on the $d$-dimensional flat torus $\mathbb{T}^d$,
  \[
  -\nabla\cdot\left(e^{\diamond (- \beta X) }\diamond\nabla U\right)=\nabla \cdot (e^{\diamond (- \beta X)} \diamond \mathbf{F}),
  \] where $X$ is the log-correlated Gaussian field, $\mathbf{F}$ is a random vector and $\diamond$ denotes the Wick product. The problem is a variant of the stochastic pressure equation, in which $U$ is modeling the pressure of a creeping water-flow in crustal rock that occurs in enhanced geothermal heating. In the original model, the Wick exponential term $e^{\diamond(-\beta X)}$ is modeling the random permeability of the rock. The porosity field is given by a log-correlated Gaussian random field $\beta X$, where $\beta&lt;\sqrt{d}$. We use elliptic regularity theory in order to define a notion of a solution to this (a priori very ill-posed) problem, via modifying the $S$-transform from Gaussian white noise analysis, and then establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions. Moreover, we show that the solution to the problem can be expressed in terms of the Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure.</description>

Abstract: The approximation of a circle with the edges of a fine square grid distorts the perimeter by a factor about $\tfrac{4}{\pi}$. We prove that this factor is the same on average (in the ergodic sense) for approximations of any rectifiable curve by the edges of any non-exotic Delaunay mosaic (known as Voronoi path), and extend the results to all dimensions, generalizing Voronoi paths to Voronoi scapes.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the convergence properties of a continuous-time optimization method, the \textit{Mean-Field Best Response} flow, for solving convex-concave min-max games with entropy regularization. We introduce suitable Lyapunov functions to establish exponential convergence to the unique mixed Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we demonstrate the convergence of the fictitious play flow as a by-product of our analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a system of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) of mixed elliptic-parabolic type that models the propagation of electric signals and their effect on the deformation of cardiac tissue. The system governs the dynamics of ionic quantities, intra and extra-cellular potentials, and linearized elasticity equations. We introduce a framework called the active strain decomposition, which factors the material gradient of deformation into an active (electrophysiology-dependent) part and an elastic (passive) part, to capture the coupling between muscle contraction, biochemical reactions, and electric activity. Under the assumption of linearized elastic behavior and a truncation of the nonlinear diffusivities, we propose a stochastic electromechanical bidomain model, and establish the existence of weak solutions for this model. To prove existence through the convergence of approximate solutions, we employ a stochastic compactness method in tandem with an auxiliary non-degenerate system and the Faedo--Galerkin method. We utilize a stochastic adaptation of de Rham's theorem to deduce the weak convergence of the pressure approximations.</description>

      <title>Sliced optimal transport: is it a suitable replacement?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a one-parameter family of metrics on the space of Borel probability measures on Euclidean space with finite $p$th moment for $1\leq p &lt;\infty$, called the $\textit{sliced Monge--Kantorovich metrics}$, which include the sliced Wasserstein and max-sliced Wasserstein metrics. We then show that these are complete, separable metric spaces that are topologically equivalent to the classical Monge--Kantorovich metrics and these metrics have a dual representation. However, we also prove these sliced metrics are $\textit{not}$ bi-Lipschitz equivalent to the classical ones in most cases, and also the spaces are (except for an endpoint case) $\textit{not}$ geodesic. The completeness, duality, and non-geodesicness are new even in the sliced and max-sliced Wasserstein cases, and non bi-Lipschitz equivalence is only known for a few specific cases. In particular this indicates that sliced and max-sliced Wasserstein metrics are not suitable direct replacements for the classical Monge--Kantorovich metrics in problems where the specific metric or geodesic structure are critical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ordinal pattern dependence has been introduced in order to capture co-monotonic behavior between two time series. This concept has several features one would intuitively demand from a dependence measure. It was believed that ordinal pattern dependence satisfies the axioms which Grothe et al. (Journal of Multivariate Analysis 123, 2014) proclaimed for a multivariate measure of dependence. In the present article we show that this is not true and that there is a mistake in the article Betken et al. (Journal of Multivariate Analysis 186, 2021). Furthermore we show that ordinal pattern dependence satisfies a slightly modified set of axioms.</description>

Abstract: We study two variants of the mirror descent-ascent algorithm for solving min-max problems on the space of measures: simultaneous and sequential. We work under assumptions of convexity-concavity and relative smoothness of the payoff function with respect to a suitable Bregman divergence, defined on the space of measures via flat derivatives. We show that the convergence rates to mixed Nash equilibria, measured in the Nikaid\`o-Isoda error, are of order $\mathcal{O}\left(N^{-1/2}\right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left(N^{-2/3}\right)$ for the simultaneous and sequential schemes, respectively, which is in line with the state-of-the-art results for related finite-dimensional algorithms.</description>

      <title>Combining Evidence Across Filtrations Using Adjusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In anytime-valid sequential inference, it is known that any admissible procedure must be based on e-processes, which are composite generalizations of test martingales that quantify the accumulated evidence against a composite null hypothesis at any arbitrary stopping time. This paper studies methods for combining e-processes constructed using different information sets (filtrations) for the same null. Although e-processes constructed in the same filtration can be combined effortlessly (e.g., by averaging), e-processes constructed in different filtrations cannot, because their validity in a coarser filtration does not translate to validity in a finer filtration. This issue arises in exchangeability tests, independence tests, and tests for comparing forecasts with lags. We first establish that a class of functions called adjusters allows us to lift e-processes from a coarser filtration into any finer filtration. We then introduce a characterization theorem for adjusters, formalizing a sense in which using adjusters is necessary. There are two major implications. First, if we have a powerful e-process in a coarsened filtration, then we readily have a powerful e-process in the original filtration. Second, when we coarsen the filtration to construct an e-process, there is an asymptotically logarithmic cost of recovering anytime-validity in the original filtration.</description>
