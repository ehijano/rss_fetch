      <title>VIRA: An Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrieval Framework for JWST Transmission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations are leading to important new insights into exoplanetary atmospheres through transmission spectroscopy. In order to harness the full potential of the broad spectral range and high sensitivity of JWST, atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets require a high level of robustness and accuracy in the underlying models. We present the VIRA retrieval framework which implements a range of modelling and inference capabilities motivated by early JWST observations of exoplanet transmission spectra. This includes three complementary approaches to modelling atmospheric composition, three atmospheric aerosol models, including a physically-motivated Mie scattering approach, and consideration of correlated noise. VIRA enables a cascading retrieval architecture involving a sequence of retrievals with increasing sophistication. We demonstrate VIRA using a JWST transmission spectrum of the hot Saturn WASP-39 b in the $\sim$1-5 $\mu$m range. In addition to confirming prior chemical inferences, we retrieve molecular abundances for H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$, SO$_2$ and H$_2$S, resulting in super-solar elemental abundances of log(O/H)=$-2.0\pm0.2$, log(C/H)=$-2.1\pm0.2$ and log(S/H)=$-3.6\pm0.2$, along with C/O and S/O ratios of $0.83^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$ and $0.029^{+0.012}_{-0.009}$, respectively, in the free chemistry case. The abundances correspond to $20.1^{+10.5}_{-8.1}\times$, $28.2^{+16.3}_{-12.1}\times$ and $20.8^{+10.3}_{-7.5}\times$ solar values for O/H, C/H and S/H, respectively, compared to C/H $= 8.67\pm0.35 \times$ solar for Saturn. Our results demonstrate how JWST transmission spectroscopy combined with retrieval frameworks like VIRA can measure multi-elemental abundances for giant exoplanets and enable comparative characterisation with solar system planets.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Waves Driving Variability and Cloud Modulation on a Planetary-Mass Object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs at the transition from relatively red L dwarfs to bluer mid-T dwarfs $\left(\rm{T}_{eff}\sim1300 \ \text{K} \right)$ show enhanced spectrophotometric variability. An open question is whether this variability is caused by atmospheric planetary-scale (Kelvin or Rossby) waves or by large spots associated with the precipitation of silicate and metal clouds. We applied both waves and spotted models to fit near-infrared (NIR), multi-band ($Y$/$J$/$H$/$K$) photometry of SIMP J013656.5+093347 (hereafter SIMP0136), collected at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope using the Wide-field InfraRed Camera. SIMP0136 is a planetary-mass object (12.7$\pm1.0 \ \rm{M_J}$) at the L/T transition (T2$\pm0.5$) known to exhibit light curve evolution over multiple rotational periods. We measure the maximum peak-to-peak variability of $6.17\pm0.46\%$, $6.45\pm0.33\%$, $6.51\pm0.42\%$, and $4.33\pm0.38\%$ in the $Y$, $J$, $H$, and $K$ bands respectively, and find evidence that wave models are preferred for all four NIR bands. Furthermore, we determine the spot size necessary to reproduce the observed variations is larger than the Rossby deformation radius and Rhines scale, which is unphysical. Through the correlation between light curves produced by the waves and associated color variability, we find evidence of planetary-scale, wave-induced cloud modulation and breakup, similar to Jupiter's atmosphere and supported by general circulation models. We also detect a $93.8^{\circ}\pm7.4^{\circ}$ ($12.7\sigma$) phase shift between the $H-K$ and $J-H$ color time series, providing evidence for complex vertical cloud structure in SIMP0136's atmosphere.</description>

      <title>MINDS: JWST/NIRCam imaging of the protoplanetary disk PDS 70</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Two protoplanets have recently been discovered within the PDS 70 protoplanetary disk. JWST/NIRCam offers a unique opportunity to characterize them and their birth environment at wavelengths difficult to access from the ground. Aims. We aim to image the circumstellar environment of PDS 70 at 1.87 $\mu$m and 4.83 $\mu$m, assess the presence of Pa-$\alpha$ emission due to accretion onto the protoplanets, and probe any IR excess indicative of heated circumplanetary material. Methods. We obtain non-coronagraphic JWST/NIRCam images of PDS 70 within the MINDS (MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey) program. We leverage the Vortex Image Processing (VIP) package for data reduction, and develop dedicated routines for optimal stellar PSF subtraction, unbiased imaging of the disk, and protoplanet flux measurement in this type of dataset. A radiative transfer model of the disk is used to disentangle the contributions from the disk and the protoplanets. Results. We re-detect both protoplanets and identify extended emission after subtracting a disk model, including a large-scale spiral-like feature. We interpret its signal in the direct vicinity of planet c as tracing the accretion stream feeding its circumplanetary disk, while the outer part of the feature may rather reflect asymmetric illumination of the outer disk. We also report a bright signal consistent with a previously proposed protoplanet candidate enshrouded in dust, near the 1:2:4 mean-motion resonance with planets b and c. The 1.87 $\mu$m flux of planet b is consistent with atmospheric model predictions, but not that of planet c. We discuss potential origins for this discrepancy, including significant Pa-$\alpha$ line emission. The 4.83 $\mu$m fluxes of planets b and c suggest enshrouding dust or heated CO emission from their circumplanetary environment.</description>

      <title>The New Horizons Extended Mission Target: Arrokoth Search and Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the Pluto fly-by of the New Horizons spacecraft, the mission provided a unique opportunity to explore the Kuiper Belt in-situ. The possibility existed to fly-by a Kuiper Belt object (KBO) as well as to observe additional objects at distances closer than are feasible from earth-orbit facilities. However, at the time of launch no KBOs were known about that were accessible by the spacecraft. In this paper we present the results of 10 years of observations and three uniquely dedicated efforts -- two ground-based using the Subaru Suprime Camera, the Magellan MegaCam and IMACS Cameras, and one with the Hubble Space Telescope -- to find such KBOs for study. In this paper we overview the search criteria and strategies employed in our work and detail the analysis efforts to locate and track faint objects in the galactic plane. We also present a summary of all of the KBOs that were discovered as part of our efforts and how spacecraft targetability was assessed, including a detailed description of our astrometric analysis which included development of an extensive secondary calibration network. Overall, these efforts resulted in the discovery of 89 KBOs including 11 which became objects for distant observation by New Horizons and (486958) Arrokoth which became the first post-Pluto fly-by destination.</description>

      <title>Vertical and radial distribution of atomic carbon in HD 163296</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In protoplanetary disks, atomic carbon is expected to originate from the PDR at the disk surface where CO is dissociated by UV photons coming from the stellar, or external interstellar, radiation field. Even though atomic carbon has been detected in several protoplanetary disks, there is a lack of spatially resolved observations of it. For HD 163296 protoplanetary disk, we aim to obtain both radial and vertical structure of [CI]$={^3}{P_1} - {^3}{P_0}$ line emission and perform the first direct comparison of this tracer with optically thick line emission $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$. We used archival ALMA data for [CI]$={^3}{P_1} - {^3}{P_0}$ and previously published ${^{12}}$ CO $J=2-1$ data in HD 163296. Through the software of disksurf we extracted the vertical structure, meanwhile radial profiles were obtained directly from imaging. Brand new DALI modelling was employed to perform direct comparison to the data. We found that these tracers are collocated radially but not vertically, where $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ emission is, on average, located at higher altitudes, as it is also the case for other tracers in the same disk. Due to this difference in vertical height of the emission, the optically thick $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ emission line appears to trace the highest altitudes, despite the expected formation mechanism of [CI] in the disk. The latter phenomena may be due to efficient mixing of the upper layers of the disk, or UV photons penetrating deeper than we expected.</description>

      <title>Be,La,U-rich spherules as microtektites of terrestrial laterites: What goes up must come down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Loeb et al. (2024, "Recovery and Classification of Spherules from the Pacific Ocean Site of the CNEOS 2014 January 8 (IM1) Bolide", Res. Notes. Amer. Astron. Soc. 8, 39) reported the magnetic collection of millimeter-sized spherules from the seafloor near Papua New Guinea. About 22% had Mg/Si &lt; 1/3 and were identified as a new "differentiated" variety of cosmic spherule ("D-type"). In a subset of 26 of these "D-type" spherules, 12 "BeLaU" spherules were found to be dominated by Fe and Al, marked by low Si and even lower Mg content, depletions of volatile species like Pb and Cs, and remarkable enrichments of Be, La, U, Ba, and other elements. Loeb et al. claimed these have exotic compositions different from other Solar System materials. We show that in fact samples with these compositions are not just found on Earth, they are from Earth; specifically, we identify them as microtektites of terrestrial lateritic sandstone. Based on the location of the sample site, we associate them with the Australasian tektite strewn field, generated 788 kyr ago by an impactor that melted and ejected ~10^8 tons of sandstone, including a lateritic layer, from Indochina. A tektite origin for the spherules is corroborated by their terrestrial Fe isotopic compositions and the compound, non-spherical nature of many of them, which preclude formation as ablation spherules from a bolide. Due to the restriction of laterites to the tropics, iron-rich tektites may be uncommon, but we predict they should comprise ~3% of the Australasian microtektites.</description>

      <title>An implicit algorithm for simulating the dynamics of small dust grains with smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an implicit method for solving the diffusion equation for the evolution of the dust fraction in the terminal velocity approximation using dust-as-mixture smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The numerical scheme involves casting the dust diffusion equation into implicit form, rearranging into its resolvent cubic equation and solving analytically. This method is relevant for small grains that are tightly coupled to the gas, such as sub-micron dust grains in the interstellar medium or millimetre-sized dust grains in protoplanetary discs. The method avoids problems with the variable used to evolve the dust fraction becoming negative when evolved explicitly and is fast and accurate, avoiding the need for dust stopping time limiters and significantly reducing computational expense. Whilst this method is an improvement over using the explicit terminal velocity approximation method, as with any dust-as-mixture method it still fails to give accurate solutions in the limit of large (weakly coupled) grains.</description>

      <title>Super-adiabatic Temperature Gradient at Jupiter's Equatorial Zone and Implications for the Water Abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature structure of a giant planet was traditionally thought to be an adiabat assuming convective mixing homogenizes entropy. The only in-situ measurement made by the Galileo Probe detected a near-adiabatic temperature structure within one of Jupiter's 5$\mu$m hot spots with small but definite local departures from adiabaticity. We analyze Juno's microwave observations near Jupiter's equator (0 ~ 5$^o$N) and find that the equatorial temperature structure is best characterized by a stable super-adiabatic temperature profile rather than an adiabatic one. Water is the only substance with sufficient abundance to alter the atmosphere's mean molecular weight and prevent dynamic instability if a super-adiabatic temperature gradient exists. Thus, from the super-adiabaticity, our results indicate a water concentration (or the oxygen to hydrogen ratio) of about 4.9 times solar with a possible range of 1.5 ~ 8.3 times solar in Jupiter's equatorial region.</description>

      <title>The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) Science White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) is proposed as a new facility dedicated to the efficient delivery of spectroscopic surveys. This white paper summarises the initial concept as well as the corresponding science cases. WST will feature simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), a high multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS) and a giant 3x3 sq. arcmin integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability these requirements place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work synergistically with future ground and space-based facilities. This white paper shows that WST can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; origin of stars and planets; time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST's uniquely rich dataset will deliver unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The WST Science Team (already including more than 500 scientists worldwide) is open to the all astronomical community.

      <title>Modelling Triatomic Biosignatures: Ozone and Isotopomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a new approach to produce spectroscopic constants and model first-principles synthetic spectra for all molecules of astrophysical interest. We have generalized our previous diatomic molecule simulation framework, employing Transition-Optimised Shifted Hermite (TOSH) theory, thereby enabling the modelling of polyatomic rotational constants for molecules with three or more atoms. These capabilities, are now provided by our new code Epimetheus.
  As a first validation of our approach, we confront our predictions and assess their accuracy against the well-studied triatomic molecule, ozone 666 ($^{16}$O$_3$), in addition to eight of its potential isotopomers: ozone 668 ($^{16}$O$^{16}$O$^{18}$O), 686 ($^{16}$O$^{18}$O$^{16}$O), 667 ($^{16}$O$^{16}$O$^{17}$O), 676 ($^{16}$O$^{17}$O$^{16}$O), 688 ($^{16}$O$^{18}$O$^{18}$O), 868 ($^{18}$O$^{16}$O$^{18}$O), 888 ($^{18}$O$_3$), and 777 ($^{17}$O$_3$). We then assess the accuracy of these rotational constants using the Epimetheus data in our code Pandora, and generate synthetic molecular spectra.
  The ozone spectra presented here are purely infrared and not Raman. Epimetheus builds upon the work from our previous code Prometheus, which used the TOSH theory to account for anharmonicity for the fundamental $\nu=0 \rightarrow \nu=1$ band, going further to now account for triatomic molecules. This is combined with thermal profile modeling for the rotational transitions. We have found that this extended method performs promisingly, typically approximating the spectroscopic constants and spectra well. Some issues do arise depending on the symmetry group of the ozone isotopomer. In general, we show that Epimetheus can provide the data to produce appreciable molecular spectra, to help drive future high-resolution studies.</description>

      <title>Sustainability assessment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite broadband megaconstellations</title>

Abstract: The growth of megaconstellations is rapidly increasing the number of rocket launches. While Low Earth Orbit (LEO) broadband satellites help to connect unconnected communities and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there are also significant environmental emissions impacts from burning rocket fuels. We present sustainability analytics for phase 1 of the three main LEO constellations including Amazon Kuiper (3,236 satellites), Eutelsat Group`s OneWeb (648 satellites), and SpaceX Starlink (4,425 satellites). We find that LEO megaconstellations provide substantially improved broadband speeds for rural and remote communities, but are roughly 6-8 times more emissions intensive (250 kg CO2eq/subscriber/year) than comparative terrestrial mobile broadband. In the worst-case emissions scenario, this rises to 12-14 times more (469 kg CO2eq/subscriber/year). Policy makers must carefully consider the trade-off between connecting unconnected communities to further the SDGs and mitigating the growing space sector environmental footprint, particularly regarding phase 2 plans to launch an order-of-magnitude more satellites.</description>

Abstract: Hera represents the European Space Agency's inaugural planetary defense space mission and plays a pivotal role in the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment international collaboration with NASA DART mission that performed the first asteroid deflection experiment using the kinetic impactor techniques. With the primary objective of conducting a detailed post-impact survey of the Didymos binary asteroid following the DART impact on its small moon called Dimorphos, Hera aims to comprehensively assess and characterize the feasibility of the kinetic impactor technique in asteroid deflection while conducting an in-depth investigation of the asteroid binary, including its physical and compositional properties as well as the effect of the impact on the surface and shape of Dimorphos. In this work, we describe the Hera radio science experiment, which will allow us to precisely estimate critical parameters, including the mass, which is required to determine the momentum enhancement resulting from the DART impact, mass distribution, rotational states, relative orbits, and dynamics of the asteroids Didymos and Dimorphos. Through a multi-arc covariance analysis, we present the achievable accuracy for these parameters, which consider the full expected asteroid phase and are based on ground radiometric, Hera optical images, and Hera to CubeSats InterSatellite Link radiometric measurements. The expected formal uncertainties for Didymos and Dimorphos GM are better than 0.01% and 0.1%, respectively, while their J2 formal uncertainties are better than 0.1% and 10%, respectively.

      <title>Automated chemical reaction network generation and its application to exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of JWST and spectroscopic characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with unprecedented detail, there is a demand for a more complete picture of chemical and photochemical reactions and their impact on atmospheric composition. Traditionally, building reaction networks for (exo)planetary atmospheres involves manually tracking relevant species and reactions, a time-consuming and error-prone process. This approach's applicability is also often limited to specific conditions, making it less versatile for different planetary types. (i.e., photochemical networks for Jupiters may not be directly applicable to water-rich exoplanets). We introduce an automated approach using a computer-aided chemical reaction network generator, combined with a one-dimensional photochemical kinetic-transport model, offering significant advantages. This approach automatically selects reaction rates through a rate-based iterative algorithm and refinement steps, enhancing model reliability. Also, this approach allows for the efficient simulation of diverse chemical environments, from hydrogen to water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen-dominated atmospheres. Using WASP-39b and WASP-80b as examples, we demonstrate our approach's effectiveness. Our WASP-39b model aligns with prior studies and JWST observations, capturing photochemically produced sulfur dioxide. The WASP-80b model reveals an atmosphere influenced by deep interior thermochemistry and vertical mixing, consistent with JWST NIRCam observations. Furthermore, our model identifies a novel initial step for the N2-NH3-HCN pathway that enhances the conversion efficiency in high-temperature/pressure environments. This automated chemical network generation offers a novel, efficient, and precise framework for studying exoplanetary atmospheres, marking a significant advancement over traditional modeling techniques.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: Planetary and Cometary Atmospheres</title>

Abstract: The study of planets and small bodies within our Solar System is fundamental for understanding the formation and evolution the Earth and other planets. Compositional and meteorological studies of the giant planets provide a foundation for understanding the nature of the most commonly observed exoplanets, while spectroscopic observations of the atmospheres of terrestrial planets, moons, and comets provide insights into the past and present-day habitability of planetary environments, and the availability of the chemical ingredients for life. While prior and existing (sub)millimeter observations have led to major advances in these areas, progress is hindered by limitations in the dynamic range, spatial and temporal coverage, as well as sensitivity of existing telescopes and interferometers. Here, we summarize some of the key planetary science use cases that factor into the design of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), a proposed 50-m class single dish facility: (1) to more fully characterize planetary wind fields and atmospheric thermal structures, (2) to measure the compositions of icy moon atmospheres and plumes, (3) to obtain detections of new, astrobiologically relevant gases and perform isotopic surveys of comets, and (4) to perform synergistic, temporally-resolved measurements in support of dedicated interplanetary space missions. The improved spatial coverage (several arcminutes), resolution ($\sim1.2''-12''$), bandwidth (several tens of GHz), dynamic range ($\sim10^5$) and sensitivity ($\sim1$ mK km s$^{-1}$) required by these science cases would enable new insights into the chemistry and physics of planetary environments, the origins of prebiotic molecules and the habitability of planetary systems in general.</description>

      <title>Isles of regularity in a sea of chaos amid the gravitational three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three-body problem (3BP) poses a longstanding challenge in physics and celestial mechanics. Despite the impossibility of obtaining general analytical solutions, statistical theories have been developed based on the ergodic principle. This assumption is justified by chaos, which is expected to fully mix the accessible phase space of the 3BP. This study probes the presence of regular (i.e. non chaotic) trajectories within the 3BP and assesses their impact on statistical escape theories. Using numerical simulations, we establish criteria for identifying regular trajectories and analyse their impact on statistical outcomes. Our analysis reveals that regular trajectories occupy up to 32% of the phase space, and their outcomes defy the predictions of statistical escape theories. The coexistence of regular and chaotic regions at all scales is characterized by a multi-fractal behaviour. Integration errors manifest as numerical chaos, artificially enhancing the mixing of the phase space and affecting the reliability of individual simulations, yet preserving the statistical correctness of an ensemble of realizations. Our findings underscore the challenges in applying statistical escape theories to astrophysical problems, as they may bias results by excluding the outcome of regular trajectories. This is particularly important in the context of formation scenarios of gravitational wave mergers, where biased estimates of binary eccentricity can significantly impact estimates of coalescence efficiency and detectable eccentricity.</description>

      <title>The Reservoir of the Per-emb-2 Streamer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Streamers bring gas from outer regions to protostellar systems and could change the chemical composition around protostars and protoplanetary disks. We have carried out mapping observations of carbon-chain species (HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, CCH, and CCS) in the 3mm and 7mm bands toward the streamer flowing to the Class 0 young stellar object (YSO) Per-emb-2 with the Nobeyama 45m radio telescope. A region with a diameter of $\sim0.04$ pc is located north with a distance of $\sim 20,500$ au from the YSO. The streamer connects to this north region which is the origin of the streamer. The reservoir has high density and low temperature ($n_{\rm {H}_2} \approx 1.9 \times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, $T_{\rm {kin}} = 10$ K), which are similar to those of early stage starless cores. By comparisons with the observed abundance ratios of CCS/HC$_3$N to the chemical simulations, the reservoir and streamer are found to be chemically young. The total mass available for the streamer is derived to be $24-34$ M$_{\odot}$. If all of the gas in the reservoir will accrete onto the Per-emb-2 protostellar system, the lifetime of the streamer has been estimated at ($1.1 - 3.2$)$\times10^{5}$ yr, suggesting that the mass accretion via the streamer would continue until the end of the Class I stage.</description>
