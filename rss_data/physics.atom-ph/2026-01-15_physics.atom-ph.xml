      <title>High-harmonic generation as a tunneling delay probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of using high-harmonic generation (HHG) as a complementary probe of tunneling delay in strong-field ionization. By combining time--frequency analysis of HHG spectra obtained from full time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) simulations with classical three-step-model (TSM) trajectories, we extract an effective tunneling delay associated with electron motion through the laser-suppressed Coulomb barrier. The analysis is carried out for Hydrogen, Helium, and Argon atoms over a range of laser wavelengths and peak intensities within the tunneling regime. The extracted delay exhibits a systematic dependence on the instantaneous field strength and barrier width at the ionization time, and follows the expected $\tau_d \propto 1/\sqrt{I_0}$ scaling consistent with Keldysh--Rutherford-type models and attoclock observations. When recast in terms of the Keldysh parameter, the tunneling delay collapses onto a near-universal trend across different atomic species. While HHG does not provide a direct measurement of tunneling time, the present results demonstrate that it can serve as a robust, internally consistent diagnostic of tunneling dynamics, offering an independent and complementary perspective to established attoclock techniques.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Spectroscopy of $^{173}$Yb$^{+}$ Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to other stable isotopes of $\rm{Yb}^+$, $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ has a richer hyperfine structure, which leads to more favorable clock transitions, spectroscopic techniques for probing new physics, and more sophisticated quantum computing architectures. However, to date, its electronic spectrum remains poorly characterized. Here, we report on efficient laser cooling, state preparation, and detection of a single trapped $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ ion. The previously unobserved $^2\!S_{1/2} \rightarrow {}^2\!D_{3/2}$ electric quadrupole transition at 436 nm is coherently excited, and the isotope shift between $^{171}\rm{Yb}^+$ and $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ on this transition is determined with an uncertainty of 1.4 Hz. Using microwave spectroscopy, we resolve the hyperfine structure (HFS) of the ${}^2\!D_{3/2}$ state with a relative uncertainty below $10^{-8}$. From the HFS measurement data, we infer for ${}^{173}$Yb a nuclear magnetic octupole moment $\Omega = -0.062(8)\,({\rm b} \times \mu_N)$ with uncertainty reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude compared to previous studies. The data also allow us to determine hyperfine anomalies for the ${}^2\!S_{1/2}$ and ${}^2\!D_{3/2}$ states.</description>

      <title>Constraining axion-like dark matter with a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09638v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a broadband search for axion-like-particle (ALP) interactions using a radio-frequency-operated $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atomic magnetometer. The instrument provides wide spectral coverage and sensitivity to an oscillating pseudomagnetic field that may be generated by the gradient coupling of the ALP field to the constituent fermions of atoms. We search for an ALP-gradient signature in the mass range $2.40\times10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^{2}$--$2.11\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^{2}$. No statistically significant signatures of an oscillating magnetic field are observed, and we derive upper limits on the corresponding ALP-proton, -neutron and -electron couplings, $g_{\alpha pp}$, $g_{\alpha nn}$ and $g_{\alpha ee}$, respectively. The result on $g_{\alpha pp}$ improves over previous laboratory searches, while the limits on $g_{\alpha nn}$ and $g_{\alpha ee}$ complement earlier laboratory searches and astrophysical bounds. The work extends searches for ALP-fermion interactions into a mass region largely unexplored in a dark-matter context, demonstrating the potential of our method for broadband axion-like particle searches targeting the Galactic dark-matter halo.</description>

      <title>Static dc electric field orientation effects on two-photon Rydberg EIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the influence of a static dc electric field on Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) resonances that involve highly excited Rydberg states. Our focus is on how these resonances are altered when the relative orientation between the laser polarization and the external electric field vectors are varied. We experimentally demonstrate characteristic variations in the amplitude of the Stark-split EIT resonances, which can be explained by the selection rules in various geometries. We also present a simplified semi-analytical model that closely resembles the experimental observations. We use these findings to obtain information about the spatially inhomogeneous electric field, produced by a biased wire, using EIT fluorescence measurements that agrees with the expected angular dependencies. These results suggest that simultaneous analysis of frequency shifts and amplitudes of Rydberg EIT resonances may enable vector electrometry of electrostatic fields, necessary for many quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <title>A 10 Megahertz Spatial Light Modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid and programmable shaping of light fields is central to modern microscopy, display technologies, optical communications and sensing, quantum engineering, and quantum information processing. Current wavefront shaping technologies face a fundamental dichotomy: spatial light modulators (SLMs) offer high pixel count but suffer from low refresh rates, while acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) provide moderate speed with restricted optical beam geometries. Though recent advances in photonic integrated circuits achieve fast switching, there is currently no tool that provides MHz-rate, continuous motion, and arbitrarily reconfigurable control over a set of diffraction-limited spots. Here we introduce a new class of spatial light modulator that provides both 2D pixel geometry and high speed. The device operates by encoding spatial information in frequency bins via a broadband optical phase modulator, and decoding them via a first-of-its-kind, high-resolution 2D spectrometer. The spectrometer, based on the architecture which we call the Re-Imaging Phased Array (RIPA), achieves its sensitivity through long path-lengths, enabled by intra-spectrometer re-imaging lens-guides. We demonstrate site-resolved optical pulsing with a 44(1)~ns rise time, corresponding to frame rates exceeding 10 million frames per second, as well as arbitrary, reconfigurable 2D addressing and multi-site operations, including asynchronous, independent beam motion, splitting, and recombination. Leveraging these tools opens new horizons in rapid optical manipulation of matter across science, from fast, scalable control that approaches the inertial and radiation limits of atoms in quantum processors, to dynamically programmable, microsecond-resolved illumination in microscopy and neuro-biological imaging.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous nondestructive measurement of many polar molecules using Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tweezer arrays of polar molecules present new opportunities for quantum science and quantum information. However, a major challenge, especially in bialkali molecule platforms, is the fact that current measurement schemes for the internal states are destructive. In this work, we present a method to use Rydberg atoms to nondestructively measure the internal state of a molecular qubit. We achieve this via microwave dressing of both molecules and Rydberg atoms, allowing us to tune the interactions so that there are minimal Rydberg-Rydberg interactions and many measurements can take place simultaneously. We consider two experimentally-motivated examples of detecting $^{23}$Na$^{133}$Cs and $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs with $^{133}$Cs atoms. Finally, we discuss several strategies for mitigating various sources of crosstalk.</description>

      <title>A saturation-absorption rubidium magnetometer with multilevel optical Bloch-equation modeling for intermediate-to-high fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SASHMAG (Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy High-field MAGnetometer), an atomic sensor designed for precision magnetic-field measurements in the intermediate-to-high field regime ($&gt;0.2\,\text{T}$) using Rubidium-87 ($^{87}Rb$). The sensor operates in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime, where the hyperfine and Zeeman interactions decouple, and utilizes counter-propagating pump-probe configuration in Faraday geometry to resolve isolated, Doppler-free Zeeman transitions. To interpret the resulting spectra in this strongly field-dependent regime, we developed a comprehensive multilevel optical Bloch-equation model solved explicitly in the uncoupled $\ket{m_I, m_J}$ basis, capturing state mixing and nonlinear saturation dynamics. This model reproduces measured spectra at sub-Doppler resolution and is consistent with analytical expectations for power broadening and thermal Doppler scaling. Magnetic field estimation is performed using a physics-constrained optimization routine that infers the magnetic field by minimizing the residual between experimentally extracted line centers and calculated transition frequencies from the field-dependent Hamiltonian. We demonstrate magnetic field retrieval from $0.2\,\text{T}$ to $0.4\,\text{T}$ with a precision of $\pm 0.0017 \,\text{T}$). Furthermore, the validated simulation establishes a foundation for generating synthetic training datasets, paving the way for autonomous, Machine Learning-enhanced magnetometry in applications ranging from MRI to fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>Collective resonance displacement in strongly driven cold atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold atoms are promising platforms for metrology and quantum computation, yet their many-body dynamics remains largely unexplored. We here investigate Rabi oscillations from optically-thick cold clouds, driven by high-intensity coherent light. A dynamical displacement from the atomic resonance is predicted, which can be detected through the collective Rabi oscillations of the atomic ensemble. Different from linear-optics shifts, this dynamical displacement grows quadratically with the optical depth, yet it reduces with increasing pump power as dipole-dipole interactions are less effective.</description>

      <title>Single photon zeptosecond interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the generation of a train of attosecond XUV pulses that are in a superposition of wavefront states. Such superposition yields a high precision, self-referencing, common path XUV interferometer setup to produce pairs of spatially separated and independently controllable XUV pulses that are locked in phase and time with a temporal jitter of 3.5 zs (zs = zeptoseconds = $10^{-21}$). In our approach, we can independently control the relative phase/delay of the two optical beams with a resolution of 52 zs. Since the jitter is on the order of the Compton time scale, we explore the level of correlation between the non-local photons by comparing different spatial mode superpositions. Further, thanks to the stability of the interferometer we can retrieve the interference pattern through photon counting. Through post-selection of different particle events we can analyze one, two or more photon events. We argue that this zeptosecond level of temporal precision will open the door for new dynamical QED tests at lower intensities while photon counting experiments can also have an impact on the emerging field of quantum light in strong fields. We also discuss the potential impact on other areas, such as time-dependent QED, imaging, measurements of non-locality, and molecular quantum tomography.</description>

      <title>How Are Quantum Eigenfunctions of Hydrogen Atom Related To Its Classical Elliptic Orbits?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a highly-excited energy eigenfunction $\psi_{nlm}(\vec{r})$ of hydrogen atom can be approximated as an equal-weight superposition of classical elliptic orbits with energy $E_n$ and angular momentum $L=\sqrt{l(l+1)}\hbar$, and $z$ component of angular momentum $L_z=m\hbar$. This correspondence is established by comparing the quantum probability distribution $|\psi_{nlm}(\vec{r})|^2$ and the classical probability distribution $p_c(\vec{r})$ of an ensemble of such orbits. This finding illustrates a general principle: in the semi-classical limit, an energy eigenstate of a quantum system is in general reduced to a collection of classical orbits, rather than a single classical orbit.</description>
