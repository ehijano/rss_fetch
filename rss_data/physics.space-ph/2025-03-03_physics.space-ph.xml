      <title>Constructing Linear Operators Using Classical Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a methodology for generating linear operators that approximately represent nonlinear systems of perturbed ordinary differential equations. This is done through the application of classical perturbation theory via the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e expansion, followed by an extension of the space of configuration that guarantees the linear representation of the expanded system of differential equations. To ensure that such a linear representation exists, this paper uses polynomial basis functions. Pseudo-code describing the implementation of the proposed method is listed. The method is applied to the Duffing oscillator as well as to the J2 problem, with and without atmospheric drag, both analyzed using an osculating formulation. Additionally, conditions on the osculating Keplerian elements that produce low-eccentricity frozen orbits are presented, and a modification of the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method is proposed to enable the generation of linear operators that dynamically adapt to changes in the frequency of the motion. Finally, the proposed method is compared with alternatives in the literature.</description>

      <title>An experimental platform for levitated mechanics in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conducting levitated mechanical experiments in extreme conditions has long been the aim of researchers, as it allows for the investigation of new fundamental physics phenomena. One of the great frontiers has been sending these experiments into the micro-g environment of space, with multiple proposals calling for such a platform. At the same time, levitated sensors have demonstrated a high sensitivity to external stimuli which will only improve in low-vibrational conditions. conditions This paper describes the development of a technology demonstrator for optical and magnetic trapping experiments in space. Our payload represents the first concrete step towards future missions with aims of probing fundamental physical questions: matter-wave interferometry of nanoparticles to probe the limits of macroscopic quantum mechanics, detection of Dark Matter candidates and gravitational waves to test physics beyond the Standard Model, and accelerometry for Earth-observation.</description>
