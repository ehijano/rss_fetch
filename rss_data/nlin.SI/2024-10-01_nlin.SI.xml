      <title>Equation with the lower negative time number in the Davey--Stewartson hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \textit{SIGMA} \textbf{17} (2021), 091, 12 p.p.\ we have presented an integrable system with a negative time variable number for the Davey-Stewartson hierarchy. Here we develop this approach to construct an integrable equation with a lower time variable number. In addition, we show that the system reduced by this time is a new integrable equation in the dimension $1+1$.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric KdV and mKdV flows based on $sl(2,1)$ algebra and its solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic construction for supersymmetric negative (non-local) flows for mKdV and KdV based on $sl(2,1)$ with a principal gradation is proposed in this paper. We show that smKdV and sKdV can be mapped onto each other through a gauge super Miura transformation, together with an additional condition for the negative flows, which ensure the supersymmetry of the negative sKdV flow. In addition, we classify both smKdV and sKdV flows with respect to the vacuum (boundary) solutions accepted for each flow, whether zero or non-zero. Each vacuum is used to derive both soliton solutions and the Heisenberg subalgebra for the smKdV hierarchy, where we present novel vertex operators and solutions for non-zero bosonic and fermionic vacuum. Finally, the gauge Miura transformation is used to obtain the sKdV solutions, which exhibit a rich degeneracy due to both multiple gauge super Miura transformations and multiple vacuum possibilities.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional reductions and finite-gap type solutions of multicomponent integrable PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main object of the paper is a recently discovered family of multicomponent integrable systems of partial differential equations, whose particular cases include many well-known equations such as the Korteweg--de Vries, coupled KdV, Harry Dym, coupled Harry Dym, Camassa--Holm, multicomponent Camassa--Holm, Dullin--Gottwald--Holm, and Kaup--Boussinesq equations.
  We suggest a methodology for constructing a series of solutions for all systems in the family. The crux of the approach lies in reducing this system to a dispersionless integrable system which is a special case of linearly degenerate quasilinear systems actively explored since the 1990s and recently studied in the framework of Nijenhuis geometry. These infinite-dimensional integrable systems are closely connected to certain explicit finite-dimensional integrable systems. We provide a link between solutions of our multicomponent PDE systems and solutions of this finite-dimensional system, and use it to construct animations of multi-component analogous of soliton and cnoidal solutions.</description>

      <title>Unusual Properties of Adiabatic Invariance in a Billiard Model Related to the Adiabatic Piston Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the motion of two massive particles along a straight line. A lighter particle bounces back and forth between a heavier particle and a stationary wall, with all collisions being ideally elastic. It is known that if the lighter particle moves much faster than the heavier one, and the kinetic energies of the particles are of the same order, then the product of the speed of the lighter particle and the distance between the heavier particle and the wall is an adiabatic invariant: its value remains approximately constant over a long period. We show that the value of this adiabatic invariant, calculated at the collisions of the lighter particle with the wall, is a constant of motion (i.e., {an exact adiabatic invariant}). On the other hand, the value of this adiabatic invariant at the collisions between the particles slowly linearly in time decays with each collision.
  The model we consider is a highly simplified version of the classical adiabatic piston problem, where the lighter particle represents a gas particle, and the heavier particle represents the piston.</description>

      <title>Boundary overlap in the open XXZ spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the overlaps of the ground states for the open spin chains after a change of one of the boundary magnetic fields. It can be considered as the first step toward the study of the boundary quench problem: behaviour of an open spin chain after an abrupt change of one boundary magnetic field.</description>
