      <title>Cluster-based Graph Collaborative Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) have significantly succeeded in learning user and item representations for recommendation systems. The core of their efficacy is the ability to explicitly exploit the collaborative signals from both the first- and high-order neighboring nodes. However, most existing GCN-based methods overlook the multiple interests of users while performing high-order graph convolution. Thus, the noisy information from unreliable neighbor nodes (e.g., users with dissimilar interests) negatively impacts the representation learning of the target node. Additionally, conducting graph convolution operations without differentiating high-order neighbors suffers the over-smoothing issue when stacking more layers, resulting in performance degradation. In this paper, we aim to capture more valuable information from high-order neighboring nodes while avoiding noise for better representation learning of the target node. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel GCN-based recommendation model, termed Cluster-based Graph Collaborative Filtering (ClusterGCF). This model performs high-order graph convolution on cluster-specific graphs, which are constructed by capturing the multiple interests of users and identifying the common interests among them. Specifically, we design an unsupervised and optimizable soft node clustering approach to classify user and item nodes into multiple clusters. Based on the soft node clustering results and the topology of the user-item interaction graph, we assign the nodes with probabilities for different clusters to construct the cluster-specific graphs. To evaluate the effectiveness of ClusterGCF, we conducted extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can significantly improve recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Exact and Efficient Unlearning for Large Language Model-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolving paradigm of Large Language Model-based Recom- mendation (LLMRec) customizes Large Language Models (LLMs) through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using recommenda- tion data. The inclusion of user data in LLMs raises privacy concerns. To protect users, the unlearning process in LLMRec, specifically removing unusable data (e.g., historical behaviors) from established LLMRec models, becomes crucial. However, existing unlearning methods are insufficient for the unique characteristics of LLM- Rec, mainly due to high computational costs or incomplete data erasure. In this study, we introduce the Adapter Partition and Ag- gregation (APA) framework for exact and efficient unlearning while maintaining recommendation performance. APA achieves this by establishing distinct adapters for partitioned training data shards and retraining only the adapters impacted by unusable data for un- learning. To preserve recommendation performance and mitigate considerable inference costs, APA employs parameter-level adapter aggregation with sample-adaptive attention for individual testing samples. Extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework</description>

      <title>Promoting the linguistic diversity of TEI in the Maghreb and the Arab region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The project targets both oral corpus and the rich text resources written in the Maghreb region. It focuses particularly on the continuity, for more than 12 centuries, of a classical still alive Arabic language and on the extreme hybridization of vernacular languages sustained by the rich Libyan, Roman, Hebrew and Ottoman influences and by the more recent French, Spanish and Italian linguistic interference. In short, the Maghreb is a place of extremely abundant, but much unexploited, textual studies.</description>

      <title>Spiral of Silences: How is Large Language Model Killing Information Retrieval? -- A Case Study on Open Domain Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The practice of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with retrieval systems, has become increasingly prevalent. However, the repercussions of LLM-derived content infiltrating the web and influencing the retrieval-generation feedback loop are largely uncharted territories. In this study, we construct and iteratively run a simulation pipeline to deeply investigate the short-term and long-term effects of LLM text on RAG systems. Taking the trending Open Domain Question Answering (ODQA) task as a point of entry, our findings reveal a potential digital "Spiral of Silence" effect, with LLM-generated text consistently outperforming human-authored content in search rankings, thereby diminishing the presence and impact of human contributions online. This trend risks creating an imbalanced information ecosystem, where the unchecked proliferation of erroneous LLM-generated content may result in the marginalization of accurate information. We urge the academic community to take heed of this potential issue, ensuring a diverse and authentic digital information landscape.</description>

      <title>LegalPro-BERT: Classification of Legal Provisions by fine-tuning BERT Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A contract is a type of legal document commonly used in organizations. Contract review is an integral and repetitive process to avoid business risk and liability. Contract analysis requires the identification and classification of key provisions and paragraphs within an agreement. Identification and validation of contract clauses can be a time-consuming and challenging task demanding the services of trained and expensive lawyers, paralegals or other legal assistants. Classification of legal provisions in contracts using artificial intelligence and natural language processing is complex due to the requirement of domain-specialized legal language for model training and the scarcity of sufficient labeled data in the legal domain. Using general-purpose models is not effective in this context due to the use of specialized legal vocabulary in contracts which may not be recognized by a general model. To address this problem, we propose the use of a pre-trained large language model which is subsequently calibrated on legal taxonomy. We propose LegalPro-BERT, a BERT transformer architecture model that we fine- tune to efficiently handle classification task for legal provisions. We conducted experiments to measure and compare metrics with current benchmark results. We found that LegalPro-BERT outperforms the previous benchmark used for comparison in this research.</description>

      <title>TabSQLify: Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs Through Table Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Table reasoning is a challenging task that requires understanding both natural language questions and structured tabular data. Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but they often struggle with large tables due to their limited input length. In this paper, we propose TabSQLify, a novel method that leverages text-to-SQL generation to decompose tables into smaller and relevant sub-tables, containing only essential information for answering questions or verifying statements, before performing the reasoning task. In our comprehensive evaluation on four challenging datasets, our approach demonstrates comparable or superior performance compared to prevailing methods reliant on full tables as input. Moreover, our method can reduce the input context length significantly, making it more scalable and efficient for large-scale table reasoning applications. Our method performs remarkably well on the WikiTQ benchmark, achieving an accuracy of 64.7%. Additionally, on the TabFact benchmark, it achieves a high accuracy of 79.5%. These results surpass other LLM-based baseline models on gpt-3.5-turbo (chatgpt). TabSQLify can reduce the table size significantly alleviating the computational load on LLMs when handling large tables without compromising performance.</description>

      <title>Compressible and Searchable: AI-native Multi-Modal Retrieval System with Learned Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning volume of digital content across diverse modalities necessitates efficient storage and retrieval methods. Conventional approaches struggle to cope with the escalating complexity and scale of multimedia data. In this paper, we proposed framework addresses this challenge by fusing AI-native multi-modal search capabilities with neural image compression. First we analyze the intricate relationship between compressibility and searchability, recognizing the pivotal role each plays in the efficiency of storage and retrieval systems. Through the usage of simple adapter is to bridge the feature of Learned Image Compression(LIC) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) while retaining semantic fidelity and retrieval of multi-modal data. Experimental evaluations on Kodak datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing significant enhancements in compression efficiency and search accuracy compared to existing methodologies. Our work marks a significant advancement towards scalable and efficient multi-modal search systems in the era of big data.</description>

      <title>Reasoning on Efficient Knowledge Paths:Knowledge Graph Guides Large Language Model for Domain Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT3.5, GPT4 and LLAMA2 perform surprisingly well and outperform human experts on many tasks. However, in many domain-specific evaluations, these LLMs often suffer from hallucination problems due to insufficient training of relevant corpus. Furthermore, fine-tuning large models may face problems such as the LLMs are not open source or the construction of high-quality domain instruction is difficult. Therefore, structured knowledge databases such as knowledge graph can better provide domain back- ground knowledge for LLMs and make full use of the reasoning and analysis capabilities of LLMs. In some previous works, LLM was called multiple times to determine whether the current triplet was suitable for inclusion in the subgraph when retrieving subgraphs through a question. Especially for the question that require a multi-hop reasoning path, frequent calls to LLM will consume a lot of computing power. Moreover, when choosing the reasoning path, LLM will be called once for each step, and if one of the steps is selected incorrectly, it will lead to the accumulation of errors in the following steps. In this paper, we integrated and optimized a pipeline for selecting reasoning paths from KG based on LLM, which can reduce the dependency on LLM. In addition, we propose a simple and effective subgraph retrieval method based on chain of thought (CoT) and page rank which can returns the paths most likely to contain the answer. We conduct experiments on three datasets: GenMedGPT-5k [14], WebQuestions [2], and CMCQA [21]. Finally, RoK can demonstrate that using fewer LLM calls can achieve the same results as previous SOTAs models.</description>

      <title>Train Once, Use Flexibly: A Modular Framework for Multi-Aspect Neural News Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent neural news recommenders (NNRs) extend content-based recommendation (1) by aligning additional aspects (e.g., topic, sentiment) between candidate news and user history or (2) by diversifying recommendations w.r.t. these aspects. This customization is achieved by "hardcoding" additional constraints into the NNR's architecture and/or training objectives: any change in the desired recommendation behavior thus requires retraining the model with a modified objective. This impedes widespread adoption of multi-aspect news recommenders. In this work, we introduce MANNeR, a modular framework for multi-aspect neural news recommendation that supports on-the-fly customization over individual aspects at inference time. With metric-based learning as its backbone, MANNeR learns aspect-specialized news encoders and then flexibly and linearly combines the resulting aspect-specific similarity scores into different ranking functions, alleviating the need for ranking function-specific retraining of the model. Extensive experimental results show that MANNeR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NNRs on both standard content-based recommendation and single- and multi-aspect customization. Lastly, we validate that MANNeR's aspect-customization module is robust to language and domain transfer.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs for Synthesizing Training Data Across Many Languages in Multilingual Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been limited success for dense retrieval models in multilingual retrieval, due to uneven and scarce training data available across multiple languages. Synthetic training data generation is promising (e.g., InPars or Promptagator), but has been investigated only for English. Therefore, to study model capabilities across both cross-lingual and monolingual retrieval tasks, we develop SWIM-IR, a synthetic retrieval training dataset containing 33 (high to very-low resource) languages for fine-tuning multilingual dense retrievers without requiring any human supervision. To construct SWIM-IR, we propose SAP (summarize-then-ask prompting), where the large language model (LLM) generates a textual summary prior to the query generation step. SAP assists the LLM in generating informative queries in the target language. Using SWIM-IR, we explore synthetic fine-tuning of multilingual dense retrieval models and evaluate them robustly on three retrieval benchmarks: XOR-Retrieve (cross-lingual), MIRACL (monolingual) and XTREME-UP (cross-lingual). Our models, called SWIM-X, are competitive with human-supervised dense retrieval models, e.g., mContriever-X, finding that SWIM-IR can cheaply substitute for expensive human-labeled retrieval training data. SWIM-IR dataset and SWIM-X models are available at https://github.com/google-research-datasets/SWIM-IR.</description>

      <title>Generative Information Retrieval Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a draft of a chapter intended to appear in a forthcoming book on generative information retrieval, co-edited by Chirag Shah and Ryen White. In this chapter, we consider generative information retrieval evaluation from two distinct but interrelated perspectives. First, large language models (LLMs) themselves are rapidly becoming tools for evaluation, with current research indicating that LLMs may be superior to crowdsource workers and other paid assessors on basic relevance judgement tasks. We review past and ongoing related research, including speculation on the future of shared task initiatives, such as TREC, and a discussion on the continuing need for human assessments. Second, we consider the evaluation of emerging LLM-based generative information retrieval (GenIR) systems, including retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems. We consider approaches that focus both on the end-to-end evaluation of GenIR systems and on the evaluation of a retrieval component as an element in a RAG system. Going forward, we expect the evaluation of GenIR systems to be at least partially based on LLM-based assessment, creating an apparent circularity, with a system seemingly evaluating its own output. We resolve this apparent circularity in two ways: 1) by viewing LLM-based assessment as a form of "slow search", where a slower IR system is used for evaluation and training of a faster production IR system; and 2) by recognizing a continuing need to ground evaluation in human assessment, even if the characteristics of that human assessment must change.</description>
