      <title>Fast-Recovery Epitaxial NbN Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors with Saturated Efficiency at 1550 nm in Liquid Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving both high internal efficiency and fast reset times at elevated temperatures remains challenging due to limited understanding of how film properties govern SNSPD performance. We demonstrate that epitaxial NbN films on sapphire enable simultaneous high efficiency and rapid response. We fabricate and characterize SNSPDs based on these films deposited via DC magnetron sputtering on c-cut sapphire. High-quality epitaxial growth preserves a low electron diffusion coefficient and promotes strong electron-phonon coupling, yielding a high critical temperature and efficient hotspot formation in the dirty limit. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy confirm epitaxial alignment and lattice order. Nanowires of 20 nm width exhibit saturated internal efficiency at 1550 nm wavelength and short reset times at 4.2 K, enabled by lattice matching and high thermal conductance of the sapphire interface. Ab initio modeling reproduces photon count rates, linking device performance quantitatively to film properties such as diffusivity and electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Wide Bandgap AlGaN Heterostructure Field Effect Transistors with Current Gain Cutoff Frequency Above 85 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the design and demonstration of ultra-wide-bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN polarization-graded field-effect transistors (PolFETs) that achieve a current-gain cutoff frequency above 85 GHz and a current density exceeding 1.3 A/mm. Ultra-thin channel and buffer layers were grown epitaxially on AlN substrates, and a reverse-graded AlGaN contact layer was incorporated to reduce the contact resistance to below 1 ohm.mm. With aggressively scaled device dimensions, the AlGaN PolFETs exhibit state-of-the-art high-frequency performance for UWBG transistors. Small-signal modeling reveals both parasitic and transit delays, confirming the benefits of reduced access resistance and enhanced intrinsic transconductance. These results establish a new performance benchmark for UWBG AlGaN devices and demonstrate their strong potential for next-generation millimeter-wave electronics.</description>

      <title>Scaled Ultra-Wide Bandgap AlGaN Polarization-Graded FET with Ultra-thin Buffer Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the design and demonstration of ultra-wide bandgap AlGaN polarization-graded field effect transistors with ultra-thin channels to enable excellent current density and high-frequency performance while significantly reducing thermal resistance. We use polarization-graded AlGaN layers and ultra-thin pseudomorphic AlGaN buffer layers to enable low thermal resistance and excellent structural quality. The polarization-graded field effect transistors (PolFETs) demonstrated here show Imax over 800mA/mm and current/power gain cutoff frequency (fT/fmax) of 26/28 GHz. Small signal modeling and analysis were used to determine parasitic/transit delays, and gate-resistance thermometry was implemented to thermally characterize AlGaN PolFET and benchmark against state-of-the-art AlGaN HEMTs. The ultra-thin AlGaN PolFET showed thermal resistance of 12 K.mm/W, representing a significant reduction from typical AlGaN transistors. These results show state-of-art combination of high current density, excellent fT-LG product for ultra-wide bandgap AlGaN transistors, and superior thermal performance, and highlight the promise of AlGaN transistors for future RF and mm-wave applications.</description>

      <title>Simplified Analytical Models for High-Precision Open-Loop Scanning in Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) enables nanoscale characterization and has been widely applied across diverse systems. In AFM, the tip or sample is typically scanned using piezoelectric scanners, which convert applied voltages into precise mechanical displacements with sub-nanometer accuracy and high bandwidth. However, because piezo elements exhibit nonlinear responses, actual displacements can deviate from the applied driving signal by up to 20-30%. Various methods have been developed to improve positional accuracy, but they often suffer from limited scan speed, increased noise, or complex calibration procedures. From the perspective of routine maintenance, ease of calibration is more advantageous for applications where an error of around 1-2% is acceptable, especially when measuring dynamic molecular motions. Motivated by this, we developed a simple method to generate scan waveforms via software-based feedforward control, which can be easily implemented and calibrated. We identify four distinct sources of positioning error in piezo scanners and demonstrate that these errors can be compensated, achieving more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in positioning accuracy compared with uncompensated operation. Because the proposed method requires no additional hardware and is entirely software-based, it does not deteriorate imaging speed and is compatible with a wide range of AFM systems as well as other scanning probe microscopies.</description>

      <title>Contactless micro-elastography of single cells using oscillating microbubbles as shear wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of cells play key roles in their physiology, function, physiological and pathological transformations. Micro-elastography has recently emerged as a promising tool to estimate cellular viscoelastic properties within a millisecond, without the need for mechanical modeling. Here, we report a fully contactless approach to single-cell micro-elastography, using acoustically oscillating gas microbubbles positioned near individual cells (20~\textmu m diameter megakaryocytes) as localized shear wave sources. Using this approach, we successfully performed micro-elastography on cells up to five times smaller than those studied in previous works, establishing the smallest single-cell elastography measurements to date. Spherical or non-spherical bubble oscillations generated 15~kHz elastic waves, which we detected using a high-speed camera coupled to a standard bright-field microscope. Noise correlation elastography enabled the measurement of average and local shear-wave velocities within single cells. Our results demonstrate that this method is robust and reproducible across multiple cells from the same cell line, paving the way for real-time, label-free mechanical monitoring of single cells during fast biological processes.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Experiments of an Injection-Locked Magnetron With Various Load Reflection Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the performance of an injection-locked 5.8-GHz continuous-wave magnetron with various load reflection levels. The load reflection is introduced to an equivalent magnetron model to theoretically evaluate the system performance. The effects of different load reflection levels on the magnetron's output are numerically analyzed. Experiments are performed while the load reflection is varied using an E-H tuner between a magnetron and a circulator. A narrower locking bandwidth is observed under constant injection power with increasing load reflection. The proper-mismatched system suppresses its sideband energy, thereby reducing phase noise. The experimental features qualitatively validate the theoretical analyses results. The investigation results also provide guidance for advanced applications in communication and high-energy physics based on injection-locked magnetrons.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Reconstruction of Tennis Serve Mechanics: From Aerodynamic Constraints to Internal Torques via Rigid-Body Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most conventional studies on tennis serve biomechanics rely on phenomenological observations comparing professional and amateur players or, more recently, on AI-driven statistical analyses of motion data. While effective at describing \textit{what} elite players do, these approaches often fail to explain \textit{why} such motions are physically necessary from a mechanistic perspective. This paper proposes a deterministic, physics-based approach to the tennis serve using a 12-degree-of-freedom multi-segment model of the human upper body. Rather than fitting the model to motion capture data, we solve the inverse kinematics problem via trajectory optimization to rigorously satisfy the aerodynamic boundary conditions required for Flat, Slice, and Kick serves. We subsequently perform an inverse dynamics analysis based on the Principle of Virtual Power to compute the net joint torques. The simulation results reveal that while the kinematic trajectories for different serves may share visual similarities, the underlying kinetic profiles differ drastically. A critical finding is that joints exhibiting minimal angular displacement (kinematically ``quiet'' phases), particularly at the wrist, require substantial and highly time-varying torques to counteract gravitational loading and dynamic coupling effects. By elucidating the dissociation between visible kinematics and internal kinetics, this study provides a first-principles framework for understanding the mechanics of the tennis serve, moving beyond simple imitation of elite techniques.</description>

      <title>Enhanced diffusion in self-nanoconfined water channels between periodically modulated surfaces: insights from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water nanoconfinement is known to occur inside material void spaces, such as 2D confinement between surfaces, 1D confinement inside nanotubes, and variable-dimension confinement inside nanoporous materials. In the present work we investigate, through molecular dynamics simulations, the morphologies and self-diffusion coefficient of water channels that are nanoconfined in the void space between adjacent surfaces of nanotube bundles - an existing class of materials. In our simulations, we begin with water filling completely the void space, and then we progressively increase the inter-surface separation, maintaining the water content. We find that, as the inter-surface separation progresses, the dimensionality of the water channel decreases from 2D to 1D, the latter consisting of self-confined water channels along surface grooves. The morphologies and self-diffusion coefficients of these 1D water nanochannels are strongly dependent on the nature of the water-surface interaction and on the diameter of the nanotubes. Interestingly, as we decrease the nanotube diameter from 10 to 5 nm, the self-diffusion coefficients of the 1D channels increase by tenfold for hydrophilic surfaces and by sixfold for hydrophobic surfaces, surpassing, in both cases, the bulk water values. We also investigated the water channels at the interstitial voids of the bulk bundle material, finding 1D water channels that are similar to the surface ones.</description>

      <title>Thermal characterization of suspended fine wires across continuum to free-molecular gas regimes using the 3$\omega$ method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3$\omega$ method is widely used to measure the thermal conductivity and the specific heat of wires and thin films. These measurements are typically performed under high vacuum conditions, which justify the use of heat transfer models that exclude thermal losses to a surrounding fluid. Here, we study the effect of thermal conduction from a joule-heated wire to a surrounding gas on pressure-dependent 3$\omega$ measurements, and show how a one-dimensional (1D) heat-transfer model may be used to reliably determine the wire's thermal properties. We derive a full analytical solution of the 1D heat-transfer equation with finite heat-transfer coefficient $h$ and validate it experimentally using a 16-$\mu$m diameter platinum wire in air across pressures from $10^{-5}$ to $10^3$ mbar. We introduce a model for heat transfer between the wire and the surrounding gas based on kinetic gas theory that accurately describes the data across continuum to free-molecular gas regimes, with $h$ varying from near-zero in high vacuum to approximately 700 W/(m$^2\cdot$K) at atmospheric pressure. We show that use of a validated $h(p)$ model allows extracting both thermal conductivity $\kappa$ and volumetric heat capacity $\rho c_p$, whereas volumetric heat capacity can be extracted even without invoking a specific $h(p)$ model. Our approach facilitates the characterization of fine wires with moderate to low thermal conductivities and may enable accurate thermal measurements of suspended wires with diameters on the nanometer scale.</description>

      <title>Antichiral surface states and higher-order topological states based on a modified Haldane model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antichiral surface states, characterized by unidirectional propagation on parallel surfaces, offer unique potential for controlling classical waves. However, their realization typically relies on complex implementations of the two-dimensional modified Haldane model, limiting practical applications. Here, we propose a simplified scheme to realize such states within the nodal-line semimetal phase of a single-layer honeycomb lattice, by emulating the essential physics of the modified Haldane model through an introduced layer degree of freedom. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unequal vertical interlayer couplings can generate valley higher-order topological partial bandgaps, hosting coexisting one-dimensional hinge states and gapped antichiral surface states. We numerically verify these multiple topological states in acoustic crystals, establishing a versatile platform for advanced wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>Strong actuation and optomechanical application of mass loaded membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of studies are moving towards the combination of quantum mechanics and gravity, where studying gravity from a very small source mass is a viable starting point. Preparing for such experiments, investigations of weak gravitational forces have employed mechanical resonators to detect time-dependent gravitational forces from actuated source masses. Here, we demonstrate a source mass approach which utilizes capacitive actuation of a 1 mg gold sphere embedded on a silicon nitride membrane, rather than piezoelectric or motorized actuation. The design simultaneously provides a method for microwave optomechanical implementation by coupling the membrane position to the electromagnetic mode of a 3D cavity. The cavity quality factor is not significantly compromised by electromagnetic leakage to the actuation electrode, allowing DC and kilohertz AC voltages to be introduced in the region where electric fields are strongly concentrated. We measure over 700 nm of driven oscillation amplitude and more than ten percent tunability in the mechanical resonance frequency of the loaded membrane, giving the potential to match the oscillations to the frequency range of a detector in future experiments. An optomechanical readout is demonstrated by measuring the cavity resonance at cryogenic temperatures, while room temperature measurements provide complimentary understanding of the mechanisms which influence the mechanical response, including repulsive contact due to collisions within the device.</description>

      <title>Transient Vibroacoustic Control of a Shock-Loaded Inter-Connected Cylindrical Double Shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double-wall cylindrical shells are widely used in applications where resistance to acoustic shock loading is critical. While the transient vibroacoustic behavior of single-walled shells has been extensively investigated, extending these analyses to double-wall cylindrical configurations introduces increased complexity due to multiple inter-shell acoustic reflections and strong coupling between acoustic fields and structural vibrations. These structures often feature mechanical interconnections between the shells to ensure structural integrity, load sharing, alignment, and enhanced resilience against static and dynamic loads. These links introduce additional pathways for vibration transmission and significantly influence the overall behavior of the system, thus making the analytical description of the coupled vibroacoustic response even more challenging. This study investigates the transient vibroacoustics of an inter-connected double-wall cylindrical shell subjected to an acoustic shock, considering fully coupled fluid-structure interactions. A comprehensive two-dimensional acoustoelastic model is developed in polar coordinates, incorporating the surrounding medium, the fluid occupying the inter-shell gap, and the fluid inside the inner shell. A semi-analytical solution method is employed to capture the time-domain evolution of acoustic fields and shell vibrations. The model's accuracy is verified by benchmarking against available data reported in the literature. Leveraging the passive dynamics of the system, we present a hybrid mechanism that integrates optimized nonlinear vibration absorbers with piezoelectric actuators to control the vibroacoustic behavior. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid mechanism in mitigating shock-induced acoustic pressure waves and enhancing the structural resilience of the double-wall cylindrical shell.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Si/SiGe Heterostructures for Large and Robust Valley Splitting in Silicon Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notoriously low and fluctuating valley splitting is one of the key challenges for electron spin qubits in silicon (Si), limiting the scalability of Si-based quantum processors. In silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures, the problem can be addressed by the design of the epitaxial layer stack. Several heuristic strategies have been proposed to enhance the energy gap between the two nearly degenerate valley states in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs), e.g., sharp Si/SiGe interfaces, Ge spikes or oscillating Ge concentrations within the QW. In this work, we develop a systematic variational optimization approach to compute optimal Ge concentration profiles that boost selected properties of the intervalley coupling matrix element. Our free-shape optimization approach is augmented by a number of technological constraints to ensure feasibility of the resulting epitaxial profiles. The method is based on an effective-mass-type envelope-function theory accounting for the effects of strain and compositional alloy disorder. Various previously proposed heterostructure designs are recovered as special cases of the constrained optimization problem. Our main result is a novel heterostructure design we refer to as the "modulated wiggle well," which provides a large deterministic enhancement of the valley splitting along with a reliable suppression of the disorder-induced volatility. In addition, our new design offers a wide-range tunability of the valley splitting ranging from about 200 $\mu$eV to above 1 meV controlled by the vertical electric field, which offers new perspectives to engineer switchable qubits with on-demand adjustable valley splitting.</description>

      <title>Source quantification by mobile gamma-ray spectrometry systems: A Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying gamma-ray sources from mobile gamma-ray spectrometry surveys has remained a fundamentally elusive, long-standing inverse problem at the interface of nuclear and computational physics. Here, we present a full-spectrum Bayesian inference framework that resolves this inverse problem by combining high-fidelity, platform-dynamic Monte Carlo template generation with Bayesian inversion. Applying this methodology to airborne measurements benchmarked against laboratory and in-situ ground truths, we demonstrate accurate and robust quantification of both natural and anthropogenic radionuclides under field conditions. By improving activity estimates by an order of magnitude, providing principled uncertainty quantification, and rigorously accounting for overdispersion, this framework opens the way to a more statistically rigorous and physics-informed era of mobile gamma-ray spectrometry, unlocking enhanced inference capabilities in emergency response, environmental monitoring, nuclear security, and planetary exploration.</description>

      <title>Effect of the repulsion between twin granular impactors on crater's aspect ratio: preliminary findings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the role of repulsive granular interactions between identical intruders as they impact a granular bed. We demonstrate experimentally that repulsion does have a measurable effect in the aspect ratio of binary craters. Furthermore, we show that the protocol followed for the preparation of the granular bed plays a crucial role in the output of table-top experiments on doublet craters.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sinterability and in vitro bioactivity of diopside through fluoride doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, diopside (CaMgSi2O6) was doped with fluoride at a level of 1 mol.%, without the formation of any second phase, by a wet chemical precipitation method. The sintered structure of the synthesized nanopowders was studied by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. Also, the samples' in vitro apatite-forming ability in a simulated body fluid was comparatively evaluated by electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. According to the results, the material's sinterability was improved by fluoride doping, as realized from the further development of sintering necks. It was also found that compared to the undoped bioceramic, a higher amount of apatite was deposited on the surface of the doped sample. It is concluded that fluoride can be considered as a doping agent in magnesium-containing silicates to improve biological, particularly bioactivity, behaviors.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Vascularity in Gelatin Scaffolds via Copper-Doped Magnesium-Calcium Silicates Incorporation: In-Vitro and Ex-Ovo Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing a critical challenge in current tissue-engineering practices, this study aims to enhance vascularization in 3D porous scaffolds by incorporating bioceramics laden with pro-angiogenic ions. Specifically, freeze-dried gelatin-based scaffolds were infused with sol-gel-derived powders of Cu-doped akermanite (Ca2MgSi2O7) and bredigite (Ca7MgSi4O16) at various concentrations (10, 20, and 30 wt%). The scaffolds were initially characterized for their structural integrity, biodegradability, swelling behavior, impact on physiological pH, and cytocompatibility with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The silicate incorporation effectiveness in promoting vascularity was then assessed through HUVEC attachment, capillary tube formation, and ex-ovo chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assays. The findings revealed significant improvements in both in-vitro and ex-ovo vascularity of the gelatin scaffolds upon the addition of Cu-doped akermanite. The most effective concentrations were determined to be 10 and 20%, which led to notable HUVEC metabolic activity, a well-spread morphology with extensive peripheral filopodia and lamellipodia at 10% and a cobblestone phenotype indicative of in-vivo endothelium at 20% during cell attachment, the formation of complex networks of tubular structures, and robust vascularization in chick embryo development. Moving forward, the incorporation of Cu-doped akermanite into tissue-engineering scaffolds shows great potential for addressing the limitations of vascularization, especially for critical-sized bone defects, by facilitating the controlled release of pro-angiogenic and pro-osteogenic ions.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Photonic Switching in GST-467 for Deep Neural Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) have emerged as key enablers of non-volatile, ultra-compact photonic switches for energy-efficient deep neural network (DNN) applications. In this work, we investigate the recently discovered $\mathrm{Ge_{4}Sb_{6}Te_{7}}$ (GST-467) as a high-contrast optical PCM and demonstrate its suitability for multi-level photonic computing. The complex refractive indices of amorphous and crystalline GST-467 were experimentally extracted and used to propose a segmented silicon-on-insulator photonic switch optimized at 1550 nm. Three-dimensional FDTD simulations reveal that segmentation significantly enhances the extinction ratio while maintaining low insertion loss, resulting in a more than seven times higher design figure of merit than an unsegmented design. Laser-induced thermo-optical simulations further establish efficient, reversible switching with sub-nJ energy requirements for crystallization and amorphization. Compared with established GST, GSST, and GSS compositions, GST-467 provides the largest transmission contrast and supports up to 48 resolvable optical states. When deployed as multi-level weights in photonic DNN architectures, the GST-467 switch achieves superior classification accuracy on EMNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks. These results position GST-467 as a highly promising PCM for scalable, low-energy photonic computing and neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>Reactive near-field subwavelength microwave imaging with a non-invasive Rydberg probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive microwave field imaging--accurately mapping field distributions without perturbing them--is essential in areas such as aerospace engineering, biomedical imaging and integrated-circuit diagnostics. Conventional metal probes, however, inevitably perturb reactive near fields: they act as strong scatterers that drive induced currents and secondary radiation, remap evanescent components and thereby degrade both accuracy and spatial resolution, particularly in the reactive near-field regime that is most relevant to these applications. Here we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, reactive near-field subwavelength imaging of microwave fields using the quantum non-demolition properties of Rydberg atoms, realized with a compact, non-invasive single-ended fibre-integrated Rydberg probe engineered to minimize field disturbance. The probe achieves an imaging resolution of {\unboldmath$\lambda/56$}, and the measured field distributions agree with full-wave simulations with structural similarity approaching unity, confirming both its subwavelength spatial resolution and its genuinely non-invasive character compared with conventional metal-based probes. Because the atomic sensor is intrinsically isotropic, the same device can faithfully image multi-dimensional field structures without orientation-dependent calibration. Our results therefore establish a general, non-invasive route to high-accuracy, subwavelength reactive near-field microwave imaging, with particular promise for applications such as chip-defect detection and integrated-circuit diagnostics, where even small perturbations by the probe can mask the underlying physics of interest.</description>

      <title>Precise control of high-frequency ultrasounds in thin crystals for the development of tunable narrowband and directional gamma-ray sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a complete methodology for the precise characterization of the acoustic field inside crystal-based devices driven by high-frequency ultrasounds towards the generation of tunable narrowband and directional gamma radiation via undulation of ultra-relativistic charged particles. Such gamma-ray sources have long been anticipated by the scientific community, as they promise new powerful tools for the study of high-energy physical phenomena and the development of novel nuclear technologies. In such devices, a piezoelectric transducer induces tens of MHz harmonic waves inside a silicon monocrystal. Ultra-relativistic charged particles traversing the crystal get trapped within the channels formed by the extremely strong electric fields of the acoustically modulated lattice planes, undergoing undulation and emitting gamma radiation. Precise characterization of the acoustic field in the crystal is crucial for the determination of the expected characteristics of the secondarily generated gamma rays. For this purpose, fast laser refraction imaging is used here to image the acoustic waves by exploiting the spatial redistribution of a laser beam optical intensity caused by the acoustic field. A dedicated computational model is developed for the estimation of the spatial distribution of the pressure and lattice deformation inside the crystal. This methodology provides a framework for future novel gamma-ray sources in high-energy facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the necking, filament thinning, and pinchoff dynamics of ferrofluid droplets within a magnetic field, via a simple and low-cost experimental method. In our studies, both the Ohnesorge number Oh and the Deborah number De are O1, a typically inaccessible regime with conventional extensional rheometers. Under magnetic forcing, the nanoparticles assemble into field aligned, chainlike structures, that generate a tunable magnetoelastic response, and markedly alter the extensional flow. Although behaving as Newtonian liquids in the absence of a magnetic field, the field induces extensional thickening, and the emergence of beads on a string BOAS structures in the ferrofluid filaments, a non-Newtonian signature. By combining controlled elongation with high speed imaging, we directly quantify the magnetic field-dependent extensional viscosity and relaxation time. Our findings underscore how magnetically induced microstructures govern filament stability and extensional dynamics in ferrofluids.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a formal definition of the transfer ABCD parameters in time-varying electromagnetic systems. The formal definition comes after the rearrangement of the fields $D$ and $B$ at the inputs and outputs of the temporal system based on the time-varying boundary conditions. Then, we derive the ABCD parameters of a temporal transmission line, i.e., a temporal slab, and compute the associated scattering parameters (reflection and transmission coefficients). The results presented here open up an alternative way, based on network theory, to analyze multilayer temporal configurations. Moreover, we show that the ABCD parameters can be used to compute the dispersion diagram ($\omega$ vs $k$) of time crystals.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Regression Modelling for Vertical Facade Surface Temperature: A Tropical Case Study on Solar-reflective Material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban heat islands (UHIs) pose a critical challenge in densely populated cities and tropical climates where large amounts of energy are used to meet the cooling demand. To address this, Building and Construction Authority (BCA) of Singapore provides incentives for passive cooling such as using of solar-reflective material in its Green Mark guidelines. Thus, understanding about its real-world effectiveness in tropical urban environments is required. This study evaluated the effectiveness of solar-reflective cool paint using a hybrid modelling framework combining a transient physical model and data driven model through field measurements. Several machine learning algorithms were compared including multiple-linear regression (MLR), random forest regressor (RF), AdaBoost regressor (AB), extreme gradient boosting regressor (XGB), and TabPFN regressor (TPR). The results indicated that the transient physical model overestimated facade temperatures in the lower temperature ranges. The physics-informed MLR achieved best performance with improved accuracy for pre-cool paint (R2=0.96, RMSE=0.83C) and post-cool paint (R2=0.95, RMSE=0.65C) scenarios, reducing RMSE by 26% and 44%, respectively. The hybrid model also effectively predicted hourly heat fluxes revealing substantial reductions in surface temperature and heat storage with increasing albedo. The maximum net heat flux q_net was reduced by about 30-65 W/m2 in the post-cool paint stage (albedo = 0.73) compared to the pre-cool paint stage (albedo = 0.31). As albedo increases from 0.1 to 0.9, the sensitivity analysis predicts that the maximum daytime surface temperature will decrease by about 11C and the peak heat release of the net heat flux will decrease significantly from about 161 W/m2 to 27 W/m2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work by Lawrie et al. [PRR 7, 023209 (2025)] introduced a non-diffracting resonant angular filter on a network of thin channels (modelled via quantum graph theory) that exhibits unit transmission of acoustic waves at a discrete, symmetry-paired set of incidence angles determined solely by the graph topology, while transmission at all other angles is strictly forbidden. In the present work, we study the same filtering geometry for waves governed by the magnetic Schr\"odinger equation rather than the classical wave equation. Using a phase shift induced by non-reciprocal wave propagation due to the presence of the magnetic potential and tuning $\delta$-type vertex boundary conditions, we make the previously topology-fixed discrete pass directions continuously tunable: both the transmission angle and the transmission coefficient become control parameters. The resulting flux-tunable angular filtering device replaces topology-constrained passbands with a programmable steering device, broadening the scope for wave-filter and beam-shaping applications.</description>

      <title>Neutron-Assisted Breakdown Enhancement in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky Diodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study demonstrates a substantial enhancement of breakdown voltage in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky diodes through an approach that combines fast neutron irradiation with controlled post-irradiation electro-thermal annealing. Devices irradiated with 1 MeV neutrons at a high fluence of 1E15 n/cm^2 exhibited substantial degradation, including a drastic reduction in on-current and an increase in on-resistance. Electrothermal testing, conducted through simultaneous current-voltage (J-V) measurements and thermal annealing, resulted in significant recovery. After four cycles of electro-thermal testing, the devices demonstrated significant improvements in performance, with a substantial recovery of on-current and a reduction in on-resistance compared to the post-radiation condition, approaching pre-radiation levels. Most recovery occurred during the first two cycles, with diminishing improvements in later cycles, indicating that most thermally recoverable traps were mitigated early. Capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements revealed a substantial reduction in carrier concentration, decreasing from 3.2E16 cm^-3 pre-radiation to 5.5E15 cm^-3 after the first electro-thermal testing cycle, indicating an over 82% reduction. Following the third cycle, the carrier concentration partially recovered to 9.9E15 cm^-3, reflecting a carrier removal rate of ~22 cm^-1. The breakdown voltage exhibited a remarkable enhancement, increasing from approximately 300 V to 1.28 kV (a ~325% improvement) after the first electro-thermal testing, attributed to the reduction in carrier concentration by compensating radiation-induced traps. Subsequent testing reduced breakdown voltage slightly to 940 V due to partial recovery of carrier concentration, but it remained significantly higher than pre-radiation levels.</description>

      <title>A Tri-Band Shared-Aperture Base Station Antenna Array Covering 5G Mid-Band and 6G Centimetric Wave Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a tri-band shared-aperture antenna array with three wide bands, covering the 5G mid-band and the 6G centimetric band, which is a promising candidate for future 6G base station antennas. The challenge of suppressing interferences, including scattering and coupling, in the tri-band array is holistically addressed across wide bands. Guided by characteristic mode analysis (CMA), a segmented spiral radiator is efficiently developed to mitigate scattering and coupling at high frequencies while preserving radiation performance at low frequencies. Compared to a conventional tube radiator, the proposed spiral exhibits a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) over an ultra-wide range of 4.7-21.5 GHz (128.2%). With the aid of serial resonators, impedance matching of the segmented-spiral-based dipole antenna is achieved across the low band (LB) of 3.05-4.68 GHz (42.2%), spanning the 5G band 3.3-4.2 GHz. Moreover, suppressors are placed near the LB ports to further reduce the cross-band coupling. Middle band (MB) and high band (HB) antennas operate in 6.2-10.0 GHz (46.9%) and 10.0-15.6 GHz (43.8%), respectively, collectively covering the anticipated 5G-Advanced and 6G centimetric band of 6.425-15.35 GHz. Both the MB and HB antennas employ a planar magnetoelectric (ME) dipole structure, which prevents common-mode resonances in the LB and MB, and mitigates the scattering from the MB antenna in the HB. In this tri-band array, radiation patterns remain undistorted across the LB, MB, and HB, and the isolation between any two ports exceeds 20 dB over all three bands.</description>

Abstract: The crystallographic orientation of films grown on 2D-masked substrates is often used to infer the pathway among remote, van der Waals, and thru-hole (pinhole-seeded) epitaxy. However, attribution of a specific growth mechanism based on orientation can be ambiguous unless mask continuity and substrate pre-treatment are evaluated within a single process window. We compare GaN grown under identical conditions on four m-plane sapphire templates: (i) bare, (ii) "graphene-grown" (high-temperature Ar/H2 with CH4 on), (iii) "anneal-only" (high-temperature Ar/H2 with CH4 off), and (iv) graphene oxide spin-coated and reduced on pristine sapphire. GaN selects (103) on graphene-grown and anneal-only m-plane sapphire, selects (100) on bare m-plane sapphire, and is predominantly (100) with a minority (103) on graphene oxide spin-coated and reduced/pristine m-plane sapphire. High-resolution TEM shows that, on partly graphene-covered samples, nucleation occurs on exposed sapphire (thru-hole), not on graphene, providing mechanism evidence independent of orientation. Within this window, the substrate surface state set by high-temperature Ar/H2 pre-treatment (rather than mask continuity) primarily governs orientation, while open-area effects can play a secondary role. Thus, preferred orientation alone may not determine the growth mechanism; mask continuity and substrate pre-treatment must be explicitly controlled when using orientation as evidence for mechanism assignment.</description>

      <title>Full-spectrum modeling of mobile gamma-ray spectrometry systems in scattering media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile gamma-ray spectrometry (MGRS) systems are essential for localizing, identifying, and quantifying gamma-ray sources in complex environments. Full-spectrum template matching offers the highest accuracy and sensitivity for these tasks but is limited by the computational cost of generating the required spectral templates. Here, we present a generalized full-spectrum modeling framework for MGRS systems in scattering media, enabling near-real-time template generation through dynamic, anisotropic instrument response functions. Benchmarked against high-fidelity brute-force Monte Carlo simulations, our method yields a computational speedup by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10^7)$, while achieving comparable accuracy with median spectral deviations below 6%. The methodology presented is platform-agnostic and applicable across marine, terrestrial, and airborne domains, unlocking new capabilities for MGRS in a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, geophysical exploration, nuclear safeguards, and radiological emergency response.</description>

      <title>High-magnitude, spatially programmable, and sustained strain engineering of 2D semiconductors</title>

Abstract: Crystalline two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors often combine high elasticity and in-plane strength, making them ideal for strain-induced tuning of electronic characteristics, akin to strategies used in silicon electronics. However, existing techniques have not achieved strain in 2D materials that is simultaneously high in magnitude (&gt;1%), stable over long periods, and spatially programmable, meaning the strain level can be deterministically engineered across different regions of a single 2D layer. Here, we apply spatially programmable biaxial strain (e_b) up to 2.2% with spatial resolution of 0.13 %e_b um-1 in monolayer MoS2 via conformal transfer onto patterned substrates fabricated using two-photon lithography. The induced strain is stable for months and enables local band gap tuning of ~0.4 eV in monolayer MoS2, ~25% of its intrinsic band gap. We further extend the approach to bilayer WS2-MoS2 heterostructures. This strain-engineering technique introduces a new regime of strain-enabled control in 2D semiconductors to support the development of wide-spectrum optoelectronic devices and nanoelectronics with engineered electronic landscapes.</description>

      <title>3D printed waveguides for optogenetics applications: design optimization and optical characterization</title>

Abstract: Optogenetics has emerged as a powerful tool for disease modeling, enabling precise control of cellular activities through light stimulation and providing a valuable insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Innovative materials and technologies such as micro-LEDs, optical fibers and micro/nano probes have been developed to allow precise spatial and temporal control of light delivery to target cells. Recent advances in 3D printing have further enhanced optogenetic applications by enabling the fabrication of implantable, customizable, and miniaturized light stimulation systems with high spatial resolution. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of a 3D printed light delivery system for brain organoid stimulation exploring the capabilities of projection microstereolithography (P$\mu$SL). We characterized the optical properties of the high-resolution acrylate-based 3D print resin, i.e., refractive index and extinction coefficient, to evaluate if the light transmission efficiency might limit the performance of the optogenetic stimulation systems. Finite element method simulations were employed to optimize the 3D printed design. An optogenetic setup was developed for optimal light delivery, and initial tests with optogenetically modified cells showed light-induced dopamine release with a stimulation efficiency of 2.8\%, confirming the 3D printed waveguide functionality and guiding future optimization. Our results demonstrate that this light stimulation tool offers strong potential for advancing customizable optogenetic applications.</description>

      <title>ASPEN: An Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network for Ginzburg-Landau Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful, mesh-free paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they notoriously struggle with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear systems due to the inherent spectral bias of standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures, which prevents them from adequately representing high-frequency components. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network (ASPEN), a novel architecture designed to overcome this critical limitation. ASPEN integrates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features directly into the network's input stage. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically tune its own spectral basis during training, enabling it to efficiently learn and represent the precise frequency content required by the solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of ASPEN by applying it to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), a canonical and challenging benchmark for nonlinear, stiff spatio-temporal dynamics. Our results show that a standard PINN architecture catastrophically fails on this problem, diverging into non-physical oscillations. In contrast, ASPEN successfully solves the CGLE with exceptional accuracy. The predicted solution is visually indistinguishable from the high-resolution ground truth, achieving a low median physics residual of 5.10 x 10^-3. Furthermore, we validate that ASPEN's solution is not only pointwise accurate but also physically consistent, correctly capturing emergent physical properties, including the rapid free energy relaxation and the long-term stability of the domain wall front. This work demonstrates that by incorporating an adaptive spectral basis, our framework provides a robust and physically-consistent solver for complex dynamical systems where standard PINNs fail, opening new options for machine learning in challenging physical domains.</description>

      <title>Robust AC vector sensing at zero magnetic field with pentacene</title>

Abstract: Quantum sensors based on electronic spins have emerged as powerful probes of microwave-frequency fields. Among other solid-state platforms, spins in molecular crystals offer a range of advantages, from high spin density to functionalization via chemical tunability. Here, we demonstrate microwave vector magnetometry using the photoexcited spin triplet of deuterated pentacene molecules, operating at zero external magnetic field and room temperature. We achieve full three-dimensional microwave field reconstruction by detecting the Rabi frequencies of anisotropic spin-triplet transitions associated with two crystallographic orientations of pentacene in naphthalene crystals. We further introduce a phase alternated protocol that extends the rotating-frame coherence time by an order of magnitude and enables sensitivities of $1~\mu\mathrm{T}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. These results establish pentacene-based molecular spins as a practical and high-performance platform for microwave quantum sensing, and the control techniques are broadly applicable to other molecular and solid-state spin systems.</description>

      <title>An Euler-Lagrangian Multiphysics Coupling Framework for Particle-Laden High-Speed Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06548v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle-laden effects in high-speed flows require a coupled Euler and Lagrangian prediction technique with varying fidelity of thermochemical models, depending on the simulation conditions of interest. This requirement makes the development of a conventional monolithic solver challenging to manage the different fidelity of the thermochemical models within a single computational framework. To address this, the present study proposes a multi-solver framework for the coupled Euler-Lagrangian predictions applicable to various particle-laden high-speed flow conditions. Volumetric and surface couplings are established between a particle solver ORACLE (OpenFOAM-based lagRAngian CoupLEr) and a thermochemical nonequilibrium flow solver based on an adaptable data exchange algorithm. The developed framework is then validated by predicting particle-laden supersonic nozzle flows and aerothermal heating around a hypersonic Martian atmospheric entry capsule. Finally, a quasi-1D approximation is proposed in conjunction with a surrogate method to efficiently and accurately predict particle-laden surface erosion, with quantified parametric uncertainty, for hypersonic aerothermal characterization.</description>

      <title>Design of Microlens Arrays for Thermal Imaging with Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) detectors are widely used for their ability to sense thermal radiation. Recently, a room-temperature infrared detector known as the spintronic Poisson bolometer was introduced. Operating in a probabilistic regime governed by Poissonian counting statistics, it establishes a fundamentally different detection mechanism with the potential to relax conventional sensitivity limits. While offering fast digital readout, its sensitivity is currently limited by a small active area and array fill factor. In this work, we present design guidelines for spherical plano-convex microlens arrays that enhance light collection in spintronic Poisson bolometer arrays. Using FDTD simulations of aluminum oxide microlenses, we analyze focal properties, collection efficiency, and concentration factor in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR). Guided by the simulations, we fabricate a microlens array sample to demonstrate that the chosen geometrical parameters are realistic and compatible with the fabrication process. A radiometric-stochastic model is used to quantify the resulting sensitivity improvements.</description>
