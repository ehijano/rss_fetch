      <title>A proposal to improve the calculation of the disruption index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wu et al. (2019) proposed the disruption index (DI1) as a bibliometric indicator that measures disruptive and consolidating research. Leibel and Bornmann (2024) recently published a literature overview on the disruption index research in Scientometrics. In this letter to the editor, we point out that the method of calculating the DI1 score of a focal paper contains a logical impact measurement error that leads to a meaningful reduction of the score. We explain why this is problematic and propose a correction of the formula.</description>

      <title>Which international co-authorships produce higher quality journal articles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: International collaboration is sometimes encouraged in the belief that it generates higher quality research or is more capable of addressing societal problems. Nevertheless, while there is evidence that the journal articles of international teams tend to be more cited than average, perhaps from increased international audiences, there is no science-wide direct academic evidence of a connection between international collaboration and research quality. This article empirically investigates the connection between international collaboration and research quality for the first time, with 148,977 UK-based journal articles with post publication expert review scores from the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF). Using an ordinal regression model controlling for collaboration, international partners increased the odds of higher quality scores in 27 out of 34 Units of Assessment (UoAs) and all Main Panels. The results therefore give the first large scale evidence of the fields in which international co-authorship for articles is usually apparently beneficial. At the country level, the results suggests that UK collaboration with other high research-expenditure economies generates higher quality research, even when the countries produce lower citation impact journal articles than the United Kingdom. Worryingly, collaborations with lower research-expenditure economies tend to be judged lower quality, possibly through misunderstanding Global South research goals.</description>

      <title>How open are hybrid journals included in transformative agreements?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ongoing controversy surrounding transformative agreements, which aim to transition journal publishing to full open access, highlight the need for large-scale studies assessing the impact of these agreements on hybrid open access. By combining publicly available data from various sources, including cOAlition S Journal Checker, Crossref, and OpenAlex, this study presents a novel approach that analyses over 700 agreements. Results suggest a strong growth in open access between 2018 and 2022 from 4.3% to 15%. During this period, 11,189 hybrid journals provided open access to 742,369 out of 8,146,958 articles, representing a five-year open access proportion of 9.1%. Authors who could make use of transformative agreements at the time of publication contributed 328,957 open access articles. In 2022, 143,615 out of 249,511 open access articles in hybrid journals or 58% were enabled by transformative agreements. This trend was largely driven by the three commercial publishers Elsevier, Springer Nature, and Wiley, but the open access uptake varied substantially across journals, publishers, disciplines, and country affiliations. In particular, the OECD and BRICS areas revealed different publication trends. In conclusion, this study suggests that current levels of implementation of transformative agreements is insufficient to bring about a large-scale transition to full open access.</description>
