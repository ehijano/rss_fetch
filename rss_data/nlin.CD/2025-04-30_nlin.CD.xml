      <title>Chaos and Regularity in an Anisotropic Soft Squircle Billiard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hard-wall billiard is a mathematical model describing the confinement of a free particle that collides specularly and instantaneously with boundaries and discontinuities. Soft billiards are a generalization that includes a smooth boundary whose dynamics are governed by Hamiltonian equations and overcome overly simplistic representations. We study the dynamical features of an anisotropic soft-wall squircle billiard. This curve is a geometric figure that seamlessly blends the angularity of a square with the smooth curves of a circle. We characterize the billiard's emerging trajectories, exhibiting the onset of chaos and its alternation with regularity in the parameter space. We characterize the transition to chaos and the stabilization of the dynamics by revealing the nonlinearity of the parameters (squarness, ellipticity, and hardness) via the computation of Poincar\'e surfaces of section and the Lyapunov exponent across the parameter space. We expect our work to introduce a valuable tool to increase understanding of the onset of chaos in soft billiards.</description>

      <title>Chaos Meets Attention: Transformers for Large-Scale Dynamical Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating long-term trajectories of dissipative chaotic systems autoregressively is a highly challenging task. The inherent positive Lyapunov exponents amplify prediction errors over time. Many chaotic systems possess a crucial property - ergodicity on their attractors, which makes long-term prediction possible. State-of-the-art methods address ergodicity by preserving statistical properties using optimal transport techniques. However, these methods face scalability challenges due to the curse of dimensionality when matching distributions. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a scalable transformer-based framework capable of stably generating long-term high-dimensional and high-resolution chaotic dynamics while preserving ergodicity. Our method is grounded in a physical perspective, revisiting the Von Neumann mean ergodic theorem to ensure the preservation of long-term statistics in the $\mathcal{L}^2$ space. We introduce novel modifications to the attention mechanism, making the transformer architecture well-suited for learning large-scale chaotic systems. Compared to operator-based and transformer-based methods, our model achieves better performances across five metrics, from short-term prediction accuracy to long-term statistics. In addition to our methodological contributions, we introduce a new chaotic system benchmark: a machine learning dataset of 140$k$ snapshots of turbulent channel flow along with various evaluation metrics for both short- and long-term performances, which is well-suited for machine learning research on chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>DICOM Compatible, 3D Multimodality Image Encryption using Hyperchaotic Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image encryption plays an important role in protecting sensitive health information from cyberattacks and unauthorized access. In this paper, we introduce a secure and robust encryption scheme that is multi-modality compatible and works with MRI, CT, X-Ray and Ultrasound images for different anatomical region of interest. The method utilizes hyperchaotic signals and multi-level diffusion methods. The encryption starts by taking DICOM image as input, then padding to increase the image area. Chaotic signals are produced by a logistic map and are used to carry out pixel random permutation. Then, multi-level diffusion is carried out by 4-bit, 8-bit, radial and adjacent diffusion to provide high randomness and immunity against statistical attacks. In addition, we propose a captcha-based authentication scheme to further improve security. An algorithm generates alphanumeric captcha-based image which is encrypted with the same chaotic and diffusion methods as the medical image. Both encrypted images(DICOM image and captcha image) are then superimposed to create a final encrypted output, essentially integrating dual-layer security. Upon decryption, the superimposed image is again decomposed back to original medical and captcha images, and inverse operations are performed to obtain the original unencrypted data. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides strong protection with no loss in image integrity, thereby reducing unauthorized data breaches to a significant level. The dual-encryption approach not only protects the confidentiality of the medical images but also enhances authentication by incorporating captcha.</description>
