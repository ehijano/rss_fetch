      <title>When to Reason: Semantic Router for vLLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial accuracy gains when augmented with reasoning modes such as chain-of-thought and inference-time scaling. However, reasoning also incurs significant costs in inference latency and token usage, with environmental and financial impacts, which are unnecessary for many simple prompts. We present a semantic router that classifies queries based on their reasoning requirements and selectively applies reasoning only when beneficial. Our approach achieves a 10.2 percentage point improvement in accuracy on the MMLU-Pro benchmark while reducing response latency by 47.1% and token consumption by 48.5% compared to direct inference with vLLM. These results demonstrate that semantic routing offers an effective mechanism for striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency in open-source LLM serving systems</description>

      <title>Designing and Evaluating an AI-driven Immersive Multidisciplinary Simulation (AIMS) for Interprofessional Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interprofessional education has long relied on case studies and the use of standardized patients to support teamwork, communication, and related collaborative competencies among healthcare professionals. However, traditional approaches are often limited by cost, scalability, and inability to mimic the dynamic complexity of real-world clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we designed and developed AIMS (AI-Enhanced Immersive Multidisciplinary Simulations), a virtual simulation that integrates a large language model (Gemini-2.5-Flash), a Unity-based virtual environment engine, and a character creation pipeline to support synchronized, multimodal interactions between the user and the virtual patient. AIMS was designed to enhance collaborative clinical reasoning and health promotion competencies among students from pharmacy, medicine, nursing, and social work. A formal usability testing session was conducted which participants assumed professional roles on a healthcare team and engaged in a mix of scripted and unscripted conversations. Participants explored the patient's symptoms, social context, and care needs. Usability issues were identified (e.g., audio routing, response latency) and used to guide subsequent refinements. Findings in general suggest that AIMS supports realistic, profession-specific and contextually appropriate conversations. We discussed both technical and pedagogical innovations of AIMS and concluded with future directions.</description>

      <title>Online Advertising is a Regrettable Necessity: On the Dangers of Pay-Walling the Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00026v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of the web and its benefits can be attributed largely to its open model where anyone with internet connection can access information on the web for free. This has created unprecedented opportunities for various members of society including the most vulnerable, as recognized by organizations such as the UN. This again can be attributed to online advertising, which has been the main financier to the open web. However, recent trends of paywalling information and services on the web are creating imminent dangers to such open model of the web, inhibiting access for the economically vulnerable, and eventually creating digital segregation. In this paper, we argue that this emerging model lacks sustainability, exacerbates digital divide, and might lead to collapse of online advertising. We revisit the ad-supported open web business model and demonstrate how global users actually pay for the ads they see. Using data on GNI (gross national income) per capita and average paywall access costs, we established a simple income-paywall expenditure gap baseline. With this baseline we show that 135 countries with a total population estimate of 6.56 billion people cannot afford a scenario of a fully paywalled web. We further discuss how a mixed model of the so-called "premium services" creates digital segregation and poses danger to online advertising ecosystem. Finally, we call for further research and policy initiatives to keep the web open and more inclusive with a sustainable business model.</description>

      <title>A Semantic Framework for Patient Digital Twins in Chronic Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized chronic care requires the integration of multimodal health data to enable precise, adaptive, and preventive decision-making. Yet most current digital twin (DT) applications remain organ-specific or tied to isolated data types, lacking a unified and privacy-preserving foundation. This paper introduces the Patient Medical Digital Twin (PMDT), an ontology-driven in silico patient framework that integrates physiological, psychosocial, behavioral, and genomic information into a coherent, extensible model. Implemented in OWL 2.0, the PMDT ensures semantic interoperability, supports automated reasoning, and enables reuse across diverse clinical contexts. Its ontology is structured around modular Blueprints (patient, disease and diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, trajectories, safety, pathways, and adverse events), formalized through dedicated conceptual views. These were iteratively refined and validated through expert workshops, questionnaires, and a pilot study in the EU H2020 QUALITOP project with real-world immunotherapy patients. Evaluation confirmed ontology coverage, reasoning correctness, usability, and GDPR compliance. Results demonstrate the PMDT's ability to unify heterogeneous data, operationalize competency questions, and support descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics in a federated, privacy-preserving manner. By bridging gaps in data fragmentation and semantic standardization, the PMDT provides a validated foundation for next-generation digital health ecosystems, transforming chronic care toward proactive, continuously optimized, and equitable management.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Post-Quantum Digital Signature Algorithms on Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computing threatens the security of traditional encryption algorithms, motivating the development of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). In 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardized several PQC algorithms, marking an important milestone in the transition toward quantum-resistant security. Blockchain systems fundamentally rely on cryptographic primitives to guarantee data integrity and transaction authenticity. However, widely used algorithms such as ECDSA, employed in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other networks, are vulnerable to quantum attacks. Although adopting PQC is essential for long-term security, its computational overhead in blockchain environments remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose a methodology for benchmarking both PQC and traditional cryptographic algorithms in blockchain contexts. We measure signature generation and verification times across diverse computational environments and simulate their impact at scale. Our evaluation focuses on PQC digital signature schemes (ML-DSA, Dilithium, Falcon, Mayo, SLH-DSA, SPHINCS+, and Cross) across security levels 1 to 5, comparing them to ECDSA, the current standard in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Our results indicate that PQC algorithms introduce only minor performance overhead at security level 1, while in some scenarios they significantly outperform ECDSA at higher security levels. For instance, ML-DSA achieves a verification time of 0.14 ms on an ARM-based laptop at level 5, compared to 0.88 ms for ECDSA. We also provide an open-source implementation to ensure reproducibility and encourage further research.</description>

      <title>Sequencing on Silicon: AI SoC Design for Mobile Genomics at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Miniature DNA sequencing hardware has begun to succeed in mobile contexts, driving demand for efficient machine learning at the edge. This domain leverages deep learning techniques familiar from speech and time-series analysis for both low-level signal processing and high-level genomic interpretation. Unlike audio, however, nanopore sequencing presents raw data rates over 100X higher, requiring more aggressive compute and memory handling. In this paper, we present a CMOS system-on-chip (SoC) designed for mobile genetic analysis. Our approach combines a multi-core RISC-V processor with tightly coupled accelerators for deep learning and bioinformatics. A hardware/software co-design strategy enables energy-efficient operation across a heterogeneous compute fabric, targeting real-time, on-device genome analysis. This work exemplifies the integration of deep learning, edge computing, and domain-specific hardware to advance next-generation mobile genomics.</description>

      <title>Clustering Deposit and Withdrawal Activity in Tornado Cash: A Cross-Chain Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09433v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tornado Cash is a decentralised mixer that uses cryptographic techniques to sever the on-chain trail between depositors and withdrawers. In practice, however, its anonymity can be undermined by user behaviour and operational quirks. We conduct the first cross-chain empirical study of Tornado Cash activity on Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon, introducing three clustering heuristics-(i) address-reuse, (ii) transactional-linkage, and (iii) a novel first-in-first-out (FIFO) temporal-matching rule. Together, these heuristics reconnect deposits to withdrawals and deanonymise a substantial share of recipients. Our analysis shows that 5.1 - 12.6% of withdrawals can already be traced to their originating deposits through address reuse and transactional linkage heuristics. Adding our novel First-In-First-Out (FIFO) temporal-matching heuristic lifts the linkage rate by a further 15 - 22 percentage points. Statistical tests confirm that these FIFO matches are highly unlikely to occur by chance. Comparable leakage across Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon indicates chain-agnostic user misbehaviour, rather than chain-specific protocol flaws. These results expose how quickly cryptographic guarantees can unravel in everyday use, underscoring the need for both disciplined user behaviour and privacy-aware protocol design. In total, our heuristics link over $2.3 billion in Tornado Cash withdrawals to identifiable deposits, exposing significant cracks in practical anonymity.</description>

      <title>Three Birds with One Stone: Improving Performance, Convergence, and System Throughput with Nest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have the potential to demonstrate quantum utility on near-term quantum computers. However, these algorithms often get executed on the highest-fidelity qubits and computers to achieve the best performance, causing low system throughput. Recent efforts have shown that VQAs can be run on low-fidelity qubits initially and high-fidelity qubits later on to still achieve good performance. We take this effort forward and show that carefully varying the qubit fidelity map of the VQA over its execution using our technique, Nest, does not just (1) improve performance (i.e., help achieve close to optimal results), but also (2) lead to faster convergence. We also use Nest to co-locate multiple VQAs concurrently on the same computer, thus (3) increasing the system throughput, and therefore, balancing and optimizing three conflicting metrics simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Exploring human-SAV interaction using LLMs: The impact of psychological factors on user experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been extensive prior work exploring how psychological factors such as anthropomorphism affect the adoption of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs). However, limited research has been conducted on how prompt strategies in large language models (LLM)-powered conversational SAV agents affect users' perceptions, experiences, and intentions to adopt such technology. In this work, we investigate how conversational SAV agents powered by LLMs drive these psychological factors, such as psychological ownership, the sense of possession a user may come to feel towards an entity or object they may not legally own. We designed four SAV agents with varying levels of anthropomorphic characteristics and psychological ownership triggers. Quantitative measures of psychological ownership, anthropomorphism, quality of service, disclosure tendency, sentiment of SAV responses, and overall acceptance were collected after participants interacted with each SAV. Qualitative feedback was also gathered regarding the experience of psychological ownership during the interactions. The results indicate that an SAV designed to be more anthropomorphic and to induce psychological ownership improved users' perceptions of the SAV's human-like qualities, and its responses were perceived as more positive but also more subjective compared to the control conditions. Qualitative findings support established routes to psychological ownership in the SAV context and suggest that the conversational agent's perceived performance may also influence psychological ownership. Both quantitative and qualitative outcomes highlight the importance of personalization in designing effective SAV interactions. These findings provide practical guidance for designing conversational SAV agents that enhance user experience and adoption.</description>
