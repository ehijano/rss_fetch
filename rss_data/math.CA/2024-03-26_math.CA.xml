      <title>Fractional flow equations. A model for pressure deficit in an oil well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.09068v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel system of flow equations that models the pressure deficit of a reservoir considered as a triple continuous medium formed by the rock matrix, vugular medium and fracture. In non-conventional reservoirs, the velocity of the fluid particles is altered due to physical and chemical phenomena caused by the interaction of the fluid with the medium, this behavior is defined as anomalous. A more exact model can be obtained with the inclusion of the memory formalism concept that can be expressed through the use of fractional derivatives. Using Laplace transform of the Caputo fractional derivative and Bessel functions, a semi-analytical solution is reached in the Laplace space.</description>

      <title>Jacob's ladders, Hardy-Littlewood integral (1918) and new asymptotic functional equations for Euler's Gamma function together with the tenth equivalent of the Fermat-Wiles theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper new $\Gamma$-functional is constructed upon the basis of the set of almost linear increments of the Hardy-Littlewood integral. This functional generates a $\Gamma$-equivalent of the Fermat-Wiles theorem and also new set of factorization formulae for Euler's $\Gamma$-function.</description>

      <title>Functional differential equations driven by c\`adl\`ag rough paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of unique solutions is established for rough differential equations (RDEs) with path-dependent coefficients and driven by c\`adl\`ag rough paths. Moreover, it is shown that the associated solution map, also known as It\^o-Lyons map, is locally Lipschitz continuous. These results are then applied to various classes of rough differential equations, such as controlled RDEs and RDEs with delay, as well as stochastic differential equations with delay. To that end, a joint rough path is constructed for a c\`adl\`ag martingale and its delayed version, that corresponds to stochastic It\^o integration.</description>

      <title>On Littlewood's estimate for the modulus of the zeta function on the critical line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by a result of Soundararajan, assuming the Riemann hypothesis (RH), we prove a new inequality for the logarithm of the modulus of the Riemann zeta-function on the critical line in terms of a Dirichlet polynomial over primes and prime powers. Our proof uses the Guinand-Weil explicit formula in conjunction with extremal one-sided bandlimited approximations for the Poisson kernel. As an application, by carefully estimating the Dirichlet polynomial, we revisit a 100-year-old estimate of Littlewood and give a slight refinement of the sharpest known upper bound (due to Chandee and Soundararajan) for the modulus of the zeta function on the critical line assuming RH, by providing explicit lower-order terms.</description>

      <title>On two-term hypergeometric recursions with free lower parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F(n,k)$ be a hypergeometric function that may be expressed so that $n$ appears within initial arguments of inverted Pochhammer symbols, as in factors of the form $\frac{1}{(n)_{k}}$. Only in exceptional cases is $F(n, k)$ such that Zeilberger's algorithm produces a two-term recursion for $\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} F(n, k)$ obtained via the telescoping of the right-hand side of a difference equation of the form $p_{1}(n) F(n + r, k) + p_{2}(n) F(n, k) = G(n, k+1) - G(n, k)$ for fixed $r \in \mathbb{N}$ and polynomials $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$. Building on the work of Wilf, we apply a series acceleration technique based on two-term hypergeometric recursions derived via Zeilberger's algorithm. Fast converging series previously given by Ramanujan, Guillera, Chu and Zhang, Chu, Lupa\c{s}, and Amdeberhan are special cases of hypergeometric transforms introduced in our article.</description>

      <title>The Hausdorff-integral on h-measure spaces and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are going to widen the scope of the previously defined Hausdorff-integral in two ways. First, in the sense, that we develop the theory of the integral on some naturally generalized measure spaces. Second, we extend it to functions taking values in $[0,+\infty)\times[0,+\infty)$. In all our intentions, we follow the same attitude that we had in our previous investigation, i.e. we work in the realm of Hausdorff dimension and measure.</description>

      <title>On improvements of the Hardy, Copson and Rellich inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a method of factorization and by introducing a generalized discrete Dirichlet's Laplacian matrix $(-\Delta_{\Lambda})$, we establish an extended improved discrete Hardy's inequality and Rellich inequality in one dimension. We prove that the discrete Copson inequality (E.T. Copson, \emph{Notes on a series of positive terms}, J. London Math. Soc., 2 (1927), 9-12.) in one-dimension admits an improvement. We also prove that the improved Copson's weights are optimal (in fact \emph{critical}). It is shown that improvement of the Knopp inequalities (Knopp in J. London Math. Soc. 3(1928), 205-211 and 5(1930), 13-21) lies on improvement of the Rellich inequalities. Further, an improvement of the generalized Hardy's inequality (Hardy in Messanger of Math. 54(1925), 150-156) in a special case is obtained.</description>

      <title>On the pointwise existence of Cauchy $\rm{P.V.}$ integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Riemann-Hilbert (RH) approach, whose origins can be traced back to Riemann's PhD thesis, is well known to be far-reaching. It provides a general framework for expressing solutions of integrable problems such as ODEs or PDEs. Its generalization concerning monodromy groups of Fuchsian systems is one of Hilbert's 23 problems.
  In this paper we extend a basic result in scalar RH theory, the Sokhotski-Plemelj formula. Classically, this formula is derived under assumptions of H\"older continuity, although it also holds true under weaker, Dini, continuity conditions. Dini continuity is still too restrictive. We prove the Sokhotski-Plemelj formula under weaker assumptions, namely continuity at a point and an $L^1$ condition.
  Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of the Cauchy $\rm{P.V.}$ integral which are in a precise sense also necessary: weakening them runs into obstructions of a mathematical foundations nature.</description>
