      <title>Water dissociation and rotational broadening in the atmosphere of KELT-20 b from high-resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present atmospheric retrievals from Keck/KPIC phase II observations of the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-20/MASCARA-2~b. Previous free retrievals of molecular abundances for ultra-hot Jupiters have been impacted by significant model biases due to variations in vertical abundance profiles, which we address by including molecular dissociation into our retrieval framework as an additional free parameter. We measure the abundance of CO ($\rm \log CO_{MMR} = -2.5^{+0.6}_{-0.5}$) and obtain a lower limit on the abundance of H$_2$O ($\rm \log H{_2}O_{MMR} = -1.5^{+0.8}_{-1.0}$, $&gt;-3.0$ at 95\% confidence) in the atmosphere of \keltb. These abundances yield an atmospheric $\rm C/O = 0.1^{+0.4}_{-0.1}$ ($\rm C/O &lt; 0.9$ at 95\% confidence) and suggest a metallicity approximately solar to $10\times$ solar. H$_2$O is dissociated at pressures below $\log P_{\rm H_2O} = -1.2^{+0.5}_{-0.7}$ bar, roughly consistent with predictions from chemical equilibrium models, and suggesting that the retrieved composition is not a result of assumptions about the vertical mixing profiles. We also constrain the rotational velocity of \keltb\ to $v\sin i = 7.5\pm0.7$ \kms, suggesting the presence of a jet comparable to the sound speed in the direction of the planet's rotation, assuming the actual rotation of the planet is tidally locked.</description>

      <title>Mapping the merging zone of late infall in the AB Aur planet-forming system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Late infall events challenge the traditional view that planet formation occurs without external influence. Here we present deep ALMA $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ and SO $J_{N}=5_6-4_5$ observations toward AB Aurigae, a Class II disk system with strong signs of gravitational instability and ongoing planet formation. By applying Keplerian and anti-Keplerian masks, we separate disk-like and non-disk-like motions of $^{12}$CO, considering the two outputs as the 'disk' and 'exo-disk' (out of disk) emission components, respectively. The disk component of $^{12}$CO extends to $\sim 1600$ au in radius and exhibits a stunningly rich architecture of global spiral structure. The exo-disk emission consists predominantly of three spiral structures -- S1, S2 and S3 -- whose projections are co-spatial with the disk. We successfully reproduce their trajectories with a ballistic accretion flow model, finding that S1 and S2 (both redshifted) are infalling toward the disk from in front, and S3 (blueshifted) is infalling from behind. Where the terminal ends of S1 and S2 become indistinguishable from the disk, we observe a brightness peak in SO emission $2.5\times$ the azimuthal average of a background SO ring. This merging zone lies within a relatively confined region $15-100$ degrees east of north, and between $\sim150-300$ au from the star, at scales relevant to where planet candidates have been previously identified. The AB Aur system provides a unified picture of late infall inducing replenishment of the disk, triggering gravitational instability, and modifying the conditions of forming planets.</description>

      <title>Enceladus's Limit Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enceladus exhibits some remarkable phenomena, including water geysers spraying through surface cracks, a global ice shell that is librating atop an ocean, a large luminosity, and rapid outward orbital migration. Here we model the coupled evolution of Enceladus's orbit and interior structure. We find that Enceladus is driven into a periodic state: a limit cycle. Enceladus's observed phenomena emerge from the model, and the predicted values for the orbital eccentricity, libration amplitude, shell thickness, and luminosity agree with observations. A single limit cycle lasts around ten million years, and has three distinct stages: (1) freezing, (2) melting, and (3) resonant libration. Enceladus is currently in the freezing stage, meaning that its ice shell is getting thicker. That pressurizes the ocean, which in turn cracks the shell and pushes water up through the cracks. In this stage the orbital eccentricity increases, as Saturn pushes Enceladus deeper into resonance with Dione. Once the eccentricity is sufficiently high, tidal heating begins to melt the shell, which is the second stage of the cycle. In the third stage the shell remains close to 3km thick. At that thickness the shell's natural libration frequency is resonant with the orbital frequency. The shell's librations are consequently driven to large amplitude, for millions of years. Most of the tidal heating of Enceladus occurs during this stage, and the observed luminosity is a relic from the last episode of resonant libration.</description>

      <title>Enceladus's Tidal Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saturn raises a time-dependent tide on its small moon Enceladus, due to the eccentricity of the orbit. As shown in a companion paper (Goldreich et al.), the resulting tidal heating drives Enceladus into a limit cycle, in which its eccentricity and shell thickness vary in tandem, on a timescale of ~ 10 Myr. The limit cycle explains a variety of observed phenomena on Enceladus, including its large luminosity and cracked ice shell. Here we derive the tidal heating rate needed for that study, starting from a simple first-principles derivation of Enceladus's tidal response. Enceladus is comprised of three layers: a rocky core, an outer ice shell, and an ocean sandwiched in between. Tides force the shell to librate and distort, which generates heat. We calculate the libration amplitude and tidal heating rate by minimizing the sum of elastic and gravitational energies. The final expressions are analytic, and account for the finite hardness of the shell, and for resonant libration. Although we specialize to Enceladus, our approach may be extended to other bodies that have a similar three layer structure, such as Europa and Titan.</description>

      <title>The stochastic nature of migration of disc instability protoplanets in three-dimensional hydrodynamical and MHD simulations of fragmenting discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the nature of migration of protoplanetary clumps formed via disc instability in self-consistent 3D hydrodynamical (HD) and magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of self-gravitating discs. Motivated by the complex structure of protoplanetary clumps we do not introduce sink particles. We find that the orbital evolution of the clumps has a stochastic character but also exhibits recurrent properties over many orbits. Clump migration is governed by two sources of gravitational torques: a torque originating from a region about twice the Hill sphere around each clump's orbit, and the torque resulting from clump-clump interactions. Compared to non-magnetized companion runs, the latter are more frequent in MHD simulations, which give rise to more numerous clumps starting off at smaller masses, often below a Neptune mass. Clump-clump interactions can lead to temporary strong accelerations of migration in both directions, but integrated over time provide a lesser impact than disc-driven torques. They can also lead to clump mergers but do not cause ejections; a difference to previous works which adopted sink particles. The local "Hill torque" is responsible for the fast migration, inward or outward. Estimating the characteristic timescales of conventional migration in our regime, we find that the disc-driven migration timescales are in agreement with Type III migration. However, the dominant local torque is rapidly fluctuating, which reflects the turbulent nature of the flow. The resulting stochastic migration pattern is markedly different from Type III runaway migration and appears to be a distinctive feature of orbital dynamics in a fragmenting disc.</description>

      <title>Global Hall-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of transition disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Transition disks (TDs) are a type of protoplanetary disk characterized by a central dust and gas cavity. The processes behind how these cavities are formed and maintained, along with their observed high accretion rates of $10^{-8} -10^{-7} \, M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, continue to be subjects of active research. Aims. This work aims to investigate how the inclusion of the Hall effect (HE) alongside Ohmic resistivity (OR) and ambipolar diffusion (AD) affects the structure of the TD. Of key interest is the dynamical evolution of the cavity and whether it can indeed produce transonic accretion, as predicted by theoretical models in order to account for the observed high accretion rates despite the inner disk's low density. Methods. We present our results of 2D axisymmetric global radiation magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of TDs for which all three non-ideal MHD effects are accounted. We used the NIRVANA-III fluid code and initialized our model with a disk cavity reaching up to $R=8~\mathrm{au}$ with a density contrast of $10^5$. We performed three runs, one with only OR and AD, and one for each of the two configurations that arise when additionally including the HE, that is, with the field aligned (anti-aligned) with respect to the rotation axis. Results. For all three runs, our models maintain an intact inner cavity and an outer standard disk. MHD winds are launched both from the cavity and from the disk. Notably, when the HE is included, ring-like structures develop within the cavity. We moreover obtain accretion rates of $3 - 8 \times 10^{-8} \, M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, comparable to typical values seen in full disks. Importantly, we clearly observe transonic accretion ($v_{\mathrm{acc}} \gtrsim c_{s}$) in the cavity. Additionally, outward magnetic flux transport occurs in all three runs.</description>

      <title>Convective Overstability in Radially Global Protoplanetary Disks. II. Impact on planetesimal formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Convective Overstability (COS) is a hydrodynamic instability occurring in protoplanetary disk (PPD) regions with an adverse radial entropy gradient. It is a potential driver of turbulence and may influence planetesimal formation. In this second paper of our series, we study the effects of the COS on dust dynamics in radially global PPD simulations, focusing on the mid-plane region, where vertical gravity on the dust is included.
  Axisymmetric 2D simulations show susceptibility to both the COS and the Vertically Shearing Streaming Instability. For a Stokes number tau = 0.1, strong dust clumping occurs only for highly super-solar initial metallicities Z greater than 0.05.
  In 3D non-axisymmetric simulations, the COS generates large-scale, long-lived vortices that have the potential to efficiently concentrate dust, with dust accumulation strengthening as tau increases. For tau = 0.01, no strong clumping occurs even at metallicities as high as Z = 0.1, and vortices remain robust and long-lived. At tau = 0.04, strong dust clumping is observed for solar metallicity (Z = 0.01) and higher. For tau = 0.1, clumping occurs even at strongly sub-solar metallicities (Z greater or equal to 0.004), peaking at Z approximately 0.01 to 0.03, including solar values. Under these conditions, vortices weaken significantly and become more spatially extended. At higher metallicities (Z greater or equal to 0.04) with tau = 0.1, large-scale vortex formation is suppressed, leading to nearly axisymmetric dust rings, which can still undergo clumping via the classical Streaming Instability.</description>

      <title>Re-recognized universality of Kozai oscillation on three-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1962, Yoshihide Kozai reported his findings on the secular dynamics of asteroids moving in orbits with high inclination and eccentricity. In contrast to the classic understanding of the stability of planetary motion in the solar system, Kozai showed that asteroids can significantly change their orbital shape over a long timescale in an oscillatory manner between nearly circular orbits and highly elliptic orbits. An anti-correlated variation between orbital inclination and eccentricity characterizes this oscillation. The importance of Kozai's work in understanding the dynamical evolution of various systems was recognized decades later, including the fields of irregular satellites of planets, Oort Cloud, extrasolar planets, binary star systems, type Ia supernovae, planet climate, merging black hole systems, and so on.</description>

      <title>Extension of the creep tide theory to exoplanet systems with high stellar obliquity. The dynamic tide of CoRoT-3b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the creep tide theory to exoplanetary systems with significant obliquities. The extended theory allows us to obtain the stellar and planetary hydrodynamic equilibrium tides and the evolution of the rotational state of the bodies. The dynamic ellipsoidal figure of equilibrium of the body is calculated taking into account that its reaction to external forces is delayed by its viscosity. The derived equations are used to determine the motion of the tidal bulge of the planetary companion CoRoT-3b (a brown dwarf) and its host star. We show how the tides deform the figure of the companion and how its tidal bulge moves close to the substellar meridian from one hemisphere to another. The stellar lag is mostly positive and is braking the star's rotation.</description>

      <title>Activity of comet 7P/Pons-Winnecke during the 2021 apparition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comet 7P/Pons-Winnecke was observed from the Calar Alto Observatory (Spain) for four months during the 2021 inbound apparition. Broad-band visible images were taken between 1.71 and 1.25 AU pre-perihelion, while long-slit spectrophotometric data were taken at $\sim$ 1.25 AU pre-perihelion. This dataset has been complemented with three $r$-Sloan images observed from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to model the physical properties and loss rate of the dust with a forward Monte Carlo dust tail code. The model fits the observed isophotes well for most observations. The peak dust production rate was measured at 83 kg s$^{-1}$, 15 days after perihelion. The particle terminal speed ranges from 3 m s$^{-1}$ for 0.1 m particles to 23 m s$^{-1}$ for 5 $\mu$m particles. Regarding the gas production from spectra, CN and C$_2$ show asymmetric emission between the sunward and antisunward directions beyond the data uncertainties and error propagation, while a clear asymmetry for C$_3$ cannot be definitively claimed. Average production rates for CN, C$_2$, and C$_3$ near 2021 perihelion are 1.15 $\times 10^{24}$, 2.32$\times 10^{24}$, and 1.69$\times 10^{23}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. The dust-to-gas mass ratio value is estimated to be around 2, suggesting a dust-rich composition. Based on the gas composition and the $Af\rho$ value, we classify 7P/Pons-Winnecke as having a typical composition for Jupiter Family comets, with some C$_3$ depletion. Given the limited previous knowledge, our work contributes to expanding the understanding of the activity and characteristics of 7P/Pons-Winnecke.</description>

      <title>No Robust Statistical Evidence for a Population of Water Worlds in a 2025 Sample of Planets Orbiting M Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of exoplanets has led to many surprises, one of which is the discovery of planets larger than Earth yet smaller than Neptune, super Earths and gas dwarfs. No such planet is a member of the Solar System, yet they appear to be abundant in the local neighbourhood. Their internal structure is not well understood. Super Earths presumably are rocky planets with a thin secondary atmosphere, whereas gas dwarfs have a substantial (by volume) primary H/He atmosphere. However, conflicting evidence exists regarding the presence of a third class of planets, so-called water worlds, which are hypothesised to contain a significant mass fraction of water in condensed or steam form. This study examines the evidence for water worlds and presents a sample of 60 precisely measured small exoplanets (less than 4 Earth radii) orbiting M dwarf stars. We combine observational data and unsupervised machine-learning techniques to classify these planets based on their mass, radius, and density. We individually model the interior of each planet using the ExoMDN code and classify them into populations based on these models. Our findings indicate that the sample divides into two distinct planet populations, with no clear evidence supporting the existence of water worlds in the current dataset.</description>

      <title>An Extremely Deep Rubin Survey to Explore the Extended Kuiper Belt and Identify Objects Observable by New Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proposed Vera C. Rubin Observatory Deep Drilling micro-survey of the Kuiper Belt will investigate key properties of the distant solar system. Utilizing 30 hours of Rubin time across six 5-hour visits over one year starting in summer 2026, the survey aims to discover and determine orbits for up to 730 Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) to an $r$-magnitude of 27.5. These discoveries will enable precise characterization of the KBO size distribution, which is critical for understanding planetesimal formation.
  By aligning the survey field with NASA's {\it New Horizons} spacecraft trajectory, the micro-survey will facilitate discoveries for the mission operating in the Kuiper Belt. Modeling based on the Outer Solar System Origin Survey (OSSOS) predicts at least 12 distant KBOs observable with the {\it New Horizons} LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) and approximately three objects within 1~au of the spacecraft, allowing higher-resolution observations than Earth-based facilities. LORRI's high solar phase angle monitoring will reveal these objects' surface properties and shapes, potentially identifying contact binaries and orbit-class surface correlations. The survey could identify a KBO suitable for a future spacecraft flyby.
  The survey's size, depth, and cadence design will deliver transformative measurements of the Kuiper Belt's size distribution and rotational properties across distance, size, and orbital class. Additionally, the high stellar density in the survey field also offers synergies with transiting exoplanet studies.</description>

      <title>Forming Mercury by a grazing giant collision involving similar mass bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of Mercury still remains poorly understood compared to the other rocky planets of the Solar System. One of the most relevant constraints that any formation model has to fulfill refers to its internal structure, with a predominant iron core covered by a thin silicate layer. This led to the idea that it could be the product of a mantle stripping caused by a giant impact. Previous studies in this line focused on binary collisions involving bodies of very different masses. However, such collisions are actually rare in N-body simulations of terrestrial planet formation, whereas collisions involving similar mass bodies appear to be more frequent. Here, we perform smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations to investigate the conditions under which collisions of similar mass bodies are able to form a Mercury-like planet. Our results show that such collisions can fulfill the necessary constraints in terms of mass (0.055 $M_\oplus$) and composition (30/70 silicate-to-iron mass ratio) within less than 5%, as long as the impact angles and velocities are properly adjusted according to well established scaling laws.</description>

      <title>The Diversity of Cold Worlds: a blended-light binary straddling the T/Y transition in brown dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02025</link>

Abstract: We present the first brown dwarf spectral binary characterized with JWST: WISE J014656.66+423410.0, the coldest blended-light brown dwarf binary straddling the T/Y transition. We obtained a moderate resolution (R$\sim$2700) G395H spectrum of this unresolved binary with JWST/NIRSpec and we fit it to late-T and Y dwarf spectra from JWST/NIRSpec, and model spectra of comparable temperatures, both as individual spectra and pairs mimicking an unresolved binary system. We find that this tightly-separated binary is likely composed of two unequal-brightness sources with a magnitude difference of $0.50\pm0.08$ mag in IRAC [4.5] and a secondary $1.01\pm0.13$ mag redder than the primary in [3.6]-[4.5]. Despite the large color difference between the best fit primary and secondary, their temperature difference is only $92\pm23$\,K, a feature reminiscing of the L/T transition. Carbon disequilibrium chemistry strongly shapes the mid-infrared spectra of these sources, as a complex function of metallicity and surface gravity. While a larger library of JWST/NIRSpec spectra is needed to conclusively examine the peculiarities of blended-light sources, this spectral binary is a crucial pathfinder to both understand the spectral features of planetary-mass atmospheres and detect binarity in unresolved, moderate-resolution spectra of the coldest brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The effect of spectroscopic binning on atmospheric retrievals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the JWST offering higher resolution data in space-based transmission spectroscopy, understanding the capabilities of our current atmospheric retrieval pipelines is essential. These new data cover wider wavelength ranges and at much higher spectral resolution than previous instruments have been able to offer. Therefore, it is often appealing to bin spectra to fewer points, better constrained in their transit depth, before using them as inputs for atmospheric retrievals. As such, we produce a simulation replicating the observations of WASP-39b by the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument on board JWST using the PRISM dispersion element. Then, we assess the accuracy and consistency of retrievals while varying both the resolution and the average photometric error of this simulated spectrum. We repeat this analysis on three different simulation setups where each includes an opaque cloud layer at a different height in the atmosphere. In agreement with previous studies, we find that a much greater resolution is needed in the case of a high cloud deck since features are already heavily muted by the presence of the clouds. In the other two cases, there are large 'safe zones' in the parameter space where accurate estimations are made. If these maps can be generalized, they could be used to inform future observations on how long to observe a given target in order to achieve the most accurate retrieval results. We also find that the resolution required to fully resolve the degeneracies between the parameters contributing to the spectra is much greater than that needed to constrain the marginalized posterior distributions for each parameter individually.</description>

      <title>Strong clumping in global streaming instability simulations with a dusty fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: How planets form in protoplanetary disks and what drives the formation of their seeds is still a major unknown. It is an accepted theory that multiple processes can trap dusty material in radially narrow rings or vortex-like structures, preventing the dust from drifting inwards. However, the relevant process for clumping this dusty material until it collapses under gravity still needs to be identified. One promising candidate is the streaming instability arising from the aerodynamic interaction between dust and gas once they reach similar densities. Aims: We investigate with a global disk model based on recent observational constraints if streaming instability can form dust clumps, which might gravitationally collapse. Further, our goal is to verify the observability of the produced structures using ALMA or ngVLA. Methods. For the first time, we present global 2D (R, z) hydrodynamic simulations using FARGO3D in which the dust is treated as a pressureless fluid. The disk model assumes stratification, realistic boundary conditions, and meaningful resolution to resolve the fast-growing modes. We choose two values for the total dust-to-gas mass ratio Z = 0.01 and Z = 0.02, compare the maximum clump density to the local Hill density, and compute the optical depth of the dust disk. Results: With a dust-to-gas mass ratio of Z = 0.01, we confirm previous streaming instability simulations, not showing the ability to form strong concentrations of dust clumps. With Z = 0.02, dense clumps form within 20 orbits, however reaching only 30% of the Hill density even following disk parameters from the massive protoplanetary disks GM Aur, HD163296, IM Lup, MWC 480, and TW Hya, which all share astonishingly similar surface density profiles.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Bouncing Barrier with Collision Simulations of Compressed Dust Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collision outcomes of dust aggregates in protoplanetary disks dictate how planetesimals form. Experimental and numerical studies have suggested that bouncing collisions occurring at low impact velocities may limit aggregate growth in the disks, but the conditions under which bouncing occurs have yet to be fully understood. In this study, we perform a suite of collision simulations of moderately compact dust aggregates with various impact velocities, aggregate radii, and filling factors ranging between 0.4 and 0.5. Unlike previous simulations, we generate compact aggregates by compressing more porous ones, mimicking the natural processes through which compact aggregates form. We find that the compressed aggregates bounce above a threshold mass, which decreases with impact velocity. The threshold mass scales with impact velocity as the $-4/3$ power, consistent with the findings of previous experiments. We also find that the threshold aggregate mass for bouncing depends strongly on filling factor, likely reflecting the strong filling-factor dependence of the compressive strength of compressed aggregates. Our energy analysis reveals that nearly 90\% of the initial impact energy is dissipated during the initial compression phase, and over 70\% of the remaining energy is dissipated during the subsequent stretching phase, regardless of whether the collision results in sticking or bouncing. Our results indicate that dust aggregates with a filling factor of 0.4 cease to grow beyond 100 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ as a result of the bouncing barrier.</description>
