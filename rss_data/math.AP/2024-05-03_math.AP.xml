      <title>Local and Global Log-Gradient estimates of solutions to $\Delta_pv+bv^q+cv^r =0$ on manifolds and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the Nash-Moser iteration technique to study local and global properties of positive solutions to the equation $$\Delta_pv+bv^q+cv^r =0$$ on complete Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded from below, where $b, c\in\mathbb R$, $p&gt;1$, and $q\leq r$ are some real constants. Assuming certain conditions on $b,\, c,\, p,\, q$ and $r$, we derive succinct Cheng-Yau type gradient estimates for positive solutions, which is of sharp form. These gradient estimates allow us to obtain some Liouville-type theorems and Harnack inequalities. Our Liouville-type results are novel even in Euclidean spaces. Based on the local gradient estimates and a trick of Sung and Wang, we also obtain the global gradient estimates for such solutions. As applications we show the uniqueness of positive solutions to some generalized Allen-Cahn equation and Fisher-KPP equation.</description>

      <title>Some inequalities related to Riesz transform on exterior Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\ge2$ and $\mathcal{L}=-\mathrm{div}(A\nabla\cdot)$ be an elliptic operator on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Given an exterior Lipschitz domain $\Omega$, let $\mathcal{L}_D$ and $\mathcal{L}_N$ be the elliptic operators $\mathcal{L}$ on $\Omega$ subject to the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary {conditions}, respectively. For the Neumann operator, we show that the reverse inequality $\|\mathcal{L}_N^{1/2}f\|_{L^p(\Omega)} \le C\|\nabla f\|_{L^p(\Omega)}$ holds true for any $p\in(1,\infty)$. For the Dirichlet operator, it was known that the Riesz operator $\nabla \mathcal{L}_D^{-1/2}$ is not bounded for $p&gt;2$ and $p\ge n$, even if $\mathcal{L}=-\Delta$ being the Laplace operator. Suppose that $A$ are CMO coefficients or VMO coefficients satisfying certain perturbation property, and $\partial\Omega$ is $C^1$, we prove that for $p&gt;2$ and $p\in [n,\infty)$, it holds $$ \inf_{\phi\in\mathcal{A}^p_0(\Omega)}\left\|\nabla f-\nabla\phi\right\|_{L^p(\Omega)}\le C\left\|\mathcal{L}^{1/2}_D f\right\|_{L^p(\Omega)} $$ for $f\in \dot{W}^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$. Here $\mathcal{A}^p_0(\Omega)=\{f\in \dot{W}^{1,p}_0(\Omega):\,\mathcal{L}_Df=0\}$ is a non-trivial subspace generated by harmonic function in $\Omega$ with zero boundary value.</description>

      <title>Two-step minimization approach to an $L^\infty$-constrained variational problem with a generalized potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variational problem on $H^1({\mathbb R})$ under an $L^\infty$-constraint related to Sobolev-type inequalities for a class of generalized potentials, including $L^p$-potentials, non-positive potentials, and signed Radon measures. We establish various essential tools for this variational problem, including the decomposition principle, the comparison principle, and the perturbation theorem, those are the basis of the two-step minimization method. As for their applications, we present precise results for minimizers of minimization problems, such as the study of potentials of Dirac's delta measure type and the analysis of trapped modes in potential wells.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the $L^p-L^q$ $(1&lt;p\leqslant 2\leqslant q&lt;+\infty)$ norm estimates for the solutions of heat and wave type equations on a locally compact separable unimodular group $G$ by using an integro-differential operator in time and any positive left invariant operator (maybe unbounded) on $G$. We complement our studies by giving asymptotic time estimates for the solutions, which in some cases are sharp.</description>

      <title>Exterior stability of Minkowski spacetime with borderline decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1993, the global stability of Minkowski spacetime has been proven in the celebrated work of Christodoulou and Klainerman \cite{Ch-Kl}. In 2003, Klainerman and Nicol\`o \cite{Kl-Ni} revisited Minkowski stability in the exterior of an outgoing null cone. In \cite{Shen23}, the author extended the results of \cite{Ch-Kl} to minimal decay assumptions. In this paper, we prove that the exterior stability of Minkowski holds with decay which is borderline compared to the minimal decay considered in \cite{Shen23}.</description>

      <title>Note about the existence and essential uniqueness of quadrature domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note is intended to explain the proof of two facts about quadrature domains: first, they are essentially unique if they exist; and second, they do exist for a large class of weight functions. The proofs roughly follow Sakai's "Solutions to the obstacle problem as Green potentials," but are presented at an easier level.</description>

      <title>Higher-order asymptotic profiles of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the convection-diffusion equation with variable diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the convection-diffusion equation: \[ \partial_t u - \mathrm{div}\left(a(x)\nabla u\right) = d\cdot\nabla \left(\left\lvert u\right\rvert ^{q-1}u\right), \ \ x \in \mathbb{R}^n, \ t&gt;0 \] with an integrable initial data $u_{0}(x)$, where $n\ge1$, $q&gt;1+\frac{1}{n}$ and $d\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Moreover, we take $a(x)=1+b(x)&gt;0$, where $b(x)$ is smooth and decays fast enough at spatial infinity. It is known that the asymptotic profile of the solution to this problem can be given by the heat kernel. Moreover, the second asymptotic profile of the solution have already been studied. In particular, the following three cases are distinguished: $1+\frac{1}{n}&lt;q&lt;1+\frac{2}{n}$; $q=1+\frac{2}{n}$; $q&gt;1+\frac{2}{n}$. More precisely, the second asymptotic profile has different properties in each of these three cases. In this paper, we focus on the critical case of $q=1+\frac{2}{n}$. By analyzing the corresponding integral equation in details, we have succeeded to give the more higher-order asymptotic expansion of the solution, which generalizes the previous works.</description>

      <title>Existence of normalized solutions of a Hartree-Fock system with mass subcritical growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with normalized solutions in $H_{r}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{3}) \times H_{r}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{3})$ for Hartree-Fock type systems with the form \be\lab{ Hartree-Fock} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} -\Delta u +\alpha \phi _{u,v} u=\lambda _{1} u+\left | u \right | ^{2q-2} u+\beta \left | v \right | ^{q} \left | u \right | ^{q-2} u , \\ -\Delta v +\alpha \phi _{u,v} v=\lambda _{2} v+\left | v\right | ^{2q-2} v+\beta \left | u \right | ^{q} \left | v \right | ^{q-2} v , \\ \int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}}\left | u \right | ^{2} {\rm d}x=a_{1} , \quad \int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}}\left | v \right | ^{2} {\rm d}x=a_{2} , \nonumber\\ \end{array} where $$ \phi_{u, v}\left(x\right):=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}} \frac{u^{2}(y)+v^{2}(y)}{|x-y|} {\rm d}y \in D^{1,2}\left(\mathbb{R}^{3}\right). $$ Here $\alpha,\beta&gt;0, a_1,a_2&gt;0$ and $1&lt;q&lt;\frac{5}{3}$. By seeking the constrained global minimizers of the corresponding functional, we prove that the existence of normalized solutions to the system above for any $a_1,a_2&gt;0$ when $1&lt;q&lt;\frac{4}{3}$ and for $a_1,a_2&gt;0$ small when $\frac{4}{3}\le q &lt; \frac{3}{2}$. The nonexistence of normalized solutions is also considered for $\frac{3}{2}\le q &lt; \frac{5}{3}$. Also, the orbital stability of standing waves is obtained under local well-posedness assumptions of the evolution problem.</description>

      <title>Evolution of multiple closed knotted curves in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a system of geometric evolution equations describing a curvature and torsion driven motion of a family of 3D curves in the normal and binormal directions. We explore the direct Lagrangian approach for treating the geometric flow of such interacting curves. Using the abstract theory of nonlinear analytic semi-flows, we are able to prove local existence, uniqueness, and continuation of classical H\"older smooth solutions to the governing system of non-linear parabolic equations modelling $n$ evolving curves with mutual nonlocal interactions. We present several computational studies of the flow that combine the normal or binormal velocity and considering nonlocal interaction.</description>

      <title>Dynamics for a diffusive epidemic model with a free boundary: spreading-vanishing dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper involves a diffusive epidemic model whose domain has one free boundary with the Stefan boundary condition, and one fixed boundary subject to the usual homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann condition. By using the standard upper and lower solutions method and the regularity theory, we first study some related steady state problems which help us obtain the exact longtime behaviors of solution component $(u,v)$. Then we prove there exists the unique classical solution whose longtime behaviors are governed by a spreading-vanishing dichotomy. Lastly, the criteria determining when spreading or vanishing happens are given with respect to the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$, the initial habitat $[0,h_0]$, the expanding rates $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ as well as the initial function $(u_0,v_0)$. The criteria reveal the effect of the cooperative behaviors of agents and humans on spreading and vanishing.</description>

      <title>On the semi-additivity of the $1/2$-symmetric caloric capacity in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study properties of a variant of the $1/2$-caloric capacity, called $1/2$-symmetric caloric capacity. The latter is associated simultaneously with the $1/2$-fractional heat equation and its conjugate. We establish its semi-additivity in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and, moreover, we compute explicitly the $1/2$-symmetric caloric capacity of rectangles, which illustrates its anisotropic behaviour.</description>

      <title>On the Cauchy problem for the fractional Keller-Segel system in variable Lebesgue spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are mainly concerned with the well-posed problem of the fractional Keller--Segel system in the framework of variable Lebesgue spaces. Based on carefully examining the algebraical structure of the system, we reduced the fractional Keller--Segel system into the generalized nonlinear heat equation to overcome the difficulties caused by the boundedness of the Riesz potential in a variable Lebesgue spaces, then by mixing some structural properties of the variable Lebesgue spaces with the optimal decay estimates of the fractional heat kernel, we were able to establish two well-posedness results of the fractional Keller--Segel system in this functional setting.</description>

      <title>On well/ill-posedness for the generalized surface quasi-geostrophic equations in H\"older spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the well/ill-posedness theories for the inviscid $\alpha$-surface quasi-geostrophic ($\alpha$-SQG) equations in H\"older spaces, where $\alpha = 0$ and $\alpha = 1$ correspond to the two-dimensional Euler equation in the vorticity formulation and SQG equation of geophysical significance, respectively. We first prove the local-in-time well-posedness of $\alpha$-SQG equations in $C([0,T);C^{0,\beta}(\mathbb{R}^2))$ with $\beta \in (\alpha,1)$ for some $T&gt;0$. We then analyze the strong ill-posedness in $C^{0,\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ constructing smooth solutions to the $\alpha$-SQG equations that exhibit $C^{0,\alpha}$--norm growth in a short time. In particular, we develop the nonexistence theory for $\alpha$-SQG equations in $C^{0,\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^2)$.</description>

By choosing a class of new and special initial data, we can transform this d-dimensional Euler-Poincar\'{e} equations into the Camassa-Holm type equation in the real line. We first obtain some global existence results and then present a new blow-up result to the system under some different assumptions on this special class of initial data.</description>

      <title>On small-amplitude asymmetric water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the method used by M{\ae}hlen &amp; Seth [17] used to prove the existence of small-amplitude asymmetric solutions to the capillary-gravity Whiham equation, so that it can be applied directly to a class of similar equations. The purpose is to prove or disprove the existence of asymmetric waves for the water wave problem or other model equations for water waves. Our main result in this paper is a theorem that gives both necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of small-amplitude periodic asymmetry solutions for this class of equations. The result is then applied to an infinite depth capillary-gravity Whitham equation and an infinite depth capillary-gravity Babenko equation to show the nonexistence of small-amplitude waves for these equations. This example also highlights the similarities between these equations suggesting the potential existence of small-amplitude asymmetric waves for the finite depth capillary-gravity Babenko equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the periodic homogenization problem of state-constraint Hamilton--Jacobi equations on perforated domains in the convex setting and obtain the optimal convergence rate. We then consider a dilute situation in which the holes' diameter is much smaller than the microscopic scale. Finally, a homogenization problem with domain defects where some holes are missing is analyzed.</description>

Abstract: Sharp lower and upper uniform estimates are obtained for fundamental frequencies of $p$-Laplace type operators generated by quadratic forms. Optimal constants are exhibited, rigidity of the upper estimate is proved, anisotropic attainability of the lower estimate is derived as well as characterization of anisotropic extremizers for circular and rectangular membranes. Sharp quantitative anisotropic inequalities associated with lower constants are also established, providing as a by-product information on anisotropic stability. When the uniform ellipticity condition is relaxed, we show that the optimal lower constant remains positive, while anisotropic extremizers no longer exist. Our sharp lower estimate can be viewed as an isoanisotropic counterpart of the Faber-Krahn isoperimetric inequality in the plane.</description>

      <title>An interacting particle consensus method for constrained global optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a particle-based optimization method designed for addressing minimization problems with equality constraints, particularly in cases where the loss function exhibits non-differentiability or non-convexity. The proposed method combines components from consensus-based optimization algorithm with a newly introduced forcing term directed at the constraint set. A rigorous mean-field limit of the particle system is derived, and the convergence of the mean-field limit to the constrained minimizer is established. Additionally, we introduce a stable discretized algorithm and conduct various numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an $I$-family of ancient graphical mean curvature flows over a minimal hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ of finite total curvature with the Morse index $I$ by establishing exponentially fast convergence in terms of $|x|^2-t$. As a corollary, we show that these ancient flows have finite total curvature and finite mass drop. Moreover, one family of these flows is mean convex by a pointwise estimate.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph $p$-Laplacian regularization on point clouds for data interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a generalization of graphs, hypergraphs are widely used to model higher-order relations in data. This paper explores the benefit of the hypergraph structure for the interpolation of point cloud data that contain no explicit structural information. We define the $\varepsilon_n$-ball hypergraph and the $k_n$-nearest neighbor hypergraph on a point cloud and study the $p$-Laplacian regularization on the hypergraphs. We prove the variational consistency between the hypergraph $p$-Laplacian regularization and the continuum $p$-Laplacian regularization in a semisupervised setting when the number of points $n$ goes to infinity while the number of labeled points remains fixed. A key improvement compared to the graph case is that the results rely on weaker assumptions on the upper bound of $\varepsilon_n$ and $k_n$. To solve the convex but non-differentiable large-scale optimization problem, we utilize the stochastic primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm. Numerical experiments on data interpolation verify that the hypergraph $p$-Laplacian regularization outperforms the graph $p$-Laplacian regularization in preventing the development of spikes at the labeled points.</description>

      <title>On Young regimes for locally monotone SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following SPDE on a Gelfand-triple $(V, H, V^*)$: $$
  du(t)=A(t,u(t))dt+dI_t(u), \qquad u(0)=u_0\in H. $$
  Given certain local monotonicity, continuity, coercivity and growth conditions of the operator $A:[0, T]\times V\to V^*$ and a sufficiently regular operator $I$ we establish global existence of weak solutions.
  In analogy to the Young regime for SDEs, no probabilistic structure is required in our analysis, which is based on a careful combination of monotone operator theory and the recently developed Besov rough analysis by Friz and Seeger. Due to the abstract nature of our approach, it applies to various examples of monotone and locally monotone operators $A$, such as the $p$-Laplace operator, the porous medium operator, and an operator that arises in the context of shear-thickening fluids; and operators $I$, including additive Young drivers $I_t(u) = Z_t-Z_0$, abstract Young integrals $I_t(u) = \int_0^t \sigma(u_s)d X_s$, and translated integrals $I_t(u) = \int_0^t b(u_s - w_s)ds$ that arise in the context of regularization by noise. In each of the latter cases, we identify corresponding noise regimes (i.e. Young regimes) that assure our abstract result to be applicable. In the case of additive drivers, we identify the Brownian setting as borderline, i.e. noises which enjoy slightly more temporal regularity are amenable to our completely pathwise analysis.</description>

Abstract: We examine the validity of the kinetic description of wave turbulence for a model quadratic equation. We focus on the space-inhomogeneous case, which had not been treated earlier; the space-homogeneous case is a simple variant. We determine nonlinearities for which the kinetic description holds, or might fail, up to an arbitrarily small polynomial loss of the kinetic time scale. More precisely, we focus on the convergence of the Dyson series, which is an expansion of the solution in terms of the random data.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem for a time-dependent Convection-diffusion equation in admissible geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.08780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a partial data inverse problem for a time-dependent convection-diffusion equation on an admissible manifold. We prove that the time-dependent convection term and time-dependent density can be recovered uniquely modulo a known gauge invariance. There have been several works on inverse problems related to the steady state convection-diffusion operator in Euclidean as well as in Riemannian geometry settings; however, inverse problems related to time-dependent convection-diffusion equation on a manifold are not studied in the prior works, which is the main aim of this paper. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, the problem studied here is the first work related to a partial data inverse problem for recovering both first and zeroth-order time-dependent perturbations of evolution equations in the Riemannian geometry setting.</description>

Abstract: Results concerning the existence and spectral stability and instability of multiple periodic wave solutions for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger system with \textit{dnoidal} and \textit{cnoidal} profile will be determined in this manuscript. The spectral analysis for the corresponding linearized operator is established by using the comparison theorem and tools of Floquet theory. The main results are determined by applying the spectral stability theory in \cite{KapitulaKevrekidisSandstedeI} and \cite{KapitulaKevrekidisSandstedeII} via Krein signature.</description>

Abstract: In this article we show that the fractional Laplacian in $R^{2}$ can be factored into a product of the divergence operator, a Riesz potential operator, and the gradient operator. Using this factored form we introduce a generalization of the fractional Laplacian, involving a matrix $K(x)$, suitable when the fractional Laplacian is applied in a non homogeneous medium. For the case of $K(x)$ a constant, symmetric positive definite matrix we show that the fractional Poisson equation is well posed, and determine the regularity of the solution in terms of the regularity of the right hand side function.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the generalized Zakharov-Kuznetsov-Burgers equation in 2D. This is one of the nonlinear dispersive-dissipative equations, which has a spatial anisotropic dissipative term $-\mu u_{xx}$. In this paper, we prove that the solution to this problem decays at the rate of $t^{-\frac{3}{4}}$ in the $L^{\infty}$-sense, provided that the initial data $u_{0}(x, y)$ satisfies $u_{0}\in L^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ and some appropriate regularity assumptions. Moreover, we investigate the more detailed large time behavior and obtain a lower bound of the $L^{\infty}$-norm of the solution. As a result, we prove that the given decay rate $t^{-\frac{3}{4}}$ of the solution to be optimal. Furthermore, combining the techniques used for the parabolic equations and for the Schr$\ddot{\mathrm{o}}$dinger equation, we derive the explicit asymptotic profile for the solution.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with the mathematical analysis and numerical simulation of a new nonlinear ablation system modeling radiofrequency ablation phenomena in cardiac tissue and takes into account the phenomena of viscous energy dissipation and electric field. The model consists of a coupled thermistor and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations that describe the evolution of temperature, velocity and potential in cardiac tissue. Based on Schauder's fixed-point theory, we establish the global existence of the solution in two- and three-dimensional space. Moreover, we prove the uniqueness of the solution under some additional conditions on the data and the solution. Finally, we discuss some numerical results for the validation of the proposed model using the finite element method.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an extended variational framework for nonlinear SPDEs with unbounded noise, defining three different solution types of increasing strength along with criteria to establish their existence. The three notions can be understood as probabilistically and analytically weak, probabilistically strong and analytically weak, as well as probabilistically and analytically strong. Our framework facilitates several well-posedness results for the Navier-Stokes Equation with transport noise, equipped with the no-slip and Navier boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a nonlinear reaction-diffusion-fluid system that simulates radiofrequency ablation within cardiac tissue. The model conveys the dynamic evolution of temperature and electric potential in both the fluid and solid regions, along with the evolution of velocity within the solid region. By formulating the system that describes the phenomena across the entire domain, encompassing both solid and fluid phases, we proceed to an analysis of well-posedness, considering a broad class of right-hand side terms. The system involves parameters such as heat conductivity, kinematic viscosity, and electrical conductivity, all of which exhibit nonlinearity contingent upon the temperature variable. The mathematical analysis extends to establishing the existence of a global solution, employing the Faedo-Galerkin method in a three-dimensional space. To enhance the practical applicability of our theoretical results, we complement our study with a series of numerical experiments. We implement the discrete system using the finite element method for spatial discretization and an Euler scheme for temporal discretization. Nonlinear parameters are linearized through decoupling systems, as introduced in our continuous analysis. These experiments are conducted to demonstrate and validate the theoretical findings we have established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sobolev mappings exhibiting only pointwise quasiregularity-type bounds have arisen in various applications, leading to a recently developed theory of quasiregular values. In this article, we show that by using rescaling, one obtains a direct bridge between this theory and the classical theory of quasiregular maps. More precisely, we prove that a non-constant mapping $f \colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^n$ with a $(K, \Sigma)$-quasiregular value at $f(x_0)$ can be rescaled at $x_0$ to a non-constant $K$-quasiregular mapping. Our proof of this fact involves establishing a quasiregular values -version of the linear distortion bound of quasiregular mappings. A quasiregular values variant of the small $K$ -theorem is obtained as an immediate corollary of our main result.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we provide convergence rates for a finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative Lipschitz noise and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions (SHE). More precisely, we give an error estimate for the $L^2$-norm of the space-time discretization of SHE by a semi-implicit Euler scheme with respect to time and a TPFA scheme with respect to space and the variational solution of SHE. The only regularity assumptions additionally needed is spatial regularity of the initial datum and smoothness of the diffusive term.</description>
