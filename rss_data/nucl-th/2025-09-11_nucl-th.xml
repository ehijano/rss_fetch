      <title>Wave-Breaking Phenomena in Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the onset of wave-breaking in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in heavy-ion collisions at both RHIC and the LHC. A nonlinear longitudinal color field is coupled to a three-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic background constrained by experimental conditions: Pb-Pb at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV (LHC) and Au-Au at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV (RHIC). The instantaneous wave-breaking threshold is determined from the in-medium plasma frequency, while the field evolution follows a nonlinear Landau equation with Debye screening and expansion damping. At the LHC, the higher initial temperature and density drive the system above the threshold within $\tau \lesssim $ 2.3 fm/$c$, whereas at RHIC the cooler and more dilute medium delays wave-breaking to $\tau \simeq 2.8$~fm/$c$. Scans over initial temperature, density, thermalization time, QGP lifetime, and collision system (RHIC vs LHC) confirm the robustness of this instability against parameter variations. These results identify wave-breaking as a universal microscopic mechanism for the early loss of coherence and rapid onset of hydrodynamics in the QGP, providing a common explanation for the fast equilibration observed at both RHIC and the LHC.</description>

      <title>The IBM Description of the B(E2) Anomaly: Dynamical Triaxiality and Configuration Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical investigation has been carried out to examine the effects of dynamical triaxility and configuration mixing on the $B(E2)$ anomaly, characterized by $B_{4/2}=B(E2;4_1^+\rightarrow2_1^+)/B(E2;2_1^+\rightarrow0_1^+)&lt;1.0$ and $R_{4/2}=E(4_1^+)/E(2_1^+)\geq2.0$, within the framework of the interacting boson model (IBM). The results indicate that the effective $\gamma$ deformation may undergo substantial changes with increasing angular momentum in the $B(E2)$ anomaly system governed by an IBM Hamiltonian involving rotor-like terms. Further calculations reveal that mixing between normal and intruder states may facilitate the emergence of $B(E2)$ anomaly, thereby providing additional theoretical insights into this unusual phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Triaxial rotor modes in finite-N boson systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algebraic approach to elucidate the dynamic characteristics of triaxial rotor modes in nuclei by mapping a triaxial rotor Hamiltonian to the interacting boson model (IBM) one within a finite-$N$ framework. Our method unveils striking features not observed in conventional modes, exemplified by the $B(E2)$ anomaly, characterized by $B(E2;4_1--2_1^+)/B(E2;2_1--0_1^+)&lt;&lt;1$. Using specific examples, we demonstrate that the peculiar properties of low-lying states in both neutron-rich and neutron-deficient Os nuclei can be comprehensively understood through the proposed Hamiltonian, which incorporates both rigid and soft triaxial rotor modes. This algebraic method not only offers fresh insights into triaxial dynamics but also showcases its capability in uncovering emergent exotic collective modes in nuclear structure.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Mass Predictions Using a Neural Network with Additive Gaussian Process Regression-Optimized Activation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear masses are machine-learned as a function of proton and neutron numbers.
  The neural network with additive Gaussian process regression-optimized activation functions (GPR-NN) method is employed for the first time for this purpose.
  GPR-NN combines the advantages of both neural networks and Gaussian process regression, in that it possesses the expressive power of an NN, in principle allowing modeling any kind of dependence of nuclear mass on the features, and robustness of a linear regression with respect to overfitting.
  A study of the GPR-NN approach for interpolation and extrapolation in nuclear mass predictions is presented.
  It is found that the optimal hyperparameters for the GPR-NN approach in interpolation and extrapolation are different.
  If an appropriate set of hyperparameters is adopted, the GPR-NN approach can achieve good extrapolation performance for nuclear mass prediction, which could potentially help improve the mass predictions of a large number of currently experimentally unknown nuclei.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive view of nuclear shapes, rotations and vibrations from fully quantum mechanical perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear quadrupole collective states at low excitation energies are described in a novel, fully quantum mechanical and systematic manner as compared to traditional pictures initiated by Aage Bohr. The ellipsoidal shapes are shown to be triaxial in virtually all strongly deformed nuclei, in contrast to the Ansatz of axially symmetric shapes. The rotational bands of such triaxially deformed nuclei are described in a fully quantum mechanical way, i. e., without resorting to quantized free rotation of rigid body. The excitation energies within a rotational band, exhibiting the $J(J+1)$ dependence on angular momentum $J$, are shown to basically represent the change of binding energies due to nuclear forces. This differs from the interpretation \'a la Aage Bohr as rotational kinetic energies. The $K$ quantum numbers are shown to be practically conserved for triaxial ellipsoids, which turned out to be a real but positive surprise to many people in the field. The so-called $\gamma$ bands are shown to be $K$=2$^+$ rotations rather than $\gamma$-vibrations, leading to a nice description of the so-called $\gamma\gamma$ 4$^+$ state as a $K$=4$^+$ rotation. Vibrational modes are also shown to emerge in this study. Thus, the whole picture of low-energy quadrupole collective motion of heavy nuclei has been renewed in a fully quantum mechanical fashion, which differs from the traditional picture but appears to be simpler and more natural.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first $\textit{ab initio}$ lattice calculations of the proton-rich tin isotopes $^{99}$Sn to $^{102}$Sn using nuclear lattice effective field theory with high-fidelity two- and three-nucleon forces. For a given set of three-nucleon couplings, we reproduce binding energies with $\sim 1\%$ accuracy for the even-even systems, and obtain energy splitting and two-nucleon separation energies in agreement with experiment. Our results confirm the $N=50$ shell closure and reveal that the binding energy of $^{99}$Sn lies below values extrapolated from heavier isotopes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce NuLattice, a Python software package for ab initio computations of atomic nuclei on lattices. The computational tools consist of Hartree Fock, the coupled cluster method, the in-medium similarity renormalization group, and full configuration interaction. At present, the employed interactions are from pion-less effective field theory at leading order and consist of two-body and three-body contacts. We present results for light nuclei $^{2}$H, $^{3,4}$He, $^{8}$Be, $^{12}$C, and $^{16}$O. NuLattice algorithms exploit the sparsity and locality of lattice interactions, and as a result computations can be run on laptops.</description>

      <title>Two-particle two-hole excitations in semi-inclusive neutrino-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A calculation of the two-particle two-hole contribution to the semi-inclusive $(\nu_\mu,\mu^-N)$ cross section on carbon is performed in the framework of the relativistic Fermi gas model. The process is driven by meson-exchange currents encompassing all contributions involving the exchange of a single pion and the excitation of a $\Delta$ resonance. The calculation is validated against the inclusive $(\nu_\mu,\mu^-)$ response functions already existing in the literature, and then extended for the first time to the semi-inclusive channel. Results are presented both at fixed neutrino energy and folded with the T2K neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>GUMP1.0 -- First global extraction of generalized parton distributions from experiment and lattice data with NLO accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first global extraction of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), GUMP1.0, by combining deeply virtual Compton scattering and $\rho$-meson production data from Jefferson Lab and Hadron-Electron Ring Accelerator with global fits of parton distribution functions, charge form factors, and lattice quantum chromodynamics simulations. Using a conformal moment space parametrization, we achieve a unified description across low- and high-$x$ regions at next to leading order (NLO) accuracy in perturbative corrections. The results provide state-of-the-art GPDs consistent with almost all known facts, enabling three-dimensional nucleon imaging in impact parameter space and, at the same time, establishing a benchmark for future theoretical and experimental studies of the nucleon structure.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Jet-Induced Medium Response with Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark-gluon plasma (QGP), when viewed at length scales of order the inverse of its temperature, behaves as a strongly-coupled liquid. However, when it is probed with sufficiently high momentum transfer, asymptotic freedom mandates the presence of quark- and gluon-like quasi-particles. High energy partons within jets can trigger these high-momentum exchanges, making jets valuable probes for revealing the presence of such quasi-particles. Such elastic scatterings are implemented in the Hybrid Model, where a jet parton that scatters is deflected, kicking a medium parton, which recoils. Before and after a scattering, as one and then both partons propagate through the medium, they lose energy and momentum, exciting wakes in the QGP droplet. We use two-point and three-point energy-energy correlators (EECs) to reveal the relevant angular regions at which (modified) parton showers and wakes in the QGP each dominate, offering a new way with which to visualize and constrain the corresponding dynamics. We compare our calculations to recent CMS and ALICE measurements of two-point EECs of charged-particle tracks in jets produced in PbPb collisions. We show that our calculations are closest to the experimental measurements when elastic scattering is included and when the elastically scattered recoil-partons produce their own wakes. We also propose a new variant of the measurement that is especially sensitive to jet wakes.</description>

      <title>$T \times \mu$ phase diagram from a fractal NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a $\mu$-dependent coupling for a fractal effective model (FNJL) to make the results for the phase diagram compatible with the experimental data and lattice QCD calculations. The $\mu$-dependence of the coupling, which accounts for gluon effects, is obtained by fitting the lattice QCD results for the pseudo-critical temperature with the fractal model. We then use the new effective coupling in order to compute the dynamical mass, the quark condensate, the thermal susceptibility and, finally, the $T\times\mu$ phase diagram. We consider both extensive and non-extensive statistics, and with a slight variation in the $\mu$-dependent coupling parameters we provide a single result for our model which is able to describe incredibly well the data from STAR, considering the simplicity of the effective model.</description>

Abstract: We provide a modern pedagogical introduction to light mesons. We discuss their masses and widths, their classification into multiplets of isospin and flavor SU(3), as well as other quantum numbers, mixing schemes, observable states, and their disposition in Regge trajectories. We briefly introduce the relevant concepts of Quantum Chromodynamics, including confinement, chiral symmetry, and the relationship between poles and resonances. We discuss their interpretation in terms of quark-model ordinary quark-antiquark states or non-ordinary states like exotics, multiquarks, or glueballs. Finally, we comment on the open issues that are still under discussion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlocality in microscopic optical potentials derived from chiral effective field theory. For this purpose we employ the Perey-Buck ansatz, which connects the energy dependence of purely local optical potentials to a Gaussian spatial nonlocality. We find that the dominant source of energy dependence in the microscopic real optical potential indeed arises from spatial nonlocalities, while the energy dependence associated with the microscopic imaginary optical potential is a genuine time nonlocality. We present results for nonlocal nucleon-nucleus optical potentials for the calcium isotopic chain and study the dependence of the Woods-Saxon shape parameters on the isotopic number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute radiative corrections to the superallowed $\beta$ decay of $^{10}{\rm C}$ in an effective field theory approach using nuclear matrix elements obtained from quantum Monte Carlo calculations. These corrections are an important ingredient in the extraction of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Masakawa quark mixing matrix element $V_{ud}$, and the role of this work is to illuminate the uncertainties arising from nuclear structure. Our results provide good agreement with both the traditional extraction of $V_{ud}$, as well as with a more recent evaluation performed using the no-core shell model and a dispersion formalism. The dominant uncertainty in this approach is the presence of two unknown low-energy constants that enter into the relevant nuclear matrix elements. Future determinations of these low-energy constants -- either from QCD or modeling them with two nucleon amplitudes -- would improve the precision of the extraction in this formalism.</description>

      <title>Decay behavior of hidden-strange hadronic molecular state $N(2270)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we systematically discuss the decay patterns of the hidden-strange hadronic molecular state $N(2270)$ which is assumed as an S-wave $K^\ast\Sigma^\ast$ shallow bound state with its possible quantum numbers $J^P$ which are ${1/2}^-$, ${3/2}^-$ and ${5/2}^-$. By using the effective Lagrangian approach and considering pseudo-scalar meson and vector meson exchanges, we have thoroughly calculated and discussed the decay behavior of the $N(2270)$ molecular state, including hadronic and radiative decay and the cutoff dependence, for different $J^P$ values. For all three cases, $K^\ast \Lambda$, $K^\ast \Sigma$, and $\rho N$ final states are always included as the main decay channels. However, the $K \Lambda$, $\pi N$ and $\pi \Delta$ final states exhibit notable differences. These different decay properties will provide valuable guidance for future experimental searches and aid in distinguishing different $J^P$ assumptions and understanding their internal structures.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Quadrupole Deformation using E$2$ and M$1+$E$2$ Transitions in Heavy Isotopes in the Mass Range of $150&lt;A&lt;250$</title>

Abstract: The measurement of a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) in atoms is crucial for understanding the origins of CP-violation. However, accurate interpretation of the EDM in systems involving deformed isotopes requires the characterization of their deformation. While nuclear deformation is indicated in various structure models, there is substantial mutual disagreement between the theoretical models or between theoretical models and experimental values.
  Nuclear E$2$ transitions allow access to quantify quadrupole deformation, but these transitions are often mixed with M$1$ transitions. Both E$2$ and M$1$ transitions are well characterized by Weisskopf estimates, which rely on a single-particle approximation, but deviate due to collective nuclear deformations. Previously, Weisskopf estimates were only available for the mass range $A&lt;150$, and in this work we have extended the Weisskopf estimates of both E$2$ and M$1$ transition lifetimes to the mass range of $150\le A\le 250$.
  We comprehensively studied the deviation of E$2$ and M$1+$E$2$ transition lifetimes from the newly established Weisskopf estimates in $91$ candidate isotopes, by comparing the transition lifetimes of the candidate isotopes to their nearest even-even counterparts, whose E$2$ transition strengths are very well understood. Estimates of collective nuclear quadrupole deformation in $67$ of these isotopes were thus obtained, either from E$2$ or M$1+$E$2$ transition lifetimes. In $32$ cases they were obtained from both types of transitions independently, and are mutually consistent, as well as following the trends established in theory. We thereby identify the isotopes $^{223,225}$Fr, $^{221,223}$Ra, $^{223,225,227}$Ac and $^{229}$Pa, where EDM measurements are foreseen and information on nuclear deformation is needed, for which no measurement of nuclear quadrupole deformation has been made.</description>

      <title>Star Log-extended eMulation: a method for efficient computation of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We emulate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, including tidal deformability, for neutron stars using a new method based upon the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). This method, which we call Star Log-extended eMulation (SLM), utilizes the underlying logarithmic behavior of the differential equations to enable accurate emulation of the nonlinear system. We show predictions for well-known equations of state (EOSs) with fixed parameters using the SLM, accurately recreating high-fidelity results while achieving a computational speed-up of $\approx 2.4 \times 10^4$. We test our parametric SLM method for a two-parameter quarkyonic EOS against high-fidelity RK4 TOV calculations and find a computational speedup of $\approx 7.0 \times 10^4$. Hence, SLM is an efficient emulator for the numerous TOV evaluations required by multi-messenger astrophysical frameworks that infer constraints on the EOS. The ability of the SLM algorithm to learn a mapping between parameters of the EOS and subsequent neutron star properties also opens up potential extensions for assisting in computationally prohibitive uncertainty quantification (UQ) for any type of EOS. The source code for the methods employed in this work is openly available in a public GitHub repository for community modification and use.</description>

      <title>Statistical complexity as a probe of mass and phase structure in compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive and systematic study of the statistical complexity, originally introduced by L\'opez-Ruiz, Mancini, and Calbet [Phys. Lett. A 209, 321-326 (1995)], across a broad range of compact star models. We explore how complexity correlates not only with macroscopic observables such as mass and radius, but also with the microscopic characteristics of the underlying equation of state. By incorporating both realistic equations of state and analytical solutions to Einstein's field equations, we demonstrate that gravitational mass plays a dominant role in determining the behavior of complexity. Furthermore, we show that strong phase transitions within the stellar interior, such as those hypothesized in hybrid stars, can manifest as distinct features in the complexity profile, offering a potential informational signature of such transitions. This work offers new insights into the link between information theory and compact object physics, highlighting complexity's potential as a diagnostic tool in astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Freezeout at constant energy density and spin polarization in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the local equilibrium density operator, we develop a geometry-informed linear response theory that takes into account the parameterization of the freezeout hypersurface before the gradient expansion is carried out. Assuming local equilibrium on an iso-energy density hypersurface, we study the $\Lambda$ hyperon spin polarization, and compute corrections to the isothermal case due to finite density. We argue that corrections to isothermal freezeout should be small, and that even in heavy ion collisions with energy as low as $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 11.5$ GeV they constitute at most a $10\%$ effect. They may, however, become relevant for local polarization observables.</description>
