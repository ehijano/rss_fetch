      <title>Largeness and generalized t-henselianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a countable field. Then $K$ is large in the sense of Pop if and only if it admits a field topology which is "generalized t-henselian" (gt-henselian) in the sense of Dittmann, Walsberg, and Ye, meaning that the implicit function theorem holds for polynomials. Moreover, the \'etale open topology can be characterized in terms of the gt-henselian topologies on $K$: a subset $U \subseteq K^n$ is open in the \'etale open topology if and only if it is open with respect to every gt-henselian topology on $K$.</description>

      <title>Infinite convex geometries with lower semi-modularity and join semi-distributivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following article treats about convex geometries which are lower semi-modular and join semi-distributive lattices. Firstly, it is shown that there is a class $K$ of infinite convex geometries which can be build out of finite ones by using the construction of a union of a chain. Then it is shown that elements of $K$ preserve lower semi-modularity and join semi-distributivity which are not default properties in the infinite setting. It is also discussed that not all of the infinite convex geometries may be obtained by the means of the union of a chain.</description>

      <title>Existential completions and Herbrand's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Abbadini and Guffanti gave an algebraic proof of Herbrand's theorem using a completion for Lawvere doctrines that freely adds existential and universal quantifiers. A more direct argument can be given by only completing with respect to existential quantifiers. We construct the free existential completion on a presheaf of distributive lattices, and deduce Herbrand's theorem for coherent logic from the explicit description. We also discuss the cases involving presheaves of meet-semilattices, due to Trotta, and presheaves of frames.</description>

      <title>Ramsey-like theorems and immunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Ramsey-like theorem is a statement of the form ``For every 2-coloring of $[\mathbb{N}]^2$, there exists an infinite set~$H \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that $[H]^2$ avoids some pattern''. We prove that none of these statements are computably trivial, by constructing a computable 2-coloring of $[\mathbb{N}]^2$ such that every infinite set avoiding any pattern computes a diagonally non-computable function relative to $\emptyset'$. We also consider multiple notions of weaknesses based of variants of immunity, and characterize the Ramsey-like theorems which preserve these notions or not, based on the shape of the avoided pattern. This is part of a larger study of the reverse mathematics of Ramsey-like theorems.</description>

      <title>The Derivative of a Constructible Function is Constructible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of constructible functions in the setting of tame real geometry has been introduced by Cluckers and Dan Miller in their work on parametric integration of globally subanalytic functions. A function on a globally subanalytic set is called constructible if it is a finite sum of finite products of globally subanalytic functions and the logarithm of positive globally subanalytic functions. We show that the class of constructible functions is stable under taking derivatives.</description>

      <title>Isometry groups of Polish ultrametric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve a long-standing open problem, formulated by Krasner in the 1950's, in the context of Polish (i.e. separable complete) ultrametric spaces by providing a characterization of their isometry groups using suitable forms of generalized wreath products of full permutation groups. Since our solution is developed in the finer context of topological (Polish) groups, it also solves a problem of Gao and Kechris from 2003. Furthermore, we provide an exact correspondence between the isometry groups of Polish ultrametric spaces belonging to some natural subclasses and various kinds of generalized wreath products proposed in the literature by Hall, Holland, and Malicki.</description>

      <title>Continuous and algebraic domains in univalent foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06956v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of continuous and algebraic domains in constructive and predicative univalent foundations, building upon our earlier work on basic domain theory in this setting. That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. To deal with size issues and give a predicatively suitable definition of continuity of a dcpo, we follow Johnstone and Joyal's work on continuous categories. Adhering to the univalent perspective, we explicitly distinguish between data and property. To ensure that being continuous is a property of a dcpo, we turn to the propositional truncation, although we explain that some care is needed to avoid needing the axiom of choice. We also adapt the notion of a domain-theoretic basis to the predicative setting by imposing suitable smallness conditions, analogous to the categorical concept of an accessible category. All our running examples of continuous dcpos are then actually examples of dcpos with small bases which we show to be well behaved predicatively. In particular, such dcpos are exactly those presented by small ideals. As an application of the theory, we show that Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus is an example of an algebraic dcpo with a small basis. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</description>
