      <title>Bending Mechanics of Biomimetic Scale Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the fundamentals of nonlinear and anisotropic bending behavior of biomimetic scale plates using a combination of analytical modeling, finite element (FE) computations, and motivational experiments. The analytical architecture-property relationships are derived for both synclastic and anticlastic curvatures. The results show that, as the scales engage, both synclastic and anticlastic deformations show non-linear scale contact kinematics and cross-curvature sensitivity of moments resulting in strong curvature-dependent elastic nonlinearity and emergent anisotropy. The anisotropy of bending rigidities and their evolution with curvature are affected by both the direction and magnitude of bending as well as scale geometry parameters, and their distribution on the substrate. Like earlier beam-like substrates, kinematic locked states were found to occur; however, their existence and evolution are also strongly determined by scale geometry and imposed cross-curvatures. This validated model helps us to quantify bending response, locking behavior, and their geometric dependence, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the nature of nonlinearity and anisotropy of these systems.</description>

      <title>EXCOGITO, an extensible coarse-graining toolbox for the investigation of biomolecules by means of low-resolution representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) models proved to be essential to complement and sometimes even replace all-atom representations of soft matter systems and biological macromolecules. The development of low-resolution models takes the moves from the reduction of the degrees of freedom employed, that is, the definition of a mapping between a system's high-resolution description and its simplified counterpart. Even in absence of an explicit parametrisation and simulation of a CG model, the observation of the atomistic system in simpler terms can be informative: this idea is leveraged by the mapping entropy, a measure of the information loss inherent to the process of coarsening. Mapping entropy lies at the heart of the extensible coarse-graining toolbox, or EXCOGITO, developed to perform a number of operations and analyses on molecular systems pivoting around the properties of mappings. EXCOGITO can process an all-atom trajectory to compute the mapping entropy, identify the mapping that minimizes it, and establish quantitative relations between a low-resolution representation and geometrical, structural, and energetic features of the system. Here, the software, which is available free of charge under an open source licence, is presented and showcased to introduce potential users to its capabilities and usage.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of gapped shear waves and liquid-like to gas-like dynamical crossover in active granular matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike crystalline solids, liquids do not exhibit long-range order. Their atoms undergo frequent structural rearrangements, resulting in the long-wavelength dynamics of shear fluctuations in liquids being diffusive, rather than propagating waves, as observed in crystals. When considering shorter time and length scales, molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical propositions suggest that collective shear excitations in liquids display a gap in wave-vector space, referred to as the $k$-gap. Above this gap, solid-like transverse waves re-emerge. However, direct experimental verification of this phenomenon in classical liquids remains elusive, with the only documented evidence from studies in two-dimensional dusty plasmas. Active granular systems provide a novel platform for exploring the emergence of collective dynamics and showcasing a rich interplay of complex phases and phenomena. Our study focuses on bi-disperse active Brownian vibrators. Through measurements of the pair correlation functions, mean square displacements, velocity auto-correlation functions, vibrational density of states, and a detailed analysis of microscopic atomic motion, we demonstrate that this active system exhibits both gas-like and liquid-like phases, depending on the packing fraction, despite pure hard-disk-like repulsive interactions. Notably, within the granular liquid-like phase, we experimentally validate the existence of a $k$-gap in the dispersion of transverse excitations. This gap becomes more significant with a decrease in packing fraction and disappears into the gas phase, aligning with theoretical expectations. Our results offer a direct experimental confirmation of the $k$-gap phenomenon, extending its relevance beyond classical thermal liquids to active granular systems, and reveal the existence of intriguing similarities between the physics of active granular matter and supercritical fluids.</description>

      <title>Influence of cholesterol on hydrogen-bond dynamics of water molecules in lipid-bilayer systems at varying temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cholesterol (Chol) plays a crucial role in shaping the intricate physicochemical attributes of biomembranes, exerting considerable influence on water molecules proximal to the membrane interface. In this study, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations on the bilayers of two lipid species, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and palmitoyl sphingomyelin (PSM); they are distinct with respect to the structures of the hydrogen-bond (H-bond) acceptors. Our investigation focuses on the dynamic properties and H-bonds of water molecules in the lipid-membrane systems, with particular emphasis on the influence of Chol at varying temperatures. Notably, in the gel phase at 303 K, the presence of Chol extends the lifetimes of H-bonds of the oxygen atoms acting as H-bond acceptors within DPPC with water molecules by a factor of 1.5 to 2.5. In the liquid-crystalline phase at 323 K, on the other hand, H-bonding dynamics with lipid membranes remain largely unaffected by Chol. This observed shift in H-bonding states serves as a crucial key to unraveling the subtle control mechanisms governing water dynamics in lipid-membrane systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic flexoelectric instabilities in nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-hydrodynamic phenomena in liquid crystals constitute an old but still very active research area. The reason is that these phenomena play the key role in various applications of liquid crystals and due to the general interest of physical community to out-of-equilibrium systems. Nematic liquid crystals (NLCs) are ideally representative for such investigations. Our article aims to study theoretically the linear NLCs dynamics. We include into consideration orientation elastic energy, hydrodynamic motion, external alternating electric field, electric conductivity and flexoelectric polarization. We analyze the linear stability of the NLC film, determining dynamics of perturbations with respect to the homogeneous initial state of the NLC. For the purpose we compute eigen-values of the evolution matrix for a period of the external alternating electric field. These eigen-values determine the amplification factors for the modes during the period. The instability occurs when the principal eigen-value of the evolution matrix becomes unity by its absolute value. The condition determines the threshold (critical field) for the instability of the uniform state. It turns out that one might expect various types of the instability, only partially known and investigated in the literature. Particularly, we find that the flexoelectric instability may lead to two-dimensionally space modulated patterns exhibiting time oscillations. This type of the structures was somehow overlooked in the previous works.</description>

      <title>Structural investigation of the liquid crystalline phases of three homologues from the series of 4-pentylphenyl-4'-n-alkyloxythiobenzoates (n = 9, 10, 11)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarizing optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry are used to determine the phase sequence of three liquid crystalline 4-pentylphenyl-4'-n-alkyloxythiobenzoates with n = 9, 10, 11. The X-ray diffraction method is applied for structural characterization of the liquid crystalline phases. The smectic layer spacing, tilt angle, average distance between the long axes of molecules and correlation length of the short-range order are determined as a function of temperature. For the crystal-like smectic phases with hexagonal or herring-bone packing, the unit cell parameters are obtained. The presence of the tilted hexagonal phase for n = 10, 11 and tilted herring-bone phase for n = 9, 10 is indicated, although the direction of the tilt cannot be determined.</description>

      <title>Modelling of initially stressed solids: structure of the energy density in the incompressible limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the modelling of elastic bodies, particularly when the relaxed configuration is unknown or non-existent. We adopt the theory of initially stressed materials, incorporating the deformation gradient and stress state of the reference configuration (initial stress tensor) into the response function. We show that for the theory to be applicable, the response function of the relaxed material is invertible up to an element of the material symmetry group. Additionally, we establish that commonly imposed constitutive restrictions, namely the initial stress compatibility condition and initial stress reference independence, naturally arise when assuming an initial stress generated solely from elastic distortion. The paper delves into modelling aspects concerning incompressible materials, showcasing the expressibility of strain energy density as a function of the deviatoric part of the initial stress tensor and the isochoric part of the deformation gradient. This not only reduces the number of independent invariants in the energy functional, but also enhances numerical robustness in finite element simulations. The findings of this research hold significant implications for modelling materials with initial stress, extending potential applications to areas such as mechanobiology, soft robotics, and 4D printing.</description>

      <title>How motility drives the glassy dynamics in confluent epithelial monolayers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wounds heal, embryos develop, cancer spreads, or asthma progresses, the cellular monolayer undergoes a glass transition from a solid-like jammed to a fluid-like flowing state. Two primary characteristics of these systems, confluency, and self-propulsion, make them distinct from particulate systems. Are the glassy dynamics in these biological systems and equilibrium particulate systems different? Despite the biological significance of glassiness in these systems, no analytical framework, which is indispensable for deeper insights, exists. Here, we extend one of the most popular theories of equilibrium glasses, the random first-order transition (RFOT) theory, for confluent systems with self-propulsion. One crucial result of this work is that, unlike in particulate systems, the confluency affects the effective persistence time-scale of the active force, described by its rotational diffusion $D_r^{\text{eff}}$. Unlike in particulate systems, this value differs from the bare rotational diffusion of the active propulsion force due to cell shape dynamics which acts to rectify the force dynamics: $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ is equal to $D_r$ when $D_r$ is small, and saturates when $D_r$ is large. We present simulation results for the glassy dynamics in active confluent models and find that the results are consistent with existing experimental data, and conform remarkably well with our theory. In addition, we show that the theoretical predictions agree nicely with and explain previously published simulation results. Our analytical theory provides a foundation for rationalizing and a quantitative understanding of various glassy characteristics of these biological systems.</description>

      <title>Criticality in an imidazolium ionic liquid fully wetting a sapphire support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypothesis: Ionic liquids have various applications in catalytic reaction environments. In those systems, their interaction with interfaces is key to their performance as a liquid phase. We hypothesize that the way a monolayer ionic liquid phase interacts with interfaces like a sapphire substrate is significantly dependent on temperature and that critical behavior can be observed in the structural properties of the liquid film.
  Methods and simulations: We perform molecular dynamics simulations of imidazolium-based ionic liquid monolayers deposited on a sapphire substrate at temperatures from 200K to 400K. We develop computational tools to analyze structural properties of molecular arrangement in the monolayer, the structure of the film and the defects spontaneously forming and healing.
  Findings: We observe a clear structural phase transition at around 300K from a solid-like to a liquid-like behavior of a film. Below the critical point an alternating crystalline structure of cations and anions with alignment of periodic vectors with the underlying substrate grid is observed, with frozen defects. Above the critical temperature, the pattern becomes isotropic within the contact layer that displays dynamic defects of a characteristic size. Our results highlight the importance of confinement to the phase behavior of the system.</description>

      <title>Evidence of robust, universal conformal invariance in living biological matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective cellular movement plays a crucial role in many processes fundamental to health, including development, reproduction, infection, wound healing, and cancer. The emergent dynamics that arise in these systems are typically thought to depend on how cells interact with one another and the mechanisms used to drive motility, both of which exhibit remarkable diversity across different biological systems. Here, we report experimental evidence of a universal feature in the patterns of flow that spontaneously emerges in groups of collectively moving cells. Specifically, we demonstrate that the flows generated by collectively moving dog kidney cells, human breast cancer cells, and by two different strains of pathogenic bacteria, all exhibit conformal invariance. Remarkably, not only do our results show that all of these very different systems display robust conformal invariance, but we also discovered that the precise form of the invariance in all four systems is described by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE), and belongs to the percolation universality class. A continuum model of active matter can recapitulate both the observed conformal invariance and SLE form found in experiments. The presence of universal conformal invariance reveals that the macroscopic features of living biological matter exhibit universal translational, rotational, and scale symmetries that are independent of the microscopic properties of its constituents. Our results show that the patterns of flows generated by diverse cellular systems are highly conserved and that biological systems can unexpectedly be used to experimentally test predictions from the theories for conformally invariant structures</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Nucleation and Growth of Sessile Chemically Active Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplets are essential for spatially controlling biomolecules in cells. To work properly, cells need to control the emergence and morphology of droplets. On the one hand, driven chemical reactions can affect droplets profoundly. For instance, reactions can control how droplets nucleate and how large they grow. On the other hand, droplets coexist with various organelles and other structures inside cells, which could affect their nucleation and morphology. To understand the interplay of these two aspects, we study a continuous field theory of active phase separation. Our numerical simulations reveal that reactions suppress nucleation while attractive walls enhance it. Intriguingly, these two effects are coupled, leading to shapes that deviate substantially from the spherical caps predicted for passive systems. These distortions result from anisotropic fluxes responding to the boundary conditions dictated by the Young-Dupr\'e equation. Interestingly, an electrostatic analogy of chemical reactions confirms these effects. We thus demonstrate how driven chemical reactions affect the emergence and morphology of droplets, which could be crucial for understanding biological cells and improving technical applications, e.g., in chemical engineering.</description>

      <title>The importance of stretching rate in achieving true stress relaxation in the elasto-capillary thinning of dilute solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on inferring the molecular state of the polymer chain required to induce elasto-capillary stress relaxation and the accurate measure of the polymer relaxation time in uniaxial stretching of dilute polymer solutions. This work is facilitated by the discovery that constant velocity applied at early times leads to initial constant extension rate before reaching the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. Such constant rate experiments are used to correlate initial stretching kinematics with the thinning dynamics in the elasto-capillary Regime. We show that there is a minimum initial strain-rate required to induce rate independent elastic effects. Below the minimum extension rate, insufficient stretching of the chain is observed before capillary instability, such that the polymer stress is comparable to the capillary stress at long times and true stress relaxation is not achieved. Above the minimum strain-rate, the chain reaches a critical stretch before instability, such that during the unstable filament thinning the polymer stress is significantly larger than the capillary stress and true stress relaxation is observed. Using a single relaxation mode Oldroyd-B model, we show that the the minimum strain rate leads to a required initial stretch of the chain before reaching the Rayleigh Plateau limit. Along with the accurate measure of relaxation time, this work introduces a characteristic dimensionless group, called the stretchability factor, that can be used to quantitatively compare different materials based on the overall material deformation/kinematic behavior, not just the relaxation time. Overall, these results demonstrate a useful methodology to study the stretching of dilute solutions using a constant velocity stretching scheme.</description>

      <title>Boundary geometry controls topological defect transitions that determine lumen nucleation in embryonic development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects determine the collective properties of anisotropic materials. How their configurations are controlled is not well understood however, especially in 3D, where bulk-surface coupling can render the geometry of confining boundaries relevant. This is particularly important in living matter, where 2D topological defects have been linked to essential biological functions, whereas the role of 3D defects is unclear. Motivated by multicellular systems interacting with extracellular boundaries, we consider a polar fluid confined within curved boundaries imposing weak surface anchoring. We report a novel charge-preserving transition between different defect configurations, controlled by the boundary shape, and invariant to changes in the material parameters. We test if this geometry-driven transition occurs in confined multicellular systems and investigate the biological role of 3D polar defects in the mouse epiblast -- an embryonic tissue consisting of apico-basally polarised cells. We find that fluid-filled lumina -- structures essential for subsequent embryonic development -- tend to form near defect positions of polar fluids in embryo-like confinement geometries. Moreover, by experimentally perturbing embryo shape beyond the transition point, we trigger the formation of additional lumen nucleation sites at the predicted position. Thus, our work reveals how boundary geometry controls polar defects, and how embryos use this mechanism for shape-dependent lumen formation. Because this defect control principle is independent of specific material properties, we expect it to apply universally to systems with orientational order.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the AMOEBA force field for simulating metal halide perovskites in the solid state and in solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we compare existing non-polarizable force fields developed to study the solid or solution phases of hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskites with the AMOEBA polarizable force field. The aim is to test whether more computationally expensive polarizable force fields like AMOEBA offer better transferability between solution and solid phases, with the ultimate goal being the study of crystal nucleation, growth and other interfacial phenomena involving these ionic compounds. In the context of hybrid perovskites, AMOEBA force field parameters already exist for several elements in solution and we decided to leave them unchanged and to only parameterize the missing ones (Pb\textsuperscript{2+} and CH\textsubscript{3}NH\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{+} ions) in order to maximise transferability and avoid over-fitting to the specific examples studied here. Overall, we find that AMOEBA yields accurate hydration free energies (within 5\%) for typical ionic species while showing the correct ordering of stability for the different crystal polymorphs of CsPbI\textsubscript{3} and CH\textsubscript{3}NH\textsubscript{3}PbI\textsubscript{3}. While the existing parameters do not accurately reproduce all transition temperatures and lattice parameters, AMOEBA offers better transferability between solution and solid states than existing non-polarizable force fields.</description>

      <title>GCMe: Efficient implementation of Gaussian core model with smeared electrostatic interactions for molecular dynamics simulations of soft matter systems</title>

Abstract: In recent years, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged as a pivotal tool for understanding the structure, dynamics, and phase behavior in charged soft matter systems. To explore phenomena across greater length and time scales in MD simulations, molecules are often coarse-grained for better computational performance. However, commonly-used force fields represent particles as hard-core interaction centers with point charges, which often overemphasizes the packing effect and short-range electrostatics, especially in systems with bulky deformable organic molecules and systems with strong coarse-graining. This underscores the need for an efficient soft-core model to physically capture the effective interactions between coarse-grained particles. To this end, we implement a soft-core model uniting the Gaussian core model with smeared electrostatic interactions that is phenomenologically equivalent to recent theoretical models. We first parameterize it generically using water as the model solvent. Then, we benchmark its performance in the OpenMM toolkit for different boundary conditions to highlight a computational speedup of up to $34\times$ compared to commonly used force fields and existing implementations. Finally, we demonstrate its utility by investigating how boundary polarizability affects the adsorption behavior of a polyelectrolyte solution on perfectly conducting and nonmetal electrodes.</description>

      <title>Single file motion of robot swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental results on the single file motion of a group of robots interacting with each other through position sensors. We successfully replicate the fundamental diagram typical of these systems, with a transition from free flow to congested traffic as the density of the system increases. In the latter scenario we also observe the characteristic stop-and-go waves. The unique advantages of this novel system, such as experimental stability and repeatability, allow for extended experimental runs, facilitating a comprehensive statistical analysis of the global dynamics. Above a certain density, we observe a divergence of the average jam duration and the average number of robots involved in it. This discovery enables us to precisely identify another transition: from congested intermittent flow (for intermediate densities) to a totally congested scenario for high densities. Beyond this finding, the present work demonstrates the suitability of robot swarms to model complex behaviors in many particle systems.</description>

      <title>Isotope effects in supercooled H$_2$O and D$_2$O and a corresponding-states-like rescaling of the temperature and pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water shows anomalous properties that are enhanced upon supercooling. The unusual behavior is observed in both H$_2$O and D$_2$O, however with different temperature dependences for the two isotopes. It is often noted that comparing the properties of the isotopes at two different temperatures (i.e., a temperature shift) approximately accounts for many of the observations with a temperature shift of 7.2 K in the temperature of maximum density being the most well-known example. However, the physical justification for such a shift is unclear. Motivated by recent work demonstrating a corresponding-states-like rescaling for water properties in three classical water models that all exhibit a liquid-liquid transition and critical point (B. Uralcan, et al., J. Chem. Phys. 150, 064503 (2019)), the applicability of this approach for reconciling the differences in temperature- and pressure-dependent thermodynamic properties of H$_2$O and D$_2$O is investigated here. Utilizing previously published data and equations-of-state for H$_2$O and D$_2$O, we show that the available data and models for these isotopes are consistent with such a low temperature correspondence. These observations provide support for the hypothesis that a liquid-liquid critical point, which is predicted to occur at low temperatures and high pressures, is the origin of many of water's anomalies.</description>

      <title>Models of fractional viscous stresses for incompressible materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01934v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and review several models of fractional viscous stresses from the literature, which generalise classical viscosity theories to fractional orders by replacing total strain derivatives in time with fractional time derivatives. We also briefly introduce Prony-type approximations of these theories. Here we investigate the issues of material frame-indifference and thermodynamic consistency for these models and find that on these bases, some are physically unacceptable. Next we study elementary shearing and tensile motions, observing that some models are more convenient to use than others for the analysis of creep and relaxation. Finally, we compute the incremental stresses due to small-amplitude wave propagation in a deformed material, with a view to establish acousto-elastic formulas for prospective experimental calibrations.</description>

      <title>Phase-ordering kinetics in the Allen-Cahn (Model A) class: universal aspects elucidated by electrically-induced transition in liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.09043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2d) Ising model is the statistical physics textbook example for phase transitions and their kinetics. Quenched through the Curie point with Glauber rates, the late-time description of the ferromagnetic domain coarsening finds its place at the scalar sector of the Allen-Cahn (Model A) class. Resisting exact results sought since Lifshitz's account in 1962, central quantities in 2d Model A $-$ most scaling exponents and correlation functions $-$ remain known up to approximate theories whose disparate outcomes urge experimental assessment. Here, we perform such assessment from a comprehensive study of the coarsening of 2d twisted nematic liquid crystals whose kinetics is induced by a super-fast switching from a spatiotemporally chaotic state to a two-phase concurrent, equilibrium one. Tracking the dynamics via optical microscopy, we firstly show the sharp evidence of well-established Model A aspects, such as the dynamic exponent $z=2$ and the dynamic scaling hypothesis, to then move forward. We confirm the Bray-Humayun theory for Porod's regime describing intradomain length scales of spatial correlators, and show that their nontrivial decay beyond that regime is captured in a free-from-parameter fashion by Gaussian theories. These paradigmatic theories, however, do not perform well for time-related Model A statistics. We reveal that the collapsed form of two-time correlators is best accounted for by the local scaling invariance theory, along with the Fisher-Huse conjecture. We also suggest the true value for the local persistence exponent, in disfavour of Gaussian models, and extract a universal fractal dimension for the morphology of persistence clusters that is notably close to the golden ratio. Given its accuracy and possibilities, this experimental setup may work as a prototype to address universality issues in the realm of nonequilibrium systems.</description>
