      <title>Phase-Field Modeling of Fracture under Compression and Confinement in Anisotropic Geomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly anisotropic geomaterials undergo fracture under compressive loading. This paper applies a phase-field fracture model to study this fracture process. While phase-field fracture models have several advantages, they provide unphysical predictions when the stress state is complex and includes compression that can cause crack faces to contact.
  Building on a phase-field model that accounts for compressive traction across the crack face, this paper extends the model to anisotropic fracture. The key features include: (1) a homogenized anisotropic elastic response and strongly-anisotropic model for the work to fracture; (2) an effective damage response that accounts consistently for compressive traction across the crack face, that is derived from the anisotropic elastic response; (3) a regularized crack normal field that overcomes the shortcomings of the isotropic setting, and enables the correct crack response, both across and transverse to the crack face.
  To test the model, we first compare the predictions to phase-field fracture evolution calculations in a fully-resolved layered specimen with spatial inhomogeneity, and show that it captures the overall patterns of crack growth. We then apply the model to previously-reported experimental observations of fracture evolution in laboratory specimens of shales under compression with confinement, and find that it predicts well the observed crack patterns in a broad range of loading conditions. We further apply the model to predict the growth of wing cracks under compression and confinement. The effective crack response model enables us to treat the initial crack simply as a non-singular damaged zone within the computational domain, thereby allowing for easy and general computations.</description>

      <title>Monitorization of the H-O Bond Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike conventional thought, the H-O bond is flexible, instead, and sensitive to perturbation. This exercise empowers the electron and phonon spectroscopies with the Tight-binding approach, enabling a referential database to synchronically quantize the relaxation and flexibility of these identities for substances involving the H-O bond during phonon spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Architected Dual-Network Solvent-free Adhesives for Stretchable Fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural systems, such as tendons and spider silk, demonstrate how the combination of strength and stretchability can be effectively achieved by integrating stiff and flexible network structures. Inspired by these systems, we developed a novel, solvent-free dual-network adhesive based on a self-assembling ABA triblock copolymer, poly(methyl methacrylate)-poly(n-butyl acrylate)-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA-b-PnBA-b-PMMA), designed for applications requiring both high strength and stretchability. The triblock copolymer forms a physically crosslinked network through microdomains of PMMA end-blocks that provide structural integrity, while the PnBA mid-block forms a soft, stretchable matrix. To further enhance mechanical performance, a second poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA) network is polymerized in situ, locking the PMMA microdomains in place and creating a load-bearing system. By varying the crosslinking density of the secondary network, we tailor the adhesive's mechanical properties (Young's modulus: 0.17 - 1.18 MPa) to suit different substrates, creating a mechanically transparent seam. The resulting dual-network system combines different strategies to achieve high strength and stretchability, with adhesive performance comparable to industrial methods such as sewing, particularly in bonding neoprene fabric composites and sealing the joints. Our solvent-free approach also eliminates the need for lengthy solvent evaporation steps, offering an eco-friendly and more efficient alternative for flexible adhesive applications in fields such as soft robotics, flexible electronics, and sports apparel.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of Ge, Re and Cr substituted Fe$_5$SiB$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the possible approaches to decrease the demand for critical elements such as rare earths is to develop new sustainable magnets. Iron-based materials are suitable for gap magnets applications since iron is the most abundant ferromagnetic element on Earth. Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ is a candidate as gap magnet thanks to its high Curie temperature (T$_{\text{C}} \sim$ 800 K) and saturation magnetization (M$_{\text{S}}\sim$ 140 Am$^2$kg$^{-1}$). However its anisotropy field is too low for applications (H$_{\text{A}} \sim$ 0.8 T). In order to increase the anisotropy value, we synthesized a series of Ge, Re and Cr substituted Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ samples and studied their magnetic properties. They all crystallize in the Cr$_5$B$_3$-type tetragonal structure with the $I4/mcm$ space group. Curie temperature (T$_{\text{C}}$ = 803 K) and saturation magnetization (M$_{\text{S}}$ = 138 Am$^2$kg$^{-1}$) are slightly decreased by elemental substitution with Re having the largest effect. Despite being reduced, T$_{\text{C}}$ and M$_{\text{S}}$ still maintain significant values (T$_{\text{C}}&gt;$ 750 K and M$_{\text{S}}$ = 118 Am$^2$kg$^{-1}$). The room temperature anisotropy field has been measured by Singular Point Detection (SPD) and increases by about 15% upon Re substitution, reaching 0.92 T for Fe$_{4.75}$Re$_{0.25}$SiB$_2$. We have also used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and SPD measurements to study the spin reorientation transition which takes place at 172 K and we have found that it is partially suppressed by substitution of Ge from 172 K to 140 K and completely suppressed upon Cr and Re substitution.</description>

      <title>Unveiling potential candidates for rare-earth-free permanent magnet and magnetocaloric effect applications: a high throughput screening in Fe-N alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we have found 49 ferromag-netic cases in FexN1-x (0&lt;x&lt;1) compounds, focusing especially on permanent magnet and giant magnetocaloric effect applications. It is found that 15 compounds are potential permanent mag-nets with a magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy more than 1 MJ/m3, filling in the gap of appli-cation spectrum between high-performance and widely used permanents. Among the potential permanent magnets, Fe2N can be classified as a hard magnet while the other 14 compounds can be classified as semi-hard magnets. According to the calculations of magnetic deformation proxy, 40 compounds are identified as potential giant magnetocaloric effect candidates. We suspect that Fe-N compounds provide fine opportunities for applications in both rare-earth free permanent magnets and magnetocaloric effect.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the matrix elements of the position operator in the crystal momentum representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fewer operators are more fundamental than the position operator in a crystal. But since it is not translationally invariant in crystal momentum representation (CMR), how to properly represent it is nontrivial. Over half a century, various methods have been proposed, but they often lead to either highly singular derivatives or extremely arcane expressions. Here we propose a resolution to this problem by directly computing their matrix elements between two Bloch states. We show that the position operator is a full matrix in CMR, where the off-diagonal elements in crystal momentum $\bf k$ only appear along the direction of the position vector. Our formalism, free of singular derivative and degeneracy difficulties, can describe an array of physical properties, from intraband transitions, polarization with or without spin-orbit coupling, orbital angular momentum, to susceptibilities.</description>

      <title>Can structure influence hydrovoltaic energy generation? Insights from the metallic 1T' and semiconducting 2H phases of MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrovoltaic power generation from liquid water and ambient moisture has attracted considerable research efforts. However, there is still limited consensus on the optimal material properties required to maximize the power output. Here, we used laminates of two different phases of layered MoS$_2$ -- metallic 1T' and semiconducting 2H -- as representative systems to investigate the critical influence of specific characteristics, such as hydrophilicity, interlayer channels, and structure, on the hydrovoltaic performance. The metallic 1T' phase was synthesized via a chemical exfoliation process and assembled into laminates, which can then be converted to the semiconducting 2H phase by thermal annealing. Under liquid water conditions, the 1T' laminates, having a channel size of 6 angstroms, achieved a peak power density of 2.0 mW m$^{-2}$, significantly outperforming the 2H phase, lacking defined channels, that produced a power of 2.4 microW m$^{-2}$. Our theoretical analysis suggests that energy generation in these hydrophilic materials primarily arises from electro-kinetic and surface diffusion mechanisms. These findings highlight the crucial role of phase-engineered MoS$_2$ and underscore the potential of 2D material laminates in advancing hydrovoltaic energy technologies.</description>

      <title>Exciton Dynamics and Quantum Efficiencies in Optically Coupled OLEDs: A Unified Quantum Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary function of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is to convert electrons into photons. However, only 25 % of the electronic states (singlets) in electrically excited fluorescent molecules can emit light, which is why triplet harvesting has attracted significant attention. Specifically, one often aims to maximize the rate of triplet-to-singlet conversion, while at the same time, it is crucial to depopulate the singlets fast enough -- before they convert to triplets or interact with other excited states, potentially breaking molecular bonds. Planar microcavities provide a viable architecture to address these issues. By confining the emitters within planar microcavities one can couple the excitons to cavity modes and engineer the population dynamics to one's liking. While the weak-coupling regime is renowned for Purcell-enhanced emission, strongly coupled excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates known as polaritons. To fully understand and optimize exciton-photon interactions and light-emission mechanisms across various coupling regimes, a unified theory of optically coupled (and uncoupled) OLEDs is needed. In this article, we introduce a quantum master equation model spanning the zero-, weak-, and strong-coupling regimes. We derive the different rates using Fermi's golden rule and Marcus theory, show how the different regimes converge, and finally evaluate the internal quantum efficiencies in all cases.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Filamentary Conduction in Thermally Stable Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework (ZIF-8) Resistive Switching Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of digital technology has driven the need for efficient storage solutions, positioning memristors as promising candidates for next-generation non-volatile memory (NVM) due to their superior electrical properties. Organic and inorganic materials each offer distinct advantages for resistive switching (RS) performance, while hybrid materials like metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) combine the strengths of both. In this study, we present a resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) device utilizing zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8), a MOF material, as the resistive switching layer. The ZIF-8 film was synthesized via a simple solution process method at room temperature and subsequently characterized. The Al/ZIF-8/ITO device demonstrates bipolar resistive switching behaviour with an on/off resistance ratio of 100, stable retention up to 10000 seconds, and consistent performance across 60 cycles while exhibiting robust thermal stability from -20 C to 100 C. Low-frequency noise and impedance spectroscopy measurements suggest a filamentary switching mechanism. Additionally, the memory state can be tuned by adjusting the reset voltage, pointing to potential as multi-level memory. Potentiation and depression experiments further highlight the devices promise for neuromorphic applications. With high stability, tunability, and strong performance, the ZIF-8 based ReRAM shows great promise for advanced NVM and neuromorphic computing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately calculating energies and atomic forces with linear-scaling methods is a crucial approach to accelerating and improving molecular dynamics simulations. In this paper, we introduce HamGNN-DM, a machine learning model designed to predict atomic forces and energies using local density matrices in molecular dynamics simulations. This approach achieves efficient predictions with a time complexity of O(n), making it highly suitable for large-scale systems. Experiments in different systems demonstrate that HamGNN-DM achieves DFT-level precision in predicting the atomic forces in different system sizes, which is vital for the molecular dynamics. Furthermore, this method provides valuable electronic structure information throughout the dynamics and exhibits robust performance.</description>

      <title>Dynamical electron-phonon vertex correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical screening of the electron-phonon vertex is due to the retarded oscillations of the electronic charge following the phonon annihilation into an electron-hole pair. This retardation induces a frequency dependence of the electron-phonon interaction that is commonly neglected. In this work I propose a dynamical perturbative expansion that, while being diagrammatically consistent, defines a controllable and physically sound method to include dynamical screening effects in the electron-phonon vertex. The method is applied to the phonon self-energy of the homogeneous electron gas where I show how retardation effects are driven by the ratio between the plasma and the phonon frequencies. I finally propose a simple approach to estimate the importance of dynamical corrections. This method is applied to the paradigmatic case of MgB$_2$ to show the non--perturbative and large retardation effects that characterize this peculiar material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that C$_{60}$ fullerene molecules can serve as promising building blocks in the construction of versatile crystal structures with unique symmetries using first-principles calculations. These phases include quasi-2D layered structures and 3D van der Waals crystals where the molecules adopt varied orientations. The interplay of molecular arrangement and lattice symmetry results in a variety of tuneable crystal structures with distinct properties. Specifically, the electronic structures of these phases vary significantly, offering potential for fine-tuning the band gap for electronics and optoelectronics. Additionally, the optical properties of these materials are strongly influenced by their crystalline symmetry and molecular alignment, providing avenues for tailoring optical responses for photonics. Our findings highlight the potential of fullerene-based building blocks in the rational design of functional materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For over a decade, linear and symmetric weight updates have remained the elusive holy grail in neuromorphic computing. Here, we unveil a kinetically controlled molecular mechanism driving a near-ideal neuromorphic element, capable of precisely modulating conductance linearly across 16,500 analog levels spanning four orders of magnitude. Our findings, supported by experimental data and mathematical modelling, demonstrate how nonlinear processes such as nucleation can be orchestrated within small perturbation regimes to achieve linearity. This establishes a groundwork for routinely realizing these long-sought neuromorphic features across a broad range of material systems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-dimensional magnetism and antiferromagnetic ground state in Li$_2$FeSiO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our experimental (neutron diffraction, M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat) and numerical studies on the evolution of short- and long-range magnetic order in $\gamma_{\rm II}$-Li\(_2\)FeSiO\(_4\) suggest a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) nature of magnetism. The experimental data obtained on single crystals imply long-range antiferromagnetic order below $T_{\rm N}= 17$~K. A broad maximum in magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ at $T_{\rm m}\simeq 28$~K, observation of magnetic entropy changes up to 100~K and anisotropy in $\chi$ are indicative of low-dimensional magnetism and suggest short-range magnetic correlations up to 200~K. Neutron diffraction shows that long-range antiferromagnetic order is characterised by the propagation vector k=(1/2,0,1/2). The ordered moment $\mu = 2.50(2) \mu_B$ /Fe, at $T = 1.5$~K, is along the crystallographic $a$-axis. This is consistent with the observed static hyperfine field of $B_{\rm hyp}=14.8(3)$\,T by M\"ossbauer spectroscopy which indicates significant orbital contributions. The temperature dependence of $B_{\rm hyp}$ yields the critical exponent $\beta=0.116(12)$ which is in the regime of the 2D Ising behaviour. LSDA+U studies exploiting the experimental spin structure suggest dominating magnetic exchange coupling within the $ac$-layers (i.e., $J_3\simeq -6$~K and $J_6\simeq-2$~K) while interlayer coupling is much smaller and partly frustrated. This confirms the 2D nature of magnetism and is in full agreement with the experimental findings.</description>

Abstract: The kagome lattice has garnered significant attention due to its ability to host quantum spin Fermi liquid states. Recently, the combination of unique lattice geometry, electron-electron correlations, and adjustable magnetism in solid kagome materials has led to the discovery of numerous fascinating quantum properties. These include unconventional superconductivity, charge and spin density waves (CDW/SDW), pair density waves (PDW), and Chern insulator phases. These emergent states are closely associated with the distinctive characteristics of the kagome lattice's electronic structure, such as van Hove singularities, Dirac fermions, and flat bands, which can exhibit exotic quasi-particle excitations under different symmetries and magnetic conditions. Recently, various quantum kagome materials have been developed, typically consisting of kagome layers stacked along the $z$-axis with atoms either filling the geometric centers of the kagome lattice or embedded between the layers. In this topical review, we begin by introducing the fundamental properties of several kagome materials. To gain an in-depth understanding of the relationship between topology and correlation, we then discuss the complex phenomena observed in these systems. These include the simplest kagome metal $T_3X$, kagome intercalation metal $TX$, and the ternary compounds $AT_6X_6$ and $RT_3X_5$ ($A$ = Li, Mg, Ca, or rare earth; $T$ = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; $X$ = Sn, Ge; $R$ = K, Rb, Cs). Finally, we provide a perspective on future experimental work in this field.</description>

      <title>Landau-Levich Scaling for Optimization of Quantum Dot Layer Morphology and Thickness for Enhanced Quantum-Dot Light-Emitting Diode Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dot (QD) light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) are promising candidates for next-generation displays because of their high efficiency, brightness, broad color gamut, and solution-processability. Large-scale solution-processing of electroluminescent QLEDs poses significant challenges, particularly concerning the precise control of the active layer's thickness and uniformity. These obstacles directly impact charge transport, leading to current leakage and reduced overall efficiency. Blade-coating is a prevalent and scalable solution processing technique known for its speed and minimal waste. Additionally, it allows for continuous "roll-to-roll" processing, making it highly adaptable in various applications. In this study, we demonstrate the precise control of blade speed in the Landau-Levich regime to create a uniform QD emission layer, using a commercial CdSe/ZnS QD as a representative example. QDs assemble into different morphologies on glass and the underlying layers of the QLED device due to variations in interaction energy. The QD film thickness can be modified from monolayer to multilayer by adjusting blade speed, which can be predicted by fitting the Landau-Levich-Derjaguin theory. The optimal speed at 7 mm/s results in a QD film with a surface coverage of around 163% and low roughness (1.57 nm mean square height). The QLED external quantum efficiency (EQE) of approximately 1.5% was achieved using commercially available CdSe/ZnS QDs with low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), and an EQE of around 7% has been obtained using lab-made InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs having a solution PLQY of 74%. All-blade-coated CdSe-QLEDs are further demonstrated by adopting the optimized speed for the QD layer. This method demonstrates significant potential for developing low-cost, reproducible, and scalable QLED technologies with uniform emission characteristics and low-waste production.</description>

      <title>Dissociation of Adsorbates via Electronic Energy Transfer from Aromatic Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photofragment translational spectroscopy has been used to characterize the photodissociation of CH$_3$I and CF$_3$I adsorbed on thin films of a variety of aromatic molecules, initiated by near-UV light. Thin films (nominally 10 monolayers) of benzene, five substituted benzenes and two naphthalenes have been employed to study systematic changes in the photochemical activity. Illumination of these systems with 248nm light is found to result in a dissociation process for the CH$_3$I and CF$_3$I mediated by initial absorption in the aromatic thin film, followed by electronic energy transfer (EET) to the dissociating species. The effective cross sections for dissociation are found to be substantially increased via this mechanism, by amounts that differ depending on the aromatic molecule thin film used, and is connected to the aromatic photabsorption profile. Distinctive translational energy distributions for the CH$_3$ and CF$_3$ photofragments are found to vary systematically for the different aromatic molecule thin film used, and are related to the aromatic molecule excited states. The CH$_3$ and CF$_3$ photofragment kinetic energy distributions found for the aromatic thin films suggest that the dissociation occurs via EET to the $^3Q_1$ excited state of CH$_3$I and CF$_3$I.</description>

      <title>SFFT-Based Homogenization: Using Tensor Trains to Enhance FFT-Based Homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homogenization is a key technique for approximating the macroscopic properties of materials with microscale heterogeneity. The FFT-based Homogenization method has gained widespread usage due to its computational efficiency and accuracy in handling complex microstructures. However, despite its advantages, the method is limited by speed and memory constraints, particularly when applied to high-resolution discretizations. These limitations affect its scalability and efficiency, especially in large-scale simulations or when dealing with highly detailed microstructures. These challenges arise from the fundamental reliance on the Fast Fourier Transform, which imposes inherent restrictions on further advancements. In this paper, we propose a novel SFFT-based Homogenization algorithm that utilizes a Quantized Tensor Train variant of the Quantum Fourier Transform. This method is tailored to the geometry under consideration and offers significant improvements in time complexity and memory efficiency compared to the traditional FFT-based approach while remaining executable on classical hardware. The method is applicable only if a suitable Quantized Tensor Train representation exists for the stiffness operator associated with the underlying geometry.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Ultra-Stable Antiferromagnetic Two-Dimensional CrF3 Phase with Anisotropic Quasi-1D Mechanical, Electronic, and Thermal Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies.</description>

      <title>Experimental identification of topological defects in 2D colloidal glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological defects are singularities within a field that cannot be removed by continuous transformations. The definition of these irregularities requires an ordered reference configuration, calling into question whether they exist in disordered materials, such as glasses. However, recent work suggests that well-defined topological defects emerge in the dynamics of glasses, even if they are not evident in the static configuration. In this study, we reveal the presence of topological defects in the vibrational eigenspace of a two-dimensional experimental colloidal glass. These defects strongly correlate with the vibrational features and spatially correlate with each other and structural "soft spots", more prone to plastic flow. This work experimentally confirms the existence of topological defects in disordered systems revealing the complex interplay between topology, disorder, and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Entropy stabilized form chirality in curved rod nematics: structure and symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo molecular simulations of curve-shaped rods show the propensity of such shapes to polymorphism revealing both smectic and polar nematic phases. The nematic exhibits a nanoscale modulated local structure characterized by a unique, polar, $\rm{C}_2$-symmetry axis that tightly spirals generating a mirror-symmetry-breaking orgnization of the achiral rods=form chirality. A comprehensive characterization of the polarity and its symmetries in the nematic phase confirms that the nanoscale modulation is distinct from the elastic deformations of a uniaxial nematic director in the twist-bend nematic phase. Instead it is shown that, analogous to the isotropic-to-nematic transition, entropy stabilizes the roto-translating polar director in the polar-twisted nematic phase. The conflation of macroscale form chirality in ferroelectric nematics with that in the twist-bend nematic stems from the misattribution of the nanoscale modulation in the lower temperature nematic ''$\rm{N_X}$ phase'' found in CB7CB dimers.</description>

      <title>Reflections from the 2024 Large Language Model (LLM) Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we present the outcomes from the second Large Language Model (LLM) Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry, which engaged participants across global hybrid locations, resulting in 34 team submissions. The submissions spanned seven key application areas and demonstrated the diverse utility of LLMs for applications in (1) molecular and material property prediction; (2) molecular and material design; (3) automation and novel interfaces; (4) scientific communication and education; (5) research data management and automation; (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation; and (7) knowledge extraction and reasoning from scientific literature. Each team submission is presented in a summary table with links to the code and as brief papers in the appendix. Beyond team results, we discuss the hackathon event and its hybrid format, which included physical hubs in Toronto, Montreal, San Francisco, Berlin, Lausanne, and Tokyo, alongside a global online hub to enable local and virtual collaboration. Overall, the event highlighted significant improvements in LLM capabilities since the previous year's hackathon, suggesting continued expansion of LLMs for applications in materials science and chemistry research. These outcomes demonstrate the dual utility of LLMs as both multipurpose models for diverse machine learning tasks and platforms for rapid prototyping custom applications in scientific research.</description>

      <title>Development of a linac-based LEPD experimental station for surface structure analysis and coordination with synchrotron radiation ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the development of a low-energy positron diffraction (LEPD) experimental station for surface structure analysis using a linac-based slow-positron beam. LEPD, the positron counterpart of low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), offers higher accuracy in surface structure determination. The station enables acquisition of LEPD I-V curves within a few hours, allowing measurements before surface degradation occurs. It consists of two ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chambers: one for sample preparation and the other for LEPD observations. The preparation chamber includes an Ar+ sputtering system, a triple-pocket electron beam evaporator, three gas introduction systems, additional user-configurable ports, and a LEED/Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) system. Sample manipulators enable rapid cooling, precise positioning, and orientation adjustments. In the preparation chamber, the manipulator also supports direct current heating up to 1200 {\deg}C. The sample holder is compatible with the LEPD station at SPF-A4 and the ARPES station at PF BL-13B, both located at the Tsukuba campus of the Institute of Materials Structure Science (IMSS), KEK. Design concepts and experimental demonstrations are presented.</description>
