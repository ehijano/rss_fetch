      <title>Diffusion Models at the Drug Discovery Frontier: A Review on Generating Small Molecules versus Therapeutic Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework in generative modeling, showing significant potential to accelerate and transform the traditionally slow and costly process of drug discovery. This review provides a systematic comparison of their application in designing two principal therapeutic modalities: small molecules and therapeutic peptides. We analyze how a unified framework of iterative denoising is adapted to the distinct molecular representations, chemical spaces, and design objectives of each modality. For small molecules, these models excel at structure-based design, generating novel, pocket-fitting ligands with desired physicochemical properties, yet face the critical hurdle of ensuring chemical synthesizability. Conversely, for therapeutic peptides, the focus shifts to generating functional sequences and designing de novo structures, where the primary challenges are achieving biological stability against proteolysis, ensuring proper folding, and minimizing immunogenicity. Despite these distinct challenges, both domains face shared hurdles: the need for more accurate scoring functions, the scarcity of high-quality experimental data, and the crucial requirement for experimental validation. We conclude that the full potential of diffusion models will be unlocked by bridging these modality-specific gaps and integrating them into automated, closed-loop Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) platforms, thereby shifting the paradigm from chemical exploration to the targeted creation of novel therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Design, Assessment, and Application of Machine Learning Potential Energy Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potential Energy Surfaces (PESs) are an indispensable tool to investigate, characterise and understand chemical and biological systems in the gas and condensed phases. Advances in Machine Learning (ML) methodologies have led to the development of Machine Learned Potential Energy Surfaces (ML-PES) which are now widely used to simulate such systems. The present work provides an overview of concepts, methodologies and recommendations for constructing and using ML-PESs. The choice of topics is focused on practical and recurrent issues to conceive and use such model. Application of the principles discussed are illustrated through two different systems of biomolecular importance: the non-reactive dynamics of the Alanine-Lysine-Alanine tripeptide in gas and solution phases, and double proton transfer reactions in DNA base pairs.</description>

      <title>How Do Proteins Fold?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How proteins fold remains a central unsolved problem in biology. While the idea of a folding code embedded in the amino acid sequence was introduced more than 6 decades ago, this code remains undefined. While we now have powerful predictive tools to predict the final native structure of proteins, we still lack a predictive framework for how sequences dictate folding pathways. Two main conceptual models dominate as explanations of folding mechanism: the funnel model, in which folding proceeds through many alternative routes on a rugged, hyperdimensional energy landscape; and the foldon model, which proposes a hierarchical sequence of discrete intermediates. Recent advances on two fronts are now enabling folding studies in unprecedented ways. Powerful experimental approaches; in particular, single-molecule force spectroscopy and hydrogen (deuterium exchange assays) allow time-resolved tracking of the folding process at high resolution. At the same time, computational breakthroughs culminating in algorithms such as AlphaFold have revolutionized static structure prediction, opening opportunities to extend machine learning toward dynamics. Together, these developments mark a turning point: for the first time, we are positioned to resolve how proteins fold, why they misfold, and how this knowledge can be harnessed for biology and medicine.</description>

      <title>AI-Guided Molecular Simulations in VR: Exploring Strategies for Imitation Learning in Hyperdimensional Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a crucial computational tool for researchers to understand and engineer molecular structure and function in areas such as drug discovery, protein engineering, and material design. Despite their utility, MD simulations are expensive, owing to the high dimensionality of molecular systems. Interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) has recently emerged as a "human-in-the-loop" strategy for efficiently navigating hyper-dimensional molecular systems. By providing an immersive 3D environment that enables visualization and manipulation of real-time molecular simulations running on high-performance computing architectures, iMD-VR enables researchers to reach out and guide molecular conformational dynamics, in order to efficiently explore complex, high-dimensional molecular systems. Moreover, iMD-VR simulations generate rich datasets that capture human experts' spatial insight regarding molecular structure and function. This paper explores the use of researcher-generated iMD-VR datasets to train AI agents via imitation learning (IL). IL enables agents to mimic complex behaviours from expert demonstrations, circumventing the need for explicit programming or intricate reward design. In this article, we review IL across robotics and Multi-agents systems domains which are comparable to iMD-VR, and discuss how iMD-VR recordings could be used to train IL models to interact with MD simulations. We then illustrate the applications of these ideas through a proof-of-principle study where iMD-VR data was used to train a CNN network on a simple molecular manipulation task; namely, threading a small molecule through a nanotube pore. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential challenges of using AI agents to augment human expertise in navigating vast molecular conformational spaces.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</description>

      <title>Machine Olfaction and Embedded AI Are Shaping the New Global Sensing Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine olfaction is rapidly emerging as a transformative capability, with applications spanning non-invasive medical diagnostics, industrial monitoring, agriculture, and security and defense. Recent advances in stabilizing mammalian olfactory receptors and integrating them into biophotonic and bioelectronic systems have enabled detection at near single-molecule resolution thus placing machines on par with trained detection dogs. As this technology converges with multimodal AI and distributed sensor networks imbued with embedded AI, it introduces a new, biochemical layer to a sensing ecosystem currently dominated by machine vision and audition. This review and industry roadmap surveys the scientific foundations, technological frontiers, and strategic applications of machine olfaction making the case that we are currently witnessing the rise of a new industry that brings with it a global chemosensory infrastructure. We cover exemplary industrial, military and consumer applications and address some of the ethical and legal concerns arising. We find that machine olfaction is poised to bring forth a planet-wide molecular awareness tech layer with the potential of spawning vast emerging markets in health, security, and environmental sensing via scent.</description>

      <title>BadGraph: A Backdoor Attack Against Latent Diffusion Model for Text-Guided Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns, particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation, conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method against latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear, while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate, with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.</description>
