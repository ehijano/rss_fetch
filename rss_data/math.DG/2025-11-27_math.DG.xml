      <title>The canonical symmetry reduction of string backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String backgrounds, defined here as metric connections with skew-symmetric torsion and reduced holonomy, yield generalized Ricci solitons relative to the Lee vector field. By a variational argument using the string action, they are also gradient generalized Ricci solitons relative to a potential function. These two observations combine to yield a canonical symmetry, and in this work we derive fundamental features of the transverse geometry, and rigidity phenomena. We prove in a unified conceptual fashion that the transverse geometry satisfies the string generalized Ricci soliton equations (a simplified Hull-Strominger system) in many settings including almost Hermitian, almost contact, $SU(3)$, $G_2$, and $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ geometry. We also show that the transverse geometry is always conformally co-closed, with the conformal factor given by the associated soliton potential.</description>

      <title>A rigidity theorem for complex Kleinian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Farre, Pozzetti and Viaggi proved that any (d-k)-hyperconvex subgroup of PSL(d,C) is virtually isomorphic to a convex cocompact Kleinian group and that its k-th simple root critical exponent is at most 2. We show that a (d-k)-hyperconvex subgroup is isomorphic to a uniform lattice in PSL(2,C) if and only if its k-th simple root critical exponent is exactly 2. Furthermore, we show that if a strongly irreducible (d-k)-hyperconvex subgroup has k-th simple root critical exponent 2, then it is the image of a uniform lattice in PSL(2, C) by an irreducible representation of PSL(2, C) into PSL(d, C).</description>

      <title>Flows of conformally coclosed $G_2$-structures with dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study flows of $G_2$-structures guided by the principle of dimensional reduction: natural geometric flows in $G_2$-geometry reduce to natural flows in complex geometry. Our main examples are the $G_2$-Laplacian coflow, which lifts the K\"ahler--Ricci flow, and a 7-dimensional lift of the anomaly flow on complex threefolds. The $G_2$-lift of the anomaly flow deforms conformally coclosed $G_2$-structures. We compare the $G_2$-anomaly flow to the $G_2$-Laplacian coflow, and investigate short-time existence and fixed points.</description>

      <title>Metric Lines in the Space of Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates sub-Riemannian geodesics within the jet space of curves. We establish the existence of two distinct families of metric lines, that is, globally minimizing geodesics, in the $2$-jet space of plane curves. This result provides an initial contribution toward the broader classification of metric lines in jet spaces. Additionally, we present precise criteria, which characterize when a sub-Riemannian geodesic in the $2$-jet space of plane curves can be identified as a metric line.</description>

Abstract: We establish the existence of smooth solutions for the LYZ equation at the critical phase $\theta =(n-2)\frac{\pi}{2}$, thereby solving the critical case of a problem posed by Collins-Jacob-Yau
  and Li concerning the solvability for phase $\theta \leq (n-2)\frac{\pi}{2}$. As applications, we solve the 3D Hessian equation $\sigma_2 = 1$ and the 4D Hessian quotient equation $\sigma_3 = \sigma_1$ under weaker assumptions than previously required.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Solitons to the Mean Curvature Flow in $\mathbb{H}^3$ as Translation Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the half-space model of the hyperbolic three space with the hyperbolic metric, this same space can be seen as the Lie group, hence, a translation surface is a surface that is given by the product of two curves $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in this group. Here we present the rigidity of this kind of surfaces for some particular products in the context of minimal surfaces and solitons to the Mean Curvature Flow, also known as self-similar solutions.</description>

      <title>The G-signature Theorem on Witt spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G be a compact Lie group and let X be an oriented Witt G-pseudomanifold. Using intersection cohomology it is possible to define Sign(G,X) in R(G), the G-signature of X. Let g be an element in G. Assuming that the inclusion of the fixed point set associated to g is normally non-singular, we prove a formula for Sign(g,X), the G-signature of X computed at g, thus extending to Witt G-pseudomanifolds the fundamental result proved by Atiyah, Segal and Singer on smooth compact G-manifolds. Along the way, we give a detailed study of the fixed point set of a Thom-Mather G-space X and our main result in this direction is a sufficient condition ensuring that the fixed point set associated to G is included in X in a normally non-singular manner. This latter result provides many examples where our formula applies.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of solutions for Gross-Pitaevskii equations on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a multiplicity result for solutions of time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii equations on closed Riemannian manifolds. Such solutions arise as (possibly non-minimizing) critical points of the Ginzburg-Landau energy having prescribed momentum according to a given tangent velocity field. Lower bounds on the multiplicity of solutions are obtained in terms of the topology of the maximum velocity set, in the small momentum and vorticity core size regime. The proof relies on methods from critical point theory and $\Gamma$-convergence for Ginzburg-Landau functionals as well as on some new results for codimension 2 isoperimetric-type problems in the small flux regime, possibly of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate extremal metrics at which various types of rigidity theorems involving scalar curvatures hold. The rigidity we discuss here is related to the rigidity theorems presented by Mario Listing in his previous preprint. More specifically, we give some sufficient conditions for metrics not to be rigid in this sense. We also give several examples of Riemannian manifolds that satisfy such sufficient conditions.</description>

      <title>Expanding Ricci solitons and Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the long-time behavior of Ricci flows that collapse with bounded curvature, we study expanding Ricci solitons with nilpotent symmetry on vector bundles over a closed manifold. We prove that, under mild assumptions that are satisfied by Ricci flow limits, the equations dimension-reduce to the so-called twisted harmonic-Einstein equations. When the base is a surface, we establish a correspondence between solutions of the latter and a class of G-Higgs bundles. This allows us to produce infinite families of new examples that are not locally homogeneous, and in particular to obtain a complete description in dimension 4. We also show that all our examples admit Einstein one-dimensional extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a loop group (DPW-type) representation for minimal Lagrangian surfaces in the complex quadric $Q_{2}\cong \mathbb S^{2}\times \mathbb S^{2}$, formulated via a flat family of connections $\{\nabla^\lambda\}_{\lambda\in \mathbb S^{1}}$ on a trivial bundle. We prove that minimality is equivalent to the flatness of $\nabla^\lambda$ for all $\lambda$, describe the associated isometric $\mathbb S^{1}$-family, and establish a precise correspondence with minimal surfaces in $\mathbb S^{3}$ through their Gauss maps. Our framework unifies and streamlines earlier constructions (e.g., Castro--Urbano) and yields explicit families including $\mathbb R$-equivariant, radially symmetric, and trinoid-type examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a self-contained comprehensive theory of log-Euclidean Lie groups: smooth manifolds diffeomorphic to finite-dimensional vector spaces; extending existing results for symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices S+(n) and full-rank correlation matrices Cor+(n). We specify an isometric isomorphism theorem, showing that all log-Euclidean metrics on manifolds of identical dimension are isomorphically Riemannian isometric. Explicit isometries are constructed, linking SPD and correlation matrix manifolds. We further characterize quotient log-Euclidean metrics within a principal-bundle framework. We show that for any n $\ge$ 3, there is no choice of log-Euclidean metrics on S+(n) and on Cor+(n) for which the inclusion i\,: Cor+(n) $\rightarrow$ S+(n) becomes an isometric embedding. These results unify several disparate metrics in geometric statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the recently discovered BCCD shrinking soliton is linearly unstable, by extending the approach of \cite{chi04} and \cite{hm11}, via recent work the \cite{cm21} on gradient shrinking Ricci solitons. On the other hand, we prove that the weighted $L^2$-spectra of the weighted Lichnerowicz Laplacians of steady and expanding K\"ahler Ricci solitons are nonpositive in real dimension $4$. We additionally determine the linear stability of the orbifold singularities of K\"ahler solitons: shrinkers are unstable, steadies are neutrally stable and expanders are strictly stable. All of these results follow from new Weitzenb\"ock formulae for the weighted Lichnerowicz Laplacian specialized to K\"ahler metrics.</description>

      <title>The Willmore energy and curvature concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study isometric immersions of a Riemannian surface $(\Omega,\frak{g})$, where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, into $\mathbb{R}^3$. We consider their bending energy, i.e., the square of the $L^2$-norm of their second fundamental form, which is equivalent to the Willmore functional. We obtain two new lower bounds for this energy, one in terms of the Gaussian curvature of the surface, and the other in terms of a Burgers vector -- a measure of non-flatness connected to torsion. These new estimates provide optimal blowup rates of the energy when the curvature is concentrated (e.g., in a conical geometry). In the more subtle case of dipoles of concentrated curvature, we use the Burgers vector estimates to obtain an optimal blowup rate in terms of the size of the system. Our motivation comes from non-Euclidean elasticity, in which cones and curvature-dipoles play a central role. The lower bounds derived in this work directly yield lower bounds for the elastic energy of thin elastic sheets. The derivation of the curvature-based lower bound involves an isoperimetric inequality for framed loops, which we believe to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Topics in Weyl Geometry and Quantum Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first part of this thesis focuses on the Weyl-covariant nature of holography. We generalize the Fefferman-Graham ambient construction for conformal geometry to a corresponding construction for Weyl geometry. Through the Weyl-ambient construction, we investigate Weyl-covariant quantities on the Weyl manifold and define Weyl-obstruction tensors. We show that Weyl-obstruction tensors appear as poles in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the AlAdS bulk metric for even boundary dimensions. Under holographic renormalization in the Weyl-Fefferman-Graham gauge, we compute the Weyl anomaly of the boundary theory in multiple dimensions and demonstrate that Weyl-obstruction tensors can be used as the building blocks for the Weyl anomaly of the dual quantum field theory. The holographic calculation with a background Weyl geometry also suggests an underlying geometric interpretation of the Weyl anomaly.
  The second part of this thesis is devoted to understanding the geometric nature of the BRST formalism and quantum anomalies. Using the language of Lie algebroids, the BRST complex can be encoded in the exterior algebra of an Atiyah Lie algebroid derived from the principal bundle of the gauge theory. We showed that the cohomology of an Atiyah Lie algebroid in a trivialization gives rise to the BRST cohomology. We then apply the Lie algebroid cohomology in studying quantum anomalies and demonstrate the computation for chiral and Lorentz-Weyl anomalies. In particular, we pay close attention to the fact that the geometric intuition afforded by the Lie algebroid (which was absent in the traditional BRST complex) provides hints of a deeper picture that simultaneously geometrizes the consistent and covariant forms of the anomaly. In the algebroid construction, the difference between the consistent and covariant anomalies is simply a different choice of basis.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a generalized Stokes operator on smooth bounded domains via layer-potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the invertibility of the relevant single and double layer potentials associated to some generalizations of the Stokes operator on bounded domains. In order to do that, we first develop an ``algebra tool kit'' to deal with limit and jump relations of layer operators. We do that first on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for operators acting on a distribution supported on $\{x_{n} = 0\}$ and then in general on (possibly non-compact manifolds). We use these results to study the limit and jump relations of the layer potential operators associated to our generalized Stokes operators. In turn, we then use these results to prove the Fredholm property of single and double layer potentials of the generalized Stokes operator and even their invertibility when the auxiliary potentials satisfy suitable non-vanishing conditions. As an application, we obtain well-posedness results.</description>
