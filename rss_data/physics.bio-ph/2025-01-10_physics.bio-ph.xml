      <title>Energy Dynamics Powered by Traction and Stress Control Formation and Motion of +1/2 Topological Defects in Epithelial Cell Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In confluent cell monolayers, patterns of cell forces and motion are systematically altered near topological defects in cell shape. In turn, defects have been proposed to alter cell density, extrusion, and invasion, but it remains unclear how the defects form and how they affect cell forces and motion. Here, we studied +1/2 defects, and, in contrast to prior studies, we observed both tail-to-head and head-to-tail defect motion occurring at the same time in the same cell monolayer. We quantified the cell velocities, the tractions at the cell-substrate interface, and stresses within the cell layer near +1/2 defects. Results revealed that both traction and stress are sources of activity within the epithelial cell monolayer, with their competition defining whether the cells inject or dissipate energy and determining the direction of motion of +1/2 defects. Interestingly, patterns of motion, traction, stress, and energy injection near +1/2 defects existed before defect formation, suggesting that defects form as a result of spatially coordinated patterns in cell forces and motion. These findings reverse the current picture, from one in which defects define the cell forces and motion to one in which coordinated patterns of cell forces and motion cause defects to form and move.</description>

      <title>Universal quasi-particle kinetics control the cell death decision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how fluctuations propagate across spatial scales is central to our understanding of inanimate matter from turbulence to critical phenomena. In contrast to physical systems, biological systems are organized into a hierarchy of processes on a discrete set of spatial scales: they are compartmentalized. Here, we show that dynamic compartmentalization of stochastic systems leads to emergent, quasi-particle-like kinetics which are used by cells to perform key biological functions. Specifically, we derive a general theory that predicts the emergence of a single degree of freedom irrespective of system specifics. We obtain equations of motion and response characterising its unique kinetic properties. We experimentally demonstrate the biological relevance of quasi-particle kinetics in the decision of cells to commit suicide (apoptosis). Using fluorescent microscopy, we show that the response of cells to apoptotic stimuli exhibits quasi-particle like kinetics which establish a low-pass filter for cellular stress signals. By highlighting that cells manipulate how noise and signals propagate across spatial scales, our work reveals a new mechanism of cell fate decision-making.</description>

      <title>Physical and chemical characterization of Saccharum spontaneum flower fibre: potential applications in thermal insulation and microbial fuel cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saccharum spontaneum is a grass-type plant abundantly found in the Indian subcontinent, known for its beautiful, lustrous white flowers. Fibres were extracted from the flower and analyzed for their physical, mechanical, and chemical properties. The chemical composition of the fibre is 90.9% holocellulose, with a moisture content of 10.97%, and an average fibre length of 25 mm. FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of functional groups similar to those found in other natural cellulosic fibres. Additionally, the fibre exhibits a tensile strength of approximately 63 cN/tex, which is significantly higher than that of cotton and jute fibres. However, its crystallinity is relatively high at about 75%, resulting in a low elongation at break of 1.9%. FESEM analysis revealed a hollow structure in the fibre, indicating its potential suitability for applications requiring high thermal insulation, excellent moisture management, vapor permeability, and microbial fuel cell development.</description>

      <title>Rotational mobility in spherical membranes: The interplay between Saffman-Delbr\"uck length and inclusion size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mobility of particles in fluid membranes is a fundamental aspect of many biological processes. In a 1975 paper [1], Saffman and Delbr\"uck demonstrated how the presence of external Stokesian solvents is crucial in regularising the apparently singular flow within an infinite flat membrane. In the present paper, we extend this classical work and compute the rotational mobility of a rigid finite-sized particle located inside a spherical membrane embedded in Stokesian solvents. Treating the particle as a spherical cap, we solve for the flow semi-analytically as a function of the Saffman-Delbr\"uck (SD) length (ratio of membrane to solvent viscosity) and the solid angle formed by the particle. We study the dependence of the mobility and flow on inclusion size and SD length, recovering the flat-space mobility as a special case. Our results will be applicable to a range of biological problems including rotational Brownian motion, the dynamics of lipid rafts, and the motion of aquaporin channels in response to water flow. Our method will provide a novel way of measuring a membrane's viscosity from the rotational diffusion of large inclusions, for which the commonly used planar Saffman-Delbr\"uck theory does not apply.</description>

      <title>Stability of a passive viscous droplet in a confined active nematic liquid crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The translation and shape deformations of a passive viscous Newtonian droplet immersed in an active nematic liquid crystal under circular confinement are analyzed using a linear stability analysis. We focus on the case of a sharply aligned active nematic in the limit of strong elastic relaxation in two dimensions. Using an active liquid crystal model, we employ the Lorentz reciprocal theorem for Stokes flow to study the growth of interfacial perturbations as a result of both active and elastic stresses. Instabilities are uncovered in both extensile and contractile systems, for which growth rates are calculated and presented in terms of the dimensionless ratios of active, elastic, and capillary stresses, as well as the viscosity ratio between the two fluids. We also extend our theory to analyze the inverse scenario, namely, the stability of an active nematic droplet surrounded by a passive viscous layer. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of capillary, active, elastic, and viscous stresses in governing droplet stability. The instabilities uncovered here may be relevant to a plethora of biological active systems, from the dynamics of passive droplets in bacterial suspensions to the organization of subcellular compartments inside the cell and cell nucleus.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Adaptive High-Level Tight Control of Prostate Cancer: A Path from From Terminal Disease to Chronic Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastatic prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is characterized by a high mortality rate and a poor prognosis. In this work, we explore how a clinical oncologist can apply a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework to prolong metastatic prostate cancer survival, or even make it chronic in duration. We utilize a Bayesian optimization approach to identify the optimal adaptive chemotherapeutic treatment policy for a single drug (Abiraterone) to maximize the time before the patient begins to show symptoms. We show that, with precise adaptive optimization of drug delivery, it is possible to significantly prolong the cancer suppression period, potentially converting metastatic prostate cancer from a terminal disease to a chronic disease for most patients, as supported by clinical and analytical evidence. We suggest that clinicians might explore the possibility of implementing a high-level tight control (HLTC) treatment, in which the trigger signals (i.e. biomarker levels) for drug administration and cessation are both high and close together, typically yield the best outcomes, as demonstrated through both computation and theoretical analysis. This simple insight could serve as a valuable guide for improving current adaptive chemotherapy treatments in other hormone-sensitive cancers.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition: A perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21439v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone &amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson &amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>
