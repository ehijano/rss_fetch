      <title>Effects of Non-reciprocity on Coupled Kuramoto Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All the fundamental interactions (such as gravity or electromagnetic interactions) are reciprocal in nature. However, in the macroscopic world, in particular outside equilibrium, non-reciprocal or non-mutual interactions are quite ubiquitous. Understanding the impact of such non-reciprocal interactions has drawn a significant amount of interest in physics and other fields of sciences in recent years. We explore a non-reciprocal version of coupled oscillators (known as the Kuramoto model) with the aim of understanding the role of non-reciprocity, particularly in relation to chimera states, where oscillators spontaneously break into mutually synchronous and asynchronous groups. Our findings suggest that non-reciprocity not only alters the state diagram of the chimera state significantly but can also lead to new dynamical states, such as traveling chimera, run-and-chase and coexistence phases.</description>

      <title>Local and global bifurcations to large-scale oblique patterns in inclined layer convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the inclined layer convection system, thermal convection in a Rayleigh--B\'enard cell tilted against gravity, the flow is subject to competing buoyancy and shear forces. For varying inclination angle ($\gamma$) and Rayleigh number ($Ra$), a variety of spatio-temporal patterns is observed. We investigate the switching diamond panes (SDP) pattern, observed at $(\gamma, Ra)\simeq(100\degree,10000)$, which exhibits large-scale oblique features and is one of the five complex tertiary patterns at Prandtl number $Pr=1.07$. First, we study the linear instability of the secondary-state transverse convection rolls and the five branches including two travelling waves and three periodic orbits, bifurcating simultaneously from it. These non-generic bifurcations arise from the breaking of the spatial $D_4$ and $O(2)$ symmetries of transverse rolls, and the resulting bifurcated solutions show large-scale diamond-shaped amplitude modulations. Second, we explore a periodic orbit that captures both the large-scale structure and small-scale defects of modulated rolls. Parametric continuation in $Ra$ reveals the global homoclinic bifurcation via which this periodic orbit emerges. Third, the boundary of the basins of attraction of two dynamically relevant periodic orbits has been characterised. Specifically, additional steady and time-periodic solutions are identified on the basin boundary and their bifurcation structures are analysed. Together, using non-linear invariant solutions and their bifurcations, we take a further step toward understanding the emergence and dynamics of SDP far from the onset of convection, where linear methods have not been applied successfully.</description>

      <title>Identifying statistical indicators of temporal asymmetry using a data-driven approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of time-reversible systems are statistically indistinguishable when observed forward or backward in time. A rich literature of statistical methods to distinguish irreversible dynamics from the reversible dynamics of linear, Gaussian systems can provide insights into underlying mechanisms and aid modeling and statistical quantification of time-series data. But these existing time-reversibility metrics have been developed individually, forming a fragmented body of research that makes it challenging to identify the most effective approaches developed to date, and the most promising new directions for development. Here we address these issues by systematically evaluating over 6000 time-series summary statistics, derived from across the time-series analysis literature, on their ability to distinguish the time-irreversibility of data simulated from a diverse range of 35 systems. Our large-scale data-driven comparison highlights the effectiveness of several key families of statistics, including time-asymmetric forms of generalized autocorrelation functions, time-series symbolic sequences, and forecasting-related methods. All irreversible systems studied here could be accurately distinguished by a well-chosen time-series statistic, but no single statistic could accurately index the statistical form of irreversibility for all irreversible systems. This challenges the assumption that a given time-reversibility statistic will accurately capture time reversibility in general, and underscores the importance of tailoring statistical approaches to the time-reversal characteristics of a given system. Our results provide a unified understanding of the key algorithmic structures through which irreversibility can be effectively quantified from data, providing a foundation for connecting patterns in time series to the underlying mechanisms of the systems that generate them.</description>
