      <title>Rewriting Systems on Arbitrary Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce monoidal rewriting systems (MRS), an abstraction of string rewriting in which reductions are defined over an arbitrary ambient monoid rather than a free monoid of words. This shift is partly motivated by logic: the class of free monoids is not first-order axiomatizable, so "working in the free setting" cannot be treated internally when applying first-order methods to rewriting presentations.
  To analyze these systems categorically, we define $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ as the 2-category of Noetherian Confluent MRS. We then prove the existence of a canonical biadjunction between $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ and $\mathbf{Mon}$.
  Finally, we classify all Noetherian Confluent MRS that present a given fixed monoid. For this, we introduce Generalized Elementary Tietze Transformations (GETTs) and prove that any two presentations of a monoid are connected by a (possibly infinite) sequence of these transformations, yielding a complete characterization of generating systems up to GETT-equivalence.</description>

      <title>Digital Circuits as Moore Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0522</link>
      <description>arXiv:1003.0522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper illustrates a technique for specifying the timing, logical operation, and compositional circuit design of digital circuits in terms of ordinary state machines with output (Moore machines). The method is illustrated here with specifications of gates, latches, and other simple circuits and via the construction of devices starting with a SR latch built from gates. The method is based on "classical" automata and recursive functions on strings (sequential functions).</description>

      <title>From higher-order rewriting systems to higher-order categorial algebras and higher-order Curry-Howard isomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This ongoing project aims to define and investigate, from the standpoint of category theory, order theory and universal algebra, the notions of higher-order many-sorted rewriting system and of higher-order many-sorted categorial algebra and their relationships, via the higher-order Curry-Howard isomorphisms. The ultimate goal, to be developed in future versions of this work, is to define and investigate the category of towers, whose objects will consist of families, indexed by $\mathbb{N}$, of higher-order many-sorted rewriting systems and of higher-order many-sorted categorial algebras, including higher-order Curry-Howard type results for the latter, together with an additional structure that intertwines such $\mathbb{N}$-families; and whose morphism from a tower to another will be families, indexed by $\mathbb{N}$, of morphisms between its higher-order many-sorted rewriting systems and of higher-order many-sorted categorial algebras compatible with their structures. All feedback is appreciated.</description>
