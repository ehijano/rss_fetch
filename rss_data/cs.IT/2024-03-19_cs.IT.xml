      <title>Holographic Phase Retrieval via Wirtinger Flow: Cartesian Form with Auxiliary Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new gradient method for holography, where a phase-only hologram is parameterized by not only the phase but also amplitude. The key idea of our approach is the formulation of a phase-only hologram using an auxiliary amplitude. We optimize the parameters using the so-called Wirtinger flow algorithm in the Cartesian domain, which is a gradient method defined on the basis of the Wirtinger calculus. At the early stage of optimization, each element of the hologram exists inside a complex circle, and it can take a large gradient while diverging from the origin. This characteristic contributes to accelerating the gradient descent. Meanwhile, at the final stage of optimization, each element evolves along a complex circle, similar to previous state-of-the-art gradient methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods, primarily due to the optimization of the amplitude.</description>

      <title>Multiple Spectrally Null Constrained Complete Complementary Codes of Various Lengths Over Small Alphabet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complete complementary codes (CCCs) are highly valuable in the fields of information security, radar and communication. The spectrally null constrained (SNC) problem arises in radar and modern communication systems due to the reservation or prohibition of specific spectrums from transmission. The literature on SNC-CCCs is somewhat limited in comparison to the literature on traditional CCCs. The main objective of this paper is to discover several configurations of SNC-CCCs that possess more flexibility in their parameters. The proposed construction utilised the existing CCCs and mutually orthogonal sequences. The proposed construction can cover almost all lengths with the smallest alphabets $\{-1,0,1\}$. Further, the idea of SNC-CCC is extended to multiple SNC-CCC with an inter-set zero cross-correlation zone (ZCCZ). Based on our construction, we can also control the correlation value outside the ZCCZ. The beauty of the obtained codes have aperiodic and periodic inter-set ZCCZ and low cross-correlation side-lobs.</description>

      <title>Properties of the Strong Data Processing Constant for R\'enyi Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong data processing inequalities (SDPI) are an important object of study in Information Theory and have been well studied for $f$-divergences. Universal upper and lower bounds have been provided along with several applications, connecting them to impossibility (converse) results, concentration of measure, hypercontractivity, and so on. In this paper, we study R\'enyi divergence and the corresponding SDPI constant whose behavior seems to deviate from that of ordinary $\Phi$-divergences. In particular, one can find examples showing that the universal upper bound relating its SDPI constant to the one of Total Variation does not hold in general. In this work, we prove, however, that the universal lower bound involving the SDPI constant of the Chi-square divergence does indeed hold. Furthermore, we also provide a characterization of the distribution that achieves the supremum when $\alpha$ is equal to $2$ and consequently compute the SDPI constant for R\'enyi divergence of the general binary channel.</description>

      <title>Secure Distributed Storage: Optimal Trade-Off Between Storage Rate and Privacy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the problem of storing data in a distributed manner over $T$ servers. Specifically, the data needs to (i) be recoverable from any $\tau$ servers, and (ii) remain private from any $z$ colluding servers, where privacy is quantified in terms of mutual information between the data and all the information available at any $z$ colluding servers. For this model, our main results are (i) the fundamental trade-off between storage size and the level of desired privacy, and (ii) the optimal amount of local randomness necessary at the encoder. As a byproduct, our results provide an optimal lower bound on the individual share size of ramp secret sharing schemes under a more general leakage symmetry condition than the ones previously considered in the literature.</description>

      <title>LIGHTCODE: Light Analytical and Neural Codes for Channels with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of reliable and efficient codes for channels with feedback remains a longstanding challenge in communication theory. While significant improvements have been achieved by leveraging deep learning techniques, neural codes often suffer from high computational costs, a lack of interpretability, and limited practicality in resource-constrained settings. We focus on designing low-complexity coding schemes that are interpretable and more suitable for communication systems. We advance both analytical and neural codes. First, we demonstrate that POWERBLAST, an analytical coding scheme inspired by Schalkwijk-Kailath (SK) and Gallager-Nakiboglu (GN) schemes, achieves notable reliability improvements over both SK and GN schemes, outperforming neural codes in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. Next, to enhance reliability in low-SNR regions, we propose LIGHTCODE, a lightweight neural code that achieves state-of-the-art reliability while using a fraction of memory and compute compared to existing deep-learning-based codes. Finally, we systematically analyze the learned codes, establishing connections between LIGHTCODE and POWERBLAST, identifying components crucial for performance, and providing interpretation aided by linear regression analysis.</description>

      <title>Joint Power Allocation and Beamforming for In-band Full-duplex Multi-cell Multi-user Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a robust joint power allocation and beamforming scheme for in-band full-duplex multi-cell multi-user (IBFD-MCMU) networks. A mean-squared error (MSE) minimization problem is formulated with constraints on the power budgets and residual self-interference (RSI) power. The problem is not convex, so we decompose it into two sub-problems: interference management beamforming and power allocation, and give closed-form solutions to the sub-problems. Then we propose an iterative algorithm to yield an overall solution. The computational complexity and convergence behavior of the algorithm are analyzed. Our method can enhance the analog self-interference cancellation (ASIC) depth provided by the precoder with less effect on the downlink communication than the existing null-space projection method, inspiring a low-cost but efficient IBFD transceiver design. It can achieve 42.9% of IBFD gain in terms of spectral efficiency with only antenna isolation, while this value increases to 60.9% with further digital self-interference cancellation (DSIC). Numerical results illustrate that our algorithm is robust to hardware impairments and channel uncertainty. With sufficient ASIC depth, our method reduces the computation time by at least 20% than the existing scheme due to its faster convergence speed at the cost of &lt; 12.5% sum rate loss. The benefit is much more significant with single-antenna users that our algorithm saves at least 40% of the computation time at the cost of &lt; 10% sum rate reduction.</description>

      <title>CSI Transfer From Sub-6G to mmWave: Reduced-Overhead Multi-User Hybrid Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid beamforming is vital in modern wireless systems, especially for massive MIMO and millimeter-wave deployments, offering efficient directional transmission with reduced hardware complexity. However, effective beamforming in multi-user scenarios relies heavily on accurate channel state information, the acquisition of which often incurs excessive pilot overhead, degrading system performance. To address this and inspired by the spatial congruence between sub-6GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels, we propose a Sub-6G information Aided Multi-User Hybrid Beamforming (SA-MUHBF) framework, avoiding excessive use of pilots. SA-MUHBF employs a convolutional neural network to predict mmWave beamspace from sub-6G channel estimate, followed by a novel multi-layer graph neural network for analog beam selection and a linear minimum mean-square error algorithm for digital beamforming. Numerical results demonstrate that SA-MUHBF efficiently predicts the mmWave beamspace representation and achieves superior spectrum efficiency over state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, SA-MUHBF demonstrates robust performance across varied sub-6G system configurations and exhibits strong generalization to unseen scenarios.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Transmitting and Reflecting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Empowered Cooperative Rate Splitting with User Relaying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we unveil the advantages of synergizing cooperative rate splitting (CRS) with user relaying and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR RIS). Specifically, we propose a novel STAR RIS-assisted CRS transmission framework, featuring six unique transmission modes that leverage various combination of the relaying protocols (including full duplex-FD and half duplex-HD) and the STAR RIS configuration protocols (including energy splitting-ES, mode switching-MS, and time splitting-TS). With the objective of maximizing the minimum user rate, we then propose a unified successive convex approximation (SCA)-based alternative optimization (AO) algorithm to jointly optimize the transmit active beamforming, common rate allocation, STAR RIS passive beamforming, as well as time allocation (for HD or TS protocols) subject to the transmit power constraint at the base station (BS) and the law of energy conservation at the STAR RIS. To alleviate the computational burden, we further propose a low-complexity algorithm that incorporates a closed-form passive beamforming design. Numerical results show that our proposed framework significantly enhances user fairness compared with conventional CRS schemes without STAR RIS or other STAR RIS empowered multiple access schemes. Moreover, the proposed low-complexity algorithm dramatically reduces the computational complexity while achieving very close performance to the AO method.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multi-Objective Dynamic Offloading Scheduling for Air-Ground Cooperative MEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with edge server to assist terrestrial mobile edge computing (MEC) has attracted tremendous attention. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art schemes based on deterministic optimizations or single-objective reinforcement learning (RL) cannot reduce the backlog of task bits and simultaneously improve energy efficiency in highly dynamic network environments, where the design problem amounts to a sequential decision-making problem. In order to address the aforementioned problems, as well as the curses of dimensionality introduced by the growing number of terrestrial terrestrial users, this paper proposes a distributed multi-objective (MO) dynamic trajectory planning and offloading scheduling scheme, integrated with MORL and the kernel method. The design of n-step return is also applied to average fluctuations in the backlog. Numerical results reveal that the n-step return can benefit the proposed kernel-based approach, achieving significant improvement in the long-term average backlog performance, compared to the conventional 1-step return design. Due to such design and the kernel-based neural network, to which decision-making features can be continuously added, the kernel-based approach can outperform the approach based on fully-connected deep neural network, yielding improvement in energy consumption and the backlog performance, as well as a significant reduction in decision-making and online learning time.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Graph Capacity with Quantum Mechanics and Finite Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The zero-error capacity of a channel (or Shannon capacity of a graph) quantifies how much information can be transmitted with no risk of error. In contrast to the Shannon capacity of a channel, the zero-error capacity has not even been shown to be computable: we have no convergent upper bounds. In this work, we present a new quantity, the zero-error {\em unitary} capacity, and show that it can be succinctly represented as the tensor product value of a quantum game. By studying the structure of finite automata, we show that the unitary capacity is within a controllable factor of the zero-error capacity. This allows new upper bounds through the sum-of-squares hierarchy, which converges to the commuting operator value of the game. Under the conjecture that the commuting operator and tensor product value of this game are equal, this would yield an algorithm for computing the zero-error capacity.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Index Modulation Aided Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access via Constellation Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been widely nominated as an emerging spectral efficiency (SE) multiple access technique for the next generation of wireless communication network. To meet the growing demands in massive connectivity and huge data in transmission, a novel index modulation aided NOMA with the rotation of signal constellation of low power users (IM-NOMA-RC) is developed to the downlink transmission. In the proposed IM-NOMA-RC system, the users are classified into far-user group and near-user group according to their channel conditions, where the rotation constellation based IM operation is performed only on the users who belong to the near-user group that are allocated lower power compared with the far ones to transmit extra information. In the proposed IM-NOMA-RC, all the subcarriers are activated to transmit information to multiple users to achieve higher SE. With the aid of the multiple dimension modulation in IM-NOMA-RC, more users can be supported over an orthogonal resource block. Then, both maximum likelihood (ML) detector and successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector are studied for all the user. Numerical simulation results of the proposed IM-NOMARC scheme are investigate for the ML detector and the SIC detector for each users, which shows that proposed scheme can outperform conventional NOMA.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Outage Probability Analysis for Downlink RIS-NOMA Networks with On-Off Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been regarded as a promising technology since it has ability to create the favorable channel conditions. This paper investigates the secure communications of RIS assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks, where both external and internal eavesdropping scenarios are taken into consideration. More specifically, novel approximate and asymptotic expressions of secrecy outage probability (SOP) for the k-th legitimate user (LU) are derived by invoking imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) and perfect successive interference cancellation (pSIC). To characterize the secrecy performance of RIS-NOMA networks, the diversity order of the k-th LU with ipSIC/pSIC is obtained in the high signal-to-noise ratio region. The secrecy system throughput of RIS-NOMA networks is discussed in delay-limited transmission mode. Numerical results are presented to verify theoretical analysis that: i) The SOP of RIS-NOMA networks is superior to that of RIS assisted orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and conventional cooperative communication schemes; ii) As the number of reflecting elements increases, the RIS-NOMA networks are capable of achieving the enhanced secrecy performance; and iii) The RIS-NOMA networks have better secrecy system throughput than that of RIS-OMA networks and conventional cooperative communication schemes.</description>

      <title>Secure Communication of Active RIS Assisted NOMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a revolutionary technology, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been deemed as an indispensable part of the 6th generation communications due to its inherent ability to regulate the wireless channels. However, passive RIS (PRIS) still suffers from some pressing issues, one of which is that the fading of the entire reflection link is proportional to the product of the distances from the base station to the PRIS and from the PRIS to the users, i.e., the productive attenuation. To tackle this problem, active RIS (ARIS) has been proposed to reconfigure the wireless propagation condition and alleviate the productive attenuation. In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security of the ARIS assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks with the attendance of external and internal eavesdroppers. To be specific, the closed-form expressions of secrecy outage probability (SOP) and secrecy system throughput are derived by invoking both imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) and perfect SIC. The secrecy diversity orders of legitimate users are obtained at high signal-to-noise ratios. Numerical results are presented to verify the accuracy of the theoretical expressions and indicate that: i) The SOP of ARIS assisted NOMA networks exceeds that of PRIS-NOMA, ARIS/PRIS-assisted orthogonal multiple access (OMA); ii) Due to the balance between the thermal noise and residual interference, introducing excess reconfigurable elements at ARIS is not helpful to reduce the SOP; and iii) The secrecy throughput performance of ARIS-NOMA networks outperforms that of PRIS-NOMA and ARIS/PRIS-OMA networks.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Performance Analysis of RIS Assisted Ambient Backscatter Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) have been envisioned as two promising technologies due to their high transmission reliability as well as energy-efficiency. This paper investigates the secrecy performance of RIS assisted AmBC networks. New closed-form and asymptotic expressions of secrecy outage probability for RIS-AmBC networks are derived by taking into account both imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) and perfect SIC (pSIC) cases. On top of these, the secrecy diversity order of legitimate user is obtained in high signal-to-noise ratio region, which equals \emph{zero} and is proportional to the number of RIS elements for ipSIC and pSIC, respectively. The secrecy throughput and energy efficiency are further surveyed to evaluate the secure effectiveness of RIS-AmBC networks. Numerical results are provided to verify the accuracy of theoretical analyses and manifest that: i) The secrecy outage behavior of RIS-AmBC networks exceeds that of conventional AmBC networks; ii) Due to the mutual interference between direct and backscattering links, the number of RIS elements has an optimal value to minimise the secrecy system outage probability; and iii) Secrecy throughput and energy efficiency are strongly influenced by the reflecting coefficient and eavesdropper's wiretapping ability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, random signaling is used to convey useful information as well as sense the environment. Such randomness poses challenges in various components in sensing signal processing. In this paper, we investigate quantizer design for sensing in ISAC systems. Unlike quantizers for channel estimation in massive multiple-input-multiple-out (MIMO) communication systems, sensing in ISAC systems needs to deal with random nonorthogonal transmitted signals rather than a fixed orthogonal pilot. Considering sensing performance and hardware implementation, we focus on task-based hardware-limited quantization with spatial analog combining. We propose two strategies of quantizer optimization, i.e., data-dependent (DD) and data-independent (DI). The former achieves optimized sensing performance with high implementation overhead. To reduce hardware complexity, the latter optimizes the quantizer with respect to the random signal from a stochastic perspective. We derive the optimal quantizers for both strategies and formulate an algorithm based on sample average approximation (SAA) to solve the optimization in the DI strategy. Numerical results show that the optimized quantizers outperform digital-only quantizers in terms of sensing performance. Additionally, the DI strategy, despite its lower computational complexity compared to the DD strategy, achieves near-optimal sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Interference Cancellation for OTFS-Based Over-the-Air Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates over-the-air computation (AirComp) in the context of multiple-access time-varying multipath channels. We focus on a scenario where devices with high mobility transmit their sensing data to a fusion center (FC) for averaging. To combat the time-varying channel and Doppler effect, each device adopts orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation. After signals are received by the FC, the aggregated data undergoes demodulation and estimation within the delay-Doppler domain. We leverage the mean squared error (MSE) as a metric for the computational error of OTFS-based AirComp. We then derive the optimal transmit power at each device and signal scaling factor at FC for minimizing MSE. Notably, the performance of OTFS-based AirComp is not only affected by the noise but also by the inter-symbol interference and inter-link interference arising from the multipath channel. To counteract the interference-induced computational errors, we incorporate zero-padding (ZP)-assisted OTFS into AirComp and propose algorithms for interference cancellation. Numerical results underscore the enhanced performance of ZP-assisted OTFS-based AirComp over naive OTFS-based AirComp.</description>

      <title>Deep Holes of Twisted Reed-Solomon Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deep holes of a linear code are the vectors that achieve the maximum error distance to the code. There has been extensive research on the topic of deep holes in Reed-Solomon codes. As a generalization of Reed-Solomon codes, we investigate the problem of deep holes of a class of twisted Reed-Solomon codes in this paper. The covering radius and a standard class of deep holes of twisted Reed-Solomon codes ${\rm TRS}_k(\mathcal{A}, \theta)$ are obtained for a general evaluation set $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$. Furthermore, we consider the problem of determining all deep holes of the full-length twisted Reed-Solomon codes ${\rm TRS}_k(\mathbb{F}_q, \theta)$. Specifically, we prove that there are no other deep holes of ${\rm TRS}_k(\mathbb{F}_q, \theta)$ for $\frac{3q-8}{4} \leq k\leq q-4$ when $q$ is even, and $\frac{3q+2\sqrt{q}-7}{4} \leq k\leq q-4$ when $q$ is odd. We also completely determine their deep holes for $q-3 \leq k \leq q-1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA codes have many applications, such as in data storage, DNA computing, etc. Good DNA codes have large sizes and satisfy some certain constraints. In this paper, we present a new construction method for reversible DNA codes. We show that the DNA codes obtained using our construction method can satisfy some desired constraints and the lower bounds of the sizes of some DNA codes are better than the known results. We also give new lower bounds on the sizes of some DNA codes of lengths $80$, $96$ and $160$ for some fixed Hamming distance $d$.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Semantic-Bit Coexisting Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is emerging as a key technology for future sixth-generation (6G) systems. Unlike traditional bit-level communication (BitCom), SemCom directly optimizes performance at the semantic level, leading to supe- rior communication efficiency. Nevertheless, the task-oriented nature of SemCom renders it challenging to completely replace BitCom. Consequently, it is desired to consider a semantic-bit coexisting communication system, where a base station (BS) serves SemCom users (sem-users) and BitCom users (bit-users) simultaneously. Such a system faces severe and heterogeneous inter-user interference. In this context, this paper provides a new semantic-bit coexisting communication framework and proposes a spatial beamforming scheme to accommodate both types of users. Specifically, we consider maximizing the semantic rate for semantic users while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for bit-users. Due to the intractability of obtaining the exact closed-form expression of the semantic rate, a data driven method is first applied to attain an approximated expression via data fitting. With the resulting complex transcendental function, majorization minimization (MM) is adopted to convert the original formulated problem into a multiple-ratio problem, which allows fractional programming (FP) to be used to further transform the problem into an inhomogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQP) problem. Solving the problem leads to a semi-closed form solution with undetermined Lagrangian factors that can be updated by a fixed point algorithm. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beamforming scheme significantly outperforms conventional beamforming algorithms such as zero-forcing (ZF), maximum ratio transmission (MRT), and weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE).</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Codes for $(t,s)$-Burst Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, codes for correcting a burst of errors have attracted significant attention. One of the most important reasons is that bursts of errors occur in certain emerging techniques, such as DNA storage. In this paper, we investigate a type of error, called a $(t,s)$-burst, which deletes $t$ consecutive symbols and inserts $s$ arbitrary symbols at the same coordinate. Note that a $(t,s)$-burst error can be seen as a generalization of a burst of insertions ($t=0$), a burst of deletions ($s=0$), and a burst of substitutions ($t=s$). Our main contribution is to give explicit constructions of $q$-ary $(t,s)$-burst correcting codes with $\log n + O(1)$ bits of redundancy for any given non-negative integers $t$, $s$, and $q \geq 2$. These codes have optimal redundancy up to an additive constant. Furthermore, we apply our $(t,s)$-burst correcting codes to combat other various types of errors and improve the corresponding results. In particular, one of our byproducts is a permutation code capable of correcting a burst of $t$ stable deletions with $\log n + O(1)$ bits of redundancy, which is optimal up to an additive constant.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Constructions of $\ell$-Read Codes under the Hamming Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanopore sequencing is a promising technology for DNA sequencing. In this paper, we investigate a specific model of the nanopore sequencer, which takes a $q$-ary sequence of length $n$ as input and outputs a vector of length $n+\ell-1$ referred to as an $\ell$-read vector where the $i$-th entry is a multi-set composed of the $\ell$ elements located between the $(i-\ell+1)$-th and $i$-th positions of the input sequence. Considering the presence of substitution errors in the output vector, we study $\ell$-read codes under the Hamming metric. An $\ell$-read $(n,d)_q$-code is a set of $q$-ary sequences of length $n$ in which the Hamming distance between $\ell$-read vectors of any two distinct sequences is at least $d$. We first improve the result of Banerjee \emph{et al.}, who studied $\ell$-read $(n,d)_q$-codes with the constraint $\ell\geq 3$ and $d=3$. Then, we investigate the bounds and constructions of $2$-read codes with a minimum distance of $3$, $4$, and $5$, respectively. Our results indicate that when $d \in \{3,4\}$, the optimal redundancy of $2$-read $(n,d)_q$-codes is $o(\log_q n)$, while for $d=5$ it is $\log_q n+o(\log_q n)$. Additionally, we establish an equivalence between $2$-read $(n,3)_q$-codes and classical $q$-ary single-insertion reconstruction codes using two noisy reads. We improve the lower bound on the redundancy of classical $q$-ary single-insertion reconstruction codes as well as the upper bound on the redundancy of classical $q$-ary single-deletion reconstruction codes when using two noisy reads. Finally, we study $\ell$-read codes under the reconstruction model.</description>

      <title>Full-Duplex Beamforming Systems with Coarse Quantization: How Many Bits Do We Need?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates full-duplex (FD) multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) system design with coarse quantization. We first analyze the impact of self-interference (SI) on quantization in FD single-input single-output systems. The analysis elucidates that the minimum required number of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) bits is logarithmically proportional to the ratio of total received power to the received power of desired signals. Motivated by this, we design a FD MIMO beamforming method that effectively manages the SI. Dividing a spectral efficiency maximization beamforming problem into two sub-problems for alternating optimization, we address the first by optimizing the precoder: obtaining a generalized eigenvalue problem from the first-order optimality condition, where the principal eigenvector is the optimal stationary solution, and adopting a power iteration method to identify this eigenvector. Subsequently, a quantization-aware minimum mean square error combiner is computed for the derived precoder. Through numerical studies, we observe that the proposed beamformer reduces the minimum required number of ADC bits for achieving higher spectral efficiency than that of half-duplex (HD) systems, compared to FD benchmarks. The overall analysis shows that, unlike with quantized HD systems, more than 6 bits are required for the ADC to fully realize the potential of the quantized FD system.</description>

      <title>RIS-aided Single-frequency 3D Imaging by Exploiting Multi-view Image Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieving range information in three-dimensional (3D) radio imaging is particularly challenging due to the limited communication bandwidth and pilot resources. To address this issue, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided uplink communication scenario, generating multiple measurements through RIS phase adjustment. This study successfully realizes 3D single-frequency imaging by exploiting the near-field multi-view image correlations deduced from user mobility. We first highlight the significance of considering anisotropy in multi-view image formation by investigating radar cross-section properties and diffraction resolution limits. We then propose a novel model for joint multi-view 3D imaging that incorporates occlusion effects and anisotropic scattering. These factors lead to slow image support variation and smooth coefficient evolution, which are mathematically modeled as Markov processes. Based on this model, we employ the Expectation Maximization-Turbo-Generalized Approximate Message Passing algorithm for joint multi-view single-frequency 3D imaging with limited measurements. Simulation results reveal the superiority of joint multi-view imaging in terms of enhanced imaging ranges, accuracies, and anisotropy characterization compared to single-view imaging. Combining adjacent observations for joint multi-view imaging enables a reduction in the measurement overhead by 80%.</description>

      <title>Binary Codes for Correcting Two Edits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edit refers to a single insertion, deletion, or substitution. This paper aims to construct binary codes that can correct two edits. To do this, a necessary and sufficient condition for a code to be two-edit correctable is provided, showing that a code is a two-edit correcting code if and only if it can correct two deletions, up to two substitutions, and one deletion and up to one substitution, separately. This criterion allows for the construction of two-edit correcting codes leveraging these three types of error correcting codes. In the field of constructing codes for correcting two deletions, we modify the construction presented by Guruswami and H{\aa}stad and give an alternative proof. Moreover, our two-deletion correcting codes can also correct up to two substitutions after making a slight modification. In the field of constructing codes for correcting one deletion and up to one substitution, we present a construction with $(4+o(1)) \log n$ redundant bits, which outperforms the best previously known results $(6+o(1)) \log n$. Leveraging these codes, we obtain a construction of two-edit correcting codes with $(6+o(1)) \log n$ redundant bits, which outperforms the best previously known results $(8+o(1)) \log n$. Moreover, we also consider the list-decoding problem under the two-edit channel and construct a two-edit list-decodable code with a list size of two employing $(4+o(1)) \log n$ redundant bits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study on minimal linear codes has received great attention due to their significant applications in secret sharing schemes and secure two-party computation. Until now, numerous minimal linear codes have been discovered. However, to the best of our knowledge, no infinite family of minimal ternary linear codes was found from vectorial functions. In this paper, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for a large class of ternary linear codes from vectorial functions such that those codes are minimal. Based on that, we construct several minimal ternary linear codes with three-weight from vectorial regular plateaued functions, and determine their weight distributions. Moreover, we also give a necessary and sufficient condition for a large family of ternary linear codes from vectorial functions such that the codes are minimal and violate the AB condition simultaneously. According to this characterization, we find several minimal ternary linear codes violating the AB condition. Notably, our results show that our method can be applied to solve a problem on minimal linear codes proposed by Li et al.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolving environment of mobile edge computing (MEC), optimizing system performance to meet the growing demand for low-latency computing services is a top priority. Integrating fluidic antenna (FA) technology into MEC networks provides a new approach to address this challenge. This letter proposes an FA-enabled MEC scheme that aims to minimize the total system delay by leveraging the mobility of FA to enhance channel conditions and improve computational offloading efficiency. By establishing an optimization problem focusing on the joint optimization of computation offloading and antenna positioning, we introduce an alternating iterative algorithm based on the interior point method and particle swarm optimization (IPPSO). Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed scheme compared to traditional fixed antenna positions, showing significant improvements in transmission rates and reductions in delays. The proposed IPPSO algorithm exhibits robust convergence properties, further validating the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Enhanced Channel Estimation for Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future sixth-generation (6G) systems are expected to leverage extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) technology, which significantly expands the range of the near-field region. The spherical wavefront characteristics in the near field introduce additional degrees of freedom (DoFs), namely distance and angle, into the channel model, which leads to unique challenges in channel estimation (CE). In this paper, we propose a new sensing-enhanced uplink CE scheme for near-field XL-MIMO, which notably reduces the required quantity of baseband samples and the dictionary size. In particular, we first propose a sensing method that can be accomplished in a single time slot. It employs power sensors embedded within the antenna elements to measure the received power pattern rather than baseband samples. A time inversion algorithm is then proposed to precisely estimate the locations of users and scatterers, which offers a substantially lower computational complexity. Based on the estimated locations from sensing, a novel dictionary is then proposed by considering the eigen-problem based on the near-field transmission model, which facilitates efficient near-field CE with less baseband sampling and a more lightweight dictionary. Moreover, we derive the general form of the eigenvectors associated with the near-field channel matrix, revealing their noteworthy connection to the discrete prolate spheroidal sequence (DPSS). Simulation results unveil that the proposed time inversion algorithm achieves accurate localization with power measurements only, and remarkably outperforms various widely-adopted algorithms in terms of computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed eigen-dictionary considerably improves the accuracy in CE with a compact dictionary size and a drastic reduction in baseband samples by up to 77%.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Sub-band Allocation Algorithms in In-body Sub-networks Supporting XR Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-body subnetworks (IBS) are envisioned to support reliable wireless connectivity for emerging applications including extended reality (XR) in the human body. As the deployment of in-body sub-networks is uncontrollable by nature, the dynamic radio resource allocation scheme in place becomes of the uttermost importance for the performance of the in-body sub-networks. This paper provides a comparative study on the performance of the state-of-the-art interference-aware sub-band allocation algorithms in in-body sub-networks supporting the XR applications. The study identified suitable models for characterizing in-body sub-networks which are used in a snapshot-based simulation framework to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of state-of-art sub-band allocation algorithms, including greedy selection, sequential greedy selection (SG), centralized graph coloring (CGC), and sequential iterative sub-band allocation (SISA). The study shows that for XR requirements, the SISA and SG algorithms can support IBS densities up to 75% higher than CGC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we investigate the value of information as a more comprehensive instrument than the age of information for optimally shaping the information flow in a networked control system. In particular, we quantify the value of information based on the variation in a value function, and discuss the structural properties of this metric. Through our analysis, we establish the mathematical relation between the value of information and the age of information. We prove that the value of information is in general a function of an estimation discrepancy that depends on the age of information and the primitive variables. In addition, we prove that there exists a condition under which the value of information becomes completely expressible in terms of the age of information. Nonetheless, we show that this condition is not achievable without a degradation in the performance of the system.</description>

We begin our analysis by formulating a causal tradeoff between the packet rate and the regulation cost, with an encoder and a decoder as two distributed decision makers, and show that the valuation of information is conceivable and quantifiable grounded on this tradeoff. More precisely, we characterize an equilibrium, and quantify the value of information there as the variation in a value function with respect to a piece of sensory measurement that can be communicated from the encoder to the decoder at each time. We prove that, in feedback control of a dynamical process over a noiseless channel, the value of information is a function of the discrepancy between the state estimates at the encoder and the decoder, and that a data packet containing a sensory measurement at each time should be exchanged only if the value of information at that time is nonnegative. Finally, we prove that the characterized equilibrium is in fact globally optimal.</description>

      <title>Consistency of Value of Information: Effects of Packet Loss and Time Delay in Networked Control Systems Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we study the consistency of the value of information$\unicode{x2014}$a semantic metric that claims to determine the right piece of information in networked control systems tasks$\unicode{x2014}$in a lossy and delayed communication regime. Our analysis begins with a focus on state estimation, and subsequently extends to feedback control. To that end, we make a causal tradeoff between the packet rate and the mean square error. Associated with this tradeoff, we demonstrate the existence of an optimal policy profile, comprising a symmetric threshold scheduling policy based on the value of information for the encoder and a non-Gaussian linear estimation policy for the decoder. Our structural results assert that the scheduling policy is expressible in terms of $3d-1$ variables related to the source and the channel, where $d$ is the time delay, and that the estimation policy incorporates no residual related to signaling. We then construct an optimal control policy by exploiting the separation principle.</description>

      <title>Process-and-Forward: Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding Over Cooperative Relay Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) approach to image transmission over a cooperative relay channel. The relay either amplifies and forwards a scaled version of its received signal, referred to as DeepJSCC-AF, or leverages neural networks to extract relevant features about the source signal before forwarding it to the destination, which we call DeepJSCC-PF (Process-and-Forward). In the full-duplex scheme, inspired by the block Markov coding (BMC) concept, we introduce a novel block transmission strategy built upon novel vision transformer architecture. In the proposed scheme, the source transmits information in blocks, and the relay updates its knowledge about the input signal after each block and generates its own signal to be conveyed to the destination. To enhance practicality, we introduce an adaptive transmission model, which allows a single trained DeepJSCC model to adapt seamlessly to various channel qualities, making it a versatile solution. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed DeepJSCC compared to the state-of-the-art BPG image compression algorithm, even when operating at the maximum achievable rate of conventional decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward protocols, for both half-duplex and full-duplex relay scenarios.</description>

      <title>Modelling co-evolution of resource feedback and social network dynamics in human-environmental systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Games with environmental feedback have become a crucial area of study across various scientific domains, modelling the dynamic interplay between human decisions and environmental changes, and highlighting the consequences of our choices on natural resources and biodiversity. In this work, we propose a co-evolutionary model for human-environment systems that incorporates the effects of knowledge feedback and social interaction on the sustainability of common pool resources. The model represents consumers as agents who adjust their resource extraction based on the resource's state. These agents are connected through social networks, where links symbolize either affinity or aversion among them. The interplay between social dynamics and resource dynamics is explored, with the system's evolution analyzed across various network topologies and initial conditions. We find that knowledge feedback can independently sustain common pool resources. However, the impact of social interactions on sustainability is dual-faceted: it can either support or impede sustainability, influenced by the network's connectivity and heterogeneity. A notable finding is the identification of a critical network mean degree, beyond which a depletion/repletion transition parallels an absorbing/active state transition in social dynamics, i.e., individual agents and their connections are/are not prone to being frozen in their social states. Furthermore, the study examines the evolution of the social network, revealing the emergence of two polarized groups where agents within each community have the same affinity. Comparative analyses using Monte-Carlo simulations and rate equations are employed, along with analytical arguments, to reinforce the study's findings. The model successfully captures how information spread and social dynamics may impact the sustanebility of common pool resource.</description>

Abstract: We consider extended $1$-perfect codes in Hamming graphs $H(n,q)$. Such nontrivial codes are known only when $n=2^k$, $k\geq 1$, $q=2$, or $n=q+2$, $q=2^m$, $m\geq 1$. Recently, Bespalov proved nonexistence of extended $1$-perfect codes for $q=3$, $4$, $n&gt;q+2$. In this work, we characterize all positive integers $n$, $r$ and prime $p$, for which there exist such a code in $H(n,p^r)$.</description>

      <title>Regulating Chatbot Output via Inter-Informational Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of ChatGPT has sparked over a year of regulatory frenzy. However, few existing studies have rigorously questioned the assumption that, if left unregulated, AI chatbot's output would inflict tangible, severe real harm on human affairs. Most researchers have overlooked the critical possibility that the information market itself can effectively mitigate these risks and, as a result, they tend to use regulatory tools to address the issue directly. This Article develops a yardstick for reevaluating both AI-related content risks and corresponding regulatory proposals by focusing on inter-informational competition among various outlets. The decades-long history of regulating information and communications technologies indicates that regulators tend to err too much on the side of caution and to put forward excessive regulatory measures when encountering the uncertainties brought about by new technologies. In fact, a trove of empirical evidence has demonstrated that market competition among information outlets can effectively mitigate most risks and that overreliance on regulation is not only unnecessary but detrimental, as well. This Article argues that sufficient competition among chatbots and other information outlets in the information marketplace can sufficiently mitigate and even resolve most content risks posed by generative AI technologies. This renders certain loudly advocated regulatory strategies, like mandatory prohibitions, licensure, curation of datasets, and notice-and-response regimes, truly unnecessary and even toxic to desirable competition and innovation throughout the AI industry. Ultimately, the ideas that I advance in this Article should pour some much-needed cold water on the regulatory frenzy over generative AI and steer the issue back to a rational track.</description>

      <title>Wavenumber Domain Sparse Channel Estimation in Holographic MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the sparse channel estimation in holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) systems. The conventional angular-domain representation fails to capture the continuous angular power spectrum characterized by the spatially-stationary electromagnetic random field, thus leading to the ambiguous detection of the significant angular power, which is referred to as the power leakage. To tackle this challenge, the HMIMO channel is represented in the wavenumber domain for exploring its cluster-dominated sparsity. Specifically, a finite set of Fourier harmonics acts as a series of sampling probes to encapsulate the integral of the power spectrum over specific angular regions. This technique effectively eliminates power leakage resulting from power mismatches induced by the use of discrete angular-domain probes. Next, the channel estimation problem is recast as a sparse recovery of the significant angular power spectrum over the continuous integration region. We then propose an accompanying graph-cut-based swap expansion (GCSE) algorithm to extract beneficial sparsity inherent in HMIMO channels. Numerical results demonstrate that this wavenumber-domainbased GCSE approach achieves robust performance with rapid convergence.</description>

      <title>Prior-dependent analysis of posterior sampling reinforcement learning with function approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work advances randomized exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation modeled by linear mixture MDPs. We establish the first prior-dependent Bayesian regret bound for RL with function approximation; and refine the Bayesian regret analysis for posterior sampling reinforcement learning (PSRL), presenting an upper bound of ${\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{H^3 T \log T})$, where $d$ represents the dimensionality of the transition kernel, $H$ the planning horizon, and $T$ the total number of interactions. This signifies a methodological enhancement by optimizing the $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log T})$ factor over the previous benchmark (Osband and Van Roy, 2014) specified to linear mixture MDPs. Our approach, leveraging a value-targeted model learning perspective, introduces a decoupling argument and a variance reduction technique, moving beyond traditional analyses reliant on confidence sets and concentration inequalities to formalize Bayesian regret bounds more effectively.</description>

      <title>Measuring Quantum Information Leakage Under Detection Threat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gentle quantum leakage is proposed as a measure of information leakage to arbitrary eavesdroppers that aim to avoid detection. Gentle (also sometimes referred to as weak or non-demolition) measurements are used to encode the desire of the eavesdropper to evade detection. The gentle quantum leakage meets important axioms proposed for measures of information leakage including positivity, independence, and unitary invariance. Global depolarizing noise, an important family of physical noise in quantum devices, is shown to reduce gentle quantum leakage (and hence can be used as a mechanism to ensure privacy or security). A lower bound for the gentle quantum leakage based on asymmetric approximate cloning is presented. This lower bound relates information leakage to mutual incompatibility of quantum states. A numerical example, based on the encoding in the celebrated BB84 quantum key distribution algorithm, is used to demonstrate the results.</description>

      <title>Span-Based Optimal Sample Complexity for Weakly Communicating and General Average Reward MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in an average-reward Markov decision process (MDP) under a generative model. For weakly communicating MDPs, we establish the complexity bound $\tilde{O}(SA\frac{H}{\epsilon^2})$, where $H$ is the span of the bias function of the optimal policy and $SA$ is the cardinality of the state-action space. Our result is the first that is minimax optimal (up to log factors) in all parameters $S,A,H$ and $\epsilon$, improving on existing work that either assumes uniformly bounded mixing times for all policies or has suboptimal dependence on the parameters. We further investigate sample complexity in general (non-weakly-communicating) average-reward MDPs. We argue a new transient time parameter $B$ is necessary, establish an $\tilde{O}(SA\frac{B+H}{\epsilon^2})$ complexity bound, and prove a matching (up to log factors) minimax lower bound. Both results are based on reducing the average-reward MDP to a discounted MDP, which requires new ideas in the general setting. To establish the optimality of this reduction, we develop improved bounds for $\gamma$-discounted MDPs, showing that $\tilde{\Omega}\left(SA\frac{H}{(1-\gamma)^2\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples suffice to learn an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in weakly communicating MDPs under the regime that $\gamma\geq 1-1/H$, and $\tilde{\Omega}\left(SA\frac{B+H}{(1-\gamma)^2\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples suffice in general MDPs when $\gamma\geq 1-\frac{1}{B+H}$. Both these results circumvent the well-known lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}\left(SA\frac{1}{(1-\gamma)^3\epsilon^2}\right)$ for arbitrary $\gamma$-discounted MDPs. Our analysis develops upper bounds on certain instance-dependent variance parameters in terms of the span and transient time parameters. The weakly communicating bounds are tighter than those based on the mixing time or diameter of the MDP and may be of broader use.</description>

Abstract: The optimal coordination rates are determined in three primary settings of multi-partite quantum networks, thus characterizing the minimal resources required in order to simulate a joint quantum state among multiple parties. We study the following models: (1) a cascade network with limited entanglement, (2) a broadcast network, which consists of a single sender and two receivers, (3) a multiple-access network with two senders and a single receiver. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions on the asymptotically-achievable communication and entanglement rates in each setting. At last, we show the implications of our results on nonlocal games with quantum strategies.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new method to protect Over-The-Air (OTA) computation schemes against passive eavesdropping. Our method uses a friendly jammer whose signal is -- contrary to common intuition -- stronger at the legitimate receiver than it is at the eavesdropper. We focus on the computation of arithmetic averages over an OTA channel. The derived secrecy guarantee translates to a lower bound on the eavesdropper's mean square error while the question of how to provide operationally more significant guarantees such as semantic security remains open for future work. The key ingredients in proving the security guarantees are a known result on channel resolvability and a generalization of existing achievability results on coding for compound channels.</description>

Abstract: By generalizing the stabilizer quantum error-correcting codes, entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting (EAQEC) codes were introduced, which could be derived from any classical linear codes via the relaxation of self-orthogonality conditions with the aid of pre-shared entanglement between the sender and the receiver. In this paper, three classes of entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting maximum-distance-separable (EAQMDS) codes are constructed through generalized Reed-Solomon codes. Under our constructions, the minimum distances of our EAQMDS codes are much larger than those of the known EAQMDS codes of the same lengths that consume the same number of ebits. Furthermore, some of the lengths of the EAQMDS codes are not divisors of $q^2-1$, which are completely new and unlike all those known lengths existed before.</description>

      <title>Capacity Gains in MIMO Systems with Few-Bit ADCs Using Nonlinear Analog Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) are a major contributor to the power consumption of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers with large antenna arrays operating in the millimeter wave carrier frequencies. This is especially the case in large bandwidth communication systems, due to the sudden drop in energy-efficiency of ADCs as the sampling rate is increased above 100MHz. Two mitigating energy-efficient approaches which have received significant recent interest are i) to reduce the number of ADCs via analog and hybrid beamforming architectures, and ii) to reduce the resolution of the ADCs which in turn decreases power consumption. However, decreasing the number and resolution of ADCs leads to performance loss -- in terms of achievable rates -- due to increased quantization error. In this work, we study the application of practically implementable nonlinear analog operators such as envelope detectors and polynomial operators, prior to sampling and quantization at the ADCs, as a way to mitigate the aforementioned rate-loss. A receiver architecture consisting of linear analog combiners, nonlinear analog operators, and few-bit ADCs is designed. The fundamental information theoretic performance limits of the resulting communication system, in terms of achievable rates, are investigated under various assumptions on the set of implementable analog operators. Extensive numerical evaluations and simulations of the communication system are provided to compare the set of achievable rates under different architecture designs and parameters. Circuit simulations and measurement results, based on both 22 nm FDSOI CMOS technology and 65 nm Bulk CMOS transistor technologies, are provided to justify the power efficiency of the proposed receiver architecture deploying envelope detectors and polynomial operators.</description>

Abstract: On a Goppa code whose structure polynomial has coefficients in the symbol field, the Frobenius acts. Its fixed codewords form a subcode. Deleting the naturally occurred redundance, we obtain a new code. It is proved that these new codes approach the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. It is also proved that these codes can be decoded within $O(n^2(\logn)^a)$ operations in the symbol field, which is usually much small than the location field, where $n$ is the codeword length, and $a$ a constant determined by the polynomial factorization algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resolution of the P vs. NP problem, a cornerstone in computational theory, remains elusive despite extensive exploration through mathematical logic and algorithmic theory. This paper takes a novel approach by integrating information theory, thermodynamics, and computational complexity, offering a comprehensive landscape of interdisciplinary study. We focus on entropy, a concept traditionally linked with uncertainty and disorder, and reinterpret it to assess the complexity of computational problems. Our research presents a structured framework for establishing entropy profiles within computational tasks, enabling a clear distinction between P and NP-classified problems. This framework quantifies the 'information cost' associated with these problem categories, highlighting their intrinsic computational complexity. We introduce Entropy-Driven Annealing (EDA) as a new method to decipher the energy landscapes of computational problems, focusing on the unique characteristics of NP problems. This method proposes a differential thermodynamic profile for NP problems in contrast to P problems and explores potential thermodynamic routes for finding polynomial-time solutions to NP challenges. Our introduction of EDA and its application to complex computational problems like the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) and protein-DNA complexes suggests a potential pathway toward unraveling the intricacies of the P vs. NP problem.</description>

      <title>A Causal Model for Quantifying Multipartite Classical and Quantum Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an operational definition of information-theoretic resources within a given multipartite classical or quantum correlation. We present our causal model that serves as the source coding side of this correlation and introduce a novel concept of resource rate. We argue that, beyond classical secrecy, additional resources exist that are useful for the security of distributed computing problems, which can be captured by the resource rate. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between resource rate and an extension of Shannon's logarithmic information measure, namely, total correlation. Subsequently, we present a novel quantum secrecy monotone and investigate a quantum hybrid key distribution system as an extension of our causal model. Finally, we discuss some connections to optimal transport (OT) problem.</description>

      <title>Construction of CCC and ZCCS Through Additive Characters Over Galois Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid progression in wireless communication technologies, especially in multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA), there is a need of advanced code construction methods. Traditional approaches, mainly based on generalized Boolean functions, have limitations in code length versatility. This paper introduces a novel approach to constructing complete complementary codes (CCC) and Z-complementary code sets (ZCCS), for reducing interference in MC-CDMA systems. The proposed construction, distinct from Boolean function-based approaches, employs additive characters over Galois fields GF($p^{r}$), where $p$ is prime and $r$ is a positive integer. First, we develop CCCs with lengths of $p^{r}$, which are then extended to construct ZCCS with both unreported lengths and sizes of $np^{r}$, where $n$ are arbitrary positive integers. The versatility of this method is further highlighted as it includes the lengths of ZCCS reported in prior studies as special cases, underscoring the method's comprehensive nature and superiority.</description>

      <title>6D Movable Antenna Based on User Distribution: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new six-dimensional (6D) movable antenna (6DMA) system for future wireless networks to improve the communication performance. Unlike the traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA) and existing fluid antenna/two-dimensional (2D) movable antenna (FA/2DMA) systems that adjust the positions of antennas only, the proposed 6DMA system consists of distributed antenna surfaces with independently adjustable three-dimensional (3D) positions as well as 3D rotations within a given space. In particular, this paper applies the 6DMA to the base station (BS) in wireless networks to provide full degrees of freedom (DoFs) for the BS to adapt to the dynamic user spatial distribution in the network. However, a challenging new problem arises on how to optimally control the 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces at the BS to maximize the network capacity based on the user spatial distribution, subject to the practical constraints on 6D antennas' movement. To tackle this problem, we first model the 6DMA-enabled BS and the user channels with the BS in terms of 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces. Next, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to search for the best 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces by leveraging the Monte Carlo simulation technique. Specifically, we sequentially optimize the 3D position/3D rotation of each 6DMA surface with those of the other surfaces fixed in an iterative manner. Numerical results show that our proposed 6DMA-BS can significantly improve the network capacity as compared to the benchmark BS architectures with FPAs or 6DMAs with limited/partial movability, especially when the user distribution is more spatially non-uniform.</description>

      <title>The mean and variance of the reciprocal merit factor of four classes of binary sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.11246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The merit factor of a $\{-1, 1\}$ binary sequence measures the collective smallness of its non-trivial aperiodic autocorrelations. Binary sequences with large merit factor are important in digital communications because they allow the efficient separation of signals from noise. It is a longstanding open question whether the maximum merit factor is asymptotically unbounded and, if so, what is its limiting value. Attempts to answer this question over almost sixty years have identified certain classes of binary sequences as particularly important: skew-symmetric sequences, symmetric sequences, and anti-symmetric sequences. Using only elementary methods, we find an exact formula for the mean and variance of the reciprocal merit factor of sequences in each of these classes, and in the class of all binary sequences. This provides a much deeper understanding of the distribution of the merit factor in these four classes than was previously available. A consequence is that, for each of the four classes, the merit factor of a sequence drawn uniformly at random from the class converges in probability to a constant as the sequence length increases.</description>

      <title>Usefulness of adaptive strategies in asymptotic quantum channel discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.06569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptiveness is a key principle in information processing including statistics and machine learning. We investigate the usefulness of adaptive methods in the framework of asymptotic binary hypothesis testing, when each hypothesis represents asymptotically many independent instances of a quantum channel, and the tests are based on using the unknown channel and observing outputs. Unlike the familiar setting of quantum states as hypotheses, there is a fundamental distinction between adaptive and non-adaptive strategies with respect to the channel uses, and we introduce a number of further variants of the discrimination tasks by imposing different restrictions on the test strategies. The following results are obtained: (1) We prove that for classical-quantum channels, adaptive and non-adaptive strategies lead to the same error exponents both in the symmetric (Chernoff) and asymmetric (Hoeffding, Stein) settings. (2) The first separation between adaptive and non-adaptive symmetric hypothesis testing exponents for quantum channels, which we derive from a general lower bound on the error probability for non-adaptive strategies; the concrete example we analyze is a pair of entanglement-breaking channels. (3)We prove, in some sense generalizing the previous statement, that for general channels adaptive strategies restricted to classical feed-forward and product state channel inputs are not superior in the asymptotic limit to non-adaptive product state strategies. (4) As an application of our findings, we address the discrimination power of an arbitrary quantum channel and show that adaptive strategies with classical feedback and no quantum memory at the input do not increase the discrimination power of the channel beyond non-adaptive tensor product input strategies.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the R\'enyi entropy of independent sums of integer valued random variables through Fourier theoretic means, and give sharp comparisons between the variance and the R\'enyi entropy, for Poisson-Bernoulli variables. As applications we prove that a discrete ``min-entropy power'' is super additive on independent variables up to a universal constant, and give new bounds on an entropic generalization of the Littlewood-Offord problem that are sharp in the ``Poisson regime''.</description>

      <title>Robust Counterfactual Explanations for Neural Networks With Probabilistic Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is an emerging interest in generating robust counterfactual explanations that would remain valid if the model is updated or changed even slightly. Towards finding robust counterfactuals, existing literature often assumes that the original model $m$ and the new model $M$ are bounded in the parameter space, i.e., $\|\text{Params}(M){-}\text{Params}(m)\|{&lt;}\Delta$. However, models can often change significantly in the parameter space with little to no change in their predictions or accuracy on the given dataset. In this work, we introduce a mathematical abstraction termed $\textit{naturally-occurring}$ model change, which allows for arbitrary changes in the parameter space such that the change in predictions on points that lie on the data manifold is limited. Next, we propose a measure -- that we call $\textit{Stability}$ -- to quantify the robustness of counterfactuals to potential model changes for differentiable models, e.g., neural networks. Our main contribution is to show that counterfactuals with sufficiently high value of $\textit{Stability}$ as defined by our measure will remain valid after potential $\textit{naturally-occurring}$ model changes with high probability (leveraging concentration bounds for Lipschitz function of independent Gaussians). Since our quantification depends on the local Lipschitz constant around a data point which is not always available, we also examine practical relaxations of our proposed measure and demonstrate experimentally how they can be incorporated to find robust counterfactuals for neural networks that are close, realistic, and remain valid after potential model changes. This work also has interesting connections with model multiplicity, also known as, the Rashomon effect.</description>

Abstract: We show that for log-concave real random variables with fixed variance the Shannon differential entropy is minimized for an exponential random variable. We apply this result to derive upper bounds on capacities of additive noise channels with log-concave noise.

      <title>Perceptual Scales Predicted by Fisher Information Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perception is often viewed as a process that transforms physical variables, external to an observer, into internal psychological variables. Such a process can be modeled by a function coined perceptual scale. The perceptual scale can be deduced from psychophysical measurements that consist in comparing the relative differences between stimuli (i.e. difference scaling experiments). However, this approach is often overlooked by the modeling and experimentation communities. Here, we demonstrate the value of measuring the perceptual scale of classical (spatial frequency, orientation) and less classical physical variables (interpolation between textures) by embedding it in recent probabilistic modeling of perception. First, we show that the assumption that an observer has an internal representation of univariate parameters such as spatial frequency or orientation while stimuli are high-dimensional does not lead to contradictory predictions when following the theoretical framework. Second, we show that the measured perceptual scale corresponds to the transduction function hypothesized in this framework. In particular, we demonstrate that it is related to the Fisher information of the generative model that underlies perception and we test the predictions given by the generative model of different stimuli in a set a of difference scaling experiments. Our main conclusion is that the perceptual scale is mostly driven by the stimulus power spectrum. Finally, we propose that this measure of perceptual scale is a way to push further the notion of perceptual distances by estimating the perceptual geometry of images i.e. the path between images instead of simply the distance between those.</description>

      <title>Joint Source-Channel Coding for Channel-Adaptive Digital Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel joint source-channel coding (JSCC) approach for channel-adaptive digital semantic communications. In semantic communication systems with digital modulation and demodulation, robust design of JSCC encoder and decoder becomes challenging not only due to the unpredictable dynamics of channel conditions but also due to diverse modulation orders. To address this challenge, we first develop a new demodulation method which assesses the uncertainty of the demodulation output to improve the robustness of the digital semantic communication system. We then devise a robust training strategy which enhances the robustness and flexibility of the JSCC encoder and decoder against diverse channel conditions and modulation orders. To this end, we model the relationship between the encoder's output and decoder's input using binary symmetric erasure channels and then sample the parameters of these channels from diverse distributions. We also develop a channel-adaptive modulation technique for an inference phase, in order to reduce the communication latency while maintaining task performance. In this technique, we adaptively determine modulation orders for the latent variables based on channel conditions. Using simulations, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed JSCC approach for image classification, reconstruction, and retrieval tasks compared to existing JSCC approaches.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Channel Modeling for Holographic MIMO Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empowered by the latest progress on innovative metamaterials/metasurfaces and advanced antenna technologies, holographic multiple-input multiple-output (H-MIMO) emerges as a promising technology to fulfill the extreme goals of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. The antenna arrays utilized in H-MIMO comprise massive (possibly to extreme extent) numbers of antenna elements, densely spaced less than half-a-wavelength and integrated into a compact space, realizing an almost continuous aperture. Thanks to the expected low cost, size, weight, and power consumption, such apertures are expected to be largely fabricated for near-field communications. In addition, the physical features of H-MIMO enable manipulations directly on the electromagnetic (EM) wave domain and spatial multiplexing. To fully leverage this potential, near-field H-MIMO channel modeling, especially from the EM perspective, is of paramount significance. In this article, we overview near-field H-MIMO channel models elaborating on the various modeling categories and respective features, as well as their challenges and evaluation criteria. We also present EM-domain channel models that address the inherit computational and measurement complexities. Finally, the article is concluded with a set of future research directions on the topic.</description>
