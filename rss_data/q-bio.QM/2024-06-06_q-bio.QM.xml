      <title>A Hybrid Deep Learning Classification of Perimetric Glaucoma Using Peripapillary Nerve Fiber Layer Reflectance and Other OCT Parameters from Three Anatomy Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precis: A hybrid deep-learning model combines NFL reflectance and other OCT parameters to improve glaucoma diagnosis. Objective: To investigate if a deep learning model could be used to combine nerve fiber layer (NFL) reflectance and other OCT parameters for glaucoma diagnosis. Patients and Methods: This is a prospective observational study where of 106 normal subjects and 164 perimetric glaucoma (PG) patients. Peripapillary NFL reflectance map, NFL thickness map, optic head analysis of disc, and macular ganglion cell complex thickness were obtained using spectral domain OCT. A hybrid deep learning model combined a fully connected network (FCN) and a convolution neural network (CNN) to develop and combine those OCT maps and parameters to distinguish normal and PG eyes. Two deep learning models were compared based on whether the NFL reflectance map was used as part of the input or not. Results: The hybrid deep learning model with reflectance achieved 0.909 sensitivity at 99% specificity and 0.926 at 95%. The overall accuracy was 0.948 with 0.893 sensitivity and 1.000 specificity, and the AROC was 0.979, which is significantly better than the logistic regression models (p &lt; 0.001). The second best model is the hybrid deep learning model w/o reflectance, which also had significantly higher AROC than logistic regression models (p &lt; 0.001). Logistic regression with reflectance model had slightly higher AROC or sensitivity than the other logistic regression model without reflectance (p = 0.024). Conclusions: Hybrid deep learning model significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy, without or without NFL reflectance. Hybrid deep learning model, combining reflectance/NFL thickness/GCC thickness/ONH parameter, may be a practical model for glaucoma screen purposes.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking AlphaFold3's protein-protein complex accuracy and machine learning prediction reliability for binding free energy changes upon mutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AlphaFold 3 (AF3), the latest version of protein structure prediction software, goes beyond its predecessors by predicting protein-protein complexes. It could revolutionize drug discovery and protein engineering, marking a major step towards comprehensive, automated protein structure prediction. However, independent validation of AF3's predictions is necessary. Evaluated using the SKEMPI 2.0 database which involves 317 protein-protein complexes and 8338 mutations, AF3 complex structures give rise to a very good Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.86 for predicting protein-protein binding free energy changes upon mutation, slightly less than the 0.88 achieved earlier with the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures. Nonetheless, AF3 complex structures led to a 8.6% increase in the prediction RMSE compared to original PDB complex structures. Additionally, some of AF3's complex structures have large errors, which were not captured in its ipTM performance metric. Finally, it is found that AF3's complex structures are not reliable for intrinsically flexible regions or domains.</description>

      <title>Information Benchmark for Biological Sensors Beyond Steady States -- Mpemba-like sensory withdrawal effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological sensors rely on the temporal dynamics of ligand concentration for signaling. The sensory performance is bounded by the distinguishability between the sensory state transition dynamics under different environmental protocols. This work presents a comprehensive theory to characterize arbitrary transient sensory dynamics of biological sensors. Here the sensory performance is quantified by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the probability distributions of the sensor's stochastic paths. We introduce a novel benchmark to assess a sensor's transient sensory performance arbitrarily far from equilibrium. We identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon in multi-state sensors: while an initial exposure to high ligand concentration may hinder a sensor's sensitivity towards a future concentration up-shift, certain sensors may show a boost in sensitivity if the initial high concentration exposure is followed by a transient resetting at a low concentration environment. The boosted performance exceeds that of a sensor starting from an initially low concentration environment. This effect, reminiscent of a drug withdrawal effect, can be explained by the Markovian dynamics of the multi-state sensor, similar to the Markovian Mpemba effect. Moreover, an exhaustive machine learning study of 4-state sensors reveals a tight connection between the sensor's performance and the structure of the Markovian graph of its states.</description>

      <title>Deciphering regulatory architectures from synthetic single-cell expression patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the vast majority of genes in sequenced genomes, there is limited understanding of how they are regulated. Without such knowledge, it is not possible to perform a quantitative theory-experiment dialogue on how such genes give rise to physiological and evolutionary adaptation. One category of high-throughput experiments used to understand the sequence-phenotype relationship of the transcriptome is massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). However, to improve the versatility and scalability of MPRA pipelines, we need a "theory of the experiment" to help us better understand the impact of various biological and experimental parameters on the interpretation of experimental data. To that end, in this paper we create tens of thousands of synthetic single-cell gene expression outputs using both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium models. These models make it possible to imitate the summary statistics (information footprints and expression shift matrices) used to characterize the output of MPRAs and from this summary statistic to infer the underlying regulatory architecture. Specifically, we use a more refined implementation of the so-called thermodynamic models in which the binding energies of each sequence variant are derived from energy matrices. Our simulations reveal important effects of the parameters on MPRA data and we demonstrate our ability to optimize MPRA experimental designs with the goal of generating thermodynamic models of the transcriptome with base-pair specificity. Further, this approach makes it possible to carefully examine the mapping between mutations in binding sites and their corresponding expression profiles, a tool useful not only for better designing MPRAs, but also for exploring regulatory evolution.</description>

      <title>Generative Flows on Discrete State-Spaces: Enabling Multimodal Flows with Applications to Protein Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining discrete and continuous data is an important capability for generative models. We present Discrete Flow Models (DFMs), a new flow-based model of discrete data that provides the missing link in enabling flow-based generative models to be applied to multimodal continuous and discrete data problems. Our key insight is that the discrete equivalent of continuous space flow matching can be realized using Continuous Time Markov Chains. DFMs benefit from a simple derivation that includes discrete diffusion models as a specific instance while allowing improved performance over existing diffusion-based approaches. We utilize our DFMs method to build a multimodal flow-based modeling framework. We apply this capability to the task of protein co-design, wherein we learn a model for jointly generating protein structure and sequence. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art co-design performance while allowing the same multimodal model to be used for flexible generation of the sequence or structure.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Protein-Ligand Docking: Are We There Yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of ligand binding on protein structures and their in vivo functions carry numerous implications for modern biomedical research and biotechnology development efforts such as drug discovery. Although several deep learning (DL) methods and benchmarks designed for protein-ligand docking have recently been introduced, to date no prior works have systematically studied the behavior of docking methods within the practical context of (1) using predicted (apo) protein structures for docking (e.g., for broad applicability); (2) docking multiple ligands concurrently to a given target protein (e.g., for enzyme design); and (3) having no prior knowledge of binding pockets (e.g., for pocket generalization). To enable a deeper understanding of docking methods' real-world utility, we introduce PoseBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for practical protein-ligand docking. PoseBench enables researchers to rigorously and systematically evaluate DL docking methods for apo-to-holo protein-ligand docking and protein-ligand structure generation using both single and multi-ligand benchmark datasets, the latter of which we introduce for the first time to the DL community. Empirically, using PoseBench, we find that all recent DL docking methods but one fail to generalize to multi-ligand protein targets and also that template-based docking algorithms perform equally well or better for multi-ligand docking as recent single-ligand DL docking methods, suggesting areas of improvement for future work. Code, data, tutorials, and benchmark results are available at https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/PoseBench.</description>
