      <title>Rare events algorithm study of extreme double jet summers and their connection to heatwaves over Eurasia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several large scale circulation patterns have been identified in relation to extreme Northern Hemisphere summer heatwaves. Three main ones are a double jet over Eurasia, a positive phase of the summer northern annular mode, and a quasi-wave-3 geopotential height anomaly. While there is some evidence suggesting these patterns are related to each other, the explicit nature of their relation, as well as the explicit mechanisms by which they are related to extreme heatwaves is still not known. The double jet structure has gained attention recently due to evidence that its persistence has been increasing, possibly explaining the rise in the number of extreme heatwaves over Europe. In this paper we study the occurrence and persistence of double jet states in ERA5 and in stationary simulations with the CESM1.2 model, using an index which measures the degree of jet separation. Additionally, we perform simulations with CESM1.2 coupled to a rare event algorithm in order to improve the statistics of rare summer-long double jet states. We find that extreme double jet states are characterised by three centers of extreme high surface temperature and 500hPa geopotential height anomalies, alongside a strong low pressure over the Arctic. The geopotential height anomaly pattern is consistent with both a positive Northern Annular Mode (NAM) and quasi-wave-3 patterns found in the literature. Moreover, we find a large percentage of co-occurrence of heatwaves at these centers, and a double jet state, with the percentage increasing with the duration of the double jet state.</description>

      <title>Effect of complex orography on numerical simulations of a downburst event in Spain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercells, characterized by their deep, persistent mesocyclones, are among the most severe convective weather systems, often associated with large hail, damaging winds, and significant societal impacts. Accurately simulating these events is essential for improving forecasting capabilities. This study evaluates the performance of two different nested strategies of the HARMONIE-AROME model in simulating a severe supercell outbreak over eastern Iberia on July 31, 2015, where at least six confirmed supercells were reported, producing large hail and significant damage. The configurations include H500_NESTED, a two-step one-way nested approach with a parent domain at 2.5 km resolution and a nested domain at 500 m resolution, and H500, a single-domain simulation at 500 m resolution. The simulated reflectivity is validated against OPERA radar data, while precipitation and temperature outputs are compared to observations from weather stations. Key convective parameters, derived from the Murcia radiosonde, are analyzed to assess the pre-convective environment. Results show that both configurations adequately capture the overall structure of the supercell event, with H500_NESTED offering marginally improved representations of reflectivity and thermodynamic variables. However, these improvements do not justify the 30% higher computational cost of the nested approach. The H500 simulation emerges as a more efficient option, providing comparable results at a lower cost.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of an oceanic front at finite Rossby number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submesoscale currents in the ocean's mixed layer (ML), consisting of fronts, eddies, and filaments, are characterized by order one Rossby (Ro) and Richardson (Ri) numbers. These currents play a crucial role in mediating vertical exchange between the surface and ocean interior and in facilitating cross-scale energy transfers. Despite a growing understanding of their generation mechanisms and energy pathways, two fundamental questions remain unresolved - how does a finite Ro modify the dynamics of ML instabilities, and what mechanisms are responsible for ML frontal arrest when Ro is order one. In this study, we address these questions through a linear stability analysis of a two-dimensional, geostrophically adjusted oceanic front based on the analytical model of Ou(1984), which allows systematic exploration across a range of Ro. In the low Ro, order one Ri regime, the most unstable mode is that of baroclinic instability, with the buoyancy flux serving as the primary source of perturbation kinetic energy. As Ro increases, the dominant instability becomes an inertia-critical layer type, characterized by a resonant interaction between a Rossby wave and an inertia-gravity wave. In the order one Ro regime, the shear production terms become comparable to the buoyancy flux term and even dominate in the region where the adjusted front is strongest. Our results suggest that shear production should be included in parameterizations of ML instabilities.minate in the region where the adjusted front is strongest. Our results suggest that shear production should be included in parameterizations of ML instabilities.</description>

      <title>A water-rich interior in the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b revealed by JWST</title>

Abstract: Temperate sub-Neptunes are compelling targets for detecting liquid-water oceans beyond the Solar System. If water-rich and lacking massive hydrogen-helium envelopes, these planets could sustain liquid layers beneath their atmospheres despite sizes larger than Earth. Previous observations of the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b revealed an H2-dominated atmosphere rich in CH4, with moderate evidence for CO2 and tentative signs of dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Here we present four new JWST/NIRSpec transit observations of K2-18 b. The resulting high-precision transmission spectrum robustly detects both CH4 and CO2, precisely measuring their abundances and firmly establishing the planet's water-rich nature: either a thick envelope with &gt;10% H2O by volume or a thin atmosphere above a liquid-water ocean. The spectrum reveals no detectable H2O, NH3, or CO. The absence of atmospheric water vapor suggests an efficient cold trap, while the nondetections of NH3 and CO support the scenario of a small H2-rich atmosphere overlying a liquid reservoir. However, alternative models that include these gases can also reproduce the spectrum within uncertainties, highlighting the need for deeper observations. The spectrum only contains marginal signals of DMS, methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), and nitrous oxide (N2O), with none exceeding 3 sigma in model preference and all falling below ~2 sigma without imposing a strong super-Rayleigh haze. Meanwhile, our self-consistent photochemical models show that DMS and CH3SH may form abiotically in massive H2-rich atmospheres of high metallicity, making it important to consider additional indicators for their potential use as biosignatures. K2-18 b, a cool, water-rich world, stands out as one of the most promising temperate sub-Neptunes for exploring the emergence of liquid-water environments in non-Earth-like planets, motivating further characterization of its atmosphere and interior.</description>

      <title>Trapping absorbing and non-absorbing aqueous particle using a universal 4-arm Laguerre-Gaussian mode light trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Absorbing aerosols, such as brown carbon (BrC) and absorbing secondary organic aerosols (SOA), has attracted broad interest due to their importance for climate and human health. The pronounced time-dependence of light absorption during aging renders the precise estimation of their impact on global warming difficult. Single particle studies of such aerosols would be very useful to better understand their aging in the atmosphere through processes such as photochemistry. However previously proposed optical traps cannot continuously trap particles whose absorption state changes from strongly absorbing to non-absorbing or vice versa. Some of the traps presented can isolate absorbing and non-absorbing particles, but require mechanical alignment of the trap depending on the strength of particle absorption. However, mechanical realignment is not compatible with continuous trapping and observation. Here, we introduce a flexible optical universal trap which does not require mechanical realignment. The versatility of the trap relies on four trapping beams - either vortex Laguerre- Gaussian (LG) or fundamental Gaussian beams - which are modulated with a spatial light modulator (SLM), The performance of the trap is demonstrated by trapping different types of absorbing and non-absorbing particles. We also show that the trap can be used to observe the photochemical reaction of aqueous droplets containing fulvic acid, a common component of BrC. Digital holography measurements demonstrate that the confinement of the particles in the trap can be controlled by changing the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the LG beams. The study also shows that spectroscopy measurements, such as fluorescence and Raman scattering, are possible in all configurations of the proposed trap.</description>

      <title>Super Resolution for Renewable Energy Resource Data With Wind From Reanalysis Data and Application to Ukraine</title>

Abstract: With a potentially increasing share of the electricity grid relying on wind to provide generating capacity and energy, there is an expanding global need for historically accurate, spatiotemporally continuous, high-resolution wind data. Conventional downscaling methods for generating these data based on numerical weather prediction have a high computational burden and require extensive tuning for historical accuracy. In this work, we present a novel deep learning-based spatiotemporal downscaling method using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for generating historically accurate high-resolution wind resource data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting Reanalysis version 5 data (ERA5). In contrast to previous approaches, which used coarsened high-resolution data as low-resolution training data, we use true low-resolution simulation outputs. We show that by training a GAN model with ERA5 as the low-resolution input and Wind Integration National Dataset Toolkit (WTK) data as the high-resolution target, we achieved results comparable in historical accuracy and spatiotemporal variability to conventional dynamical downscaling. This GAN-based downscaling method additionally reduces computational costs over dynamical downscaling by two orders of magnitude. We applied this approach to downscale 30 km, hourly ERA5 data to 2 km, 5 min wind data for January 2000 through December 2023 at multiple hub heights over Ukraine, Moldova, and part of Romania. This 24-year data record is the first member of the super-resolution for renewable energy resource data with wind from the reanalysis data dataset (Sup3rWind).</description>

      <title>Advancing Seasonal Prediction of Tropical Cyclone Activity with a Hybrid AI-Physics Climate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are successful with weather forecasting and have shown progress in climate simulations, yet leveraging them for useful climate predictions needs exploration. Here we show this feasibility using Neural General Circulation Model (NeuralGCM), a hybrid ML-physics atmospheric model developed by Google, for seasonal predictions of large-scale atmospheric variability and Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone (TC) activity. Inspired by physical model studies, we simplify boundary conditions, assuming sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice follow their climatological cycle but persist anomalies present at the initialization time. With such forcings, NeuralGCM can generate 100 simulation days in ~8 minutes with a single Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), while simulating realistic atmospheric circulation and TC climatology patterns. This configuration yields useful seasonal predictions (July to November) for the tropical atmosphere and various TC activity metrics. Notably, the predicted and observed TC frequency in the North Atlantic and East Pacific basins are significantly correlated during 1990 to 2023 (r=~0.7), suggesting prediction skill comparable to existing physical GCMs. Despite challenges associated with model resolution and simplified boundary forcings, the model-predicted interannual variations demonstrate significant correlations with the observation, including the sub-basin TC tracks (p&lt;0.1) and basin-wide accumulated cyclone energy (p&lt;0.01) of the North Atlantic and North Pacific basins. These findings highlight the promise of leveraging ML models with physical insights to model TC risks and deliver seamless weather-climate predictions.</description>

      <title>Generalizable neural-network parameterization of mesoscale eddies in idealized and global ocean models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08900v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven methods have become popular to parameterize the effects of mesoscale eddies in ocean models. However, they perform poorly in generalization tasks and may require retuning if the grid resolution or ocean configuration changes. We address the generalization problem by enforcing physics constraints on a neural network parameterization of mesoscale eddy fluxes. We found that the local scaling of input and output features helps to generalize to unseen grid resolutions and depths offline in the global ocean. The scaling is based on dimensional analysis and incorporates grid spacing as a length scale. We formulate our findings as a general algorithm that can be used to enforce data-driven parameterizations with dimensional scaling. The new parameterization improves the representation of kinetic and potential energy in online simulations with idealized and global ocean models. Comparison to baseline parameterizations and impact on global ocean biases are discussed.</description>
