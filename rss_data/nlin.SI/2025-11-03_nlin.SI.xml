      <title>Nonisospectral deformations of noncommutative Laurent biorthogonal polynomials and matrix discrete Painlev\'e-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establishes a connection between noncommutative Laurent biorthogonal polynomials (bi-OPs) and matrix discrete Painlev\'e (dP) equations. We first apply nonisospectral deformations to noncommutative Laurent bi-OPs to obtain the noncommutative nonisospectral mixed relativistic Toda lattice and its Lax pair. Then, we perform a stationary reduction on this Lax pair to obtain a matrix dP-type equation. The validity of this reduction is demonstrated through a specific choice of weight function and the application of quasideterminant properties. In the scalar case, our matrix dP equation reduces to the known alternate dP II equation.</description>

      <title>Non-stationary difference equation and affine Laumon space III : Generalization to $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a series of papers we have considered a non-stationary difference equation which was originally discovered for the deformed Virasoro conformal block. The equation involves mass parameters and, when they are tuned appropriately, the equation is regarded as a quantum KZ equation for $U_q(A_{1}^{(1)})$. We introduce a $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N$ generalization of the non-stationary difference equation. The Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of $q$-commuting variables and allows both factorized forms and a normal ordered form. By specializing the mass parameters appropriately, the Hamiltonian can be identified with the $R$-matrix of the symmetric tensor representation of $U_q(A_{N-1}^{(1)})$, which in turn comes from the 3D (tetrahedron) $R$-matrix. We conjecture that the affine Laumon partition function of type $A_{N-1}^{(1)}$ gives a solution to our $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N$ non-stationary difference equation. As a check of our conjecture, we work out the four dimensional limit and find that the non-stationary difference equation reduces to the Fuji-Suzuki-Tsuda system.</description>

      <title>Boundary Integrability from the Fuzzy Three Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $\mathfrak{so}_4$ invariant matrix product states (MPS) in the $\mathfrak{so}_6$ symmetric integrable spin chain and prove their integrability. These MPS appear as fuzzy three-sphere solutions of matrix models with Yang-Mills-type interactions, and in particular they correspond to scalar defect sectors of $N=4$ SYM. We find that the algebra formed by the fuzzy three-sphere generators naturally leads to a boundary reflection algebra and hence a solution to the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for every representation of the fuzzy three-sphere. This allows us to find closed formula for the overlaps of Bethe states of $\mathfrak{so}_6$ symmetric chains with the fuzzy three-sphere MPS for arbitrary bond dimensions.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity, KAM, FPUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boltzmann introduced the microcanonical ensemble in
  1868, \cite{Bo868-a}, and immediately attempted to give an
  example of a system whose stationary states would be described
  by the emsemble (as suggested also by his ergodic
  hypothesis). The example, \cite{Bo868-b}, has been recently
  shown to be incorrect, if taken literally: the point was to
  suppose that constants of motion, if any besides the energy,
  would necessarily be smooth functions; and soon later he warned
  on the dangers implicit in a similar assumption. Fifty years
  later Fermi wrote a paper attempting to prove that in general a
  nonlinear system should be ergodic, \cite{Fe923}: but his proof
  relied again on Boltzmann's assumption. Thirty-four more years
  elapsed, and Fermi returned on the problem collaborating with
  Pasta, Ulam, Tsingou: the surprise was that the considered non
  linear chain was apparently not following the ergodic
  hypothesis. In the same year Kolmogorov had proved the
  conservation of many quasi periodic motions in nonlinear
  perturbations of integrable systems, \cite{Ko954}: his theorem was
  considered, already a few years later, a possible explanation
  of the FPUT work, \cite{Fo992}. This was only the beginning of intense
  research: here a brief sketch is presented to illustrate the
  above themes and the connection with the multiscale aspects of
  the problems, and the ``Renormalization group method'' intended
  as a map $\RR$ whose iterations can be interpreted as
  successive magnifications, zooming on ever smaller regions of
  phase space in which motions develop closer and closer to the
  searched quasi periodic motion of given spectrum.</description>
