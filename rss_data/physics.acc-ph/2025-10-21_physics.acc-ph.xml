      <title>The space charge effects on the intra-bunch motion under large chromaticity at the Main Ring in the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex</title>

Abstract: In general, optimizing chromaticity and transverse feedback parameters is important in suppressing beam instabilities for stable operation in high-intensity proton machines. Meanwhile, space charge effects impact the intrabunch motion of the proton bunch within a large chromaticity region in the machines, such as the main ring (MR) in the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC). To address this issue, the decoherence and recoherence of the transverse motion of the particles comprising the proton bunch are investigated. The analysis reveals that the space charge effects have a significant influence on the recoherence period through the chromaticity. Nevertheless, the relationship between the maximum frequency in the bunch and the chromaticity is not affected by the space charge effects. These findings are demonstrated with particle tracking simulations including the direct and indirect space charge effects, and the impedance source of the J-PARC MR. Furthermore, we illustrate the influence of the indirect space charge effect on particle motion by examining the excitation patterns of radial and head-tail modes.</description>

      <title>Compensating for Amplifier Non-Linearity in a SEL Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Self-Excited Loop (SEL) architecture, used in some continuous-wave (CW) superconducting linacs, relies on a positive feedback mechanism that requires carefully defined operating limits to ensure stable operation. These limits are typically derived from amplifier calibration, which characterizes the relationship between forward power and DAC drive. However, amplifier non-linearity often prevents a simple linear fit of this characteristic, introducing errors that can compromise stability. To address this, we present a modified calibration procedure that incorporates amplifier non-linearity into the SEL framework. The approach is validated with test data from a 32 kW solid-state amplifier (SSA) and a cavity emulator developed for the Fermilab PIP-II linac.</description>
