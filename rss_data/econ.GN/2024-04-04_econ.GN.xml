      <title>The economic consequences of geopolitical fragmentation: Evidence from the Cold War</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cold War was the defining episode of geopolitical fragmentation in the twentieth century. Trade between East and West across the Iron Curtain (a symbolical and physical barrier dividing Europe into two distinct areas) was restricted, but the severity of these restrictions varied over time. We quantify the trade and welfare effects of the Iron Curtain and show how the difficulty of trading across the Iron Curtain fluctuated throughout the Cold War. Using a novel dataset on trade between the two economic blocs and a quantitative trade model, we find that while the Iron Curtain at its height represented a tariff equivalent of 48% in 1951, trade between East and West gradually became easier until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Despite the easing of trade restrictions, we estimate that the Iron Curtain roughly halved East-West trade flows and caused substantial welfare losses in the Eastern bloc countries that persisted until the end of the Cold War. Conversely, the Iron Curtain led to an increase in intra-bloc trade, especially in the Eastern bloc, which outpaced the integration of Western Europe in the run-up to the formation of the European Union.</description>

      <title>Consumer Behavior under Benevolent Price Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive research shows that consumers are generally averse to price discrimination. However, instruments of differential pricing can benefit consumer surplus and alleviate inequity through targeted price discounts. This paper examines how these outcome considerations influence consumer reactions to price discrimination. Six studies with 3951 participants show that a large share of consumers is willing to costly switch away from a store that introduces a discount for low-income consumers. This happens irrespective of whether income differences are due to luck or merit. While the price-discriminating store does attract some new high-income consumers, it cannot compensate the loss of existing consumers. Allowing for altruistic preferences by simulating a market mechanism increases costly support for price discounts, but does not alleviate consumer aversions. Finally, we provide evidence that warm glow drives costly support for price discounts.</description>

      <title>The use of trade data in the analysis of global phosphate flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new method to trace the flows of phosphate from the countries where it is mined to the countries where it is used in agricultural production. We achieve this by combining data on phosphate rock mining with data on fertilizer use and data on international trade of phosphate-related products. We show that by making adjustments to data on net exports and by estimating weighting factors we can derive the matrix of phosphate flows on the country level to a large degree and thus contribute to the accuracy of material flow analyses, a results that is important for improving environmental accounting, not only for phosphorus but for many other resources.</description>

      <title>Beyond Unbounded Beliefs: How Preferences and Information Interplay in Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.02754v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When does society eventually learn the truth, or take the correct action, via observational learning? In a general model of sequential learning over social networks, we identify a simple condition for learning dubbed excludability. Excludability is a joint property of agents' preferences and their information. We develop two classes of preferences and information that jointly satisfy excludability: (i) for a one-dimensional state, preferences with single-crossing differences and a new informational condition, directionally unbounded beliefs; and (ii) for a multi-dimensional state, intermediate preferences and subexponential location-shift information. These applications exemplify that with multiple states "unbounded beliefs" is not only unnecessary for learning, but incompatible with familiar informational structures like normal information. Unbounded beliefs demands that a single agent can identify the correct action. Excludability, on the other hand, only requires that a single agent must be able to displace any wrong action, even if she cannot take the correct action.</description>

      <title>Approximating the set of Nash equilibria for convex games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Feinstein and Rudloff (2023), it was shown that the set of Nash equilibria for any non-cooperative $N$ player game coincides with the set of Pareto optimal points of a certain vector optimization problem with non-convex ordering cone. To avoid dealing with a non-convex ordering cone, an equivalent characterization of the set of Nash equilibria as the intersection of the Pareto optimal points of $N$ multi-objective problems (i.e.\ with the natural ordering cone) is proven. So far, algorithms to compute the exact set of Pareto optimal points of a multi-objective problem exist only for the class of linear problems, which reduces the possibility of finding the true set of Nash equilibria by those algorithms to linear games only.
  In this paper, we will consider the larger class of convex games. As, typically, only approximate solutions can be computed for convex vector optimization problems, we first show, in total analogy to the result above, that the set of $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria can be characterized by the intersection of $\epsilon$-approximate Pareto optimal points for $N$ convex multi-objective problems. Then, we propose an algorithm based on results from vector optimization and convex projections that allows for the computation of a set that, on one hand, contains the set of all true Nash equilibria, and is, on the other hand, contained in the set of $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria. In addition to the joint convexity of the cost function for each player, this algorithm works provided the players are restricted by either shared polyhedral constraints or independent convex constraints.</description>
