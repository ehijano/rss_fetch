      <title>Entropic Efficiency of Bayesian Inference Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference is a versatile tool that underlies scientific discovery, machine learning, and everyday decision-making: it describes how an agent updates a probability distribution as partial information is acquired from multiple measurements, reducing ignorance about a system's latent state. We define an inferential efficiency as the ratio of information gain to cumulative memory erasure cost, with inefficiency arising from unexploited correlations between the measured system and memories, and/or between memories and environment (noise). Using this efficiency, we benchmark two limiting measurement paradigms: sequential, in which the same memory is exploited iteratively, and parallel, in which many memories are exploited simultaneously. In both cases, the minimal erasure cost reflects correlations across memories: temporal in sequential, spatial in parallel. Remarkably, when all system-memory correlations are exploited for inference, both paradigms attain the same minimal erasure cost, even in the presence of noise. Conversely, the parallel paradigm performs better in the presence of unexploited correlations, stemming from hidden memories' degrees of freedom. This approach provides a quantitative, physically grounded criterion to compare inference strategies, determine their efficiency, and link target information gains to their minimal entropic cost.</description>

      <title>A Local Structural Basis to Resolve Amorphous Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phases with distinct thermodynamic properties must differ in their underlying distributions of microscopic structures. While ordered phases are readily distinguished by unit cells and space groups, the local structural basis differentiating amorphous phases is less apparent. Here, using a new probabilistic data-driven framework applied to molecular simulation data on water, we identify local collective variables that discriminate low-density and high-density amorphous (LDA and HDA) ices and characterize pressure-induced transitions between these phases. As expected, descriptors related to local density capably distinguish LDA and HDA; however, phase identity is surprisingly encoded within the first coordination shell. Furthermore, LDA transitions to HDA by a simple redistribution of LDA- and HDA-like environments with no evident intermediate structures, in accordance with a first-order-like transition that contrasts with the gradual evolution observed in other amorphous systems such as metallic glasses. These findings are robust across force fields, which themselves exhibit structural differences, and exemplify how other systems lacking obvious distinguishing features can be characterized.</description>

      <title>Wigner distribution, Wigner entropy and Quantum Refrigerator of a One-Dimensional Off-diagonal Quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an off-diagonal quasicrystal featuring simultaneous off-diagonal and diagonal quasiperiodic modulations. By analyzing the fractal dimension, we map out the delocalization-localization phase diagram. We demonstrate that delocalized and localized states can be distinguished via the Wigner distribution, while extended, critical, and localized phases are separated using the Wigner entropy. Furthermore, we explore the quantum thermodynamic properties, revealing that localized states facilitate the emergence of a quantum heater mode, alongside the appearance of a refrigerator mode. These findings enhance our understanding of localization phenomena and expand the thermodynamic applications of quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium symmetry of cyclic first-passage times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sum of first passage times along an arbitrary cycle made up of N&gt;2 states of a small physical system. We show that, if the system is at thermodynamic equilibrium, this sum follows the same probability distribution regardless of whether the cycle is explored clockwise or counterclockwise. Out of equilibrium, the distributions of clockwise and counterclockwise cyclic first passage times are related by a detailed fluctuation theorem. This result descends from a symmetry of clockwise and counterclockwise trajectories, which combines time reversal with swapping portions of the trajectories. We then relate the entropy produced along the cycle with the entropy production of the whole system using large deviation theory. Our results reveal a novel symmetry in stochastic systems, of potential broad applicability in non-equilibrium physics.</description>

      <title>Separating Energy and Entropy Contributions to the Hexatic-Liquid Transitions in Two-Dimensional Repulsive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, research on two-dimensional melting has established that both first-order and continuous hexatic-liquid transitions can occur, influenced by various factors in the potential energy and system details. The fundamental thermodynamic origins of this sensitivity remains elusive. Here, by decomposing the Helmholtz free energy across three representative repulsive systems, we reveal a universal competition between energy and entropy that dictates the melting pathway. The energetic contribution consistently imparts convexity to the free energy, whereas entropy imparts concavity. A first-order transition occurs when concave entropy dominates; otherwise, the transition is continuous. Further decomposition shows that vibrational entropy drives the concave total entropic curvature, while the configurational entropy's curvature switches from convex (first-order) to concave (continuous), mirroring defect proliferation measured by Shannon entropy. The convexity of the energy is dominated by the inherent potential, with minimal vibrational influence. Finally, we predict and verify that the first-order transition becomes continuous at zero temperature, where entropic effects vanish. Our work establishes the curvature of different thermodynamic quantities as a fundamental principle for understanding the nature of two-dimensional melting.</description>

      <title>Measurement induced faster symmetry restoration in quantum trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous measurement of quantum systems provides a standard route to quantum trajectories through the successive acquisition of information which further results in measurement back-action. In this work, we harness this back-action as a resource for global $U(1)$ symmetry restoration where continuous measurement is combined with a $U(1)$-preserving unitary evolution. Starting from a $U(1)$ symmetry-broken initial state, we simulate quantum trajectories generated by continuous measurements of both global and local observables. We show that under global monitoring, states containing superpositions of distant charge sectors restore symmetry faster than those involving nearby sectors. We establish the universality of this behavior across different measurement protocols. Finally, we demonstrate that local monitoring can further accelerate symmetry restoration for certain states that relax slowly under global monitoring.</description>

      <title>Practical Considerations for Finite Concentrations Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding concentrated electrolytes requires a theory that spans local hydration and mesoscale interfacial assembly. We present an integrated workflow-SCOPE-that combines (i) enhanced sampling focused on a single Li+ ion, (ii) reweighting of biased trajectories to recover equilibrium microstate probabilities, and (iii) a chemical-potential correction that accounts for the limited reservoir of free water in finite simulation boxes. Applied to LiCl(aq) across 0.5-26 M and 283-313 K, this approach reveals a simple organizing principle: solvated ions dominate at low concentration; contact ion pairs emerge at intermediate strength; and aggregated Li-xCl clusters become most stable at the solubility limit. The resulting free-energy trends predict temperature-dependent solubility in close agreement with experiment and clarify the role of interfacial nucleation in precipitation. Beyond the simple LiCl(aq) salt considered here, SCOPE offers a transferable strategy for characterizing speciation and phase behavior in concentrated liquid systems where collective coordinates and rare events dominate.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory approach for multistage chemical kinetics in liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes play an important role in a variety of physical, chemical, and biological systems. Conventionally, the kinetics of these processes are described by the law of mass action. However, there are various cases where these equations are insufficient. A fundamental challenge lies in accurately accounting for the microscopic correlations that inevitably arise in bimolecular reactions. While approaches to describe microscopic correlations in many specific cases exist, no general theory for multistage reactions has been established. In this article, we apply the quantum field theory approach to derive kinetic equations for general multistage reactive systems termed CMET (complete modified encounter theory). CMET can be formulated as a set of coupled partial differential equations that can be easily integrated numerically, thereby serving as a versatile tool for investigating reaction-diffusion processes. Across multiple case studies, we demonstrated that CMET reproduces the kinetics predicted by many other theories within their respective scopes of applicability.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Decoherence Times in Finite-Memory Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoherence is often modeled using Markovian master equations that predict exponential suppression of coherence and are frequently used as effective bounds on quantum behavior in complex environments. Such descriptions, however, correspond to the singular physical limit of vanishing environmental memory. Here we formulate decoherence using a general time-nonlocal decoherence functional determined solely by the environmental force correlation function, with Markovian dynamics recovered explicitly as a limiting case.
  For arbitrary stationary environments with finite temporal correlations, we show that the decoherence functional exhibits quadratic short-time growth that is model-independent within the finite-memory class considered. Consequently, the decoherence time defined operationally-without assuming exponential decay-scales as the square root of the environmental correlation time, independent of the detailed form of the bath correlation kernel.
  These results are illustrated analytically for Gaussian-correlated, soft power-law, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck environments. In the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck case, the non-Markovian dynamics admit an exact analytical closure, yielding a closed evolution equation for the coherence. Exact numerical simulations based on a pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling and show that exponential decoherence emerges only in the memoryless limit.
  Beyond coherence decay, we distinguish decoherence rates from observable loss of quantum signatures by analyzing purity and von Neumann entropy dynamics. We show that suppression of a specific coherence element need not coincide with irreversible entropy production. Finally, we introduce an inferred-memory perspective in which the environmental correlation time is treated as an operationally extractable parameter from dynamical data.</description>

      <title>Holstein Primakoff spin codes for local and collective noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet most existing codes rely on local control and stabilizer measurements that are difficult to implement in systems dominated by collective interactions. Inspired by spin-GKP codes in PhysRevA.108.022428, we develop a general framework for Holstein-Primakoff spin codes, which maps continuous-variable bosonic codes onto permutation-symmetric spin ensembles via the Holstein-Primakoff approximation. We show that HP codes are robust to both collective and local-spin noise and propose an explicit measurement-free local error recovery procedure to map local noise into correctable collective-spin errors.</description>

      <title>Unveiling hidden features of social evolution by inferring Langevin dynamics from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Are there hidden dynamical common patterns in the evolution of social and cultural history? While the growing availability of digitized social data invites us to answer this question, prevailing quantitative methods often rely on deterministic snapshots or average effects. Such approaches overlook the continuous and inherently uncertain nature of historical trajectories. In this paper, we propose a framework for modeling historical dynamics as stochastic processes described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). By viewing historical change through the lens of continuous-time dynamics, this framework provides a natural language to describe how structural trends and inherent random fluctuations interact to shape societal evolution. This approach allows us to handle the uncertainty in fragmentary historical records, moving beyond the dichotomy of structural determinism versus pure chance. We demonstrate that adopting this stochastic perspective unlocks a rich suite of analytical capabilities unavailable to static models. Specifically, we introduce methods to: (1) quantify the irreversibility; (2) detect exogenous perturbations; (3) perform multiple imputation for missing historical records. This framework offers a unified methodology for dissecting the stability, contingency, and dynamics of historical change.</description>

      <title>In-depth analysis of bar formation mechanisms of disk galaxies in halos of different concentrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use $N$-body simulations to investigate the distinct bar formation processes in disks residing in halos of various concentrations. In a highly concentrated halo, the bar development is limited by the dominant multi-arm modes as a result of the swing amplification in the early stage. Only after the multi-arm modes decay, the bar growth proceeds mechanically owing to the particle trapping in continuation of that bar seed. In this scheme, the corotation resonance of the bar modes does not come into play at all, justified by a low amount of disk-halo angular momentum transfer and a modestly decreasing bar pattern speed. On the other hand, although reducing the halo concentration suggests the reduction of the preferred swing-amplified modes to be bi-symmetric, the bar formation in a lowly concentrated halo does not involve the swing amplification at all. Rather, the fast-growing linearly unstable bar modes of a single uniform frequency is solely the governing factor, attributed to a mild shearing. The bar modes trigger the corotation resonance since the beginning and such resonance is maintained until the end, which leads to a high amount of angular momentum transfer and a fast slowdown. For the intermediate halo concentration, the kinematical analyses of multiple non-axisymmetric modes suggests that the linear modes, the swing amplification, and the particle trapping are all present in the evolution chronology. To specify bars formed in the different halo concentrations, full analyses of the isophotal shape, the radial Fourier amplitude, and the resonance diagram can be of use.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Transition to Intermittency for a Stochastic Heat Equation Driven by the Square of a Gaussian Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spatial behavior of the solution $\psi(x,t)$ to the stochastic heat equation $\partial_t\psi(x,t)-\frac{1}{2}\partial^2_{x^2} \psi(x,t)=g\, S(x,t)^2\, \psi(x,t)$, with $0\le t\le T$, $x\in\mathbb{R}$, and $\psi(x,0)=1$. Here, $g&gt;0$ is a coupling constant and $S(x,t)$ is a stationary, homogeneous, and ergodic Gaussian field. Focusing on $\mathcal{E}(x,g)\equiv \psi(x,T)$ at a finite time $T&gt;0$, we identify the critical coupling $g_c(T)$ above which the average of $\mathcal{E}(0,g)$ diverges. We show that in the subcritical regime $g&lt;g_c(T)$, $\mathcal{E}(x,g)$ is spatially ergodic, with no intermittency, while in the supercritical regime $g&gt;g_c(T)$ it becomes spatially intermittent and loses ergodicity. Our results differ from the extensively studied case where $S(x,t)^2$ is replaced by $S(x,t)$, in which intermittency appears only asymptotically as $T\to +\infty$, with no finite-time intermittency.</description>

      <title>Multi-target density matrix renormalization group for 3D CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fuzzy sphere regularization provides a powerful framework for studying three-dimensional (3D) conformal field theories (CFTs) by mapping them onto numerically tractable lattice models on the spherical lowest Landau level. However, the system sizes accessible to this method have been limited by the exact diagonalization (ED). In this work, we transcend this limitation by combining the fuzzy sphere regularization with a sophisticated multi-target density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. Focusing on the 3D Ising-type model on the spherical lowest Landau level, we calculate the 24 low-lying energies at a larger system size than previously feasible with ED. At criticality, we extract the scaling dimensions of six primary operators, and the results show significantly improved agreement with bootstrap benchmarks compared to previous ED results at smaller sizes. Our approach allows us to efficiently target multiple excited states in larger systems beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. This study establishes the fuzzy sphere regularization combined with advanced DMRG techniques as a powerful and general framework for precision physics in 3D CFTs.</description>

Abstract: We study Langevin dynamics of $N$ Brownian particles on compact two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, interacting through pairwise potentials linear in geodesic distance with quenched random couplings. These \emph{frustrated Brownian particles} experience the competing demands of random attractive and repulsive interactions while confined to curved surfaces. We consider three geometries: the sphere $S^2$, torus $T^2$ (closed manifolds), and bounded cylinder $S^1 \times [0,H]$ (manifold with boundary). Our central finding is disorder-induced dimension reduction accompanied by spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry: order emerges from the combination of two sources of randomness (thermal noise and quenched disorder), with the manifold topology determining the character of the emerging structures. Glassy relaxation drives particles from 2D distributions to quasi-1D structures, specifically bands on $S^2$, rings on $T^2$, and localized clusters on the cylinder. The symmetry breaking pattern depends on topology: SO(3)$\to$SO(2) on the sphere, SO(2)$\times$SO(2)$\to$SO(2)$\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ on the torus, and SO(2)$\to\mathbb{Z}_2$ on the cylinder. Unlike conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking, the symmetry-breaking direction is not frozen but evolves slowly via thermal noise through type-A diffusive Nambu-Goldstone dynamics, while the reduced-dimensional structure persists. Unlike conventional self-organizing systems that require external driving or fine-tuned nonlinearities, our model demonstrates that geometry and topology alone can channel randomness into order. We discuss connections to spin glass theory, quantum field theory, astrophysical structure formation, and self-organizing systems, providing a geometric framework for understanding how disorder generates emergent spatial order on curved spaces.</description>

      <title>RG flows of minimal $\mathcal W$-algebra CFTs via non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we study renormalization group (RG) flows between 2d conformal field theories enjoying extended higher-spin $\mathcal{W}$-symmetry. We propose a new class of RG flows between the diagonal minimal models of $\mathcal{W}_N$-algebra that take the form $\mathcal{W}_N(p,q)\to\mathcal{W}_N(p,kp-q)$. These are obtained by matching the anomalies of the non-invertible symmetry ${\mathrm{Rep}}[SU(N)_{p-N}]$ (and its discrete quotients) that is preserved by special relevant primary fields. This large non-invertible symmetry includes the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry of the minimal models. Our new flows furnish a significant generalization of the ones recently found in the case of Virasoro algebra, and include all previously known RG flows of $\mathcal{W}_N$. They have the remarkable property of being uniform in the rank $N$ of the $\mathcal{W}$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Efficient Trotter-Suzuki Schemes for Long-time Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately simulating long-time dynamics of many-body systems is a challenge in both classical and quantum computing due to the accumulation of Trotter errors. While low-order Trotter-Suzuki decompositions are straightforward to implement, their rapidly growing error limits access to long-time observables. We present a framework for constructing efficient high-order Trotter-Suzuki schemes by identifying their structure and directly optimizing their parameters over a high-dimensional space. This method enables the discovery of new schemes with significantly improved efficiency compared to traditional constructions, such as those by Suzuki and Yoshida. Based on the theoretical efficiency and practical performance, we recommend two novel highly efficient schemes at $4^{\textrm{th}}$ and $6^{\textrm{th}}$ order. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of these decompositions on the Heisenberg model and the quantum harmonic oscillator, and find that for a fixed final time they perform better across the computational cost. Even when using large time steps, they surpass established low-order schemes like the Leapfrog. Finally, we investigate the in-practice performance of different Trotter schemes and find the decompositions with more uniform coefficients tend to feature improved error accumulation over long times. We have included this observation into our choice of recommended schemes.</description>

      <title>Liquid-Gas Criticality of Hyperuniform Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In statistical physics, it is well established that the liquid-gas (LG) phase transition with divergent critical fluctuations belongs to the Ising universality class. Whether non-equilibrium effects can alter this universal behavior remains a fundamental open question. In this work, we theoretically prove that non-equilibrium hyperuniform (HU) fluids with additional center-of-mass conservation exhibit LG criticality different from the Ising universality class. As a specific case, we investigate a 2D HU fluid composed of active spinners, where phase separation is driven by dissipative collisions. Strikingly, at the critical point, the 2D HU fluid displays finite density fluctuations $S(q)\sim q^{\eta}$ with $\eta=0$, while the compressibility still diverges. The critical point is thus calm yet highly susceptible, in fundamental violation of the conventional fluctuation-dissipation relation. Consistently, we observe short-range pairwise correlation functions coexisting with quasi-long-range response functions at the critical point. Based on a generalized Model B and renormalization-group analysis, we prove that hyperuniformity reduces the upper critical dimension $d_c$ from $4$ to $2$. Moreover, the critical point exhibits Gaussian density fluctuations and non-divergent energy fluctuations. Furthermore, the HU fluid undergoes non-conventional spinodal decomposition. The origin of the above anomalies lies in the non-equilibrium nature of the system which obeys a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation $2\mathrm{Im}~ \chi(q,\omega) ={\omega }C(q,\omega)/{k_B T_{\text{eff}}(q)}$ with a scale-dependent effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}(q) \propto q^2$. These findings establish a striking exception to conventional paradigms of critical phenomena and illustrate how non-equilibrium forces can fundamentally reshape universality classes.</description>

      <title>Sokoban Random Walk: From Environment Reshaping to Trapping Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a Sokoban random walker moving in a disordered medium with obstacle density $\rho$. In contrast to the classic model of de Gennes with static obstacles that exhibits a percolation transition, the Sokoban walker is capable of modifying its environment by pushing a few surrounding obstacles. Surprisingly, even a limited pushing ability leads to a loss of the percolation transition. Through a combination of a rigorous large-deviation calculation and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the Sokoban model belongs to the Balagurov-Vaks-Donsker-Varadhan trapping universality class. The survival probability that the walker has not yet been trapped inside a cage exhibits stretched-exponential relaxation at late times. Furthermore, using the average trap size as a proxy, we identify the emergence of a dynamical crossover at a density $\rho_* \approx 0.55$ between two qualitatively different trapping mechanisms: a self-trapping mechanism at low density, where the walker becomes dynamically localized within a self-formed trap, and a pre-existing trapping mechanism at high density, where confinement arises from the initial arrangement of obstacles. This crossover is responsible for the loss of the classical percolation transition.</description>

      <title>Reduced fidelities for free fermions out of equilibrium: From dynamical quantum phase transitions to Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quantum quench of the reduced fidelities between the states of a subregion $A$ at different times. Precisely, we consider the fidelity between the time-dependent state of $A$ and its initial value, as well as with the state at infinite time. We denote these fidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity (FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full system, the RLE coincides with the standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in several instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times and large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a quasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the hydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite sequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary large group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like singularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic regime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to the so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a criterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at which the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of the FSF. In particular, we show that it provides a valuable tool to detect the so-called quantum Mpemba effect.</description>

      <title>Activity-driven clustering and many-body steady state of jamming run-and-tumble particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exactly resolve the three-particle steady state of run-and-tumble particles with jamming interactions, providing the first microscopic description beyond two bodies. The invariant measure, derived via a piecewise-deterministic Markov process description and symmetry principles, reveals persistent, separated, and diffusive regimes ruled by the activity parameter. A geometric cascade of scales in the activity parameter organizes the structural weights, showing the separated phase dominates at finite activity, while non-uniformity plays only a minor role. Extending these results to larger systems, we show that the $N$-body steady state inherits the same organization: the number of clusters becomes sharply defined by the activity value, with crossover boundaries whose slopes diverge with $N$. We also show how the activity plays a role similar to a fugacity conjugate to cluster number, yielding a grand-canonical-like structure emerging directly from the microscopic dynamics. This framework lays the groundwork for a systematic microscopic theory of active many-body steady states.</description>

      <title>Largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence is studied. Finite-size scaling reveals a phase transition occurring at a divergence rate $\delta_c$. The $\delta_c$ found stands near the locus of zero in Euler characteristic for finite-size graphs, known to be indicative of the largest connected component transition. The role of non-interacting vertices in shaping this transition with their presence ($d=0$) and absence ($d=1$) in duplication is also discussed, suggesting a particular transformation of the time variable considered, which yields a singularity locus in the natural logarithm of the absolute value of Euler characteristic in finite-size graphs near to that obtained with $d=1$ but from the model with $d=0$. The findings may suggest implications for bond percolation in these growing graph models.</description>

      <title>Additive-Functional Approach to Transport in Periodic and Tilted Periodic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we clarify the physical origin of effective transport in periodic and tilted periodic systems. When Brownian dynamics is examined on the scale of a single period, the particle displacement admits a natural separation into a bounded part associated with recurrent motion within the periodic landscape, and an unbounded stochastic part that grows in time and carries the net transport. We show that effective drift and diffusion are governed entirely by this unbounded component, while local potential-induced fluctuations contribute only bounded corrections. Treating the displacement as an additive functional of the stochastic dynamics provides a rigorous formulation of this separation and leads to a corrector-martingale representation at the trajectory level. Within this framework, classical results-including the Lifson-Jackson formula for unbiased periodic systems and the Stratonovich expressions for tilted periodic potentials-follow as direct consequences of the same underlying structure. The same perspective extends naturally to higher-dimensional periodic environments, recovering the standard homogenized transport tensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09395v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce version 2.0 of the SmoQyDQMC.jl package, a Julia implementation of the determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. SmoQyDQMC.jl supports generalized tight-binding Hamiltonians with local and extended Hubbard and generalized electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions, including non-linear e-ph coupling and anharmonic lattice potentials. Our implementation uses an optimized hybrid Monte Carlo method with exact forces to efficiently sample the phonon fields, enabling the simulation of low-energy phonon branches, including acoustic phonons. The SmoQyDQMC.jl package also uses a flexible scripting interface, allowing users to adapt it to different workflows and interface with other software packages in the Julia ecosystem. The code for this package can be downloaded from our GitHub repository at https://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyDQMC.jl or installed using the Julia package manager. The online documentation, including examples, is found at https://smoqysuite.github.io/SmoQyDQMC.jl/stable/.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness Guarantees for Quantum Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their ever more widespread deployment throughout society, machine learning algorithms remain critically vulnerable to being spoofed by subtle adversarial tampering with their input data. The prospect of near-term quantum computers being capable of running {quantum machine learning} (QML) algorithms has therefore generated intense interest in their adversarial vulnerability. Here we show that quantum properties of QML algorithms can confer fundamental protections against such attacks, in certain scenarios guaranteeing robustness against classically-armed adversaries. We leverage tools from many-body physics to identify the quantum sources of this protection. Our results offer a theoretical underpinning of recent evidence which suggest quantum advantages in the search for adversarial robustness. In particular, we prove that quantum classifiers are: (i) protected against weak perturbations of data drawn from the trained distribution, (ii) protected against local attacks if they are insufficiently scrambling, and (iii) show evidence that they are protected against universal adversarial attacks if they are sufficiently chaotic. Our analytic results are supported by numerical evidence demonstrating the applicability of our theorems and the resulting robustness of a quantum classifier in practice. This line of inquiry constitutes a concrete pathway to advantage in QML, orthogonal to the usually sought improvements in model speed or accuracy.</description>

      <title>Universal Negative Energetic Elasticity in Polymer Chains: Crossovers among Random, Self-Avoiding, and Neighbor-Avoiding Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Negative energetic elasticity in gels challenges the conventional understanding of gel elasticity; despite extensive research, a concise explanation remains elusive. In this study, we use the weakly self-avoiding walk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) to investigate the emergence of negative energetic elasticity in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we show that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity, which is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer segments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal energy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently across both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and self-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest that negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of polymer networks and chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18685v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of 4 x 4 solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Regular solutions were recently classified and in this paper we find the remaining non-regular solutions. We present several new solutions, then consider regular and non-regular Lax operators and study their relation to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Robinson bounds with exponential-in-volume tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lieb-Robinson bounds demonstrate the emergence of locality in many-body quantum systems. Intuitively, Lieb-Robinson bounds state that with local or exponentially decaying interactions, the correlation that can be built up between two sites separated by distance $r$ after a time $t$ decays as $\exp(vt-r)$, where $v$ is the emergent Lieb-Robinson velocity. In many problems, it is important to also capture how much of an operator grows to act on $r^d$ sites in $d$ spatial dimensions. Perturbation theory and cluster expansion methods suggest that at short times, these volume-filling operators are suppressed as $\exp(-r^d)$ at short times. We confirm this intuition, showing that for $r &gt; vt$, the volume-filling operator is suppressed by $\exp(-(r-vt)^d/(vt)^{d-1})$. This closes a conceptual and practical gap between the cluster expansion and the Lieb-Robinson bound. We then present two very different applications of this new bound. Firstly, we obtain improved bounds on the classical computational resources necessary to simulate many-body dynamics with error tolerance $\epsilon$ for any finite time $t$: as $\epsilon$ becomes sufficiently small, only $\epsilon^{-O(t^{d-1})}$ resources are needed. A protocol that likely saturates this bound is given. Secondly, we prove that disorder operators have volume-law suppression near the "solvable (Ising) point" in quantum phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking, which implies a new diagnostic for distinguishing many-body phases of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Scaling the glassy dynamics of active particles: Tunable fragility and reentrance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the influence of activity on dense amorphous assemblies is crucial for biological processes such as wound healing, embryogenesis, or cancer progression. Here, we study the effect of self-propulsion forces of amplitude $f_0$ and persistence time $\tau_p$ in dense assemblies of soft repulsive particles by simulating a model particle system that interpolates between particulate active matter and biological tissues. We identify the fluid and glass phases of the three-dimensional phase diagram obtained by varying $f_0$, $\tau_p$, and the packing fraction $\phi$. The morphology of the phase diagram directly accounts for a non-monotonic evolution of the relaxation time with $\tau_p$, which is a direct consequence of the crossover in the dominant relaxation mechanism, from glassy to jamming. A second major consequence is the evolution of the glassy dynamics from sub-Arrhenius to super-Arrhenius. We show that this tunable glass fragility extends to active systems analogous observations reported for passive particles. This analogy allows us to apply a dynamic scaling analysis proposed for the passive case, in order to account for our results for active systems. Finally, we discuss similarities and differences between our results and recent findings in the context of computational models of biological tissues.</description>

      <title>Probing the statistics of sequence-dependent DNA conformations in solution using SAXS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SAXS studies of four 60 base-pair DNA duplexes with sequences closely related to part of the GAGE6 (G-antigen 6) promoter have been performed to study the role of DNA conformations in solution and their potential relationship to DNA-protein binding. We show that the SAXS data can be analysed using a simple polymer model which nevertheless quantitatively describes the average persistence length and torsional rigidity of the DNA double helix to determine the statistical distribution of local conformations of the DNA in solution to a high accuracy. Although the SAXS data is averaged over time and all spatial orientations of the molecules, for sequences which have some asymmetry in the data we show that the conformations can be oriented with respect to the sequence. This allows specific features detected by the analysis to be precisely related to the DNA sequence, opening up new opportunities for SAXS to investigate the properties of DNA in solution. The biological implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Partial projected ensembles and spatiotemporal structure of information scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermalisation and information scrambling in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems are deeply intertwined: local subsystems dynamically approach thermal density matrices while their entropies track information spreading. Projected ensembles--ensembles of pure states conditioned on measurement outcomes of complementary subsystems--provide higher-order probes of thermalisation, converging at late times to universal maximum-entropy ensembles. In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a framework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted on projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced on a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement, tracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded outcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the PPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing how scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we demonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs) associated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an experimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs display exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting exponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate these findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics in the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point. We extend our analysis to a many-body localised (MBL) regime numerically, along with analytic results for the $\ell$-bit model. The linear and logarithmic lightcones characteristic of ergodic and MBL regimes emerge naturally from PPE dynamics, establishing it as a powerful tool for probing scrambling and deep thermalisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize monitored quantum dynamics in a solvable model exhibiting a phase transition between a measurement apparatus and a scrambler. We show that approximate decoherent histories emerge in both phases with respect to a coarse-grained extensive observable. However, the apparatus phase, where quantum Darwinism emerges, is distinguished by the non-ergodicity of the histories and their correlation with the measured qubit, which selects an ensemble of preferred pointer states. Our results demonstrate a clear distinction between two notion of classicality, decoherent histories and environment-induced decoherence.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry for higher and noninvertible symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is an observable in quantum systems, constructed using quantum-information methods, suited to detecting symmetry breaking in states -- possibly out of equilibrium -- relative to a subsystem. In this paper we define the asymmetry for generalized finite symmetries, including higher-form and noninvertible ones. To this end, we introduce a "symmetrizer" of (reduced) density matrices with respect to the $C^*$-algebra of symmetry operators acting on the subsystem Hilbert space. We study in detail applications to (1+1)-dimensional quantum field theories: First, we analyze spontaneous symmetry breaking of noninvertible symmetries, confirming that distinct vacua can exhibit different physical properties. Second, we compute the asymmetry of certain excited states in conformal field theories (including the Ising CFT), when the subsystem is either the full circle or an interval therein. The relevant symmetry algebras to consider are the fusion, tube, and strip algebras. Finally, we comment on the case that the symmetry algebra is a (weak) Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Cored product codes for quantum self-correction in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of self-correcting quantum memories in three dimensions is a long-standing open question at the interface between quantum computing and many-body physics. We take the perspective that large contributions to the entropy arising from fine-tuned spatial symmetries, including the assumption of an underlying regular lattice, are responsible for fundamental challenges to realizing self-correction. Accordingly, we introduce a class of disordered quantum codes, which we call "cored product codes". These codes are derived from classical factors via the hypergraph product but undergo a coring procedure which allows them to be embedded in a lower number of spatial dimensions while preserving code properties. As a specific example, we focus on a fractal code based on the aperiodic pinwheel tiling as the classical factor and perform finite temperature numerical simulations on the resulting three-dimensional quantum memory. We provide evidence that, below a critical temperature, the memory lifetime increases with system size for codes up to 60000 qubits.</description>

      <title>Physical models of embryonic epithelial healing: A review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embryonic healing in epithelial tissues is distinct from adult wound healing, as it lacks inflammatory responses or immune cell recruitments, making it ideal to test models of wound healing driven primarily by epithelial dynamics. Many models have been developed to describe this process, ranging from simple mechanistic models to more elaborate multiscale simulations. We review different classes of physical models, from discrete to continuum models, and how they address key questions about the mechanics, signaling, and coordination of cells during wound closure. We highlight tensions between model complexity and interpretability and discuss recent efforts to bridge gaps across scales. Finally, we identify directions for hybrid modeling and model-experiment integration that could push forward our understanding of epithelial repair in development and disease.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum groups have a long and fruitful history of applications in integrable systems. Can quantum group symmetries exist in the absence of integrability? We provide an explicit example of a system with quantum group global symmetry which is chaotic. The example is a spin chain with next-to-nearest interaction term. We show the chaotic behavior of the system by studying the Eigenvalue statistics. The spin chain is non-unitary but PT-symmetric and, in addition to chaos, exhibits an interesting transition after which the eigenvalues become complex.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: The topological origin of Bohm resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta \propto T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the ensemble of electron gyro-axes in a magnetized plasma as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the mean magnetic field. Unlike stochastic turbulence models, this framework predicts a coherent, explosive onset of resistivity that naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. We support this thesis with renormalization group theory and a novel analysis of Magnetospheric Multiscale mission data, which reveals an explosive phase space confinement consistent with collective phase slippage rather than chaotic scattering. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</description>
