      <title>Deriving Tsallis entropy from non-extensive Hamiltonian within a statistical mechanics framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tsallis entropy, which possesses non-extensive property, is derived from the first principle employing the non-extensive Hamiltonian or the $q$-deformed Hamiltonian with the canonical ensemble assumption in statistical mechanics. Here, the $q$-algebra and properties of $q$-deformed functions are extensively used throughout the derivation. Consequently, the thermodynamic quantities, e.g. internal energy and Helmholtz free energy, are derived and they inheritly exhibit the non-extensiveness. From this intriguing connection between Tasllis entropy and the $q$-deformed Hamiltonian, the parameter $q$ encapsulates the intrinsic degree of non-extensivity for the thermodynamic systems.</description>

      <title>The Monte Carlo Method for the Orthonickelate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The peculiarities of phase states of the triplet boson model for orthonickelates are investigated analytically and by means of numerical simulations. The conditions of thermodynamic stability of homogeneous phases are found. It is shown that the description of the phase inhomogeneous state in the mean-field approximation qualitatively agrees with the observed state of the system in numerical simulations by the classical Monte Carlo method</description>

      <title>Stationary and transient correlations in driven electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-particle correlation functions in ionic systems control many of their macroscopic properties. In this work, we use stochastic density functional theory to compute these correlations, and then we analyze their long-range behavior. In particular, we study the system's response to a rapid change (quench) in the external electric field. We show that the correlation functions relax diffusively toward the non-equilibrium stationary state and that in a stationary state, they present a universal conical shape. This shape distinguishes this system from systems with short-range interactions, where the correlations have a parabolic shape. We relate this temporal evolution of the correlations to the algebraic relaxation of the total charge current reported previously.</description>

      <title>Coupling-Induced Synchronized Motion and Stochastic Resonance in Overdamped Dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore an overdamped system of a dimer in a bistable potential immersed in a heat bath. The monomers interact via the combination of the Lennard-Jones potential and the harmonic potential. We have introduced a short-range interaction in our model making it more physical. Such a classical system can be used as a model for stochastic resonance (SR) based energy harvesters where the interplay between the noise, coupling and a periodic perturbation leads to a rich class of dynamical behaviours. A key distinction between observing SR in single and coupled particle studies is that a transition between the two wells is only considered successful if both the particles cross a certain threshold position. Although we observe qualitatively a similar peaking behaviour in different quantifiers of SR (like input energy ($W_p$) and hysteresis loop area (HLA)), the effects of the above-mentioned condition on the dynamics of the system remain unaddressed to the best of our knowledge. We study SR using different measures like the input energy per period of the external forcing, the hysteresis loop area as well as quantities like phase lag between the response and the external forcing and the maximum average amplitude of the response. Additionally, we have defined a new quantity called the successful transition ratio. This ratio helps us understand the effects of the dimer's coupling on the number of successful transitions out of the total attempted transitions. The successful transition ratio is almost unity for strongly coupled dimer suggesting most of the transition attempts end up successfully however few they are in numbers. On the other hand, the ratio shows a peaking behaviour with respect to noise for weak and intermediate couplings. We show that only for the weakly coupled dimer, the ratio is maximum around the temperature where SR takes place.</description>

      <title>Observation of droplets in dimer model on a triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the formation of droplets in the dimer model on a triangular lattice. The droplets in the dimer model are superposition polygons formed as two overlapping configurations of dimers: constant and movable. We demonstrate that specific local energies of dimers and low temperatures lead to the emergence of a macroscopic droplet. The motivation for this study was the phenomenon of the formation of equilibrium droplets under certain conditions in the Ising model within the framework of the Dobrushin-Koteck\'y-Shlosman theory. Due to the deep connections between the Ising model and the dimer model, similar behaviour was expected.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa SO(2) and SO(3) tensorial criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</description>

      <title>Inverse Kinetic Effects: localization and re-entrant transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typically, metallic systems localized under strong disorder exhibit a transition to finite conduction as kinetic terms increase. In this work, we reveal the opposite effect--increasing kinetic terms leads to an unexpected suppression of conductivity, enhancing localization of the system, and even lead to re-entrant delocalization transitions. Specifically, we add a nearest-neighbor hopping with amplitude $\kappa$ to the Rosenzweig-Porter (RP) model with fractal on-site disorder and surprisingly see that, as $\kappa$ grows, the system initially tends to localization from the fractal phase, but then re-enters the ergodic phase. We build an analytical framework to explain this re-entrant behavior, supported by exact diagonalization results. The interplay between the spatially local $\kappa$ term, insensitive to fractal disorder, and the energy-local RP coupling, sensitive to fine-level spacing structure, drives the observed re-entrant behavior. This mechanism offers a novel pathway to re-entrant localization phenomena in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Continual Evolution in Nonreciprocal Ecological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedbacks between evolution and ecology are ubiquitous, with ecological interactions determining which mutants are successful, and these mutants in turn modifying community structure. We study the evolutionary dynamics of several ecological models with overlapping niches, including consumer resource and Lotka-Volterra models. Evolution is assumed slow and extinctions are permanent, with ecological dynamics reaching a stable fixed point between introductions of invaders or mutants. When new strains are slowly added to the community, the ecosystem converges, after an initial evolutionary transient, to a diverse eco-evolutionary steady state. In this "Red Queen" phase of continual evolution, the biodiversity continues to turn over without the invasion probability of new variants getting any smaller. For resource-mediated interactions, the Red Queen phase obtains for any amount of asymmetry in the interactions between strains, and is robust to "general fitness" differences in the intrinsic growth rates of strains. Via a dynamical mean field theory framework valid for high-dimensional phenotype space, we analytically characterize the Red Queen eco-evolutionary steady state in a particular limit of model parameters. Scaling arguments enable a more general understanding of the steady state and evolutionary transients toward it. This work therefore establishes simple models of continual evolution in an ecological context without host-pathogen arms races, and points to the generality of Red Queen evolution. However, we also find other eco-evolutionary phases in simple models: For generalized Lotka-Volterra models with weakly asymmetric interactions an "oligarch" phase emerges in which the evolutionary dynamics continually slow down and a substantial fraction of the community's abundance condenses into a handful of slowly turning-over strains.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium coexistence between a fluid and a hotter or colder crystal of granular hard disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium phase coexistence is commonly observed in both biological and artificial systems, yet understanding it remains a significant challenge. Unlike equilibrium systems, where free energy provides a unifying framework, the absence of such a quantity in non-equilibrium settings complicates their theoretical understanding. Granular materials, driven out of equilibrium by energy dissipation during collisions, serve as an ideal platform to investigate these systems, offering insights into the parallels and distinctions between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior. For example, the coexisting dense phase is typically colder than the dilute phase, a result usually attributed to greater dissipation in denser regions. In this article, we demonstrate that this is not always the case. Using a simple numerical granular model, we show that a hot solid and a cold liquid can coexist in granular systems. This counterintuitive phenomenon arises because the collision frequency can be lower in the solid phase than in the liquid phase, consistent with equilibrium results for hard-disk systems. We further demonstrate that kinetic theory can be extended to accurately predict phase temperatures even at very high packing fractions, including within the solid phase.
  Our results highlight the importance of collisional dynamics and energy exchange in determining phase behavior in granular materials, offering new insights into non-equilibrium phase coexistence and the complex physics underlying granular systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in the Hayden-Preskill protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the time evolution of entanglement asymmetry of the black hole radiation in the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment. We assume the black hole is initially in a mixed state since it is entangled with the early radiation. Alice throws a diary maximally entangled with a reference system into the black hole. After the black hole has absorbed the diary, Bob tries to recover the information that Alice thought should be destroyed by the black hole. In this protocol, we found that a $U(1)$ symmetry of the radiation emerges before a certain transition time. This emergent symmetry is exact in the thermodynamic limit and can be characterized by the vanished entanglement asymmetry of the radiation. The transition time depends on the initial entropy and the size of the diary. What's more, when the initial state of the black hole is maximally mixed, this emergent symmetry survives during the whole procedure of the black hole radiation. We successfully explained this novel phenomenon using the decoupling inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics of complex systems stands to greatly benefit from the qualitative changes in data availability and advances in data-driven computational methods. Many of these systems can be represented by interacting degrees of freedom on inhomogeneous graphs. However, the lack of translational invariance presents a fundamental challenge to theoretical tools, such as the renormalization group, which were so successful in characterizing the universal physical behaviour in critical phenomena. Here we show that compression theory allows the extraction of relevant degrees of freedom in arbitrary geometries, and the development of efficient numerical tools to build an effective theory from data. We demonstrate our method by applying it to a strongly correlated system on an Ammann-Beenker quasicrystal, where it discovers an exotic critical point with broken conformal symmetry. We also apply it to an antiferromagnetic system on non-bipartite random graphs, where any periodicity is absent.</description>

      <title>Avalanche Dynamics and the Effect of Straining in Dislocation Systems with Quenched Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The plastic deformation of crystalline and other heterogeneous materials often manifests in stochastic intermittent events indicating the criticality of plastic behavior. Previous studies demonstrated that the presence of short-ranged quenched disorder modifies this behavior disrupting long-range static and dynamic correlations consequently localizing dislocation avalanches. However, these observations were mostly confined to relaxed materials devoid of deformation history. In this work our focus is on how straining affects static and dynamic correlations, avalanche dynamics and local yield stresses. We demonstrate that the interplay between severe straining and confining quenched disorder induces critical behavior characterized by dislocation avalanches distinct from those at lower stresses. Namely, near the flow stress many avalanches, even if triggered locally, evolve into events affecting a larger region by exciting small clusters of dislocations all around the sample. This type of avalanches differ from the ones at low strains where plastic events typically consist of one compact cluster of dislocations which is either local or it is already quite extended at the onset of the avalanche. Furthermore, we examine the impact of avalanches on local yield stresses. It is shown in detail in this work that while some statistical features of the local yield thresholds are robust to straining, others are significantly affected by the deformation history.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations in the symmetric exclusion process beyond the one-dimensional geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetric simple exclusion process (SEP) is a paradigmatic model of transport, both in and out-of-equilibrium. In this model, the study of currents and their fluctuations has attracted a lot of attention. In finite systems of arbitrary dimension, both the integrated current through a bond (or a fixed surface), and its fluctuations, grow linearly with time. Conversely, for infinite systems, the integrated current displays different behaviours with time, depending on the geometry of the lattice. For instance, in 1D the integrated current fluctuations are known to grow sublinearly with time, as $\sqrt{t}$. Here we study the fluctuations of the integrated current through a given lattice bond beyond the 1D case by considering a SEP on higher-dimensional lattices, and on a comb lattice which describes an intermediate situation between 1D and 2D. We show that the different behaviours of the current originate from qualitatively and quantitatively different current-density correlations in the systems, which we compute explicitly.</description>

      <title>Local integrals of motion in dipole-conserving models with Hilbert space fragmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation is an ergodicity breaking phenomenon, in which Hamiltonian shatters into exponentially many dynamically disconnected sectors. In many fragmented systems, these sectors can be labelled by statistically localized integrals of motion, which are {\em nonlocal} operators. We study the paradigmatic nearest-neighbor pair hopping (PH) model exhibiting the so-called strong fragmentation. We show that this model hosts local integrals of motion (LIOMs), which correspond to frozen density modes with long wavelengths. The latter modes become subdiffusive when longer-range pair hoppings are allowed. Finally, we make a connection with a tilted (Stark) chain. Contrary to the dipole-conserving effective models, the tilted chain is shown to support either Hamiltonian or dipole moment as an LIOM. Numerical results are obtained from a numerical algorithm, in which finding LIOMs is reduced to the data compression problem.</description>

Abstract: Cooperative transport is a striking phenomenon where multiple agents join forces to transit a payload too heavy for the individual. While social animals such as ants are routinely observed to coordinate transport at scale, reproducing the effect in artificial swarms remains challenging, as it requires synchronization in a noisy many-body system. Here we show that cooperative transport spontaneously emerges in swarms of stochastic self-propelled robots. Robots deprived of sensing and communication, are isotropically initialized around a passive circular payload, where directional motion is not expected without an external cue. And yet it moves. We find that a minute modification to the mechanical design of the individual agent dramatically changes its alignment response to an external force. We then show experimentally that by controlling the individual's friction and mass distribution, a swarm of active particles autonomously cooperates in the directional transport of larger objects. Surprisingly, transport increases with increasing payload size, and its persistence surpasses the persistence of the active particles by over an order of magnitude. A mechanical, coarse-grained description reveals that force-alignment is intrinsic and captured by a signed, charge-like parameter with units of curvature. Numerical simulations of swarms of active particles with a negative active charge corroborate the experimental findings. We analytically derive a geometrical criterion for cooperative transport which results from a bifurcation in a non-linear dynamical system. Our findings generalize existing models of active particles, offer new design rules for distributed robotic systems, and shed light on cooperation in natural swarms.</description>

      <title>Temporal Entanglement Barriers in Dual-Unitary Clifford Circuits with Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study temporal entanglement in dual-unitary Clifford circuits with probabilistic measurements preserving spatial unitarity. We exactly characterize the temporal entanglement barrier in the measurement-free regime, exhibiting ballistic growth and decay and a volume-law peak. In the presence of measurements, we relate the temporal entanglement to the scrambling properties of the circuit. For "good scramblers" measurements do not qualitatively change the temporal entanglement profile but only result in a reduced entanglement velocity, whereas for "poor scramblers" the initial ballistic growth of temporal entanglement with bath size is modified to diffusive. This difference is understood through a mapping of the underlying operator dynamics to a biased and an unbiased persistent random walk respectively. In the latter case measurements additionally modify the ballistic decay to the perfect dephaser limit, with vanishing temporal entanglement, to an exponential decay, which we describe through a spatial transfer matrix method. This spatial dynamics is shown to be described by a non-Hermitian hopping model, exhibiting a PT-breaking transition at a critical measurement rate $p=1/2$. In all cases the peak value of the temporal entanglement barrier exhibits volume-law scaling for all measurement rates.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation and aspects of integrability of generalised hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalised Hydrodynamics (GHD) describes the large-scale inhomogeneous dynamics of integrable (or close to integrable) systems in one dimension of space, based on a central equation for the fluid density or quasi-particle density: the GHD equation. We consider a new, general form of the GHD equation: we allow for spatially extended interaction kernels, generalising previous constructions. We show that the GHD equation, in our general form and hence also in its conventional form, is Hamiltonian. This holds also including force terms representing inhomogeneous external potentials coupled to conserved densities. To this end, we introduce a new Poisson bracket on functionals of the fluid density, which is seen as our dynamical field variable. The total energy is the Hamiltonian whose flow under this Poisson bracket generates the GHD equation. The fluid density depends on two (real and spectral) variables so the GHD equation can be seen as a $2+1$-dimensional classical field theory. In its $1+1$-dimensional reduction corresponding to the case without external forces, we further show the system admits an infinite set of conserved quantities that are in involution for our Poisson bracket, hinting at integrability of this field theory.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger Entanglement in Monitored Random Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the standard monitored random Clifford circuits from the perspective of $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger ($\text{GHZ}_n$) entanglement, and find a series of new results about steady-state phase transitions, critical properties, and entanglement dynamics. For $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement, we identify a measurement-induced transitions between a phase with finite amount of $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement and a phase with no such entanglement. This transition also depends on how the system is divided into three parties: A partitioning-induced phase transition is observed in circuits with open boundary condition. For multipartite $\text{GHZ}_{n\geq 4}$ entanglement, we find that they emerge exclusively at the measurement-induced criticality. For the dynamical aspect, we find that $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement does not grow gradually as the case of bipartite entanglement. Instead, it appears suddenly via a dynamical phase transition (DPT). Moreover, in some situations without measurements, it persists for a while and then dies through another DPT. These DPTs are not in the scope of standard formalism based on Loschmidt amplitude.</description>

      <title>Transformer Wave Function for Quantum Long-Range models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ a neural-network architecture based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to find the ground states of quantum long-range models, specifically the transverse-field Ising model for spin-1/2 chains across different interaction regimes. Harnessing the transformer's capacity to capture long-range correlations, we compute the full phase diagram and critical properties of the model, in both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases. Our findings show that the ViT maintains high accuracy across the full phase diagram. We compare these results with previous numerical studies in the literature and, in particular, show that the ViT has a superior performance than a restricted-Boltzmann-machine-like ansatz.</description>

      <title>Why collective behaviours self-organise to criticality: A primer on information-theoretic and thermodynamic utility measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective behaviours are frequently observed to self-organise to criticality. Existing proposals to explain these phenomena, such as Self-organised Criticality (SOC), are fragmented across disciplines and only partially answer the question. This paper investigates the underlying, intrinsic, utilities that may explain self-organisation of collective behaviours near criticality. We focus on information-driven approaches such as predictive information, empowerment, and active inference, as well as thermodynamic efficiency, which incorporates both information-theoretic and thermodynamic quantities. By interpreting the Ising model as a perception-action loop, we compare how different intrinsic utilities shape collective behaviour and analyse the distinct characteristics that arise when each is optimised. In particular, we highlight that at the critical regime thermodynamic efficiency balances the predictability gained by the system and its energy costs. Finally, we propose the Principle of Super-efficiency, suggesting that collective behaviours self-organise to the critical regime where optimal efficiency is achieved with respect to the entropy reduction relative to the thermodynamic costs.</description>

      <title>Semi-Dirac fermions in hexagonal close-packed cadmium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-Dirac fermions are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular directions. Such quasiparticles have been proposed in various contexts in condensed matter. Using first principles calculations, we identify a pair of semi-Dirac bands in the electronic structure of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) cadmium, which keep their linear out-of-plane and quadratic inplane dispersions up to the Fermi level. We demonstrate that the dichotomy between the linear and quadratic dispersions is driven by an orientation-sensitive hybridization between the $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals. The upper semi-Dirac band produces a lens-shaped nonellipsoidal Fermi sheet whose cross-section area has a $k$-dependence that is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured period of Sondheimer oscillations.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Quantum Harmonic Otto Engine Under Hot Squeezed Thermal Reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a quantum harmonic Otto engine under a hot squeezed thermal reservoir with asymmetry between the two adiabatic branches introduced by considering different speeds of the driving protocols. In the first configuration, the driving protocol for the expansion stroke is sudden-switch in nature and compression stroke is driven adiabatically, while the second configuration deals with the converse situation. In both cases, we obtain analytic expressions for the upper bound on efficiency and efficiency at optimal work output, which reveals a significant difference between the two configurations. Additionally, we find that the maximum achievable efficiency in sudden expansion case is 1/2 only while it approaches unity for the sudden compression stroke. Further, we study the effect of increasing degree of squeezing on the efficiency and work output of the engine and indicate the optimal operational regime for both configurations under consideration. Finally, by studying the full phase-diagram of the Otto cycle we observe that the operational region of the engine mode grows with increasing squeezing at the expense of refrigeration regime.</description>
