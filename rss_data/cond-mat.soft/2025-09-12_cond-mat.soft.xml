      <title>Role of evaporation in stability of foam films and foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the stability of foam films and foams remains a challenge, despite the considerable efforts provided by the scientific community to refine their physical descriptions. This persistent difficulty underscores the interplay of various complex factors. Recently, the role of evaporation has attracted attention for its dual impact: it can either enhance stability or accelerate bursting. To depict a comprehensive overview on soapy objects, we propose first a short description on the evaporation of drops to present some key results on the evaporation-induced cooling and the consequences on the internal flows generated by Marangoni effects. Then, we review the literature on foam films and foams, examining three distinct systems: pure liquids, non-volatile, and volatile surface active molecules. We show that evaporation of foam films and foams can lead to significant variations of temperature. In conclusion, we identify a series of open questions and suggest potential research pathways to address these challenges.</description>

      <title>LAOStrain response of carbon black-polymer hydrogels: insights from rheo-TRUSAXS and rheo-electric experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloid-polymer hydrogels are encountered in various applications, from flow batteries to drug delivery. Here, we investigate hydrogels composed of hydrophobic colloidal soot particles -- carbon black (CB) -- and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a food-grade polymer functionalized with hydrophobic groups binding physically to CB. As described in [Legrand et al., Macromolecules 56, 2298-2308 (2023)], CB-CMC hydrogels exist in two flavors: either electrically conductive when featuring a percolated network of CB particles decorated by CMC, or insulating where isolated CB particles act as physical cross-linkers within the CMC matrix. We compare these two types of CB-CMC hydrogels under Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS), combining rheometry with Time-Resolved Ultra-Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (TRUSAXS) and electrical conductivity measurements. Both types of hydrogels exhibit a "type III" yielding scenario, characterized by an overshoot in G'' and a monotonic decrease in G', although the underlying microscopic mechanisms differ markedly. Conductive CB-CMC hydrogels display a yield strain (6%) concomitant with a drop in DC conductivity, indicative of the macroscopic rupture of the percolated CB network at length scales larger than a few microns, beyond USAXS resolution. At larger strain amplitudes, the conductivity of the fluidized sample increases again, exceeding its initial value, consistent with shear-induced formation of a transient, dynamically percolated network of CB clusters. In contrast, insulating CB-CMC hydrogels exhibit a larger yield strain (60%), beyond which the sample flows and the average distance between CB particles decreases. This reorganization is concomitant with a more than tenfold increase in conductivity, although it remains below that of conductive hydrogels at rest.</description>

      <title>Vortex triplets, symmetry breaking, and emergent nonequilibrium plastic crystals in an active-spinner fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of patterns and exotic nonequilibrium steady states in active-fluid systems continues to pose challenging problems -- theoretical, numerical, and experimental -- for statistical physicists and fluid dynamicists. We combine theoretical ideas from statistical mechanics and fluid mechanics to uncover a new type of self-assembled crystal of vortex triplets in an active-spinner fluid. We begin with the two-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) model for a binary-fluid system of active rotors that has two important ingredients: a scalar order parameter field phi that distinguishes regions with clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) spinners; and an incompressible velocity field u. In addition to the conventional CHNS coupling between phi and u, this model has a torque-induced activity term, with coefficient tau, whose consequences we explore. We demonstrate that, if we increase the activity tau, it overcomes dissipation and this system displays a hitherto unanticipated emergent triangular crystal, with spinning vortex triplets at its vertices. We show that this is a nonequilibrium counterpart of an equilibrium plastic crystal. We characterise the statistical properties of this novel crystal and suggest possible experimental realisations of this new state of active matter.</description>

      <title>Universality in the velocity jump in the crack propagation observed for food-wrapping films for daily use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The velocity jump found in the crack propagation for rubbers has been a powerful tool for developing tough rubber materials. Although it is suggested by a theory that the jump could be observed widely for viscoelastic materials, the report on a clear jump is very limited and, even in such a case, reproducibility is low, except for elastomers. Here, we use a mundane food-wrapping film as a sample and observe the crack propagation velocity with pulling the sample at a constant speed in the direction perpendicular to the crack. As a result, we find the jump occurs at a critical strain with high reproducibility. Remarkably, the plot of the crack-propagation velocity as a function of strain can be collapsed onto a master curve by an appropriate rescaling, where the master curve is found to be universal for change in the pulling speed and in the sample height. The result reveals a key parameter for the jump is the strain, suggesting the existence of a small length that governs the deformation along the crack. The present study sets limitations on future theories and opens an avenue for the velocity jump to become a tool for developing a wide variety of tough polymer-based materials.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous elongation of 3D gastruloids from local cell polarity alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gastruloids are 3D stem cell aggregate models for early embryogenesis that provide a unique platform to study how collective cell dynamics drive tissue symmetry breaking and axial elongation. Using 3D light sheet imaging, we show that a pulse of Chiron, a Wnt activator, induces coherent alignment of cell polarity during elongation. While nuclear elongation occurs with or without treatment, only Chiron-treated gastruloids exhibit quasi-long-range alignment of nuclear axes, linking cell polarity coherence to tissue-scale remodeling. A minimal physical model of polarized cells, incorporating alignment-dependent torques and polarity-mediated adhesion, reproduces symmetry breaking and elongation, demonstrating that local cell polarity alignment alone can drive tissue-scale convergence-extension flows.</description>

      <title>On the role of water activity on the formation of a protein-rich coffee ring in an evaporating multicomponent drop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coffee-ring effect is a universal feature of evaporating sessile droplets with pinned contact line, wherein solutes or particles are advected to the droplet's edge due to evaporation-driven flows. While existing models have successfully described this phenomenon in particle-laden droplets, they often assume that hydrodynamics are decoupled from solute transport. This assumption breaks down in complex fluids, such as protein or polymeric solutions, where the solute can influence evaporation through changes in water activity. Here, we investigate model respiratory droplets primarily composed of water, salt, and a type of the glycoprotein mucin. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observe the formation of a well-defined protein ring at the droplet edge as water evaporates. The growth and morphology of this ring exhibit a strong dependence on ambient relative humidity ($H_r$), revealing dynamics that existing models cannot capture. Specifically, we find that protein accumulation at the edge is governed by the feedback between local solute concentration and evaporation rate. To account for this, we develop a minimal theoretical model based on the lubrication approximation, incorporating the coupling between hydrodynamics and solute transport through the evaporation rate. Our framework reproduces key features of the experimental observations and suggests a physical basis for the $H_r$-dependent stability and infectivity of respiratory droplets containing viruses.</description>

      <title>Isotopic Fingerprints of Proton-mediated Dielectric Relaxation in Solid and Liquid Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report cross-validated measurements of the isotope effect on dielectric relaxation for four isotopologues of ice and water, including the 1-10^5 Hz region, in which only sporadic and inconsistent measurements were previously available. In ice, the relaxation rates exhibit an activated temperature dependence with an isotope-independent activation energy. Across 248-273 K, the H_2O/D_2O relaxation rate ratio remains constant at 2.0 \pm 0.1. This scaling agrees with Kramers' theory in the high-friction limit if the moving mass is the proton or deuteron, indicating that dielectric relaxation is governed by a classic proton transfer over an energy barrier rather than molecular reorientation.</description>

      <title>Coarsening model of chromosomal crossover placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chromosomal crossovers play a crucial role in meiotic cell division, as they ensure proper chromosome segregation and increase genetic variability. Experiments have consistently revealed two key observations across species: (i) the number of crossovers per chromosome is typically small, but at least one, and (ii) crossovers on the same chromosome are subject to interference, i.e., they are more separated than expected by chance. These observations can be explained by a recently proposed coarsening model, where the dynamics of droplets associated with chromosomes designate crossovers. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the coarsening model, which we also extend by including material exchanges between droplets, the synaptonemal complex, and the nucleoplasm. We derive scaling laws for the crossover count, which allows us to analyze data across species. Moreover, our model provides a coherent explanation of experimental data across mutants, including the wild-type and zyp1-mutant of A. thaliana. Consequently, the extended coarsening model provides a solid framework for investigating the underlying mechanisms of crossover placement.</description>

      <title>Orientational dynamics governs the pathways of entropic crystallization of Brownian squares</title>

Abstract: In dense systems of hard-interacting colloidal particles having anisotropic shapes, crystallization pathways represent an interesting frontier. The translational and rotational dynamics of such particles become coupled at higher densities, resulting in complex kinetics of their configurational ordering. To elucidate this, we have studied a two-dimensional entropic system of osmotically compressed corner-rounded Brownian square platelets. By analyzing the translational and orientational dynamics of the particles and their respective contributions toward minimizing the free energy, we show that the range of accessible orientational states of the particles principally governs the pathways of structural evolution, as the orientational entropy dictates the minimization of the free energy and, hence, the resulting optimal equilibrium ordering. When the particles have access to a wider range of orientational states, the larger rotational component of configurational entropy minimizes the total free energy, leading to hexagonal ordering. At higher osmotic pressures, the long collective translational fluctuations of the side-aligned particles with restricted rotational fluctuations maximize the entropy with a greater contribution from the translational component, thereby inducing a free energetically favored rhombic crystalline structure. We further show that density influences the crystallization pathways indirectly by setting an upper bound on the range of accessible orientational states. Complementary Brownian dynamics simulations and free-energy calculations further corroborate our findings, and their generalizability is demonstrated using a system of triangular particles. Thus, orientational dynamics is predicted to play a crucial role in governing the pathways for entropic ordering of various anisotropic shapes.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Insights into the Chain-Length-Dependent Antifreeze Activity of Oligoprolines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity of polymers generally increases with chain length. However, for polyproline (PPro), a highly potent cryoprotectant, the IRI activity varies nonmonotonically with the degree of polymerization (DP), i.e., DP=8 (P8) &gt; DP=15 (P15) &gt; DP=3 (P3). Herein, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the microscopic mechanism behind this nonmonotonic effect in PPro. Our findings indicate that the population of the PPII helix structure, which increases with DP, is not the primary reason for this effect. Instead, both single-molecule conformation and multi-molecule aggregation play critical roles. At the single-molecule level, PPro exhibits two types of thermodynamically stable conformations:linear (L) and coil (C), with the latter demonstrating enhanced IRI potency due to its stronger hydrophobicity and ice-binding capability. Notably, P8 has a higher content of the C conformation compared to P15, accounting for its superior IRI activity. Aligning with the conventional understandings, P3's lowest activity stems from its excessively small volume/coverage area on the ice surface. At the multi-molecule level, P15 shows a significantly higher tendency to aggregate than P8, which limits the ability of PPro molecules to fully spread at the ice-water interface and reduces their effective coverage of the ice surface, thereby diminishing its effectiveness. And P15's aggregation becomes significantly pronounced at high concentrations, amplifying the nonmonotonic effect. This work provides an atomistic insight into the nonmonotonic relationship between IRI activity and DP in PPro, offering valuable insights for the rational design of novel biocompatible antifreeze polymers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colloidal gels gradually evolve as their structures reorganize, a process known as aging. Understanding this behavior is essential for fundamental science and practical applications such as drug delivery and tissue engineering. This study examines the aging of low-concentration Laponite suspensions with varying salt concentrations using fluorescence microscopy, scattering imaging, and particle tracking microrheology. Structural heterogeneity appeared earlier at higher salt concentrations, and the average size of aggregates decreased as the salt concentration increased further. Fourier transform analysis corroborated these trends, and scattering images showed similar results. Microrheology revealed distinct dynamics in Laponite-rich and Laponite-poor regions: the poor phase exhibited liquid-like behavior, while the rich phase exhibited gel-like properties. Further analysis suggested the presence of submicron or nanoscale structural heterogeneities within the rich phase. These findings provide insight into how aging and salt concentration shape the structure and dynamics of colloidal gels.</description>

Abstract: Rubber friction is of major practical importance in applications such as tires, rubber seals, and footwear. This review article focuses on the theory and experimental studies of rubber friction on substrates with random roughness. We examine both steady sliding and accelerated motion, with particular attention to the origins of the breakloose friction force and the influence of pre-slip, elasticity, and flash temperature on friction dynamics. We further discuss rolling friction for cylinders and spheres, as well as sliding friction for triangular sliders on dry and lubricated rubber surfaces. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results obtained using different materials, geometries, and environmental conditions, highlighting the importance of accounting for multiscale roughness. Open challenges, such as the role of adhesion enhancement, energy dissipation due to crack opening, and the physical origin of the short-distance roughness cut-off, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Evaluating non-equilibrium trajectories via mean back relaxation: Dependence on length and time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mean back relaxation (MBR) relates the value of a stochastic process at three different time points. It has been shown to detect broken detailed balance under certain conditions. For experiments of probe particles in living and passivated cells, MBR was found to be related to the so called effective energy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem. In this manuscript, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters that enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding qualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the phenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of time parameters compared to previous work, allowing to test it in systems with limited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in dependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in MBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in terms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum as a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data to a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process.</description>
