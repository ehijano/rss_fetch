      <title>Lecture notes on Nichols algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These are lecture notes for an introductory course on Nichols algebras. As a main reference, I work with the book by Heckenberger and Schneider, but I want to take a distinct categorical perspective and try to develop the topic for an audience without a background in Hopf algebras. On the other hand I put some emphasis on hands-on examples. My first goal is to explain the definitions and the striking properties of Nichols algebras, foremost the odd reflection theory that is already present in Lie superalgebras. My second goal is to explain how the category of representations of a quantum group can be constructed, using categorical tools, from the Nichols algebra as its centerpiece. This makes the zoo of different existing versions of quantum groups more transparent and allows the construction of many more non-semisimple modular tensor categories. Other topics include different types of examples beyond the diagonal case, categorical versions of some Hopf algebra constructions, and an outlook section on the appearance of Nichols algebras in conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Some classifications of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras over the Hopf algebra $H_{b:x^2y}$ of Kashina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be the $16$-dimensional nontrivial (namely, noncommutative and noncocommutative) semisimple Hopf algebra $H_{b:x^2y}$ classified by Kashina. We figure out all simple Yetter-Drinfeld $H$-modules, and then determine all finite-dimensional Nichols algebras satisfying the constraint condition $\mathcal{B}(V)\cong \bigotimes_{i\in I}\mathcal{B}(V_i)$, where $V=\bigoplus_{i\in I}V_i$, each $V_i$ is a simple object in $_H^H\mathcal{YD}$. Finally, we describe some liftings of the corresponding Radford biproducts $\mathcal{B}(V)\sharp H$, which provide some classifications of finite dimensional Hopf algebras with $H$ as their coradical.</description>

      <title>Factorization algebras in quite a lot of generality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a first stab at a mathematical framework in which one can study quantum field theories on spacetimes with quite general geometries. We will study these theories via their factorization algebras. The aim is to identify a minimalist formalism that makes sense of factorization algebras in any geometric context. This formalism extends the technology of factorization algebras to many new contexts, including those arising in arithmetic quantum field theories.
  In order to make sense of factorization algebras on a geometric object X, one needs two ingredients. First, one needs an additional piece of structure on X that we call an "isolability structure." This is the data required to say whether two (generalized) points of X are "distant." This is encoded as a functor from a certain combinatorial category of cographs. Second, one needs some sort of sheaf theory. The isolability structure then induces on the category of sheaves a kind of twofold symmetric monoidal structure. Factorization algebras are then defined in terms of this structure.
  This paper develops this formalism. We describe how some existing theories of factorization algebras fit into this framework, and we give a construction of the Beilinson-Drinfeld Grassmannian as a factorization stack that works in quite a lot of generality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a single solution of QYBE (or CYBE) we produce an infinite family of solutions of QYBE (or CYBE) parametrized by transitive arrays and, in particular, by signed permutations. We are especially interested in cases when such solutions yield quasi-triangular structures on direct powers of Lie bialgebras and tensor powers of Hopf algebras. We obtain infinite families of such structures as well and study the corresponding Poisson-Lie structures and co-quasi-triangular algebras.</description>

      <title>Mass formula for topological boundary conditions from TQFT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass formulas evaluate the total weighted count of a given class of algebraic structures, such as lattices or codes. We show that 3d TQFTs provide a generalization of this concept: the total weighted count of topological boundary conditions is given by the TQFT partition function averaged over all closed 3d manifolds. This weighted count, which we call the mass, can be interpreted as the renormalized partition function of TQFT gravity. For Abelian TQFTs, the mass formula for topological boundary conditions reduces to the mass formula for particular families of codes. Focusing on the Abelian case, we show how to evaluate the mass for any bosonic theory and consider many explicit examples. We then discuss the non-Abelian generalization and compute the mass for $n + \bar n$ copies of the Ising modular tensor category. Finally, we generalize the construction to five dimensions and compute the mass for Abelian 2-form Chern-Simons theories.</description>

      <title>A new new coproduct on quantum loop algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum loop algebras generalize $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ for simple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$, and they include examples such as quantum affinizations of Kac-Moody Lie algebras, K-theoretic Hall algebras of quivers, and BPS algebras for toric Calabi-Yau threefolds. In the present paper, we define a coproduct on general quantum loop algebras, which coincides with the Drinfeld-Jimbo coproduct in the particular case of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ . We investigate the consequences of our construction for the representation theory of quantum loop algebras, particularly for tensor products of modules and R-matrices.</description>

      <title>Systematic Orbifold Constructions of Schellekens' Vertex Operator Algebras from Niemeier Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.00849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic, rigorous construction of all 70 strongly rational, holomorphic vertex operator algebras $V$ of central charge 24 with non-zero weight-one space $V_1$ as cyclic orbifold constructions associated with the 24 Niemeier lattice vertex operator algebras $V_N$ and certain 226 short automorphisms in $\operatorname{Aut}(V_N)$.
  We show that up to algebraic conjugacy these automorphisms are exactly the generalised deep holes, as introduced in arXiv:1910.04947, of the Niemeier lattice vertex operator algebras with the additional property that their orders are equal to those of the corresponding outer automorphisms.
  Together with the constructions in arXiv:1708.05990 and arXiv:1910.04947 this gives three different uniform constructions of these vertex operator algebras, which are related through 11 algebraic conjugacy classes in $\operatorname{Co}_0$.
  Finally, by considering the inverse orbifold constructions associated with the 226 short automorphisms, we give the first systematic proof of the result that each strongly rational, holomorphic vertex operator algebra $V$ of central charge 24 with non-zero weight-one space $V_1$ is uniquely determined by the Lie algebra structure of $V_1$.</description>

Abstract: We categorify a class of quantum groups associated with quivers, possibly with loops, by constructing the corresponding Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras (KLR) algebras $R$. We prove that the indecomposable projective $R$-modules realize the canonical basis of the negative part $U^-$ of the quantum group. Moreover, for $\Lambda \in P^+$, the cyclotomic KLR algebra $R^\Lambda$ provide a categorification of the irreducible highest weight $U$-module $V(\Lambda)$.</description>

Abstract: This paper works as an appendix of the paper titled Geometry of Associated Quantum Vector Bundles and the Quantum Gauge Group and for paper titled Yang-Mills-Connes Theory and Quantum Principal SU(N)-Bundles. Here, we are going to prove four statements in the theory of quantum principal bundles:: 1) The universal differential envelope $\ast$--calculus of a matrix (compact) Lie group, for the classical bicovariant $\ast$--First Order Differential Calculus, is the algebra of differential forms. 2) An example of a quantum principal bundle in which the space of base forms is not generated by the base space. 3) The group isomorphism between convolution-invertible maps and covariant left module isomorphisms at the level of differential calculus 4) The way the maps $\{T^V_k \}$ from Remark 3.1 look in differential geometry.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Extensions of Unitary Vertex Operator Algebras and Conformal Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $V$ be one of the following unitary strongly-rational VOAs: unitary WZW models, discrete series W-algebras of type ADE, even lattice VOAs, parafermion VOAs, their tensor products, and their strongly-rational cosets. Let $U$ be a (unitary) VOA extension of $V$, described by a Q-system $Q$.
  We prove that $U$ is strongly local. Let $\mathcal A_V,\mathcal A_U$ be the conformal nets associated to $V,U$ in the sense of Carpi-Kawahigashi-Longo-Weiner (CKLW). We prove that $\mathcal A_U$ is canonically isomorphic to the conformal net extension of $\mathcal A_V$ defined by the Q-system $Q$.
  We prove that all unitary $U$-modules are strongly integrable in the sense of Carpi-Weiner-Xu (CWX). We show that the CWX $*$-functor from the $C^*$-category of unitary $U$-modules to the $C^*$-category of finite-index $\mathcal A_U$-modules is naturally isomorphic to $*$-functor defined by $Q$.</description>

      <title>Optimization of maximal quantum f-divergences between unitary orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximal quantum $f$-divergences, defined via the commutant Radon--Nikodym derivative, form a fundamental class of distinguishability measures for quantum states associated with operator convex functions. In this paper, we study the optimization of maximal quantum $f$-divergences along unitary orbits of two quantum states.
  For any operator convex function $f:(0,+\infty)\to\mathbb{R}$, we determine the exact minimum and maximum of $$ U \longmapsto \widehat S_f(\rho\|U^*\sigma U) $$ over the unitary group, and derive explicit spectral formulas for these extremal values together with complete characterizations of the unitaries that attain them.
  Our approach combines the integral representation of operator convex functions with majorization theory and a unitary-orbit variational method. A key step is to show that any extremizer must commute with the reference state, which reduces the noncommutative optimization problem to a spectral permutation problem. As a consequence, the minimum is achieved by pairing the decreasing eigenvalues of $\rho$ and $\sigma$, while the maximum corresponds to pairing the decreasing eigenvalues of $\rho$ with the increasing eigenvalues of $\sigma$. Hence, the range of the maximal quantum $f$-divergence along the unitary orbit is exactly the closed interval determined by these two extremal configurations.
  Finally, we compare our results with recent unitary-orbit optimization results for quantum $f$-divergences defined via the quantum hockey-stick divergence, highlighting fundamental structural differences between the two frameworks. Our findings extend earlier extremal results for Umegaki, R\'enyi, and related quantum divergences, and clarify the distinct operator-theoretic nature of maximal quantum $f$-divergences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any four-dimensional Supersymmetric Quantum Field Theory with eight supercharges can be associated to a monoidal category of BPS line defects. Any Coulomb vacuum of such a theory can be conjecturally associated to an ``algebra of BPS particles'', exemplified by certain Cohomological Hall Algebras. We conjecture the existence of a monoidal functor from the category of line defects to a certain category of bimodules for the BPS Algebra in any Coulomb vacuum. We describe images of simple objects under the conjectural functor and study their monoidal structure in examples. We conjecture that the functor may be an equivalence of dg-categories and test the conjecture at the level of the equivariant Witten indices of the spaces of morphisms.</description>

Abstract: We consider a generalization of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of a surface that is generated by loops and arcs between marked points on the interior or boundary, up to skein relations defined by Muller and Roger-Yang. We compute the center of this Muller-Roger-Yang skein algebra and show that it is almost Azumaya when the quantum parameter $q$ is a primitive $n$-th root of unity with odd $n$. We also discuss the implications on the representation theory of the Muller-Roger-Yang generalized skein algebra.</description>

      <title>Minimal Factorization of Chern-Simons Theory -- Gravitational Anyonic Edge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00501v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One approach to analyzing entanglement in a gauge theory is embedding it into a factorized theory with edge modes on the entangling boundary. For topological quantum field theories (TQFT), this naturally leads to factorizing a TQFT by adding local edge modes associated with the corresponding CFT. In this work, we instead construct a minimal set of edge modes compatible with the topological invariance of Chern-Simons theory. This leads us to propose a minimal factorization map. These minimal edge modes can be interpreted as the degrees of freedom of a particle on a quantum group. Of particular interest is three-dimensional gravity as a Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SL$(2,\mathbb{R}) \times$ SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$. Our minimal factorization proposal uniquely gives rise to quantum group edge modes factorizing the bulk state space of 3d gravity. This agrees with earlier proposals that relate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in 3d gravity to topological entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>The Geometric P=W conjecture and Thurston's compactification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use new results together with established facts about Thurston's compactification of Teichm\"uller space to address the geometric P=W conjecture for $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, which concerns projective compactifications of character varieties of closed surfaces. In particular, we construct a projective compactification of the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-character variety of any closed surface of genus $g&gt;1$, in which the boundary divisors are toric varieties and the dual intersection complex is a sphere. A main technical step, of independent interest, is the derivation of an explicit formula for a well-known embedding of the set of isotopy classes of multicurves on a closed surface of genus $g$ into $\mathbb{N}^{9g-9}$.</description>

      <title>Compactification of quasi-local algebras on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a compactification construction for abstract quasi-local C*-algebras over countable metric spaces equipped with an isometric group action which is functorial with respect to bounded spread isomorphisms. In $1$D, the construction recovers Ocneanu's Tube algebra for fusion spin chains, and provides a canonical bridge between infinite-volume observables and observables with periodic boundary conditions. We exploit this connection to derive an obstruction for the implementability of such topological symmetries as Kramers-Wannier type dualities on symmetric subalgebras.</description>
