      <title>Optimal high-precision shadow estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give the first tight sample complexity bounds for shadow tomography and classical shadows in the regime where the target error is below some sufficiently small inverse polynomial in the dimension of the Hilbert space. Formally we give a protocol that, given any $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\epsilon \le O(d^{-12})$, measures $O(\log(m)/\epsilon^2)$ copies of an unknown mixed state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$ and outputs a classical description of $\rho$ which can then be used to estimate any collection of $m$ observables to within additive accuracy $\epsilon$. Previously, even for the simpler task of shadow tomography -- where the $m$ observables are known in advance -- the best known rates either scaled benignly but suboptimally in all of $m, d, \epsilon$, or scaled optimally in $\epsilon, m$ but had additional polynomial factors in $d$ for general observables. Intriguingly, we also show via dimensionality reduction, that we can rescale $\epsilon$ and $d$ to reduce to the regime where $\epsilon \le O(d^{-1/2})$. Our algorithm draws upon representation-theoretic tools recently developed in the context of full state tomography.</description>

      <title>Truthfulness of Calibration Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the truthfulness of calibration measures in sequential prediction. A calibration measure is said to be truthful if the forecaster (approximately) minimizes the expected penalty by predicting the conditional expectation of the next outcome, given the prior distribution of outcomes. Truthfulness is an important property of calibration measures, ensuring that the forecaster is not incentivized to exploit the system with deliberate poor forecasts. This makes it an essential desideratum for calibration measures, alongside typical requirements, such as soundness and completeness.
  We conduct a taxonomy of existing calibration measures and their truthfulness. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that all of them are far from being truthful. That is, under existing calibration measures, there are simple distributions on which a polylogarithmic (or even zero) penalty is achievable, while truthful prediction leads to a polynomial penalty. Our main contribution is the introduction of a new calibration measure termed the Subsampled Smooth Calibration Error (SSCE) under which truthful prediction is optimal up to a constant multiplicative factor.</description>

      <title>Hyper-Heuristics Can Profit From Global Variation Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work, Lissovoi, Oliveto, and Warwicker (Artificial Intelligence (2023)) proved that the Move Acceptance Hyper-Heuristic (MAHH) leaves the local optimum of the multimodal CLIFF benchmark with remarkable efficiency. The $O(n^3)$ runtime of the MAHH, for almost all cliff widths $d\ge 2,$ is significantly better than the $\Theta(n^d)$ runtime of simple elitist evolutionary algorithms (EAs) on CLIFF.
  In this work, we first show that this advantage is specific to the CLIFF problem and does not extend to the JUMP benchmark, the most prominent multi-modal benchmark in the theory of randomized search heuristics. We prove that for any choice of the MAHH selection parameter $p$, the expected runtime of the MAHH on a JUMP function with gap size $m = O(n^{1/2})$ is at least $\Omega(n^{2m-1} / (2m-1)!)$. This is significantly slower than the $O(n^m)$ runtime of simple elitist EAs. Encouragingly, we also show that replacing the local one-bit mutation operator in the MAHH with the global bit-wise mutation operator, commonly used in EAs, yields a runtime of $\min\{1, O(\frac{e\ln(n)}{m})^m\} \, O(n^m)$ on JUMP functions. This is at least as good as the runtime of simple elitist EAs. For larger values of $m$, this result proves an asymptotic performance gain over simple EAs. As our proofs reveal, the MAHH profits from its ability to walk through the valley of lower objective values in moderate-size steps, always accepting inferior solutions. This is the first time that such an optimization behavior is proven via mathematical means. Generally, our result shows that combining two ways of coping with local optima, global mutation and accepting inferior solutions, can lead to considerable performance gains.</description>

      <title>Exponential Quantum Advantage for Pathfinding in Regular Sunflower Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding problems that allow for superpolynomial quantum speedup is one of the most important tasks in quantum computation. A key challenge is identifying problem structures that can only be exploited by quantum mechanics. In this paper, we find a class of graphs that allows for exponential quantum-classical separation for the pathfinding problem with the adjacency list oracle, and this class of graphs is named regular sunflower graphs. We prove that, with high probability, a regular sunflower graph of degree at least $7$ is a mild expander graph, that is, the spectral gap of the graph Laplacian is at least inverse polylogarithmic in the graph size.
  We provide an efficient quantum algorithm to find an $s$-$t$ path in the regular sunflower graph while any classical algorithm takes exponential time. This quantum advantage is achieved by efficiently preparing a $0$-eigenstate of the adjacency matrix of the regular sunflower graph as a quantum superposition state over the vertices, and this quantum state contains enough information to help us efficiently find an $s$-$t$ path in the regular sunflower graph.
  Because the security of an isogeny-based cryptosystem depends on the hardness of finding an $s$-$t$ path in an expander graph \cite{Charles2009}, a quantum speedup of the pathfinding problem on an expander graph is of significance. Our result represents a step towards this goal as the first provable exponential speedup for pathfinding in a mild expander graph.</description>

      <title>Algorithmically Fair Maximization of Multiple Submodular Objective Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constrained maximization of submodular functions poses a central problem in combinatorial optimization. In many realistic scenarios, a number of agents need to maximize multiple submodular objectives over the same ground set. We study such a setting, where the different solutions must be disjoint, and thus, questions of algorithmic fairness arise. Inspired from the fair division literature, we suggest a simple round-robin protocol, where agents are allowed to build their solutions one item at a time by taking turns. Unlike what is typical in fair division, however, the prime goal here is to provide a fair algorithmic environment; each agent is allowed to use any algorithm for constructing their respective solutions. We show that just by following simple greedy policies, agents have solid guarantees for both monotone and non-monotone objectives, and for combinatorial constraints as general as $p$-systems (which capture cardinality and matroid intersection constraints). In the monotone case, our results include approximate EF1-type guarantees and their implications in fair division may be of independent interest. Further, although following a greedy policy may not be optimal in general, we show that consistently performing better than that is computationally hard.</description>

      <title>Private Mean Estimation with Person-Level Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study person-level differentially private (DP) mean estimation in the case where each person holds multiple samples. DP here requires the usual notion of distributional stability when $\textit{all}$ of a person's datapoints can be modified. Informally, if $n$ people each have $m$ samples from an unknown $d$-dimensional distribution with bounded $k$-th moments, we show that \[n = \tilde \Theta\left(\frac{d}{\alpha^2 m} + \frac{d}{\alpha m^{1/2} \varepsilon} + \frac{d}{\alpha^{k/(k-1)} m \varepsilon} + \frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\] people are necessary and sufficient to estimate the mean up to distance $\alpha$ in $\ell_2$-norm under $\varepsilon$-differential privacy (and its common relaxations). In the multivariate setting, we give computationally efficient algorithms under approximate-DP and computationally inefficient algorithms under pure DP, and our nearly matching lower bounds hold for the most permissive case of approximate DP. Our computationally efficient estimators are based on the standard clip-and-noise framework, but the analysis for our setting requires both new algorithmic techniques and new analyses. In particular, our new bounds on the tails of sums of independent, vector-valued, bounded-moments random variables may be of interest.</description>

      <title>Simple, unified analysis of Johnson-Lindenstrauss with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10232v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simplified and unified analysis of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, a cornerstone of dimensionality reduction for managing high-dimensional data. Our approach simplifies understanding and unifies various constructions under the JL framework, including spherical, binary-coin, sparse JL, Gaussian, and sub-Gaussian models. This unification preserves the intrinsic geometry of data, essential for applications from streaming algorithms to reinforcement learning. We provide the first rigorous proof of the spherical construction's effectiveness and introduce a general class of sub-Gaussian constructions within this simplified framework. Central to our contribution is an innovative extension of the Hanson-Wright inequality to high dimensions, complete with explicit constants. By using simple yet powerful probabilistic tools and analytical techniques, such as an enhanced diagonalization process, our analysis solidifies the theoretical foundation of the JL lemma by removing an independence assumption and extends its practical applicability to contemporary algorithms.</description>
