      <title>Quantized Transport of Disordered Superconducting $\nu=2/3$ Fractional Quantum Hall Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edge states, which have counter-propagating modes, are known to flow under relevant neutral disorders into a stable Kane-Fisher-Polchinski (KFP) renormalization group (RG) fixed point, which yields a quantized two-terminal conductance $\frac{2}{3}\frac{e^2}{h}$ consistent with the experiments. Motivated by growing interests in superconducting (SC) quantum Hall systems, we study the $\nu=2/3$ FQH edge states with disordered SC proximity by generalizing the KFP analysis, which may also apply to the recently realized $\nu=2/3$ fractional Chern insulator. We show that the $\nu=2/3$ FQH edge theory has an infinite number of stable RG fixed points SC$_N$ labeled by an integer $N\in\mathbb{Z}$, each of which is driven by a relevant disordered charge-$2q_N$ SC tunneling with $q_N\in\mathbb{Z}$ depending on $N$. The $N&lt;0$ ($N\ge0$) phases are favored by an attractive (repulsive) inter-mode interaction on the edge. We further predict that the edge states in a SC$_N$ phase with $q_N\neq0$ yields a quantized downstream resistance $R_d=\frac{h}{2q_N^2e^2}$ measurable in a FQH-SC junction. For edge states staying in the KFP phase ($N=0$ and $q_N=0$) under SC proximity, we arrive at a nonlinear $R_d\propto V^{-\alpha}$ or $T^{-\alpha}$ with voltage bias $V$ or temperature $T$, where $\alpha=4$ ($\alpha=1$) if pairing (vortex tunneling) dominates.</description>

      <title>From Chern to Winding: Topological Invariant Correspondence in the Reduced Haldane Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical investigation of the topological properties and edge states of the Haldane model defined on a honeycomb lattice with zigzag edges. By exploiting translational symmetry along the ribbon direction, we perform a dimensional reduction that maps the two-dimensional model into a family of effective one-dimensional systems parametrized by the crystal momentum $k_x$. Each resulting one-dimensional Hamiltonian corresponds to an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with momentum-dependent hoppings and onsite potentials. We introduce a natural rotated basis in which the Hamiltonian becomes planar and the winding number ($\nu$) is directly computable, providing a clear topological characterization of the reduced model. This framework enables us to derive closed-form expressions for the edge-state wavefunctions and their dispersion relations across the full Brillouin zone. We show that the $\nu$ exactly reproduces the Chern number of the parent model in the topologically nontrivial phase and allows for an exact characterization of the edge modes. Analytical expressions for the edge-state wavefunctions and their dispersion relations are derived without requiring perturbative methods. Our analysis further reveals the critical momentum $ k_c $ where edge states traverse the bulk energy gap, and establishes precise conditions for the topological phase transition. In contrast to earlier models, such as plaquette-based tight-binding reductions, our method reveals hidden geometric symmetries in the extended SSH structure that are essential for understanding the topological behavior of systems with long-range hopping. Our findings offer new insight into the topological features of zigzag nanoribbons and establish a robust framework for analyzing analogous systems.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale ultrafast dynamics of local charge order in a THz-induced metastable state of 1T-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-induced control of quantum materials enables manipulation of electronic and structural phases on ultrafast timescales. Probing their atomic-scale dynamics is essential to understand the role of defects and domain boundaries, but conventional time-resolved techniques lack the required spatial resolution. Here, we use terahertz (THz) scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate a THz-light-induced metastable state near a defect in 1T-TaS2, and follow its photoinduced dynamics in real space and time. THz excitation induces quasi-stationary changes in the insulating gap on angstrom scales, which we associate with interlayer stacking changes. Simultaneously, THz-lightwave-driven tunneling provides access to ultrafast dynamics of the metastable state, revealing 2.5 THz oscillations of the charge density wave amplitude mode and a 1.3 THz mode attributed to an interlayer shear vibration emerging near the defect. Our results demonstrate the dual role of tip-enhanced THz fields in driving metastability and ultrafast tunneling, opening new avenues for ultrafast atomic-scale control of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Static and Dynamics of Twisted Skyrmion Tubes in Frustrated Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable three-dimensional topological skyrmion structures in frustrated magnets are investigated. The texture exhibits a helicoid pattern along the vertical direction, described by a position-dependent helicity, which interpolates between Neel- and hedgehog-like two-dimensional skyrmions, characterized by the Hopf index, and is referred to as "twisted skyrmion tubes" (TSkTs). The stability and topology of TSkTs are achieved by competing next-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, the thickness of the magnet, and the applied magnetic field. The dynamical behavior of a twisted structure in frustrated magnets is determined. Specifically, we derive that the helicity dynamics of the TSkT can be driven by an electric current resulting from spin-orbit torque interaction. Furthermore, we address the study of the electronic scattering problem using a spin-orbit-torque-driven TSKT, which offers promising applications for low-power storage nanodevices and nanobatteries with enhanced control.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Defect States in Non-Hermitian Topolectrical Chains with Gain and Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), parity-time (PT) symmetry, and topological defect states in a finite non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain. In the conventional NHSE regime, non-reciprocal hopping leads to an asymmetric localization of all eigenstates at one edge of the system, including the bulk and topological edge states. However, the introduction of staggered gain and loss restores the symmetric localization of topological edge states while preserving the bulk NHSE. We further examine the response of defect states in this system, demonstrating that their spatial localization is dynamically controlled by the combined effects of NHSE and PT symmetry. Specifically, we identify three distinct regimes in which the defect states localize at the defect site, shift to the system's edges, or become completely delocalized. These findings extend beyond previous works that primarily explored the activation and suppression of defect states through gain-loss engineering. To validate our theoretical predictions, we propose an experimental realization using a topolectrical circuit, where non-Hermitian parameters are implemented via impedance converter-based non-reciprocal elements. Circuit simulations confirm the emergence and tunability of defect states through voltage and admittance measurements, providing a feasible platform for experimental studies of non-Hermitian defect engineering. Our results establish a route for designing reconfigurable non-Hermitian systems with controllable topological defect states, with potential applications in robust signal processing and sensing.</description>

      <title>Effect of magnetic field and light on energy levels of (1+3+1) chirally twisted multilayer graphene system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hofstadter butterfly spectrum in (1+3+1) chirally twisted multilayer graphene (CTMLG) subject to perpendicular magnetic field and light with different polarizations. We focus on the interplay between twist angles and light-induced effects. In equilibrium, we examine symmetric ($\theta_1 = \theta_2$) and asymmetric ($\theta_1 \neq \theta_2$) configurations. Our results show that asymmetric configurations cause distinct effects in the electronic energy spectrum. However, the unique symmetry of the system ensures that the spectra remain identical when the twist angles are interchanged. This highlights the role of interlayer coupling in shaping the electronic structure of CTMLG. We then explored the effects of external periodic perturbations, such as circularly polarized light (CPL) and waveguide-generated linearly polarized light (WGL). CPL breaks chiral symmetry, creating a gap that distorts the Hofstadter spectrum. These distortions are more pronounced for asymmetric twist configurations. In contrast, WGL preserves chiral symmetry and has a tunable, non-monotonic effect on the bandwidth. This makes WGL a reliable tool for engineering electronic properties. These results demonstrate how (1+3+1)-CTMLG combines the effects of light-matter interactions with moir\'e physics. This allows accurate control of the electronic properties and fractal spectra by adjusting external fields and twist angles.</description>

      <title>Pseudomagnetotransport in Strained Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In graphene, long-wavelength deformations that result in elastic shear strain couple to the low-energy Dirac electrons as pseudogauge fields. Using a scalable tight-binding model, we consider analogs to magnetotransport in mesoscopic strained graphene devices with nearly uniform pseudomagnetic fields. In particular, we consider transverse pseudomagnetic focusing in a bent graphene ribbon and show that a focused valley-polarized current can be generated with characteristic conductance oscillations. Importantly, our scaling method allows for quantum transport calculations with realistic device geometries, and leaves the Dirac physics and pseudogauge fields invariant as long as the atomic displacements vary slowly with respect to the scaled lattice. Our results show that pseudomagnetotransport is a promising new route for graphene straintronics, and our scaling method provides a new framework for the modeling, design, and interpretation of straintronics experiments and applications.</description>

      <title>In-situ nanoscale transport measurements on monoatomic metal films by low-temperature scanning tunneling potentiometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigation of transport properties is fundamental for characterizing electronic properties and phase transitions. However, most of the transport measurements on conductive layers have been performed at macroscopic scales, and thus the development of microscopic methods to measure transport is important. Scanning tunneling potentiometry (STP) is a powerful tool for investigating surface conductivity at nano-scale spatial resolutions. However, it is still challenging to conduct STP studies at low temperatures and most of the low-temperature studies were performed on samples that were prepared ex-situ. In this study, we developed a low-temperature STP and demonstrated its performance on monoatomic metal films formed on Si(111) substrates that were prepared in-situ. Stable operation at low temperatures enables us to extract the electrochemical potential originating from the surface transport by canceling out the potential due to thermal differences and artifacts arising from the nonlinearity of the density of states (DOS). We also formulated the nonlinear-DOS artifact and confirmed it by comparing with the nonlinearity obtained by scanning tunneling spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Graphene/hBN heterostructure based Valley transistor: Dynamic Control of valley current in synchronized nonzero voltages, within the time-dependent regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructures represent a promising class of metal-insulator-semiconductor systems widely explored for multifunctional digital device applications. In this work, we demonstrate that graphene, when influenced by carrier-dependent trapping in the hBN spacer triggered by a localized potential from Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), can exhibit valley transistor behavior under specific conditions. We employ a tight-binding model that self-consistently incorporates a Gaussian-shaped potential to represent the effect of the tip gate. Crucially, we show that the heterostructure functions as a field-effect transistor (FET), with its operation governed by the bias gate (shifting the Fermi level) and the tip-induced potential (breaking electron-hole symmetry via selective trapping of electron or hole quasiparticles). Our results reveal that, under specific lattice geometry, pulse frequency, and gate voltage conditions, the device exhibits valley transistor functionality. The valley current (e.g., I_K1=-K or I_K2=+K) can be selectively controlled by synchronizing the frequencies and polarities of the tip and bias gate voltages. Notably, when both gates are driven with the same polarity, the graphene channel outputs a periodically modulated, pure valley-polarized current. This enables switching between distinct ON/OFF valley current states even at finite bias. Remarkably, when the I_K1=-K current is ON (forward current), the I_K2=+K current is OFF. Reversing the gate polarity inverts this behavior: I_K1=-K turns OFF, while I_K2=+K turns ON (reverse current). These findings pave the way toward low-voltage valley transistors in metal-insulator-semiconductor architectures, offering new avenues for valleytronics and advanced gating technologies.</description>

      <title>Low-energy, ultrafast spin reorientation at competing hybrid interfaces with tunable operating temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information can be stored in magnetic materials by encoding with the direction of the magnetic moment of elements. A figure of merit for these systems is the energy needed to change the information rewrite the storage by changing the magnetic moment. Organic molecules offer a playground to manipulate spin order, with metallo molecular interfaces being a promising direction for sustainable devices. Here, we demonstrate a spin reorientation transition in molecular interfaces of high magnetisation 3d ferromagnetic films due to a competition between a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) induced by a heavy metal that dominates at high temperatures, and an in-plane anisotropy generated by molecular coupling at low temperatures. The transition can be tuned around room temperature by varying the ferromagnet thickness (1.4 to 1.9 nm) or the choice of molecular overlayer, with the organic molecules being C60, hydrogen and metal (Cu, Co) phthalocyanines. Near the transition temperature, the magnetisation easy axis can be switched with a small energy input, either electrically with a current density of 10^5 A per cm2, or optically by a fs laser pulse of fluence as low as 0.12 mJ per cm2, suggesting heat assisted technology applications. Magnetic dichroism measurements point toward a phase transition at the organic interface being responsible for the spin reorientation transition.</description>

      <title>Current-induced spin and orbital polarization in the ferroelectric Rashba semiconductor GeTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Edelstein effect is a promising mechanism for generating spin and orbital polarization from charge currents in systems without inversion symmetry. In ferroelectric materials, such as Germanium Telluride (GeTe), the combination of bulk Rashba splitting and voltage-controlled ferroelectric polarization provides a pathway for electrical control of the sign of the charge-spin conversion. In this work, we investigate current-induced spin and orbital magnetization in bulk GeTe using Wannier-based tight-binding models derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann theory. Employing the modern theory of orbital magnetization, we demonstrate that the orbital Edelstein effect entirely dominates its spin counterpart. This difference is visualized through the spin and orbital textures at the Fermi surfaces, where the orbital moment surpasses the spin moment by one order of magnitude. Moreover, the orbital Edelstein effect remains largely unaffected in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, highlighting its distinct physical origin compared to the spin Edelstein effect.</description>

      <title>Chiral Anomaly Induced Transverse Planar Transport Phenomena in Three Dimensional Spin-Orbit Coupled Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate linear and nonlinear transverse planar transport phenomena (viz. linear and nonlinear Hall and Nernst coefficients) induced by chiral anomaly in three-dimensional spin-orbit coupled metallic systems. Unlike Weyl semimetals, these systems do not possess multiple Weyl nodes located at isolated points in the momentum space but instead host a pair of Fermi surfaces characterized by opposite Berry curvature fluxes enclosing the same band-degeneracy point. Using semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism within the relaxation time approximation, we derive first- and second-order transverse planar transport coefficients induced by electrical and thermal gradients in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Our analysis reveals distinctive angular dependencies of the transport coefficients, along with characteristic scaling behavior with the magnetic field strength. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anomaly-induced transport coefficients exhibit an exponential temperature dependence. This unconventional behavior leads to the violations of the Mott relation at comparatively low temperatures, highlighting unique thermoelectric signatures that can be probed experimentally in 3D spin-orbit coupled metallic systems.</description>

      <title>All fractional Shapiro steps in the RSJ model with two Josephson harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization between the internal dynamics of the superconducting phase in a Josephson junction (JJ) and an external ac signal is a fundamental physical phenomenon, manifesting as constant-voltage Shapiro steps in the current-voltage characteristic. Mathematically, this phase-locking effect is captured by the Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) model, an important example of a nonlinear dynamical system. The standard RSJ model considers an overdamped JJ with a sinusoidal (single-harmonic) current-phase relation (CPR) in the current-driven regime with a monochromatic ac component. While this model predicts only integer Shapiro steps, the inclusion of higher Josephson harmonics is known to generate fractional Shapiro steps. In this paper, we show that only two Josephson harmonics in the CPR are sufficient to produce all possible fractional Shapiro steps within the RSJ framework. Using perturbative methods, we analyze amplitudes of these fractional steps. Furthermore, by introducing a phase shift between the two Josephson harmonics, we reveal an asymmetry between positive and negative fractional steps - a signature of the Josephson diode effect.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Transport Signatures of Hidden Symmetry Breaking in a Weyl Altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions in solids are often accompanied by structural changes, but subtle lattice distortions can remain hidden from conventional crystallographic probes, hindering the identification of the correct order parameters. A case in point is Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$, a correlated polar ruthenate with well-characterized phase transitions, whose ground state structure has recently become a subject of debate. This uncertainty stems from extremely small atomic displacements ($\sim$0.001 \AA) between competing phases, beyond the resolution of X-ray diffraction, neutron scattering, or optical second-harmonic generation. In this work, we propose a method to detect hidden symmetry breaking by leveraging nonlinear transport induced by quantum geometry. We show that Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ is a Weyl chain semimetal in both phases. The low-symmetry phase, classified as an altermagnet by symmetry, features distorted topological surface states that are asymmetric along the polar ($b$) axis. However, the nonrelativistic spin splitting is too weak ($\sim$0.1 meV) to be resolved directly, regarding the altermagnetism. In contrast, Weyl chains generate a large quantum metric at the Fermi surface, leading to nonlinear conductivities that are orders of magnitude stronger in the low-symmetry phase. A longitudinal nonlinear conductivity along the polar axis emerges exclusively in this phase, providing a sensitive probe to qualitatively distinguish it from the high-symmetry structure and demonstrate the emergence of altermangetism, which is confirmed by a recent experiment. Our work establishes a route for identifying hidden symmetry breaking in complex quantum materials through the interplay of crystal symmetry, topology and nonlinear quantum transport.</description>

      <title>Majorana Zero Mode Induced by a Screw Dislocation on the Surface of an Iron-based Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple scenario to describe a dislocation-induced Majorana zero mode on the surface of an iron-based superconductor, using an illustrative model with a cylindrical hole of radius $R$ perpendicular to its top surface. Topological surface states on the inner surface of the hole form an effective chiral $p$-wave superconductor. When the top surface has a perpendicular magnetization, chiral Majorana modes appear near the circular edge of the hole. Since the corresponding wavefunctions obey an antiperiodic boundary condition in the circumferential direction, a Majorana zero mode at zero energy does not appear. However, if a screw dislocation is inserted through the hole, the antiperiodic boundary condition is transformed into a periodic one, resulting in the appearance of a Majorana zero mode. This Majorana zero mode remains in the no-hole limit of $R \to 0$. We confirm this scenario by numerical simulation and effective theory. A method of creating a Majorana zero mode in the absence of the surface magnetization is briefly described.</description>

      <title>Observation of charge density wave excitonic order parameter in topological insulator monolayer WTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong electron-hole interactions in a semimetal or narrow-gap semiconductor may drive a ground state of condensed excitons. Monolayer WTe2 has been proposed as a host material for such an exciton condensate, but the order parameter - the key signature of a macroscopic quantum-coherent condensate - has not been observed. Here we use Fourier-transform scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (FT-STS) to study quasi-particle interference (QPI) and periodic modulations of the local density of states (LDOS) in monolayer WTe2. In WTe2 on graphene, in which the carrier density can be varied via back-gating, FT-STS shows QPI features in the 2D bulk bands, confirming the interacting nature of the bandgap in neutral WTe2 and the semi-metallic nature of highly n- and p-doped WTe2. We observe additional non-dispersive spatial modulations in the LDOS imprinted on the topological edge mode of neutral WTe2 on metallic substrates (graphene and graphite), which we interpret as the interaction of the topological edge mode with the expected charge density wave order parameter of the excitonic condensate in WTe2 at low interaction strength due to screening by the metallic substrates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synergizing altermagnetism and other ferroic orders, such as ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 106801 (2025) and ibid. 106802 (2025)], offers an effective route to achieve nonvolatile switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. In this work, by synergizing altermagnetism and ferroelasticity, we propose the concept of ferroelastic altermagnets in which the ferroelastic crystal reorientation can drive multistate nonvolatile switching of the altermagnetic spin splitting via altermagnetoelastic effect. Using monolayers RuF4 and CuF2 as material candidates, we demonstrate 2-state and 3-state altermagnetic spin splitting switching as driven by ferroelastic strain states. Transport calculation shows that multistate spin conductivities can be ferroelastically encoded in an ferroelastic altermagnet, thus suggesting the potential of ferroelastic altermagnetic as nonvolatile nanomechanical spin switches. The proposed concept of ferroelastic altermagnetism enriches the emerging landscape of multiferroic altermagnetism, paving a way towards altermagnetic-based straintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Anomalous supercurrents in the presence of particle losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that supercurrent properties in a superfluid or superconducting junction are significantly modified due to single-particle losses present in a conduction channel. In the presence of a spin-independent particle loss, we find regimes where the Josephson current $I_N(\phi)$ takes zero at a position in between $\phi= 0$ and $\phi=\pi$, and the direction of the supercurrent is reversed. Although the region is narrow, we also find a regime in which the critical current is enhanced by dissipation. Such anomalous behaviors in the Josephson current are attributed to a subtle interplay between the contribution that is present regardless of dissipation and the unconventional one that is absent without dissipation. In the presence of a spin-selective particle loss, it is shown that a dissipation-induced spin supercurrent and its reversal occur. The proposed system is analyzed by means of the Keldysh field theory approach based on the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudershan-Lindblad master equation and may be realized in ultracold atomic gases and solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Optically detected magnetic resonance of wafer-scale hexagonal boron nitride thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently been shown to host native defects exhibiting optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) with applications in nanoscale magnetic sensing and imaging. To advance these applications, deposition methods to create wafer-scale hBN films with controlled thicknesses are desirable, but a systematic study of the ODMR properties of the resultant films is lacking. Here we perform ODMR measurements of thin films (3-2000nm thick) grown via three different methods: metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We find that they all exhibit an ODMR response, including the thinnest 3nm film, albeit with different characteristics. The best volume-normalised magnetic sensitivity obtained is 30uT/sqrt(Hz um^3). We study the effect of growth temperature on a series of MOCVD samples grown under otherwise fixed conditions and find 800-900C to be an optimum range for magnetic sensitivity, with a significant improvement (up to two orders of magnitude) from post-growth annealing. This work provides a useful baseline for the magnetic sensitivity of hBN thin films deposited via standard methods and informs the feasibility of future sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Magnon blockade in spin-magnon systems with frequency detuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnon blockade is a physical mechanism for the preparation of a single-magnon source, which has important applications in quantum information processing. Here we propose a scheme for generating an optimal magnon blockade in the spin-magnon quantum system. By introducing frequency detuning between the magnon and the spin qubit of the NV center, the conventional magnon blockade and the unconventional magnon blockade can be obtained under both strong and weak coupling, relaxing the requirements for coupling strength. Moreover, the conventional and unconventional magnon blockade can occur simultaneously when both the magnon and the spin qubit are driven. This allows the equal-time second-order correlation function to reach $10^{-8}$, about five orders of magnitude lower than that in previous works. Additionally, the time-delayed second-order correlation function avoids oscillation. Our study demonstrates the impact of frequency detuning on the magnon blockade and proposes methods to enhance the magnon blockade and relax the requirements for coupling strength through frequency detuning.</description>

      <title>A Thermally Modulated SINIS Trasconductance Amplifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a superconducting transconductance amplifier based on the thermal modulation of a SINIS (Superconductor-Insulator-Normal metal-Insulator-Superconductor) configuration. The device is composed of a normal metal island interfaced with two superconducting leads through tunnel barriers, establishing a voltage-biased symmetric SINIS setup. An additional NIS junction connects the island to a third superconducting lead, which serves as input. When the input voltage surpasses the superconducting gap, the resultant injection of quasiparticles increases the electronic temperature of the island, thereby modulating the SINIS current. We perform numerical analyzes of the device performance, influenced by input voltage, frequency, and bath temperature. At bath temperatures below 250 mK, the device shows a transconductance exceeding 4 mS and a current gain exceeding 45 dB. Both gain and transconductance maintain their levels up to 1 MHz, but decrease at higher frequencies, with a -3 dB cutoff around 10 MHz, and an average power dissipation of approximately 5 nW. Our simulations reveal a fully voltage-controlled, three-terminal superconducting amplifier characterized by high transconductance and gain, achieved through thermally mediated signal transduction. This architectural design presents a promising avenue for cryogenic amplification with reduced power dissipation and compatibility with current superconducting electronic systems.</description>

Abstract: Long-lived mechanical resonators like drums oscillating at MHz frequencies and operating in the quantum regime offer a powerful platform for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Yet, quantum control of such systems remains challenging, particularly owing to their low energy scale and the difficulty of achieving efficient coupling to other well-controlled quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate repeated, and high-fidelity interactions between a 4 MHz suspended silicon nitride membrane and a resonant superconducting heavy-fluxonium qubit. The qubit is initialized at an effective temperature of 27~$\mathrm{\mu}$K and read out in a single-shot with 77% fidelity. During the membrane's 6~ms lifetime, the two systems swap excitations more than 300 times. After each interaction, a state-selective detection is performed, implementing a stroboscopic series of weak measurements that provide information about the mechanical state. The accumulated records reconstruct the membrane's position noise-spectrum, revealing both its thermal occupation $n_\mathrm{th}\approx47$ at 10~mK and the qubit-induced back-action. By preparing the qubit either in its ground or excited state before each interaction, we observe an imbalance between the emission and absorption spectra, proportional to $n_\mathrm{th}$ and $n_\mathrm{th}+1$, respectively-a hallmark of the non-commutation of phonon creation and annihilation operators. Since the predicted Di\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse time is comparable to the measured mechanical decoherence time, our architecture enters a regime where gravity-induced decoherence could be tested directly.</description>

Abstract: The computational power and fault-tolerance of future large-scale quantum processors derive in large part from the connectivity between the qubits. One approach to increase connectivity is to engineer qubit-qubit interactions at a distance. Alternatively, the connectivity can be increased by physically displacing the qubits. This has been explored in trapped-ion experiments and using neutral atoms trapped with optical tweezers. For semiconductor spin qubits, several studies have investigated spin coherent shuttling of individual electrons, but high-fidelity transport over extended distances remains to be demonstrated. Here we report shuttling of an electron inside an isotopically purified Si/SiGe heterostructure using electric gate potentials. First, we form static quantum dots, and study how spin coherence decays as we repeatedly move a single electron between up to five dots. Next, we create a traveling wave potential to transport an electron in a moving quantum dot. This second method shows substantially better spin coherence than the first. It allows us to displace an electron over an effective distance of 10 $\mu$m in under 200 ns with an average fidelity of 99.5%. These results will guide future efforts to realize large-scale semiconductor quantum processors, making use of electron shuttling both within and between qubit arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the recent interest in van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectrics, topologically nontrivial polar structures have been predicted to form in twisted bilayers. However, these structures have proven difficult to observe experimentally. We propose that these textures may be probed optically by showing that topological polarization textures result in exotic nonlinear optical responses. We derive this relationship analytically using non-Abelian Berry connections and a quantum-geometric framework, supported by tight-binding and first-principles calculations. For the case of moir\'e materials without centrosymmetry, which form networks of polar merons and antimerons, the shift photoconductivity forms a vortex-like structure in real space. For a range of frequencies where transitions between topologically trivial bands occur at the Brillouin zone edge, the shift photocurrents are antiparallel to the in-plane electronic polarization field. Our findings highlight the interplay between complex polarization textures and nonlinear optical responses in vdW materials and provide a sought-after strategy for their experimental detection.</description>

Abstract: Quantum geometry is crucial for understanding intricate condensed matter systems, governing transport phenomena and optical responses. However, traditional studies predominantly consider a static crystal lattice, focusing exclusively on the pure-electronic quantum geometry of the Hilbert space parameterized by electronic wave vectors, thereby overlooking the dynamic effects arising from phonons and their coupling with electrons. In this work, we reveal the intrinsic quantum geometry of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC), which resides in the hybrid Hilbert space parameterized by both the electronic wave vectors and phonon displacements. The EPC quantum metric, EPC Berry curvature and EPC shift vector, as central elements, quantify the EPC-induced velocity, polarization, and anomalous charge-center shift, respectively. We further connect this geometry to phonon-mediated optical responses, particularly in-gap resonances, enabling experimental detection and characterization of EPC quantum geometry.</description>

Abstract: We show that the ground state of a weakly charged two-dimensional electron-hole fluid in a strong magnetic field is a broken translation symmetry state with interpenetrating lattices of localized vortices and antivortices in the electron-hole-pair field. The vortices and antivortices carry fractional charges of equal sign but unequal magnitude and have a honeycomb lattice structure that contrasts with the triangular lattices of superconducting electron-electron-pair vortex lattices. We predict that increasing charge density or weakening magnetic field drives a vortex delocalization transition that would be signaled experimentally by an abrupt increase in counterflow transport resistance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a small system is coupled to a bath, it is generally assumed that the state of the bath remains unaffected by the system due to the bath's large number of degrees of freedom. Here we show theoretically that this assumption can be easily violated for photonic baths typically used in experiments involving superconducting circuits. We analyze the dynamics of a voltage-biased Josephson junction coupled to a photonic bath, represented as a long Josephson junction chain. Our findings show that the system can reach a non-equilibrium steady state where the photonic degrees of freedom become significantly overheated, leading to a qualitative change in the current-voltage $I-V$ curve. This phenomenon is analogous to the Joule effect observed in electrical conductors, where flowing current can substantially heat up electrons. Recognizing this effect is crucial for the many applications of high-impedance environments in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Topological nature of edge states for one-dimensional systems without symmetry protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically verify and analytically prove a winding number invariant that correctly predicts the number of edge states in one-dimensional, nearest-neighbor (between unit cells), two-band models with any complex couplings and open boundaries. Our winding number uses analytical continuation of the wave-vector into the complex plane and involves two special points on the full Riemann surface band structure that correspond to bulk eigenvector degeneracies. Our winding number is invariant under unitary or similarity transforms. We emphasize that the topological criteria we propose here differ from what is traditionally defined as a topological or trivial phase in symmetry-protected classification studies. It is a broader invariant for our model that supports nonzero energy edge states and its transition does not coincide with the gap closing condition. When the relevant symmetries are applied, our invariant reduces to well-known Hermitian and non-Hermitian symmetry-protected topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Quantum shockwave at the quasi-relativistic resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shockwaves are violent nonlinear distortions of wave motion which have been reported in fluid waves and electromagnetic waves, while here we reveal that a shockwave can occur even in the quantum wave function of a single particle. Specifically, we analyze the electromagnetic field travelling on resonance with the limiting velocity of the quasi-relativistic particle, and reveal that a strong longitudinal field can rip up a quantum shockwave singularity in the particle wave function, leading to energy dissipation. Moreover, we show that this effect is particularly strong for quasi-relativistic (Dirac) electrons in graphene for two reasons. On one hand, we obtain the single-particle shockwave at very small fields due to the small effective electron mass, and on the other hand we can obtain large dissipation in the many-particle shockwave by using the large electron density in graphene. While the single-particle shockwave can be most easily observed by locating the shockwave singularity with a high-resolution microscopy, the many-particle dissipation would be simply observed as a rapid decay of our resonant electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Spin-Polarized Unconventional Skin Effect in Hatano-Nelson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), a hallmark of non-Hermitian systems, stems from the topological nature of complex energy spectra, typically characterized by a nonzero spectral winding number. By investigating a one-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model with spin-dependent Abelian gauge fields, we uncover a tunable, spin-polarized, unconventional NHSE with zero spectral winding, coexisting with a conventional one. These unconventional skin modes, emerging in the absence of pseudo time-reversal symmetry, display scale-restricted localization and non-Bloch spectral stability, distinguishing them from the Z2 and critical NHSEs. By introducing an external magnetic field that couples the spin degrees of freedom, these unconventional skin modes evolve into critical skin states. Meanwhile, conventional ones persist, but undergo a transition from bidirectional to unidirectional accumulation with increasing field strength. While distinct, remarkably, this unconventional NHSE manifests a more general behavior, with the Z2 and critical NHSEs emerging as specific limiting cases. Our results provide experimentally accessible predictions relevant to photonic lattices and ultracold atomic systems with synthetic gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Noisy Qudit vs Multiple Qubits : Conditions on Gate Efficiency for Enhancing Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04543v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today, multiple new platforms are implementing qudits, $d$-level quantum bases of information, for Quantum Information Processing (QIP). It is therefore crucial to study their efficiencies for QIP compared to more traditional qubit platforms. We present a comparative study of the infidelity scalings of a qudit and $n$-qubit systems, both with identical Hilbert space dimensions and noisy environments. The first-order response of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) to the noise in the Lindblad formalism, which was found to be gate-independent, was calculated analytically in the two systems being compared. This yielded a critical curve $O(d^2/\log_2(d))$ of the ratio of their respective gate times in units of decoherence time. This quantity indicates how time-efficient operations on these systems are. The curve delineates regions where each system has a higher rate of increase of the AGI than the other. This condition on gate efficiency was applied to different existing platforms. It was found that specific qudit platforms possess gate efficiencies competitive with state-of-the-art qubit platforms. Numerical simulations complemented this work and allowed for discussion of the applicability and limits of the linear response formalism.</description>

      <title>Drastic modification in thermal conductivity of TiCoSb Half-Heusler alloy: Phonon engineering by lattice softening and ionic polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A drastic variation (~47%) in thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) for synthesized samples (TiCoSb1+x, x=0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.06) is observed. The lowest \k{appa} is reported for the TiCoSb1.02 sample. Thermal variation of \k{appa} is estimated from the temperature and power-dependent Raman spectroscopy data. Embedded phases and Co vacancy are analysed, employing scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy data. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy reveals the Co vacancy in synthesized samples, and the most ordered phase is TiCoSb1.02 amid the synthesized samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement of the synthesized samples provides direct evidence of Co vacancies and their increase with Sb concentration (x). Lattice dynamics are revealed using Raman Spectroscopy (RS) measurements. RS data accomplishes that variation in \k{appa} as a function of Sb concentration is observed owing to an alteration in phonon group velocity, related to lattice softening. The polar nature of the TiCoSb half-Heusler (HH) sample is revealed. Longitudinal Optical and Transvers Optical phonon (LO-TO) splitting in RS is observed due to the polar nature of TiCoSb1+x synthesized samples. Tailoring in LO-TO splitting due to the screening effect, correlated with Co vacancies, is reported for TiCoSb1+x synthesized samples. Lattice softening and LO-TO splitting lead to a minimum \k{appa} for the TiCoSb1.02 synthesized sample.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of edge modes in monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05671v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dissipation on the dynamics of edge modes in the monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Our study considers both a linear observable and a nonlinear entanglement measure, namely the two-point correlation function and the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE), as diagnostic tools. While dissipation inevitably alters the entanglement properties observed in the closed system, statistical analysis of quantum trajectories reveals that by protecting the chain's edges from dissipation, it is possible to recover characteristic features analogous to those found in the unitary limit. This highlights the fundamental role of spatial dissipation patterns in shaping the dynamics of edge modes in monitored systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-forbidden intraband transitions leading to ultralow Gilbert damping in van der Waals ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based upon first-principles calculations, we report ultralow Gilbert damping in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets. The low damping occurs at low temperature because mirror symmetry prohibits intraband transitions. The monotonic dependence on the electronic scattering rate suggests the absent lower limit, in contrast to conventional ferromagnetic materials. Breaking mirror symmetry through magnetization rotation, layer stacking, or structural phase transition significantly increases damping by enabling intraband transitions. Topological nodal lines, also protected by mirror symmetry, contribute substantially to interband-transition-mediated damping, which can be tuned by adjusting the Fermi level. Our findings elucidate the unique characteristics of Gilbert damping in 2D vdW ferromagnets, providing valuable insights for designing low-dimensional spintronic devices with high energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Mixed-state geometric phases of coherent and squeezed spin states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two mixed-state geometric phases, known as the Uhlmann phase and interferometric geometric phase (IGP), of spin coherent states (CSSs) and spin squeezed states (SSSs) are analyzed. Exact solutions and numerical results of selected examples are presented. For the $j = 3/2$ CSS, the Uhlmann phase exhibits finite-temperature topological phase transitions characterized by abrupt jumps. The IGP for the same state similarly shows discontinuous jumps as the temperature varies. In the case of the $j = 1$ one-axis SSS, both Uhlmann phase and IGP display discrete finite-temperature jumps. By contrast, the $j = 1$ two-axis SSS shows no such transitions because the Uhlmann phase and IGP both vary smoothly with temperature. We also briefly discuss potential realizations and simulations related to these phenomena in spin systems.</description>

      <title>Observing structural disorder induced interacting topological phase in an atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phases of matter can appear in noninteracting systems, as in band topology, or interacting systems, such as in spin models, with their defining features typically robust against weak disorder. Intriguingly, disorder itself can also induce topological phases--exemplified by the Anderson topological insulator in noninteracting systems. Experimental studies on disorder induced topology have so far been limited to band topology. Here we report direct observations of structural disorder induced many-body interacting topological phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, causing fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to a regular lattice. The induced topological phase is also vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin one, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices. Our experiments open a new direction for studying the interplay between structural disorder and strongly interacting topological matter in Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Full, three-quarter, half and quarter Wigner crystals in Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Application of a displacement field opens a gap and enhances the Van-Hove singularities in the band structure of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. By adjusting the carrier density so that the Fermi energy lies in the vicinity of these singularities, recent experiments observe a plethora of highly correlated electronic phases including isospin polarized phases and high-resistance states with non-linear electric transport indicative of a possible Wigner crystal. We perform Hartree-Fock calculations incorporating long-range Coulomb interactions and allowing for translational and rotational symmetry breaking. We obtain the displacement field vs. carrier density phase diagram which shows isospin polarized metallic phases tracking the Van-Hove singularity in the valence band. Between these metallic phases we observe regions where the ground state is a Wigner crystal. The isospin polarization of the Wigner crystals tracks the isospin polarization of the nearby metallic phases. Depending on whether we have four, three, two or one isospin flavours, we obtain a full, three-quarter, half or quarter Wigner crystal.</description>
